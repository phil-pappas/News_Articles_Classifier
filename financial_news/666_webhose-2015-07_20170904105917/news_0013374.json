Meanwhile stocks also edged higher and the dollar traded lower against its main rivals.\n“The number keeps rate-hike expectations roughly balanced between September and December,” predicts James Ong, a portfolio manager at Invesco.\n“The headline jobs number is good, but the flat wage growth indicates that the Fed’s 2% inflation target is not likely to materialize anytime soon,” Ong added.\n“It’s not a horror show, but is on the soft side, all things considered,” David Ader, head of government bond strategy at CRT Capital Group, said in a note.\nThursday’s price action wraps up the holiday-shortened week, as U.S. markets will be closed on Friday in observance of the July Fourth holiday.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.05% fell 4.1 basis point to 2.377%, according to Tradeweb.\nThe two-year yield TMUBMUSD02Y, -7.99% declined 4.7 basis points to 0.641% and the yield on the 30-year TMUBMUSD30Y, -1.09% Treasury fell two basis points to 3.173%.\nMeanwhile, investors all over the world continued to nervously watch Greece’s negotiations with its creditors, as the country prepares for a July 5 referendum on its bailout, which is expected to be a close vote.\nRead: Greek debt crisis: Latest news.\nGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called on Greeks to vote “no,” saying that a negative vote does not mean an exit from the euro.\nEuropean stocks swung between small gains and losses , while yields in the eurozone yields rose, after rallying earlier this week. On Thursday, the yield on the German 10-year TMBMKDE-10Y, +4.82% known as the bund, rose 4.1 basis points to 0.815%.\nThe Greek 10-year yield fell 36.4 basis points to 14.840%, after rising a total of 440.1 basis points earlier this week.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB8QqQIwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketwatch.com%2Fstory%2Fdollar-trades-lower-after-june-jobs-report-2015-07-02&ei=PDeVVYK3N8jNsAWUirbQBQ&usg=AFQjCNGmC2cN8OCCZWKpdanELlztARczsg&sig2=J4K-aX0SFTJjRO5HYtxBYg&bvm=bv.96952980,d.b2w", "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCEQqQIwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketwatch.com%2Fstory%2Feuropean-stocks-edge-up-as-greece-keeps-investors-wary-2015-07-02&ei=fC2VVcHyFsWesAXykrqIBw&usg=AFQjCNHhDy8l74H6e0oP6_bdEFqahtqNJA&sig2=2WYucjsP3WNszHQXX1gv1A&bvm=bv.96952980,d.b2w"], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T17:41:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
