Melba Acosta, president of the Government Development Bank, has said it wouldn’t necessarily involve paying less than the full value of securities when they mature.\nMcCarthy said it may have no choice. Puerto Rico’s economy has contracted in every year but one since 2006 and is expected to shrink again by 1.2 percent in fiscal 2016. About 245,000 residents are projected to leave the island by 2025, continuing an exodus that’s already caused its population to decline by 7 percent in the past decade.\n“Puerto Rico’s debt is not sustainable without real economic growth and a consolidated surplus,” McCarthy wrote. “These will remain elusive over the next several years by any reasonable estimate.”\nCommonwealth securities have traded at distressed levels for two years on concern the island won’t repay all of its debt on time. General-obligation bonds maturing July 2035 and originally sold at 93 cents on the dollar traded Friday at an average price of 73 cents on the dollar, down from 87.1 cents in January, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
