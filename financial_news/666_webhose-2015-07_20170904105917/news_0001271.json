Wayne Drought by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Dick Smith's concession-style deal with David Jones in 2013 was a win-win for both retailers - providing a fillip for the consumer electronics retailer ahead of its 2014 float and stemming losses in electrical for the department store chain under previous management.\nHowever, Street Talk understands the relationship could come to an end well before the initial three year contract (which has three one-year options) is due to expire in October 2016.\nIn an interview this week, David Jones chairman and Woolworths Holdings chief executive Ian Moir declined to comment on rumours that both sides wanted out.\nWoolworths Holdings does not sell consumer electronics in South Africa and is believed to be keen to use the space currently occupied by Dick Smith in 29 of its 38 stores for other categories - wine bars perhaps?\nDick Smith was initially keen to tap into David Jones affluent A-B demographic and American Express customer, but is now generating stronger sales growth from its stand-alone and Move stores.\nUnder the deal, Dick Smith agreed to pay David Jones a fixed percentage of sales every month, and make a minimum payment each year regardless of sales volumes. The department store stood to make even more from the arrangement if Dick Smith's sales grew.\nPush could come to shove later this year, when David Jones sells its Market St store to developers. Market St houses the largest David Jones Powered by Dick Smith concession.\nElsewhere in consumer land, the perennial rumour of a merger or deal between Kirin's Lion Co and Coca-Cola Amatil has reared its head again.\n Six years after The Coca-Cola Co killed off Lion's $7.3 billion merger proposal for Coca-Cola Amatil, the brewer, its parent and the soft drink bottler are said to be talking again.\nWell-placed sources told Street Talk the talks are preliminary and are focused initially on how the companies can work together in international markets.\nBut a merger cannot be ruled out, given the level of synergies, which were estimated to be worth between $100 million and $150 million when Lion propositioned CCA in late 2008.\nThe bid collapsed in early 2009 when The Coca-Cola Co refused to sell Lion its 30 per cent stake in CCA and Kirin refused Coke's requests to buy key assets including the Indonesian bottling franchise.\nSources close to Lion and CCA suggested this week that a merger between CCA and SAB Miller made more sense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T01:09:23.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
