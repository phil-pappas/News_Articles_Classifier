Compliance with grant requirements actually requires a separate audit. \nBlann said, overall, it is “a very, very clean audit for an organization of this size.” It includes five recommendations but uncovered only two minor problem items, neither of which would be considered “material” in the accounting world, according to Blann. \nAll local governments in Michigan are required to undergo an annual independent auditor’s report, according to Kent County Administrator/Controller Daryl Delabbio. \nBlann said there is one new requirement of all government audits beginning this year: a change in the way a government pension plan is reported. \nAgain, Kent County has nothing to worry about in that regard because it does not have an unfunded pension plan liability. \nBlann said the county pension plan is “in a dramatically better position than 95 percent of the governments we work with throughout the state.” \nHe cautioned that can change, however, due to dramatic shifts in the stock market. \nDelabbio told the commission what is really noteworthy about the 2014 auditor’s report is “it was done so quickly. This was the earliest I’ve seen an audit report completed in my 20 years with Kent County, and I would even venture, my 38 years in local government.” \nThe report goes to the county board before it is forwarded to the state government, and this year it is ahead of schedule. \nHe said it was all due to the preparation work done by the county’s fiscal services staff, beginning with fiscal services Director Stephen Duarte. \nIn 19 of the last 20 years, the Kent County audit has received a Certificate of Achievement for Excellent Financial Reporting from the Government Finance Officers Association.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T00:04:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
