Pearson (Xetra: 858266 - news ) undertook a major reorganisation two years ago when John Fallon, the former head of the education division, replaced Dame Marjorie Scardino as chief executive. \nThe group has a dominant position in the US for devising and marking school tests. The North American market provided 61pc of the group’s revenue and 64pc of its profits last year. \n= Bad marks = \nThere are worrying signs that the US education market is slowing down. A rival US company, Apollo Education (NasdaqGS: APOL - news ) , cut its guidance for full-year revenues this week after fewer students enrolled on its courses. \nThis drop in people signing up might be an isolated problem, but it could also be a sign that youngsters in the US are questioning whether they want to take on large amounts of debt to gain a qualification that has no guarantee of employment at the end of it. \nMeanwhile, the increased testing of children is also coming under scrutiny in North America. The standard test for maths and English the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Career (PARCC) that Pearson administers across 11 states is also being looked at in more detail. \n= Booking profits = \nThe media giant is still a well-diversified group. It holds a 50pc stake in the Economist newspaper and 47pc of the world’s largest publishing company, Penguin Random House, with German partner Bertelsmann. \nThe book publishing unit is still enjoying success from Jamie Oliver’s cookery books, and has also made a successful push into e-books. \n= Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) fail the test = \nThe shares are now almost exactly where they were at the start of 2013, after they have steadily recovered from a shock profit warning at the start of last year. \nHowever, given the difficulties in their largest education market in the US, a rating of 17 times forecast earnings looks far too optimistic. \nThe shares may offer an attractive dividend yield of 4.3pc, but the dividend payments don’t look all that secure, as they are only covered 1.4 times by earnings. \nThe profit recovery that is expected this year could also falter in the second half. \nThe shares don’t pass our test.
