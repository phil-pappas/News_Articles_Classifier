We build our brand by focusing on the people, because it's all about great food and the happiness of our customers. There are always going to be bumpy rides. You cannot expect everything to be smooth all of the time, and we'll be there not just in the good times, but in the bad times too.\" \nWhen asked what the company plans to change during this crisis in Greece, Harding said that nothing will change at all. \n\"Before this crisis, we gave the people of Greece an abundance of outstanding and affordable seafood in a warm and happy environment. And that's exactly what we're going to keep on doing,\" Harding said. \nReferendum \nOn Thursday, the Greece prime minister defiantly urged Greeks to reject an international bailout deal. \nAccording to a Reuters report this move has wrecked any prospect of repairing broken relations with European Union partners before a referendum on Sunday that may decide Greece's future in Europe. \nGreece has shut its banks this week, imposing capital controls and limiting ATM withdrawals to prevent the public from emptying financial institutions. \nOn the third day of the closure, according to the report, long lines have formed at many ATMs and limited amounts of cash were doled out to pensioners. \nKiki Rizopoulou, a 79-year-old pensioner from Lamia in central Greece, had to travel to Athens to collect her pension, spending €20 of the €120 she was allowed to withdraw. \n\"I already have to pay back €50 that I owe. It's embarrassing,\" she told Reuters. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T10:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T12:51:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
