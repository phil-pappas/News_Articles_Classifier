When companies want more of your info than you’re willing to provide, instead of risking expensive and potentially ineffective marketing campaigns, they hire people who know more about you than you think is possible. Those so-called data brokers are in business to collect and sell your private and personal data — typically without your consent. Information collected in this fashion is used for various purposes, ranging from simple identity verification to fraud detection, detailed “people search“ and for “optimizing” different marketing campaigns. Here are a few facts about data brokers you might not know:\nData brokers collect and store billions of data elements covering nearly every U.S. consumer. To collect and consolidate their efforts, they work together, with multiple layers of data brokers providing data to one another. Data brokers then combine and analyze the data to make inferences about consumers, some of which could potentially be sensitive. (i.e. those that primarily focus on ethnicity and income levels, such as “urban scramble” and “mobile mixers,” both of which include a high concentration of Latinos and African-Americans with low incomes). What do data brokers do with all that data? Here’s the paragraph from the Federal Trade Commission’s report on the issue, explaining the process:\nData brokers rely on websites with registration features and cookies to find consumers online and target Internet advertisements to them based on their offline activities. Once a data broker locates a consumer online and places a cookie on the consumer’s browser, the data broker’s client can advertise to that consumer across the Internet for as long as the cookie stays on the consumer’s browser. Consumers may not be aware that data brokers are providing companies with products to allow them to advertise to consumers online based on their offline activities. Some data brokers are using similar technology to serve targeted advertisements to consumers on mobile devices.\nYou might be wondering who these companies are.
