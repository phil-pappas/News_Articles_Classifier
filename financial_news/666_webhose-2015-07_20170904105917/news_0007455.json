Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Slowing population growth has been highlighted by the Reserve Bank of Australia as a key to the puzzle of why the labour market has improved despite a weak economy.\nOfficials said an easing in population growth over the past 12 months \"helped to reconcile\" the conundrum between low economic activity and a relatively steady jobless rate.\nBoard members suggested the official cash rate would remain at a record-low 2 per cent, but again warned the Australian dollar needs to be lower given declining commodity prices.\nIn the minutes of this month's meeting, published on Tuesday, the Reserve Bank said the main drivers of the economy haven't changed in recent months, with stimulation from low interest rates helping offset a slide in mining investment and weak consumer spending.\nBoard members spent considerable time debating the impact of the Greece crisis and China's stock market turmoil, concluding that both require \"close monitoring.\"\nHowever, the Reserve Bank again downplayed the immediate threat to Australia's economy.\nThe most interesting element of this month's minutes involves an attempt to reconcile a puzzle that has bedevilled economic analysts for most of the past six months – the question of why the labour market hasn't worsened even though economic growth is below average.\n\"Recent data indicated that employment had grown more rapidly than the population and the unemployment rate had been relatively stable since the latter part of the previous year,\" the central bank said in the minutes.\nHowever, they added that there was still a shortage of available jobs, with the jobless rate at 6 per cent in June and historically low wages growth and stable unit labour costs.\n As a result, inflationary pressures are likely to remain \"well contained\" in coming months – giving the Reserve Bank scope to cut the cash rate if it feels the need.\nThe dollar traded little-changed after the minutes at around US73.63¢.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-07-21T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:10:07.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
