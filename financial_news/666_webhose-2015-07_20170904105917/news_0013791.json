For headwind, read lower profits. \nThe big surprise was not that Mr East was rebasing market expectations, but that this was not the widely expected kitchen sink announcement. It came too soon, and is the result of a deep dive into the numbers being generated in each division by the (relatively) new finance director David Smith. \nInvestors have been perturbed by the news that the long-expected reduction in production of the Trent 700 engine — one of its most profitable — has not been better managed. \nThe 700 engine is being replaced by a new, lower margin engine — the Trent 7000 — which is based on the remodelled A330 wide-body made by Airbus. The transition is costing Rolls-Royce dearly, as it now does not appear confident of winning as many orders for the existing aircraft as it once expected. \nThe news pushed Rolls-Royce shares down more than 6 per cent and they continued falling for the rest of the week. \n● Related Lex note: Rolls-Royce cheap and cheerless \nNYSE lunchtime shutdown goes unnoticed by traders \nIt was a week to forget for the New York Stock Exchange, which suffered its most high-profile glitch in several years and had to halt trading on its famous floor for more than three hours, writes Philip Stafford in London . \nThe exchange traced the problem to a software release on part of its network, which had been introduced to test new rules on trade time-stamps. Markets \nExchanges and their customers have a history of halts \nTrading glitches from 2007 to the present day. \nContinue reading \nThe exchange shut down part of its market over the lunchtime period while it assessed the problem, and thousands of open orders had to be cancelled manually. \nHowever, the complexity of the market was also a saviour as well as a culprit. The Big Board shut down its floor but electronic markets continued to function as normal. \nAll the securities listed on its markets continued to trade on the myriad of rival exchanges, dark pools, alternative venues and bank trading desks that make up the modern-day US equity market structure. \nMany traders barely noticed and just traded with NYSE’s rivals Nasdaq and BATS Global Markets. Indeed, for the majority of a typical day, US share trading takes place away from the NYSE. \nCredit Suisse estimated that the intraday volume on the main NYSE exchange dwindles to less than 2 per cent of the overall market. \nHowever, that pattern changes dramatically in the final 30 minutes of trade as investors gravitate back to the exchange to execute trades in the NYSE’s closing auction. At that point it garners a near-20 per cent market share. \nP&G offloads 43 beauty brands to Coty for $12.5bn \nProcter & Gamble this week announced plans to sell 43 beauty brands, including Clairol, CoverGirl and Max Factor, to US beauty products maker Coty in a complex $12.5bn-plus transaction, writes Nathalie Kilby in London . \nThe deal will double Coty’s annual revenues to more than $10bn and help expand its footprint in countries including Brazil and Japan, transforming it into a “global leader” in fragrances. \nTo minimise its tax bill, P&G has structured the deal as a “Reverse Morris Trust”. This will see it split or spin off 43 of its cosmetics, fragrance and haircare brands into a new entity which will then be immediately merged with a Coty subsidiary, in exchange for shares in Coty. \nOnce the deal completes, P&G shareholders will own 52 per cent of the new entity, with Coty shareholders owning the remaining 48 per cent. \nCoty, which sells fragrances, cosmetics and skin and body care products under brand names including Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs, anticipates the deal will generate $550m in cost savings on an annual basis over the next three years. \nCincinnati-based P&G said the transaction will result in a one-off gain of $5bn-$7bn, depending on the value when it closes. The 43 brands being sold generated sales of $5.9bn last year. \nThe deal, which is still subject to regulatory clearance, is expected to close in the second half of 2016. \nThe new entity will take on $1.9bn-$3.9bn debt, depending on the value Coty shares before the deal closes. The higher Coty’s share price, the less debt the new entity will assume. \nThe sale comes as part of P&G’s divestment strategy which has seen it sell billions of dollars of brands, as it seeks to focus on a portfolio of just 65 brands. \nJAB Cosmetics — which owns all of Coty’s Class B common stock, representing about 97 per cent of votes — has approved the deal and agreed to convert its shares into Class A common stock. This will leave JAB owning about 33 per cent of the new entity. \n● Related Lex note: Beauty in the eye of the beholder \nNoble bows to critics and calls for external review \nAfter months of criticism Noble Group moved to address criticism of its financial reporting this week by appointing an accounting firm to review how it records profits on long-term supply agreements, writes Neil Hume in London . \nNoble, Asia’s biggest commodity trader by sales, said the decision to commission an assessment of its “mark to market models and valuations” was taken “in the interests of transparency”. \nThe review will be carried out by PwC and not Ernst & Young, Noble’s auditor. The appointment was made by a new committee of four non-executive directors. The announcement drew a muted response from the market — Noble shares were lower over the week. They have fallen by more than 40 per cent since February, when a firm called Iceberg Research began attacking the company’s use of complex accounting techniques. \nMichael Dee, the former head of Morgan Stanley’s operations in Southeast Asia and a critic of Noble and its management, said the review was unlikely to produce a truly independent assessment of the company’s accounting. \n“Three of the four members of Noble’s ‘independent’ review committee, including its chairman, are all existing members of the audit committee, which includes Mr [Richard] Elman [Noble’s founder],” noted Mr Dee. \nIn its first public comments on Noble’s accounting practices, Singapore’s stock market operator and regulator said the review would address some of the questions raised by Iceberg and other researchers. \nAnd finally ... the lighter side of the news ©Bloomberg \n● Samsung might well tout the Galaxy S6 as the flagship in its smartphone line-up, but the heavenly body that springs to mind is more likely to be a meteorite plummeting to earth. Certainly the South Korean company’s performance has been less than stellar — notching up a seventh straight decline in year-on-year quarterly profits. Could it be that the “Project Zero” code name for the handset was eerily prophetic of sales that failed to lift off? ©Bloomberg \n● When it comes to the demolition derby of taxi hailing, getting a good start and having enough fuel to last the course are crucial to taking the laurels. Didi Kuaidi, the Chinese service, has secured a super-charged start with more than $3.5bn in its full-to-the-brim tank. If the turmoil in China’s stock markets continues, US rival Uber is likely to be left on the starting grid and then lapped several times over if its efforts to rustle up $1bn stall. \n● Once the go-to destination for wardrobe staples, UK stalwart Marks and Spencer has lost its magic and sparkle and ended up muddled and staid. If a return to declining sales was not enough, Muriel Conway, one of the group’s former designers, this week took a seam ripper to M&S’s offerings, declaring that the ugliness makes her weep. No chance of her putting in an order for that ubiquitous A-line suede skirt then. ©AFP \n● Heineken is lurching back to Myanmar much like a drunken Romeo returning to a past conquest in the hope of rekindling an old flame. However, the Dutch brewing group faces a challenge to win over the drinking public in southeast Asia, as it is faced with two rival suitors: state-owned Myanmar Brewery and Denmark’s Carlsberg. The winner in this battle for hearts and stomachs will be the one who can best cope with being a cheap date.
