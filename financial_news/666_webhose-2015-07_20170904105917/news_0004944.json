ADVERTISEMENT Backers of the deal, which was negotiated by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sens Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), said the agreement \"reverses the trend of short-term, temporary fixes to fund the nationâ€™s transportation network.\n\"The DRIVE Act is a six-year highway authorization that will allow planning for important long-term projects around the country, and provides three years of guaranteed funding for the highway trust fund,\" the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee said in a statement announcing the specifics of the comprise legislation, which has been dubbed the Developing a Reliable and Innovative Vision for the Economy (DRIVE) Act. \n\"The bill is fully offset with spending reductions or changes to federal programs,\" the statement continued. \"It does not increase the deficit or raise taxes.\" \nGOP leaders are scrambling to beat a July 31 deadline for replenishing the Department of Transportation's Highway Trust Fund, but Democrats in the upper chamber have complained that they have not had enough time to read the actual text of the bill. \nThe proposal that was unveiled on Wednesday calls for taking $16.3 billion from the interest rate changes, $9 billion from the sales of reserved oil, $4 billion from customs fees, $3.5 billion from the TSA fees and $1.9 billion from extending guarantees on mortage-backed securities that had been scheduled to start declining in 2021. \nOther funding sources in the measure include approximately $7.7 billion in tax compliance measures that lawmakers have said can raise revenue that can be used to pay for roads. \nCongress has been grappling with the transportation funding shortfall since 2005, and they have not passed an infrastructure funding bill that last longer than two years during that span. \nThe main source of transportation funding for decades has been revenue that is collected by the 18.4-cents-per-gallon federal gas tax. The tax has not been increased since 1993, however, and more fuel-efficient cars have sapped its buying power. \nThe federal government typically spends about $50 billion per year on transportation projects, but the gas tax only brings in approximately $34 billion annually. \nTransportation advocates have pushed for a gas tax increase to pay for a long-term transportation bill, but McConnell and other Republican leaders have ruled out a tax hike . \nCongressional budget scorekeepers have estimated it will take about $100 billion , in addition to the gas tax revenue, to fully pay for a six-year transportation bill.
