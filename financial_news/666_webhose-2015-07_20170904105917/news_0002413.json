Big banks such as JPMorgan (LSE: JPIU.L - news ) , Bank of America, Citigroup were all up 1 percent. \nOil prices tumbled as Iran and six world powers closed in on a nuclear deal that would end sanctions on the Islamic Republic and let more Iranian oil on to world markets. \nHowever, the oil price slide boosted U.S. airline stocks . American Airlines (Xetra: A1G.DE - news ) , United Continental (NYSE: UAL - news ) , JetBlue, Alaska Air (NYSE: ALK - news ) were all up between 1.5 to up 2 percent. \nApple shares were up 1.1 percent at $124.64 after Socgen upgraded the company's stock to \"buy\" from \"hold\", saying it expected a successful launch of the new iPhone 6S handset in September. \nAscena Retail Group slumped 13.9 percent to $14.10 after the retail chain cut its full-year profit forecast. \nRemy International (NasdaqGS: REMY - news ) soared 42 percent to $29.15 after auto parts maker BorgWarner (NYSE: BWA - news ) said it would buy the company for about $1.2 billion in cash, including debt.
