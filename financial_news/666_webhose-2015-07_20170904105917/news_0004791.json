A bench of Chief Justice HL Dattu, Justice Arun Mishra and Justice Amitava Roy issued notice after counsel Prashant Bhushan told the court that appointment process of the CEC and ECs needed to be made independent and free from government control. Appearing for PIL petitioner Anoop Baramwal, he told the court that a three-member committee being sought by the petitioner for the appointments should comprise the prime minister, the chief justice of India, and the leader of opposition. The Law Commission, Administrative Reforms Commission and Committee on Electoral Reforms had all recommended that a broad-based selection committee be constituted for appointment of CEC and ECs, the court was told. The PIL assumes significance as a constitution bench of the apex court is considering a batch of petitions whether the executive's role in NJAC compromises independence of the judiciary. The court sought the government's response in this case in four weeks.
