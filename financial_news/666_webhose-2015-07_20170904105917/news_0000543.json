Spiering did not give a breakdown of where the job losses would hit. \nThe company had record revenues of NZ$22.3 billion in 2013-14 but since then a China-driven boom in diary has ended, with prices halving in the past year. \nIncreased exports from the United States and the removal of milk production quotas in Europe have added to Fonterra's woes, with Spiering saying the business review was not yet over.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T06:22:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
