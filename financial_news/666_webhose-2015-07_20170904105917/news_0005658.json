Here are your options.\nMYTAX\nThe newest player on the tax block, MyTax was launched last year and is a free and simple online option that the Australian Taxation Office says is the “fastest and most convenient way” for you to lodge your tax return.\nIt’s for people with basic tax affairs and you only need to navigate 10 screens. The ATO pre-fills your personal details and data such as wages, interest income and share dividends, which it says it usually receives by early August.\nYou will need a my.gov.au account, which needs to be sorted out online before you can use the ATO’s online lodgement options.\nThe average taxpayer can expect to get Source: Supplied\nETAX\nETax is the more complex big sister of MyTax and has been with us for more than a decade. It’s also free, relatively simple to use and you can get your data pre-filled by the ATO.\nAdrian Raftery, a senior lecturer in tax and financial planning at Deakin University, says about two million Aussies use ETax or MyTax each year, but warns that there is a trap when relying on pre-filled information.\nThe ATO passes on the data to you once it gets it from employers, banks, share registries and investment funds but these institutions are often slow in sending it. “Managed funds can take until October before they announce it,” he says.\n“The onus is on you to lodge a tax return that’s correct.”\nIf you rely on pre filling, The ATO’s data-matching technology might later pick up some income you didn’t declare and ask you to pay the tax back, plus penalty taxes.\n“There’s nothing worse than paying back something you have already spent,” Raftery says.\nHe says DIY tax through ETax, MyTax or the old paper returns are generally not suited to people with capital gains tax events, rental properties, managed funds and small businesses, but you can always ask the ATO for help when doing your tax.\n“The ATO has excellent resources and you can call them up if you are not sure about something, although you may have to wait half an hour on the phone. Dr Google is good at answering questions as well.”\nIf you’re after real DIY complexity, the old paper tax returns can still be used.\nEARN THE BEST INTEREST ON YOUR TAX REFUND\nTAX AGENT\nThe bulk of the nation’s tax returns are prepared by registered tax agents, who typically charge $100 to $150 — tax deductible — for a basic return.\nH & R Block director of tax communications Mark Chapman says tax agents understand the law, what you can and can’t claim, and will guide you through the process.\n“The tax law is complicated and it’s always changing. You think you have a handle on it but then things change,” he says.\nUsing a tax agent doesn’t mean you don’t do any work yourself. Make sure you keep receipts and other paperwork, as they can’t claim deductions that cannot be proved.\n“If you turn up with only half the information you are leaving yourself open to a bigger fee and slower process. All tax agents use checklists and are very good at giving people information about what they need to bring in beforehand,” Chapman says.\nAccountants are the Rolls Royce tax return option Source: Supplied\nACCOUNTANT\nAccountants can come with fancy acronyms like CA (Chartered Accountant), (CPA) Certified Practising Accountant or IPA (Institute of Public Accountants).\nThey’re the Rolls Royce tax return option and typically cost between several hundred and several thousand dollars to do your tax return, depending on its complexity.\nMaximum Wealth Advisers partner Gianni La Scala says there’s a big difference between lodging a tax return and obtaining advice from a quality accountant.\n“When implementing a strategy or investment out of the norm it will always pay to seek some advice, as that small cost could save you considerably. A simple ownership structure, for example, could save you thousands in the long run,” he says.\n ", "external_links": ["http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-get-your-tax-done-this-year/story-fnkji35w-1227436941929?sv=6d78e6824a8f02b60eb97ddc4ee71b1&title=Short+cuts+to+a+quick+return", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-get-your-tax-done-this-year/story-fnkji35w-1227436941929?sv=6d78e6824a8f02b60eb97ddc4ee71b1", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-get-your-tax-done-this-year/story-fnkji35w-1227436941929?sv=6d78e6824a8f02b60eb97ddc4ee71b1&title=Short+cuts+to+a+quick+return", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-get-your-tax-done-this-year/story-fnkji35w-1227436941929?sv=6d78e6824a8f02b60eb97ddc4ee71b1&h=Short+cuts+to+a+quick+return", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/guide/high-interest-savings-accounts#itm_t=story&itm_l=how-to-do-your-tax", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/savings#itm_t=story&itm_l=how-to-do-your-tax", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-get-your-tax-done-this-year/story-fnkji35w-1227436941929?sv=6d78e6824a8f02b60eb97ddc4ee71b1"], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T09:21:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
