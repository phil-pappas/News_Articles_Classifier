Photo: Reuters\nCommodity prices – including major Australian exports like iron ore and coal – are expected to hit rock-bottom in the second half of 2015 before picking up in 2016, according to the World Bank's third-quarter commodity markets outlook.\nA major exception is gold, which the bank has forecast will still be trading below current prices in 2025.\n\"Most commodity prices declined in the second quarter of 2015 due to ample supplies and weak demand, especially in industrial commodities,\" said the World Bank report. \"These trends are expected to persist for the rest of the year, with a modest recovery in 2016.\"\nIron ore, by far Australia's largest mineral export and now trading at $US51.76 per tonne, is expected to average a price of $US55 per tonne over 2015, said the report. This is 46 per cent below the levels it was trading at in 2014.\nThe bank predicted that the average price of iron ore would lift slightly in 2016 to $US56.70.\nThermal coal, Australia's third-biggest mineral export now trading at $US60.45 per tonne, was expected to average $US58 per tonne in 2015, said the report. It would lift slightly to $59.50 per tonne in 2016.\nCrude oil, currently trading at $US56.11 a barrel, would follow a similar trajectory, said the World Bank. It would average $US57.50 in 2015 before lifting to $US61.20 in 2016.\nShine off gold Other top-10 Australian mineral exports, including aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc, were forecast to follow a similar price trajectory.\nThe exception was gold, currently trading at $US1098 an ounce. The World Bank forecast prices to decline every year, reaching just $US1000 per ounce in 2025. \"Gold prices are expected to fall 12 per cent, largely driven by expectation of a rising dollar and tightening in US monetary policy.\"\nThe World Bank's forecasts are largely in line with others, including recent forecasts produced by Citi and RBC Capital.\nHowever, there are exceptions. Goldman Sachs, for example, has slashed its forecast for copper at the end of 2016 to $US5361. This compares with an average analyst outlook of $US6608, according to 26 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nMorgan Stanley, meanwhile, said on Thursday that in a worst-case scenario, gold could sink to $US800 an ounce.\nUBS commodities analyst Jo Battershill​ said the commodities forecasts from UBS and the World Bank were broadly similar.\n\"You could make the same argument they've made from our price deck,\" Mr Battershill said.\n\"We don't have massive bounces from our current forecasts, but our current forecasts are above current pricing.\"\nBut Mr Battershill said no analyst could be certain that 2015 would be the year in which commodities prices reach their nadir. \"Never say never.\"\nHe cited the Goldman Sachs report about copper as an example of potentially further downside for commodities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T23:20:07.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
