You might not be able to quit your day job anytime soon, but click through to see how you can build some breathing room into your budget. 1. Blogging \nBlogs are frequently updated websites covering any subject of your choice and written in an informal style. Monetization comes through sponsors or one of the many affiliate marketing sites. \nThe blogosphere is a competitive arena, but with a little bit of technical skill and a lot of patience, you can make a fair amount of money for less than 10 hours a week of effort, said Tim Rolston, who left his well-paying IT position to start the tech blog LoveMySurface.net . Through the blog, he and his wife make $1,000 a month for six to eight hours of work per week, he said. \nDifficulty Rating: Intermediate \nPro Tip: You’ll need the skills to build a website for your blog. Many people use WordPress or Drupal, said Rolston. Knowledge in a niche area and the ability to write compellingly about it is necessary to help you stand out from the crowd. \nRelated: 30 Clever Ways to Make Money Online 2. Designing Websites \nIn today’s cyber-focused world, every business, no matter how small, needs a website. If you have an eye for design and can build sites, you could make good money. In fact, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, the median annual income for website developers was $62,500 as of 2012. \n“A lot of people across the planet are capable of doing this, but if you have taste, style, and a sense for design, you can quickly separate yourself from the pack,” said Phil Dunn, founder and president of Synapse Services , which has been building websites for all sizes of businesses for more than a decade. \nDifficulty Rating: Intermediate to advanced \nPro Tip: “The software is constantly changing, and styles evolve every year, so even site refreshes help drive business for the competent web designer and developer,\" said Dunn. \"Mobile site development has driven much of the recent business growth.\" 3. Building Apps \nApps are those simple programs installed on your mobile device. If you have the know-how, you can make some decent extra money building apps for smartphones and tablets, according to Dunn. “This is a booming trade,” he said. \nFor instance, a 2013 investigation by Forbes Magazine found that the average app brings in anywhere from $625 to $4,000, depending on the platform for which it is written. \nDifficulty Rating: Advanced \nPro Tip: “Learn the Java programming language and learn a simple mock-up program like Balsamiq or InVision,” advised Dunn. \nRelated: 37 Ways to Make and Save More Money 4. Managing Social Media \nDo you have mad Instagram skills? Can you tweet with one thumb tied behind your back? You could earn some cash as a social media manager posting on behalf of businesses and brands to create social media campaigns. \nThis occupation includes posting original content, sharing others' content and following other influencers on particular networks. The fees you can charge range greatly, said Dunn. The key is to be patient as you establish yourself and build your business. \nDifficulty Rating: Intermediate \nPro Tip: “To manage several accounts, you'll want to learn to use a management console like Hootsuite or Buffer,\" said Dunn. \"Install their extensions and plugins and use large chunks of focused time to schedule paced sharing throughout the week that's appropriate for each social network, like Twitter, Pinterest, Facebook, Instagram and others,” he said. 5. Becoming an Online Concierge (E-Commerce) \nFrom Craigslist to Amazon Marketplace, people have many options when it comes to selling things online. To stand out, you need to do something unique like former lawyers Phillis Chan and Ben Chaung did when they started New York-based online concierge business Big Apple Buddy . \nAfter many relatives and friends from distant countries asked for clothing or high-tech gadgets to be bought in America and sent to them, Chan and Chaung started the business, and it immediately took off. “We charge $40 minimum for services per order, and since launching nine months ago, we’ve had around 1,500 orders,” said Chan. \nDifficulty Rating: Intermediate \nPro Tip: “Know your market and define your niche,\" said Chan. \"It’s important to understand the competitive landscape you’re going to play in, what your key differentiator is, and who your target customers are.” 6. Teaching Classes Online \nDo you have knowledge or a skill that others would pay you to teach them? Udemy.com is a virtual “university” where you can create your own course. There are courses on everything from operating systems and game design to yoga and more than a dozen languages. If you have a tech-related skill, you’ll be well-positioned to start a class that earns money, said Rolston. \nHere’s how it works: You sign up to teach a class online, set your price, and earn 50 percent of the fee or more for every student who signs up. You can teach more than one class, and the service is free. \nDifficulty Rating: Intermediate to advanced \nPro Tip: You’ll need a marketable tech skill, good preparation and good communication skills, said Rolston. He said a realistic expectation is $200 a class, but it can go higher. 7. Making Videos on YouTube \nYouTube offers an opportunity to make money for anyone from amateur videographers to media-savvy pros. If you can make a video, even on your iPhone, that grabs enough attention, you might be able to cash in, said Dunn. He co-founded GrubTribe , a site dedicated to telling chefs' stories and highlighting cuisine, relying heavily on video interviews. \nYou make money off your YouTube videos by allowing ads that are related to your video subject to appear before it — car ads would feature on a car review video, for instance. When viewers click on the ad or watch for a certain amount of time (30 seconds is common), you earn money. The amount you can earn varies by subject. \nDifficulty Rating: Intermediate \nPro Tip: \"GrubTribe focuses on interviewing competence,\" said Dunn. \"As we get better at pulling good stories out of gourmet chefs, our jobs become easier. Everybody loves a good story.\" Learn Adobe Premiere, iMovie or Camtasia to get started and develop strong editing skills so your videos don’t look like amateur hour at the Apple store. 8. Podcasting \nIf you have the gift of the gab, podcasting might be the right fit for you to try to make extra money. Podcasters produce original audio content that’s published on a variety of platforms, such as iTunes, Tune.in, SoundCloud, Pocket Casts and Stitcher. \nYou can potentially make money from podcasts in a few ways. One is attracting a sponsor. They pay you money for “commercial” time or a mention on your podcast. Think radio advertiser here. Another way is through an affiliate marketing structure on the podcast website. When people click the ads and buy products, you get a small payout. \nDifficulty Rating: Intermediate \nPro Tip: \"Relax, be yourself, be conversational and have fun,\" said Dunn, who produced many GrubTribe podcasts. \"The underlying crucial factor, however, is to stay focused on a specific niche that features information that's highly coveted. Get a Blue Yeti microphone or something similar to ensure quality sound capture.” 9. Online Tech Contracting \nIf you put your skills to use outside your home or after your day job, you might be able to easily score some cash through freelance jobs from sites like Fiverr.com and Freelancer.com. “You can take on as many or as few jobs as you want and you can set your own prices,” said Rolston. \nHe did add one caveat: There’s a lot of competition, especially from overseas, so you might not be able to get the fees you desire. “Depending on the type of projects you take on, you make anywhere from $5 a project for small jobs, like designing a simple logo, to $100 or more for more complex endeavors,” Rolston said. \nDifficulty Rating: Easy \nPro Tip: \"You’ll need a marketable tech skill and good project management and documentation skills,” said Rolston. You’ll also want a good sales pitch to stand out from the crowd. 10. Digital Photography \nIf you’re like most people, your smartphone is practically part of you. So why not use it to earn a few bucks? Sites such as global online stock photo site Dreamstime allow you to do just that. You start an account for free, upload images, and when end-users such as websites or magazines buy them, you get a percentage of the proceeds. \nYou won’t get rich overnight; the photographer (yes, that’s you) payout ranges from a few cents to around $40 on Dreamstime, but if your photos are downloaded enough, it can add up. \nDifficulty Rating: Easy \nPro Tip: “The subject should be as generic as possible, while composition clear, without elements that can distract the viewer from the main theme,” the Dreamstime website instructs. It also suggests perusing its bank of stock images to get a feel for the quality of the site's best-selling photos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T13:10:00.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
