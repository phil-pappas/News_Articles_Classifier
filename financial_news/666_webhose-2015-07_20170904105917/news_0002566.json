Turnover tumbled to 8.42 billion shillings ($82 million) in June from 21.32 billion shillings in May, central bank figures showed.\n\"(Investors) are having trouble exiting because of the lack of liquidity in the secondary market; it might cost us in the future,\" said a Nairobi-based fixed income trader with a commercial bank.\nOn May, 12, the central bank raised the cap on rates offered for term auction deposits (TADs), one of its main tools for managing liquidity, making it more expensive to bet against the shilling, which is now near 3-1/2 year lows.\nThe cap is now 250 basis points above the benchmark lending rate, which has been raised twice since June to 11.50 percent.\nTADs, with terms up to 28 days, can offer 14 percent, while yields on two-year bonds are 12.80 percent. Rates on TADs may not hit the upper limit, but returns are still better than on longer-term debt. A 28-day TAD offered 13 percent on Friday.\nJohn Ashbourne of Capital Economics said TAD issues were unlikely to cause too much disruption.\n\"There might be some effect at the margins, but I doubt that it would be enough to fundamentally harm the secondary bond market,\" he said, adding that the central bank could quickly lower the cap if it felt foreign investment was drying up.\nThe central bank said it was working to keep prices stable and TADs were one of its tools to achieve that.\nInflation at around 7 percent has been close to the upper limit of its 2.5 to 7.5 percent target band.\nBut Alex Muiruri, fixed income analyst at African Alliance Investment Bank, said the measures meant \"activity on the secondary (bond) market has taken a back seat.\"\nTurnover on the bond market has been sliding since last year, along with the currency.\nJust 8.42 billion shillings changed hands in June this year, compared with 44.58 billion shillings in May 2014 and 26.88 billion in June 2014.\n\"Secondary trading has been dead ... for the last quarter,\" said another fixed income trader. \"Of course the shilling weakening against the dollar does not help much.\"\n($1 = 102.4000 Kenyan shillings) (Editing by Edmund Blair/Ruth Pitchford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T14:31:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
