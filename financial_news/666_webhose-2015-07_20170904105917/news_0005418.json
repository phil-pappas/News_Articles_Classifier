(NYSE: DK ) will substantially outperform peers. \nIn a report issued Monday, analysts Neil Mehta, Kristina Cibor and Sam Schwartz look into three key themes for the second half of the year. \n1) Buy the Gulf Coast \nThe firm continues to include Valero in its Americas Conviction List, maintaining a Buy rating and $79 price target. Another other large-cap refining company that operates in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which Goldman likes, is Marathon (Buy rating, $68 price target). The analysts see the equities in this region benefiting from sturdy gasoline margins, capital allocation, wider spreads and appealing valuations, going forward. \n2) Own FCF machines \nDelek (Buy rated, $47 price target) and Valero seem well positioned to deliver premium free cash flow on the back of capex declines. This would enable the companies to buy back more stock and increase its dividend yields. \n3. Own SOTP leaders \nOn top of refiners, Goldman sees potential in some non-refining assets like at Delek’s Delek Logistics Partners LP (NYSE: DKL ) and Marathon’s speedway and retail segments. \nOn top of the Delek upgrade, the analysts downgraded Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX ) from Buy to Neutral, to reflect the recent stock appreciation and expected margin pressure, and boosted Western Refining, Inc. (NYSE: WNR )’s rating from Sell to Neutral “to reflect midstream value, M&A potential and strong Phoenix margins.” Latest Ratings for VLO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T08:16:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
