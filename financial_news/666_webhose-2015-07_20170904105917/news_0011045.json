The high grade Golden Age reef will be blended with the base load open pit Matilda Mine ore to increase the average grade of the mill feed. \n\n“Golden Age is just one of numerous high grade quartz reefs in the immediate vicinity of the Wiluna Gold Plant. Golden Age is immediately accessible with established underground infrastructure that will allow mining to commence rapidly following the development decision.” \n\nRecent Activity\n\nStudies are in progress on costing and engineering work associated with the open pit mining areas. \n\nDuring the June Quarter high resolution photogrammetric aerial surveys were flown with a drone over Matilda and Galaxy to assist in the open pit mining studies. \n\nInitial Pre-Feasibility mine designs have been prepared for the Matilda Galaxy and Williamson open pits which will be refined once the geotech and metallurgy studies are completed. \n\nRegent Bulletin South and Happy Jack have had mining optimisations prepared. \nUnderground mining studies are progressing at Golden Age East Lode West Lode and Calvert.\n\nUnderground geotechnical work has also commenced on stope design parameters at Golden Age East West Lodes and Calvert.\n\nBlackham currently has 3 drill rigs at the Matilda Gold Project to fast track drilling required to complete the Definitive Feasibility Study.\n\nA review was conducted on the plant and metallurgy test work during the quarter to ensure the areas of focus for the PFS have been identified.\n\nProposals to complete the PFS plant refurbishment study have been received from a number of engineering firms. It is expected this work will be awarded this week and work will commence immediately.\n\nIn addition a gas supply consultant has been appointed to review the cost of supplying gas to Blackham’s 12 megawatt power station via the existing spur line from the Goldfields Gas Pipeline. \n\nTwo diesel gensets with a combined power of 2.8MW have been serviced to provide power to the underground as well as pre development activities.\nDeveloping story...\n \nProactive Investors Australia is the market leader in producing news articles and research reports on ASX emerging companies with distribution in Australia UK North America and Hong Kong / China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T13:38:17.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
