The gunmen allegedly opened the canopy door and shot at the three men while they were asleep, killing one instantly. \nA second man from the same vehicle died shortly afterwards. \nOne of the gunmen then approached the second vehicle and shot through the driver's window at a man who was asleep on the passenger seat. \nHe sustained a gunshot wound to the arm. \n\"I heard a gunshot and then the cries of the guy in front screaming that I need to take him to the hospital,\" said a man who was sleeping on the back seat behind the wounded passenger. \n\"I jumped from the back seat into the front seat and sped off to the police station to report what was going on.\" \nAccording to the man, the police only responded 15 minutes later. \nThe men in the third vehicle were unaffected by the shooting as the gunmen fled after the second vehicle took off towards the police station, which is less than 20 metres away from the site of the incident. \n\"We slept near the station because we thought it would be safe,\" one man said. \n'Organised hit' \n\"This was definitely an organised hit.\" \nThe men said they would have to find alternate accommodation as they are fearful of returning to the field. \nAccording to ER24 spokesperson Paul Knoesen, when paramedics arrived, they found one man dead and three others critically injured. \nParamedics tried to resuscitate one of the men when he stopped breathing, but he was declared dead. \n\"The other two men were rushed to Grey's Hospital and Northdale Hospital for further treatment,\" Knoesen said. \nWillowton Group director Shoaib Moosa on Monday said the Labour Court had declared the strike unprotected and illegal. \n\"If the workers do not return to work, they could potentially face dismissal. We are saddened at what has happened and we feel for our drivers, regardless of the situation,\" Moosa said. \nAccording to Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Mthokozisi Ngobese, officers including the Tracing Task Team attended the crime scene. \n\"Police officers combed the crime scenes for hours to gain as much evidence as possible, to assist in the investigation of the crime. The motive for the murder is unknown. However, investigations into the case will soon reveal why the deceased were shot,\" Ngobese said. \nPietermaritzburg cluster commander Major-General Lucas Ngobeni appealed to the community to come forward with information that would result in the gunmen being apprehended. \nAnyone with information should contact Captain Pipes Haffajjee at 079 500 0264, or Detective Warrant Officer Nzuza at 072 516 8907. \nLabour dispute \nLast month, The Witness reported that a labour dispute that turned nasty between Willowton Logistics and 24 of its 200 drivers may have resulted in the deaths of three people on June 23. \nThe three died and a fourth was critically injured when two trucks collided on the N3 near the Lions River turnoff. \nCircumstantial evidence from the accident suggested that a large \"concrete block\" was thrown onto a Willowton truck as it drove under the Lions River bridge, causing the driver to lose control and crash into a Honeydew truck. \nAt the time of the incident, Willowton Group director Shoaib Moosa alleged the drivers on strike were responsible for the incident. \nThe drivers denied the allegations the next day. \nThe dispute centres on the drivers wanting their own union, which they said the company would not recognise. \nAt the time, Moosa said the company would not recognise the union as Willowton Logistics belonged to the Transport Bargaining Council, which regulated the working conditions and salaries of employees. \nSource: The Witness", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T16:33:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
