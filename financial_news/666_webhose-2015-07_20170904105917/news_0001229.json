Oil production is currently constrained to approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and is under constant review but there is no effect on the field's reservoir or resources, the company said. \nTullow said it has mobilised a team of experts to rectify the fault within the gas compression system and estimates that it will take approximately a further three weeks to reinstate gas export and full oil production. \nThe company will review its 2015 production forecast for Jubilee and provide an update on progress at its half-yearly results on 29 July. \nAtif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers , said that while the news is disappointing, he still sees value in Tullow as a standalone sector play. \n\"We do not expect there to be any material estimate changes and continue to see the upside risk as significant,\" he said. \nAt 11:44, shares were down 3.6% at 271.60p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T14:59:58.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
