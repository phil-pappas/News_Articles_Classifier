Photo: Bloomberg\nLinkedIn, operator of the biggest social networking site for professionals, said revenue climbed by a third in the latest quarter, better than expected, driven by strong growth in its business with recruiters and a 21 per cent rise in members.\nThe company also forecast full-year revenue and profit that handily exceeded market estimates.\nLinkedIn has been spending heavily to acquire businesses and build up its sales and development teams in an effort to leverage off its 380 million members.\nIn its biggest deal yet, the company bought lynda.com, a leader in the fast-growing training video market, for $US1.5 billion ($2.1 billion) in May. Second-quarter revenue included a contribution of $US18 million from lynda.com.\n\"We believe this could be one of LinkedIn's most transformational initiatives as it has the potential to improve the member experience across the platform,\" Chief Executive Jeff Weiner said in a statement.\nLinkedIn has also been investing to improve its mobile presence and is developing new products for China, where it now has about 10 million members, up from 4 million last February.\n\"If any US based Internet company has a chance to succeed in China in the near term I think it's LinkedIn,\" said Axiom Capital analyst Victor Anthony.\nLinkedIn, which gets 38 per cent of its revenue from outside the United States, said that excluding the impact of the strong dollar its revenue would have risen 38 per cent.\nThe company said revenue in its Talents Solutions business, which sells services to recruiters, rose 38 per cent to $US443 million in the three months ended June 30.\nThe business, in the midst of an overhaul, accounted for 62 per cent of total revenue. LinkedIn also gets revenue from advertising and premium subscriptions.\nThe company said it now had about 380 million members, an increase of 21 per cent from a year earlier.\nLinkedIn's net loss attributable to shareholders ballooned to $US67.7 million from $US1 million. However, revenue rose 33.3 per cent to $US711.7 million.\nLinkedIn said it expects full-year revenue of about $US2.94 billion and an adjusted profit of about $US2.19 per share. Analysts expected $US1.93 per share on revenue of $US2.91 billion.\nUp to Thursday's close of $US227.15, LinkedIn's shares had fallen about 1 per cent this year. The stock was little changed in after-hours trading on Thursday.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:24:44.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
