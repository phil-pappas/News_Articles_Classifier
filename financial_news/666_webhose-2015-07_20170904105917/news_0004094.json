Noble Group’s outside public relations firm said the company had no immediate response to questions about its stock decline.\n“If there’s a sustained decline in commodity prices, that will definitely have an impact on Noble,” said Bernard Aw, a Singapore-based strategist at IG Ltd.\nThe plunge comes on the day crude oil neared a bear market with West Texas Intermediate dropping below $50 a barrel, gold holding near five-year lows, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. saying Chinese demand growth for copper will slow to the least in two decades. In addition, Iceberg Research, an anonymous group that has criticized Noble’s accounting practices since February, issued its latest report two days ago, rejecting the trading firm’s moves to address its critics as inadequate.\nNoble Group, which says Iceberg’s criticisms are without merit, earlier hired PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to review how it values some of its assets.\n“Investors will probably remain cautious until the PWC report is out,” Aw said.\nNoble recovered to trade at 62.5 Singapore cents, down 3.9 percent, as of 12:11 p.m. local time. The local benchmark Straits Times Index benchmark was up 0.4 percent at the same time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T12:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T07:50:51.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
