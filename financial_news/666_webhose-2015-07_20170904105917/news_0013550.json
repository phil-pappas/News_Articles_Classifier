LG’s initial reaction was just to bring out a new version of its earlier hit, the more basic Chocolate phone. As a result, while its rival went on to enjoy fat profits from the smartphone boom, LG Electronics suffered two years of heavy losses in its handsets business. In 2010 its boss resigned, to be replaced by a member of LG’s founding Koo family. \nFollowing its belated entry into making smartphones, LG now has less than 5% of the world market, whereas Samsung has about a quarter. The field is getting more crowded, with the entry into the business of Chinese firms such as Lenovo, Huawei and Xiaomi, and Micromax of India. But LG continues to invest heavily in developing upmarket models such as its G4, launched earlier this year, which has a high-specification camera and an optional stitched-leather back. \nShin Moo-young, a former manager at both firms, is sceptical that such gimmicky features will do the trick, and likens the future of LG’s mobile business to the “sad decline into oblivion” of HTC, a once-prominent Taiwanese handset-maker. Though it is early days, some analysts recently downgraded their expectations for the G4’s sales, whereas Samsung’s latest model, the Galaxy S6, seems to be doing fine. \nFaced with the difficulty of catching up in smartphones, and increased competition from low-cost rivals in domestic appliances, LG is betting heavily on some emerging technologies, in the hope of shaking off its also-ran status. In particular, since 2013 it has been making televisions with organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays. These displays produce notably crisper pictures than even top-of-the-range liquid-crystal displays (LCDs). However, large OLED panels are costly and fiddly to make. Production yields (the ratio of flawless displays to duds) are depressingly low. \nLast year LG said it had made a breakthrough in a mass-production technique for big displays, and it now says it is achieving yields of up to 80%. When it launched the first version of its 55-inch curved-screen OLED television in 2013 it cost $15,000 but now the latest version of that model can be bought for about $2,500 on Amazon.com, around the price of a similar, top-end LCD set. It is now ramping up production at a second OLED factory, and it is considering a third. \nThe thin, lightweight OLED displays, which do not need a backlight, are allowing LG to experiment with transparent, rollable, foldable and curved screens. LG is now the world’s biggest maker of large displays of all kinds; in a decade its display business has more than tripled its revenue, to 26.4 trillion won ($26.3 billion) last year. As for smaller displays, it expects that within five years up to 40% of the world’s smartphones will have flexible OLED screens. LG already has a strong position selling LCD screens to Apple for its mobile devices. DisplaySearch, a market researcher, says LG has the biggest share (over 90%) of the global market for smartwatch panels, mostly on the back of sales to Apple. \nThese days cars are increasingly stuffed with electronics, and LG is also taking advantage of this trend. It is one of the world’s four main suppliers of display screens to global carmakers. It supplies electric-car batteries to 13 of the world’s 20 largest automotive brands, including Renault-Nissan, which has the broadest range of battery-powered cars. Last December LG sealed a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to work on camera systems for automated driving. LG is also using OLED technology to create bendable, energy-efficient light panels. Screen test \nBut big OLED TVs are the area in which it is taking the biggest punt. Samsung is still investing heavily in its display division, though it is being more cautious than LG in rolling out large-screen OLED TVs. Sony and Panasonic of Japan have abandoned a proposed partnership to mass-produce them. As a result, LG is emerging for the first time in a long while as the leader in a particular component, says Shaun Cochran of CLSA, a stockbroker. \nHowever, in a sense the lack of competition makes things harder for LG. It is having to work alone to create a market for such appliances by getting retailers and consumers to take an interest in them. LG is thought to be enduring heavy losses on its OLED TVs, and is a long way from seeing a return on the $3 billion it is said to have invested in production facilities since 2010. And even if consumers the world over fall in love with ultra-slimline, crystal-clear OLEDs, LG’s advantage might not last. Samsung would surely throw its vast resources at trying to catch up. In the one area of technology in which LG earns a gold star, keeping it will not be easy. \nCorrection: This article has been amended to clarify that LG's second OLED factory has now opened but production is still being ramped up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T16:04:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
