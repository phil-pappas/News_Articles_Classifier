This continues for years as he imperceptibly moves into a pre-diabetic state.\nAround middle age, he silently drifts over the line into diabetes type 2, a metabolic condition influenced by both lifestyle and genetic factors.\nThis is different to the far less common type 1 which people inherit rather than acquire.\nWhile type 2 will raise his risk of cardiovascular and other diseases, his mates will reassure him that it is not disastrous because good treatment is available and sophisticated personal treatment is emerging.\nPlaces such as Sydney's Garvan Institute are using genomic sequencing to try and develop tailored treatment strategies for individual patients.\n But this condition has complex ramifications and even when controlled on some measures, it may not be on others.\nOur man, having passed into type 2 territory is now facing a 75 per cent greater risk of developing all forms of dementia compared to his peers who don't have this disorder.\nThere are so many ways this disorder can affect his brain that some researchers refer to the dementia that results as \"diabetes type 3\".\nThe brain His brain is the most metabolically active organ in his body. It constitutes about 2 per cent of his body weight but consumes between 10 and 20 per cent of his energy stores.\nDiabetes will deprive it of fuel. It will affect the large vessels that bring blood to the head just as it will affect the small vessels that distribute blood in his brain.\nIt will also impair his brain cells' response to insulin, oxidative stress and inflammation.\nResearch last year showed fat can also leak into his brain with toxic effect.\nIn short, just as diabetes negatively affects his other bodily processes, so it negatively affects processes that strive to keep his brain healthy.\nWithin his actual brain cells, two processes could promote dementia, according to Mark Febbraio, professor and head of the Division of Diabetes and Metabolism at the Garvan.\nFirst, with age, the ability of his brain cells to deal with debris is compromised.\nSecond, diabetes can cause proteins within these cells to fold incorrectly and become misshapen.\nBecause old cells can't dispose of these faulty proteins efficiently, they are left to aggregate into amyloid plaques.\nHe says the same amyloid development occurs in the pancreas.\nBut, maintaining a good lifestyle with lots of physical activity and excellent nutrition can slow the ageing of the cell and preserve its ability to deal with debris â€“ unless there is an overriding genetic predisposition to dementia.\n\"Everyone who lives long enough will experience some form of dementia,\" Febbraio says. \"The question is how early it occurs and how rapidly it progresses.\"\nProteins His team currently has a drug in clinical trials for Alzheimer's in people with diabetes type 2.\nIt helps to refold misshapen proteins resulting in less debris in the cell.\nThe hope it that it will help delay the progression of their dementia.\nOver the past decade, the link between diabetes and dementia has become the subject of intense international research.\nLast week alone, two studies produced results that would concern anyone with the condition.\nThe first, a deep drill using only 40 people, was published in the journal Neurology .\nIt showed in just two years, people with diabetes type 2 experienced a marked drop in their ability to regulate blood flow in the brain.\nThis affected their cognitive and decision-making skills.\nThe Harvard authors explained that normal blood flow regulation allowed the brain to redistribute blood to areas that had increased activity while performing certain tasks.\nTheir participants were aged around 66 and half had been living with diabetes type 2 for about 13 years.\nThe other half didn't have the condition and at the start of the study scored some 55 points on their learning and memory tests. Two years later, their scores were largely unchanged.\nThe diabetics, however, began with scores around 46 and two years later were down to 41.\nHigher levels of inflammation were also associated with greater decreases in regulation, even when diabetes type 2 was well controlled.\nOverall, blood flow regulation in the brain was decreased by 65 percent in people with diabetes.\nActivity The second study involved 430,000 people with new-onset diabetes type 2.\nAfter following them for 12 years, the Taiwanese researchers found that as people experienced more complications from this condition, so their risk of dementia rose.\nPublished in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism , it is the first nationwide study to examine how the severity and progression of diabetes type 2 is related to dementia in people over 50.\nResearchers tracked patients admitted to hospital or had at least three outpatient medical visits for dementia after receiving a diabetes diagnosis.\nAlmost 27,000 or 6.2 per cent developed dementia.\nThose with complications such as nerve, kidney or eye damage were more likely to develop dementia.\nThere have been numerous other studies in the past 18 months including one from the Mayo Clinic which found the total brain volume of people who developed diabetes in middle age was, on average, 2.9 percent smaller than their peers.\nThe area of the brain that deals with the formation of long-term memories and spatial navigation, the hippocampus, was 4 per cent smaller.\nAnd so it goes!\nBut can men step off this path or slow their progression along it?\nFebbraio is a great advocate of activity.\nFor a start, he recommends men use the health app on their smart phone and aim to do 10,000 steps a day.\nHe's also an advocate of healthy eating.\nWhile drugs can only control, not cure diabetes type 2, he says many men have been able to drift back over the line through diligent diet and activity.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110990585086401178539/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/jillmargo1"], "published": "2015-07-14T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:06:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
