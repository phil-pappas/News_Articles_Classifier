Sam Brownback's chief spokeswoman says he expects to outline spending cuts next week to keep Kansas' current budget balanced. \nBrownback spokeswoman Eileen Hawley confirmed his plans Friday as the Republican governor announced that he's expanded the duties of budget director Shawn Sullivan to help find efficiencies throughout state government. \nSullivan's duties already included finding ways to trim spending when necessary, but the governor's office said he'll now work with agency directors across state government. Brownback's office also said that Sullivan will develop a new performance management system, without providing details. \nBrownback was expected to address the moves further during a Friday afternoon news conference. \nLegislators presumed the governor would make $50 million in cuts, even after they raised sales and cigarette taxes in June to avert a deficit. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T20:15:52.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
