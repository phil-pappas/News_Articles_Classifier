There is no chance that a solution will be achieved within 48 hours,\" said Fuchs, who has long had reservations about bailouts for Greece.\nA more moderate German conservative, Julia Kloeckner, said in a statement that Tsipras should not think he could put Germany and Europe under pressure with the referendum result but stopped short of calling for a Greek exit from the euro zone.
