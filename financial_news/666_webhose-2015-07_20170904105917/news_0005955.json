The ruble strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 57 per dollar by 1:35 p.m. in Moscow after weakening 1 percent last week.\nA deceleration in inflation from a 13-year high is giving the Bank of Russia room to keep easing monetary policy after lowering key interest rates by 550 basis points this year. Policy makers may cut borrowing costs by an additional 150 basis points by the end of 2015, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The Finance Ministry sold 75 billion rubles ($1.3 billion) of debut inflation-linked securities last week.\n“OFZs are rising as investors still expect key rate cuts later in 2015-2016,” Dmitry Polevoy, the chief economist for Russia at ING Groep NV in Moscow, said by e-mail. “The sale of inflation linkers last week seems to have spurred some reassessment of inflation and monetary-policy outlook.”\nData last Wednesday showed weekly consumer-price growth slowed to 0.1 percent from 0.7 percent in the seven days to July 13. Forward-rate agreements signal 39 basis points of rate cuts in the next three months, close to this year’s low in mid-June.\nLower Rates Russian local-currency sovereign bonds have returned 31 percent this year, the most among 31 emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg.\n“OFZs have been rising because the placement of inflation-linkers seems to have returned foreign investor appetite to the Russian market and some local players reassessed their inflation expectation toward a decline,” Dmitry Postolenko, a money manager at Kapital Asset Management LLC in Moscow, said in an e-mail.\nThe Micex Index of stocks retreated 0.2 percent, having risen 1.6 percent last week. Out of 50 Micex shares, 34 traded above the 50-day moving average on July 17, the most since March 12, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe ruble’s one-month volatility declined to 15.68, the lowest since Oct. 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T16:55:52.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
