Getty Images by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Former lawyer David Gordon is in the box seat to lead Ten Network Holdings into a new era as the free-to-air broadcaster's next chairman.\nTen is looking for a new chair after pay-TV monopoly Foxtel, owned by News Corporation and Telstra, agreed to inject up to $77 million into the third-placed commercial television network in exchange for 14.99 per cent of the company, as foreshadowed by Street Talk.\nThe company announced that following the Foxtel placement, which is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in October, the Ten board will be cut to six directors from ten, with an independent chairman.\nIt's understood Gordon, a former mergers and acquisitions partner at Freehills, is a near certainty to nab the role of chair.\nHe fits the bill given he's independent and has sat on the Ten board since 2010.\nHe's also well known in media circles after representing many of industry's biggest companies during his time at Freehills. Gordon is the principal of boutique advisory and investment business Lexicon Partners.\nIt's a big job ahead him at Ten where he will be tasked with turning around a network that has suffered from years of lacklustre ratings and revenue - although it has shown some signs of a recovery this year. The Foxtel placement and an associated rights issue will mark the third time the company has raised equity in three years.\nTen executive chairman Hamish McLennan will leave the board and return to his former chief executive role. There has been speculation about McLennan's future at Ten, although neither he nor the company have suggested he is planning to leave.\n Ten deputy chair Brian Long was considered the other obvious candidate for the chair, but at age 68, it's understood he was not interested in taking on the role.\nThere will be two independent directors on the board, a Foxtel representative and three representatives from the existing major shareholders, which include WIN Corporation owner Bruce Gordon, News Corporation co-chair Lachlan Murdoch, Crown Resorts chair James Packer and Hancock Prospecting owner Gina Rinehart.\nSiobhan McKenna was appointed to the board in 2012 as a nominee of James Packer's Cavalane Holdings and she is also a close Murdoch confidante. John Klepec represents Rinehart on the board.\nElsewhere, private equity giant TPG and Macquarie Corporate & Asset Finance Group are still weighing a first-round offer for GE Capital's commercial finance assets, despite doubts about the former's interest in the portfolio.\nSources said Tudor Investment Corp. had swerved the deal while Bank of Queensland and Lonestar Capital Management were still in the race. Bids are due in mid-August.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:09:37.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
