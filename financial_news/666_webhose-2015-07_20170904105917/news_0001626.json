Over the past two seasons, the team has stumbled into the break on similar losing streaks, including a 7-14 tailspin in 2014.\nWhile the Jays remain a playoff viable team talentwise, the numbers scream out that the roster needs help to bring the playoff picture together.\n“We’ve cooled off with the bats, no doubt about it, but we’ve seen some good pitching on this road trip, too,” Jays manager John Gibbons said. “That’s gonna happen in this game, and I’m surprised it’s taken this long.”\nStarting pitching wasn’t a problem with the Jays Friday night. Marco Estrada put in a gutsy outing against the best team in the American League and worked two outs into the seventh inning, scattering two runs on nine hits and making some tremendous pitches and outs with runners in scoring position.\nEstrada was at his best following a scary moment in the first inning when he was drilled on the right shin off a wicked come backer by Eric Hosmer.\nEstrada looked doubtful to stay in the game, limping around the mound, but wanted no part of an early exit.\n“I couldn’t feel my leg, to be honest with you,” Estrada said.\n“But I didn’t want to come out. Gibby came up to me and said, either you can or you can’t, so I said I can.”\nEstrada got the inning ending out on one pitch after being struck, a detail which helped him remain in the game.\n“Yeah, that definitely helped … I was able to come in and get it wrapped quickly, and stay on it,” Estrada said. “It hurt going up and down stairs but not out on the mound, so I was happy to stay in the game and give the team a few more innings.”\nHis teammates, meanwhile, floundered against Duffy, then ran into the Royals lights-out bullpen trio of Kelvin Hererra, Wade Davis and closer Greg Holland. That’s the best 7-through-9 inning combo in baseball, and one of several reasons the Royals — barring catastrophic setbacks — are going to the post season again this season.\nToronto remains a post-season threat in the American League East, but are clearly no match for the Royals at the moment.\nFriday’s loss marked the club’s seventh defeat in its last nine games; more importantly, the Jays have gone 10-15 since their 11-game winning streak came to a halt June 14.\nThe offence outscored opponents 114-105 over that 25-game stretch, but remains largely unable to win low-scoring games. With Friday’s two-run loss, the Jays have fallen to 13-29 in games decided by two runs or fewer.\nJays hitters, who have boarded 15 games with 10 or more runs this season, went 0-8 with runners in scoring position Friday.\nFriday’s loss also dropped Toronto below .500 (44-45) for the first time since June 8.\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays’ rotation will be balancing act\nRitual, relaxation take fresh face Muguruza to Wimbledon final: DiManno", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T15:23:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
