The other, lead plaintiff Wendy Wagner, is a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has consulted for the Administrative Conference of the United States.Some of the claims in the case were moot because two of the three plaintiffs had completed their federal contracts, the court said.Alan Morrison, a professor at George Washington University Law School who represented the plaintiffs, said he was disappointed with the ruling but declined to comment further.The   declined to comment on the ruling.The ruling comes at a time when the U.S. Supreme Court has pared back campaign finance restrictions.In 2010, the high court's ruling in the case Citizens United v.   cleared the way for unlimited independent spending by corporations and labor unions in federal elections. In 2014, the court lifted restrictions on the overall amount that donors can give to multiple candidates in a two-year federal election cycle.In a deviation from that trend, the court ruled in April that states can bar judicial candidates from soliciting campaign contributions.The case is Wagner v. FEC, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, No. 13-5162. \n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham) More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T01:20:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
