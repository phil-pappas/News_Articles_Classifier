This builds on the Bank's current tax programs in over 48 developing countries and the Fund's tax related technical assistance projects in over 120 countries. \nBy further leveraging their collective expertise, the Bank and Fund aim to play a fuller role in helping all of their member countries achieve the ambitious goals that the world will be setting for itself later this year in New York. \nBringing the voice and interests of developing countries, particularly those too small to play a role at the G-20 level, more fully into the debate on international tax policy issues is a key priority for the Bank and the Fund. The initiative will deepen the institutions' ongoing collaboration with developing countries to identify key international tax policy concerns and potential solutions, both at the country level and in the context of the continuing international dialogue. \nThe institutions also plan to strengthen their diagnostic tools, developing new methodologies where needed, to enable member countries to identify priority tax reforms and design the requisite support for their implementation. This effort would complement the launch of the Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool (TADAT) in November. \nThe Bank and the Fund will continue to work in close collaboration with other development partners, including the OECD, in expanding their work in the tax area. \nMedia Contacts: \nNicole Frost, World Bank (202) 415-6302 \nIsmaila Dieng, IMF (202) 623-9758 More on This", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T17:45:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
