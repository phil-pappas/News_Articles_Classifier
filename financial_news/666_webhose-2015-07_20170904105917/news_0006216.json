Angus Mordant Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell Local sharemarket investors experienced a testing week with a surprise 'no' result in the Greek referendum at the outset and the Chinese sharemarket crisis wreaking havoc throughout the remainder.\nA plummeting iron ore price and waning Aussie dollar also dragged the ASX down, with the dollar falling to a six-year low of US73.75c on Wednesday, before recovering in step with the local equity market towards the end of the week.\nOn Friday, local shares ended higher, buoyed by a strong rally in Chinese equities and rising hopes Greece will finally reach a debt bailout deal with its creditors at a eurozone summit on Sunday.\nThe All Ordinaries closed at 5478.1, up 0.4 per cent for the day, but down 0.9 per cent for the week, its third straight weekly loss. The ASX200 finished the week on 5492 points, up by 0.4 per cent for the day, but down 0.8 per cent for the week, belying the bumpy ride endured by investors.\nAustralian equities plunged on Monday as the first major market to open after the Greek referendum, but recovered on Tuesday as global market fears of contagion abated and negotiations recommenced between Greece and its creditors.\nBut Australian equities came crashing back down on Wednesday as Chinese share markets plummeted so dramatically that trading was halted in almost half of all listed companies, which was just one of a flurry of measures authorities introduced to restore confidence.\nAustralian equities plunged alongside the Chinese, which also pushed the iron ore price and dollar down, causing further drops. The ASX200 lost 2 per cent on Wednesday, led down by the mining industry.\nBut shares climbed again on Thursday following a rebound in Chinese markets as the measures showed some positive results. The climbing values were spurred on by strong employment data leading the ASX200 and All Ordinaries to close the gap back to Monday's values.\n Fidelity's Australian equities investment lead Kate Howitt said Australia's equity sell-off and rapid recovery were part of the increased volatility Australia's mining-heavy equities market will grapple with for years to come.\n\"The economic backdrop, both for Australia and the wider world, hasn't been robust,\" Ms Howitt said.\n\"We're in a seasonally volatile part of the year as it is summer across the northern hemisphere, and it's especially so, as we know the US Fed is thinking about when they're going to raise interest rates, so markets are jittery and this week showed how far and fast that look.\"\nOn Friday, Rio Tinto closed at $52.07, up 2.3 per cent on the day but down 0.8 per cent for the week. BHP Billiton led the recovery on Friday to close at $26.65, up 3 per cent on the day and 0.2 per cent higher for the week. Both stocks have been heavily sold off over the past four weeks, in line with a plunge in the price of iron ore.\nThe iron ore price shed more than 30 per cent in a fortnight and an alarming 10 per cent to $US44.79 on Wednesday alone, before recovering to $US48.99 per tonne on Thursday night.\nFortescue Metals Group closed at $1.81 on Friday, down 0.27 for the week and 21.07 per cent over the past four weeks.\nMs Howitt said the Australian equity market would continue to have significant volatility on Chinese and Australian data, led by the mining companies, which would always be exposed to concerns about slow-downs in Chinese and global growth.\n\"There are plenty of stocks in our market that are running their own race that will keep moving, but you'd want to design a portfolio that is less sensitive to global economic issues while Greece and China loom.\"\nThe only industry to finish the week up was telecommunications, up by 1.12 per cent, followed by health which finished flat. The latter was led by Mayne Pharma Group, which grew by 9.2 per cent, more than any other company this week.\nThe worst performing companies in the ASX200 this week were Paladin Energy that lost 20 per cent, BlueScope Steel that was down by 12.8 per cent and law firm Slater & Gordon, down 10.9 per cent.\nThe big banks ended the week with mixed results. ANZ Banking Group closed down by 1.6 per cent at $32.25; the Commonwealth Bank was down 1 per cent for the week at 85.79; the National Australia Banking Group finished on $33.07, down by 1.9 per cent while Westpac finished up 1.04 per cent at $33.10.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/greece_details_hype/index.html", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/shanghai_short_hype/index.html", "https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://twitter.com/rosepowell"], "published": "2015-07-10T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:03:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
