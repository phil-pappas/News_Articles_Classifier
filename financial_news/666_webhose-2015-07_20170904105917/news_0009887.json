They brought the total number of licences granted under the round to 175, making it one of the largest in the last 50 years. \nBritain's North Sea is one of the world's most mature and therefore costly areas to explore for oil and gas. The high number of licences issued shows the government is trying to attract as much exploration activity as possible to help dampen a rapid decline in North Sea production. \n\"Licences are just a start, and industry, government and the OGA now need to work together to revitalise exploration activity across the basin and convert licences into successful exploration wells,\" said OGA Chief Executive Andy Samuel. \nItalian oil company ENI (NYSE: E - news ) was awarded three licences, covering 23 blocks, while Shell received one licence to explore 10 blocks, government data showed.
