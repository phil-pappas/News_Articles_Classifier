This year is shaping up to be an all-time record for Chinese investments in the U.S., say real estate services firms that track deals. \nBut with the recent stock market crash in mainland China, high-net-worth family investment money \"seems to be pulling back,\" says Brian Ward, president of capital markets and investment services at Colliers International ( CIGI ). \nMany had been buying homes as well as commercial properties. Taking up the slack are big institutional investors in China, and for commercial properties such as offices, hotels and multifamily housing. For them, he says it's \"full speed ahead. \n\"The big institutional money wasn't impacted as much by the correction on the Shanghai Composite because they traded on the Hong Kong exchange,\" he said. \nWard expects Chinese investments in U.S. commercial real estate to reach $10 to $12 billion this year, over double last year's tally. \n\"The Chinese are looking to diversify to hedge risk, so markets like the U.S. are very attractive to them,\" he said. \"But I don't think it's a run for the exit. It's a measured diversification strategy. \nMany Chinese family and institutional groups made \"tons of money\" over the last decade as the economy boomed and the stock markets rose, he says. \n\"Do you take some of your chips off the table and invest it elsewhere? That's what is happening. \nChinese institutional investors and big real estate firms active in the U.S. this year include Ping An Insurance, China Vanke, Sunshine Insurance Group, Greenland Group and Gaw Capital, Ward says. \nNew York remains the top choice in the U.S. for Chinese commercial real estate investments. Of over $2 billion in U.S. assets bought by Chinese investors in Q2, $1.64 billion was in Manhattan, new data from Real Capital Analytics show. \n\"So clearly it is a Manhattan story,\" said Jim Costello, senior vice president at RCA, in an email. \nChinese investments in the U.S. in Q2 were below the nearly $2.6 billion logged by RCA in Q1, when Beijing-based Anbang Insurance Group bought the iconic Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York from Hilton Worldwide Holdings ( HLT ) for a record-breaking $1.95 billion. \nBut the Q2 total was double that from a year earlier as nine Chinese deals closed in Manhattan, says RCA. Two of the bigger ones: the new 7 Bryant Park, bought by Bank of China; and the Merrill Lynch Financial Center, acquired by Anbang Insurance Group. They sold for $1,100 to $1,300 per square foot. \nIt's not just investment in existing or nearly constructed properties. Ping An and China Life Insurance, China's two largest insurance companies, are co-investing with Tishman Speyer Properties to develop the mixed-use Pier 4 project in Boston's Seaport District. \nShanghai-based Greenland Group is co-developing with Forest City Ratner the massive, long-delayed Atlantic Yards residential and mixed-use project in Brooklyn, N.Y., now rebranded Pacific Park. \nIn Manhattan, China Vanke has joined RFR Holding to jump-start a long-stalled development site at East 53rd Street. Plans call for a 61-story condo tower designed by star architect Norman Foster. \nWhile Manhattan remains hot, Chinese investors are fanning out from their usual favorite spots of New York and San Francisco â€” to Boston, Texas, Florida, Seattle, San Jose, Southern California, Hawaii and other secondary markets . \n\"Soon as you leave New York and San Francisco, yields go up,\" said Brian McAuliffe, executive managing director of the Americas at real estate services firm CBRE Group ( CBG ). He says yields can rise from 5% to a higher level of around 8% depending on asset class. \nChicago was No. 2 on RCA's list of China's U.S. investment hot spots. \n\"There are great yield opportunities now in the suburbs,\" Costello said, noting that deal volume for suburban offices in Q2 came in \"stronger than most sectors,\" up 37%. \nIn Q2, a big multifamily housing acquisition put Houston at No. 3 for Chinese investment in the U.S. \n\"That's a bit of a contrarian play, relative to how many others have viewed the market,\" Costello said. \"I think that's a smart play. Houston is down some, with energy, but people have been too negative about the oil price impact. \nThe U.S. was the top destination for global commercial real estate investment in the second quarter, according to a preliminary report from global real estate services company JLL ( JLL ), which noted a 30% rise in transaction volumes. \nWhy the U.S., now? \"The U.S. is considered a very stable and predictable real estate market that offers attractive yields,\" said McAuliffe. \nChinese investment in U.S. commercial real estate this year \"continues to show tremendous growth,\" he said. \"It gets back to the security of the investment in the U.S. \nTrophy hotels have been big draws this year. Besides the Waldorf Astoria, another high-profile Big Apple deal was Sunshine Insurance Group's pact to buy the luxury Baccarat Hotel from Starwood Capital Group for $230 million. \nWard expects the inflow from China to step up as the Chinese government reduces restrictions on outbound capital, to \"incentivize diversification and minimize risk. \n\"At the same time,\" he added, \"you've got all these investors in China with tons of capital trying to diversify risk.\" commercial real estate", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T04:55:12.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
