Share on twitter by Amanda Saunders Rio Tinto could overtake Brazilian giant Vale to become the world's biggest global producer in iron ore in the next one to two years.\nThe two are vying for the crown of biggest producer this year, with both expecting calendar 2015 production of 340 million tonnes.\nVale has held the crown since 1974.\nOn Thursday, Rio cut its full-year guidance to to 340 million tonnes, from \"approaching 350mt\".\nDeutsche Bank analyst Paul Young said \"the scene could be set for a change in the iron ore production leadership board\".\n\"Rio hit a new record run rate in the second quarter of 320mtpa and will obviously have to exceed this in the second half to hit its 340mt guidance.\"\n\"It is now running very close to Vale's production level and may overtake it for a year or two.\"\nHowever, on an equity basis, Vale is still dominant.\n Vale is cutting costs by replacing 25 to 30 million tonnes of unprofitable iron ore with cheaper production.\nHowever, Vale is sticking to its supply target of 340 million tonnes this calendar year, meaning the high-cost tonnes it is taking out the market will be replaced by lower-cost iron ore.\nRio will need to eat into stockpiled ore to hit its guidance for the year.\nThe drawdown in iron ore stocks in the quarter will help Rio's earnings and balance sheet, Deutsche said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mandaksaunders"], "published": "2015-07-17T09:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T05:07:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
