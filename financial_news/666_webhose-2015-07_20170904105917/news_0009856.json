Picture: BLOOMBERG Related articles ArcelorMittal SA first-half loss to widen Evraz poised to halve staff at Emalahleni Load shedding is squeezing the life out of SA’s factories SOUTH African steel production rose 2.3% year on year in June to an estimated 530,000 tons, according to the World Steel Association.\nThis was the first year-on-year increase so far this year and may herald a turnaround in the fortunes of the local steel industry, which has been battered by increased steel imports.\nSouth African steel production nonetheless fell 7.6% year on year in the first half of 2015 to 3.2-million tons as the industry battled with electricity supply disruptions and subdued domestic demand.\nThis is in part due to the government’s multi-billion rand infrastructure investment plans failing to gain traction, as investment in steel-intensive railway corridors such as links to Swaziland and the Waterberg coalfields, remain plans, and not projects.\nPoor domestic demand meant that Russia-owned Evraz Highveld Steel and Vanadium placed itself in voluntary business rescue in April 2015 after it suffered mounting losses. Its recent annual steel production was of the order of half a million tons.\nSteel accounts for 4.7% of total manufacturing production and is an important indicator of the overall health of the sector, as it feeds into other manufacturing sectors such as cars, fridges and other steel products.\nDemand in the rest of Africa is however on the rise as projects such as Mozambique’s railway line linking Tete and Nacala near completion. This and other rail and port expansions on the rest of the continent mean that the World Steel Association expects Africa to be the top-performing region in the world in terms of apparent steel use, with growth of 7.4% in 2015 to 40-million tons after an increase of 4.2% in 2014.\nThe strong growth in Africa compares with subdued growth in the rest of the world as global apparent steel use will increase by 0.5% to 1.544-billion tons in 2015 following growth of 0.6% in 2014.\nIn 2016, it is forecast that world steel demand will grow by 1.4%.\nThe poor first-half 2015 performance in South African steel production followed a 0.6% drop in 2014 to 7.21-million tons. This meant that in the first quarter of 2015, Egypt was Africa’s top producer. But after a 34.2% year-on-year plunge in Egyptian steel production in June, SA has regained its crown as Africa’s largest steel producer. Egypt’s steel production fell by 7.3% year on year in the first half of 2015 to 3.1-million tons. In 2014, Egypt only produced 6.485-million tons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T15:03:50.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
