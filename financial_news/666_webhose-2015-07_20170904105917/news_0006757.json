Tamara Voninski Share on twitter by Tess Ingram CuDeco's colourful founder Wayne McCrae has been driven from company by its three key Chinese investors.\nCuDeco revealed on Thursday evening the company's longstanding chairman had tentatively agreed to resign on Friday in order to ensure ongoing funding and appease the copper hopeful's three largest shareholders, who said they had lost faith in Mr McCrae.\nThe Chinese shareholders China Oceanwide International Investment, New Apex and Sinosteel together speak for more than 34 per cent of the company.\nCuDeco confirmed in a short statement on Friday that Mr McCrae would stand down from all of his positions on the board and be replaced by existing directors Peter Hutchison and David Taylor, who will step into the roles of interim managing director and interim chairman, respectively. The changes are effective as of close of business on Friday.\nA representative of Sinosteel, Jiang Yongmin, will join the board as a nonexecutive director. Oceanwide and Apex already have representatives on the board.\nMr McCrae was unavailable to comment.\nThe three major shareholders had issued a statement earlier on Friday morning confirming their desire to oust Mr McCrae as soon as possible and had requested a meeting to vote him off the board if he failed to resign.\n\"The major shareholders maintain their position that Mr Wayne McCrae should, in the interests of the company, resign as director by no later than the board meeting [Friday] as the major shareholders no longer have confidence in his ability to successfully manage the company's development,\" they said in a statement.\n CuDeco shares have been suspended from trading since the company's bid to raise funds through a share issue to Chinese investment group Focus Sun Holdings was rejected in late June by shareholders, forcing CuDeco to scramble to find an agreeable alternative.\nThe company was relying on the additional funding to complete the development of its Rocklands copper project in Queensland with just $16.2 million cash on hand at the end of the March quarter, and an expected spend of $11.1 million in the June quarter.\nCuDeco said on Friday the three major shareholders had offered to each provide a $1 million short term loan, which the company expected to sign an agreement for \"shortly\".\nOceanwide, Apex and Sinosteel said in the statement the funding would be provided \"in support of the company's continued operation\", having previously declared they held \"mutual concerns about the financial performance of CuDeco\".\nCudeco said Friday it would also seek to increase its loan facility to $US100 million ($137 million), which would provide an additional $US35 million of funding, and said its bank had indicated it would be prepared to consider this increase provided Oceanwide and Sinosteel send letters of support to the bank.\nOceanwide, Sinosteel and Apex said they hoped to work with the company to secure a longer term funding solution and believed Mr McCrae's resignation would \"also assist the process\".\nTheir statement also countered what they claimed to be \"material inaccuracies\" in the copper hopeful's market announcement on Thursday night. The major shareholders said the announcement implied binding agreements had been formed when negotiations remained underway.\nMr McCrae is well known within the industry for his colourful language and vibrant stories, including famously telling an event the company's copper deposit had such good drilling potential he felt like \"a dog with two dicks\".\nAustralian Mining Investments, a company Mr McCrae founded early last decade, was renamed Cudeco in 2006 and shot into the limelight soon after, due to the hype surrounding its Rocklands copper deposit in Queensland. Its shares traded as high as $7.11 in July 2006.\nShares in Cudeco are expected to resume trading on Monday, having last traded at $1.70 before they were halted in June.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TessIngram"], "published": "2015-07-24T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T20:03:31.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
