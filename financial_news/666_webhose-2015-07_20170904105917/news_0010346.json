Before the FOMC's statement was released, economists believed that the Fed might raise rates as soon as September. \nYet the FOMC's continued reference to a decision on interest rates as \"nearly balanced\", despite recent improvements in the jobs market, made analysts more sanguine on the prospects of a rate rise. \nFederal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen (Photo: REUTERS/Mike Theiler) \nThe Fed's committee of rate setters acknowledged recent gains in reducing unemployment, noting that there had been \"some further improvement\". \nNick Kounis, of ABN Amro, said that the Fed had left it \"to the data to decide\" on whether to raise rates in September or December. \nJanet Yellen, the Fed's chairman, has said that delaying a rise in interest rates would mean that the central bank could \"have to do so more rapidly\" if caught behind the curve . \nIn her biannual testimony before the Senate Committee on Banking this month, she said that if the economy progresses as expected, \"economic conditions would make it appropriate at some point this year to raise\" the Fed's key interest rate. \nJames Knightley, of ING, said: \"A couple more decent labour reports, the next of which is next week, would be enough to get a majority voting in favour of tighter monetary policy.\" He suggested that in the absence of other shocks, job gains of 200,000 a month over July and August, along with higher wage growth, could mean the Fed pulls the trigger on a hike in September. \nLloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) , told Bloomberg : \"I think it will be jarring when we see an interest rate hike because we haven't had one for some time.\" \nGoldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein (Photo: Adam Berry/Bloomberg News) \n\"And then I think people will get out the smelling salts, take a sniff, and recover. Because when we have that first hike, the Fed has already suggested that it will be very conservative at the trajectory of future hikes,” he said. \nMr Blankfein said: “It's a funny set of circumstances that makes interest rates so low while growth is embedded.\" \nHe added: \"That's because of the uncertainty that that growth is really, truly embedded. The Fed would rather take a risk by keeping rates too soft for longer, than take a risk giving up all that they've accomplished in getting the economy to where it is now.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:29:24.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
