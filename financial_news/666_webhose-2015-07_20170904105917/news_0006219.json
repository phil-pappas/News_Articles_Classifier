Bloomberg Share on twitter by Karen Maley Some blame Greece. Others point the finger at China – particularly the precipitous slide in its sharemarket. Whatever the reason, commodities have been crushed in the past week, with markets as diverse as oil, copper and iron ore moving firmly into bear territory.\nThe steep drop in the iron ore price, which fell below $US45 a tonne this week, has shone the spotlight on some of Australia's more vulnerable miners.\nInvestors are increasingly querying whether some smaller producers – which enjoyed a few months of respite when the iron ore price traded around $US60 a tonne – will be able to cut costs fast enough to compensate for the sharp decline in their revenues.\nThe pressure is all the greater given that there is little prospect that iron ore heavyweights such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto will cut their output in response to the lower iron ore price. These two mining giants have break-evens of slightly more than $US30 a tonne, and are still able to enjoy decent margins on their output even though iron ore prices have plunged to their lowest level in at least six years.\nNot to be outdone, copper – which is often dubbed Dr Copper due to its uncanny ability to predict where the global economy is heading – has slumped to its lowest level since the financial crisis.\nInvestors have become nervous about copper because of niggling fears about the outlook for the Chinese economy – which accounts for around 40 per cent of global copper demand.\nChina's economy has wobbled this year and moves by China's central bank to shore up growth by cutting interest rates and lowering the amount that banks must hold as reserves has made many traders worry that the outlook is grim. This has made investors nervous about the future demand for copper and other raw materials such as aluminium, lead and oil.\nAnxiety about China's growth outlook has also spilled over into the oil market, with the price of Brent crude – the international benchmark – dipping to around $US55 a barrel this week, around 20 per cent below its peak of $US69 in May.\n China has now overtaken the US as the largest importer of crude and refined oil products, which has made the oil price extremely sensitive to even slight fluctuations in Chinese demand.\nIn addition, the oil price has been weighed down by expectations that a nuclear deal with Iran is imminent, which could result in sanctions on Iranian crude exports being lifted. Some estimate that if sanctions are lifted, Iran could add up to 800,000 barrels of oil a day to the global market within a year.\nResilience of US shale an issue A further factor depressing the oil price is the seeming resilience of US shale oil producers. Even though oil prices have fallen sharply, the number of oil rigs drilling in the US has started to rise again, a sign that some shale companies are coping with lower revenues by slashing costs.\nBut beyond concerns about the damage that China's sharemarket rout (which has wiped trillions off the value of the value of the country's equity markets) will inflict on the country's economy, analysts argue that there is another reason why the sharp slide has proven so disastrous for commodity prices.\nThis has to do with the fact that in China commodities are often used as collateral for bank loans, and investors use the borrowed money to buy assets such as shares.\nAnalysts say that after the steep slides in the Chinese market, investors have had to scramble to meet margin calls on their loans. And with the shares of hundreds of companies suspended from trading, investors have had no choice but to liquidate holdings of commodities, such as copper, crude oil and even soybeans, to meet their lenders' demands.\nBut others argue that the slide in commodity prices points to the risk that deflationary forces are again about to be unleashed in Europe. To support their argument, they point to the failure of the gold price to react to the renewed political and economic turmoil in Greece.\nSome believe there is a high risk that Greece will default on its debts and be forced to leave the eurozone, which will saddle the European Union and the European Central Bank with losses totalling hundreds of billions of euros.\nMore than €200 ($296) billion of Greece's debt is held by eurozone countries and the European Central Bank. Further, the ECB has another €90 billion exposure as a result of the emergency funding it has provided for Greek banks.\nIf the ECB were to suffer losses on its exposure to Greece, or to the Greek banks, the central bank would take a big hit to its capital, which would severely limit its ability to lend to other European banks, which would have a deflationary effect.\nAnd if other eurozone countries are forced to write down the value of the loans they have provided to Greece, this could put pressure on countries such as Portugal and Spain to either cut spending or raise taxes to compensate for these losses. Again, this would be a deflationary development.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-07-10T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:07:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
