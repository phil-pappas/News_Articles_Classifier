Greece must deliver a detailed economic package to creditors on Thursday to win a new funding deal. Chancellor Angela Merkel is willing to let Greece go if Germany doesn’t consider its plans credible, said two officials familiar with her strategy.\n“Markets appear more optimistic than most of the Greek creditors themselves,” Benjamin Schroeder, a Frankfurt-based interest-rate strategist at Commerzbank AG, wrote in a note to clients.\nThe yield spread between 10-year Italian and German bonds tightened six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 149 basis points as of 11:07 a.m. London time. The difference widened to as much as 199 basis points on June 29, the first trading day after Greece called a referendum on austerity. In 2011, the spread reached 575 basis points. The spread between Spanish debt and bunds was 149 basis points.\nPacific Investment Management Co. Chief Executive Officer Douglas Hodge said he was hopeful of an agreement can be reached. The reaction in markets to the Greece’s funding woes has been “relatively small” even as time runs out, he said.\nChina Rebound German bunds fell with Treasuries as demand for haven assets waned after a rebound in Chinese stocks and oil prices. Germany’s 10-year yield rose two basis points to 0.69 percent.\n“While the outlook for spreads appears digitally dependent on the outcome for Greece, core valuations also have an eye on the developments in Chinese equities and the commodities markets,” Commerzbank’s Schroeder said.\nBackstopping the bonds of peripheral nations is speculation that the European Central Bank will boost monetary stimulus if spreads widen. And next week, investors will also get back 16 billion euros from redemptions in Italian bonds. That’s another prop for the nation’s bonds, Commerzbank’s Schroeder said.\n“We are slightly surprised by the poor performance from the German curve,” Peter Chatwell, a fixed-income strategist at Mizuho International Plc, wrote in a note to clients. “This could be a result of the market’s gloom leading it to factor in more PSPP,” he said referring to the ECB’s bond-buying program. It “will flatten the German curve at the long end while tightening sovereign spreads.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T13:30:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
