Source: Supplied\nGovernment Property NSW chief executive Brett Newman said the six homes were released at once to take advantage of strong market conditions. Since launching the sell-off more than a year ago, the NSW Government has sold 23 former public houses, with most selling between $1.6 million and $2.5 million.\nCombined, the sales have totalled more than $50 million.\n84 Kent St, Millers Point. Properties nearby have sold in the region of $1.9 million. Source: Supplied\nThe terrace comprises four grand brick and stucco terraces built on land purchased in 1867.

Source: Supplied\n“It’s the first time six Millers Point properties have been listed and sold concurrently, reflecting strong market confidence,” Mr Newman said. Proceeds from the auctions will be reinvested into 1500 new social housing dwellings in other parts of Sydney and regional NSW.\nRaine and Horne Double Bay is marketing the six properties and selling agent Jeremy Clinton said they would most likely appeal to owner-occupiers looking for an alternative to inner city apartments.\n22 Trinity Ave, Millers Point was built circa 1898. Source: Supplied\n“Most of the interest in these homes is coming from downsizers who want to renovate the properties and live there. Investors haven’t been as interested,” Mr Clinton said. He added that some of the homes require more renovations than others, but all are being sold with a Conservation Management Plan endorsed by the Heritage Council to guide restoration and repair work.\n20 Trinity Ave, Millers Point is going to auction August 25.
