I left permanently, and as I would like to return I would like to know if I am blacklisted. Can you tell me please? SM, India \nSomeone is usually only blacklisted if they absconded – or left without giving their employer notice – and did not properly cancel a visa or if there is a criminal case against them. SM has not told me about the circumstances of his departure, so this could make a difference to his ability to return. If he did not abscond and his previous employer did not file a case against him, then any ban should have expired by now. The only way of being sure is to contact the Ministry of Labour or Immigration Department for confirmation. This column is unable to assist with these types of queries. Information should be available by telephone. In Abu Dhabi, the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs can be contacted at (02) 402 4500 or through its website, www.adnrd.ae.
