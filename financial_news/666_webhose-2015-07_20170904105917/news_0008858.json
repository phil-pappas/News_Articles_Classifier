Daniel Munoz Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Sally Rose Heading into one of the toughest periods in decades for superannuation returns, those entrusted to manage our retirement savings are under added pressure to reduce costs and ensure the tax office is not getting more than its fair share.\n\" The investment outlook is the worst it has been in over 30 years so we need to find other ways to protect members' returns. A mindset of being careful to watch every cent is really essential,\" Qantas super chief investment officer Andrew Spence said.\nOver the past three years, Mr Spence has overhauled the way the $7.1 billion fund runs its equities trading strategy by implementing a tax-managed centralised portfolio management platform.\nThe project has involved taking responsibility for executing trades away from the fund managers who are paid to make the investment decisions, and pooling that task with execution specialists.\nLast year Mr Spence told the annual Conference of Major Super Funds that the new process had saved members in Qantas super's default growth option 38.3 basis points, or $23.6 million, in the 12 months to June 30, 2014.\nAbout 80 per cent of the savings came from centralised tax management, with the rest of the gains mostly from reduced brokerage fees and foreign exchange losses.\n\"We have delivered this extra wealth with very little change to our investment strategy, which challenges the prevailing wisdom that funds have to take on extra risk to generate better returns.\"\nOn average the cost of implementing trades in the equities portfolio has been \"more than halved\". Now the fund is starting the process of centralising the execution management of its fixed interest portfolio.\n Scale Mr Spence said since presenting on the initiative at a handful of industry events over the past year he has received a few enquiries from rival investment chiefs wanting to know more, but the most calls have come from directors of other funds.\n\"Most of the feedback has been from trustees keen to understand what the super funds they sit on the board of could be doing to achieve better trading efficiencies and after tax returns.\"\nA fund doesn't have to be large to go down this path, Mr Spence said.\n\"Even a $2 billion fund can do it, in fact it is a great way to achieve scale.\"\nAn Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ruling took effect just over two years ago placing an official obligation on super funds to focus on after-tax returns.\n\" I don't think the average super fund member really understands the impact of tax on their balance over time , but it is our responsibility to worry about it for them. In the next few years I think there will be a lot more scrutiny on how funds manage this obligation.\"\nLegitimate methods of reducing tax leakage that super funds have been urged to focus on include deferring tax losses, timing capital gains, and managing franking credits.\nQantas super has implemented its tax-managed centralised portfolio management platform working with two key third-party service providers: Parametric Australia and Russell Implementation Services. The fund is â€‹only open to Qantas employees and their immediate families.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/sallymrose", "https://plus.google.com/115164720240377561218/about?hl=en", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/superannuation-alert-1-million-isnt-enough-to-retire-in-comfort-20150419-1modsc"], "published": "2015-07-27T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T11:09:46.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
