That means holding a budgetary position that is sound and gives the country solidity; and the second leg is that of the lenders, which entails supplying finacing and restructuring the debt to ease its burden,\" she said.\nLagarde also reaffirmed her view that the country needed some form of debt relief, arguing that this did not have to be an outright write-off but could involve measures such as a significant extension of loan maturities, stretching of repayment schedules, and reducing interests charged.\nLagarde also said she considered it \"probable\" that Greek banks will be able to open as planned on Monday.
