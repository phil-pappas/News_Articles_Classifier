Photo: Bloomberg\nChina's epic ploy to convince the world its stock market is safe is no match for the Huang Guangyu caper.\nSkepticism greeted news this week that the billionaire and one-time richest man of China had somehow pulled off a deal to consolidate control of Gome, the electronics retailer he founded in 1987.\nShares plunged as Huang boosted his stake to as high as 55.3 per cent after Gome announced plans to buy another company he owns.\nThe problem? Huang is in a Chinese prison until 2024 for bribery.\nAdvertisement That the cost is too high and the logic murky are side issues.\nThe real question is how a convict can seal a billion-dollar-plus corporate deal from behind bars without drawing the scrutiny of regulators?\nThis bizarre tale speaks volumes about why investors are fast losing confidence in China's stock market.\nShanghai shares fell 1.7 per cent in volatile trading on Tuesday, extending the biggest one-day loss since 2007.\nThe world is fixated on China's macro story: worsening fundamentals made the 68 per cent surge in Shanghai over the last 12 months look completely unsustainable.\nGrowth is slowing, debt risks are soaring and deflation is looming.\nAs investors flee, Beijing has launched a series of measures to stem the rout - cutting interest rates, ordering state companies to buy shares, banning short selling and letting punters put up their homes as collateral for margin trading.\nYet President Xi Jinping is expending little energy strengthening the market itself or the unpredictable companies listed on it.\nWhat China needs Huang's gambit highlights the cracks in China's microeconomy.\nRather than pumping ever more air into China's asset bubble, Xi should be empowering regulators to clamp down on corporate malfeasance.\nChina's corporate sector needs much greater transparency, random audits on even the biggest state-run enterprises, whistleblower hotlines, mandated compliance training, codes of conduct for due diligence among executives, a better credit-rating system, a freer press to police businesses, an independent enforcement team with subpoena powers and a legal framework to punish bad behaviour.\nSo far, 2015 has instead been a dismal year for Chinese corporate governance.\nIn May, Hanergy Thin Film Power Group lost a breathtaking $US19 billion ($24 billion) in 24 minutes after its CEO failed to attend a shareholder meeting. That same month, Pan Sutong's Goldin Financial and Goldin Properties lost a combined $US21 billion, about half their market value, in a couple of days for no obvious reason.\nConfusion also reigned at Kaisa, the first Chinese developer to default on dollar bonds, amid accusations of incomplete financial reports and weak governance (the Shenzhen company also was delisted).\nBack in April, as Kaisa's missed payments were rocking markets, analyst Raymond Chia of Schroder Investment Management crystallised the problem: \"A recently successful company has defaulted. This can happen anywhere, anytime, when it comes to China.\"\nThe picture grows more ominous when one considers the record number of Chinese companies leaving US exchanges to list on the mainland for higher valuations.\nAs of early July, at least 25 significant names were eyeing a move, including Internet security provider Qihoo 360 Technology and data-centre operator 21Vianet Group. Even Baidu, China's Google, says it's interested in returning to mainland bourses.\nFree to fudge These shifts will make it harder for investors to assess risks and proper valuations for Chinese companies.\nExecutives would be free from filing quarterly financial results -- and even freer to fudge balance sheets or muddy their roles in companies. Gome's statement on Huang's jailhouse deal, for example, refers to him as \"Mr Wong,\" his Cantonese name that's less known.\nThe stakes have never been higher in gauging risks in China, which high-profile fund manager Bill Gross dubbed the \"mystery meat\" of emerging markets. And yet Beijing is failing in its own fiduciary responsibility to create a more sustainable economy.\n\"Improvements in corporate governance, the financial regulatory framework, and legal reforms that underpin a market-oriented system are all essential for productive investment,\" says Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.\nNone of these ingredients currently exists, making Beijing's aggressive attempts to support stocks futile, at best.\nThe government may have the power to stabilise the market in the short run.\nBut if Xi doesn't change the kind of corporate behaviour so graphically on display this year -- even by those locked away in a prison cell -- he's courting even more uncertainty and selling pressure in the future.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T13:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T14:46:46.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
