In the past year, inflation has steadily tapered, the fiscal deficit has been reduced, domestic demand has seen an uptick and the external value of the Indian rupee has stabilized. The first quarter of 2015 started on a steady note, attracting US$2.8 billion across 130 deals, representing the best performing quarter since 2011. 1 \n2 (the “Act”) became law on May 14, 2015 after receiving the President’s assent. While this first, complete fiscal bill of the Narendra Modi government evidences the pro-investment proclivity of the administration, it falls short of removing tax uncertainties that continue to temper foreign investor appetite and affect private equity fund structures and deal terms. Below is an overview of some of the key reforms introduced by the Act, as pertinent to GPs and LPs in Indian private equity funds. “MAT”) \nen concerned with the recent assertion by the Indian revenue authorities that a Minimum Alternate Tax (“MAT”) should be levied on their activities. The concept of MAT in Indian tax law has historically been used to tax profitable Indian companies that avoided tax by using exclusions, deductions and incentives. MAT is levied on the book profits of a company, when the overall tax paid is less than 18.5% of the book profits. An overwhelming consensus of Indian tax advisors suggests that MAT should not apply to foreign companies that do not prepare their accounts in accordance with Indian corporate law (i.e., foreign companies not having a place of business in India). \n“FPIs”), for the following streams of income: (i) all capital gains from transfer of marketable securities and (ii) interest, royalty and fees for technical services accruing to a foreign company. The government has also clarified that private equity funds in treaty jurisdictions such as Mauritius and Singapore fall outside the ambit of MAT. \n“ITA”), capital gains are taxed based on the source of the gains. The indirect transfer tax provisions, which were introduced in the Finance Act, 2012 by way of Explanation 5 to Section 9(1)(i) of the ITA, expand the existing source rules for capital gains by “clarifying” that an offshore capital asset would be considered to have a situs in India if it substantially derived its value (directly or indirectly) from assets situated in India. \ness than 5% in the company will not be subject to the tax. However, these indirect transfer provisions remain on the books. Thus, despite rhetoric from the administration that notices assessing taxes based upon these provisions should be avoided, their codification in the ITA spells continuing uncertainty for foreign investors. ’s corpus; nd their connected persons must be less than 50% of the fund; \n’s length basis. \n“non-resident” in India unless wholly controlled and managed from India. Accordingly, the income of such offshore companies was not taxable in India, unless distributed to an Indian resident shareholder. The Act codifies certain changes to the corporate residence test that could potentially bring several offshore entities within the Indian tax net. The higher threshold for qualifying as a non-resident could be a cause of concern for private equity investors. \n“POEM”), taking the relevant financial year as a whole into consideration. POEM has been defined to mean “a place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the business of an entity as a whole are, in substance made.” \n’s worldwide income. “GAAR”) \n’s threatened General Anti Avoidance Rules (“GAAR”) will be shelved for good, the Act defers GAAR by another two years. Once implemented, GAAR will apply only prospectively to investments made on or after April 1, 2017. Investments made prior to April 1, 2017 will be grandfathered, providing relief to managers already invested in India. \nll tax treaties and to disregard, look through, or re-characterize business arrangements that are deemed to be impermissible avoidance arrangements. The Indian government has not yet issued promised guidelines to explain the implementation of GAAR. \n“AIFs”) registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) and provides that foreign investment will be allowed into AIFs. The special tax regime provides for a tax pass through to the specified AIFs in respect of all income other than business income. Business income of the AIFs is taxable at the level of the AIFs at the applicable rates and is exempt in the hands of the unit holders. Trusts \n“REITs”) and Infrastructure Investment Trusts (“InvITs”) was introduced last year, and while investor interest in these instruments remains high, they have yet to be utilized due to absence of clarity around the tax incidence associated with these vehicles. \n“SPV”) is now extended to rental income earned in respect of property directly held by the REIT. Further, a concessional capital gains tax regime will be available to sponsors of REITs who acquire units through a swap of SPV shares, subject to levy of a securities transaction tax. \n“SARFAESI Act”) provides certain measures for recovery of non-performing assets. Non-banking financial companies (“NBFCs”) that (i) are registered with the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) and (ii) have an asset size of INR 5 billion shall now be entitled to SARFAESI protection, enabling them to expeditiously enforce security interests without court intervention. Furthermore, assets of eligible NBFCs can now be sold to asset reconstruction or securitization companies. Additionally, eligible NBFCs are now able to acquire security receipts issued by an asset reconstruction company or a securitization company. \n’s corporate tax rate of 30% (excluding surcharge and education cess) is one of the highest in the Asia-Pacific region. The government has signaled a gradual reduction of the corporate tax rate to 25% over a period of four years from 2016. \n\"GST\"), subsuming most indirect taxes. GST is expected to rationalize India’s indirect tax regime and reduce the cascading effect of multiple taxes (including, inter alia, customs duties and service taxes) and also reduce administrative costs of compliance in relation to multiple taxes. The government expects to roll out GST with effect from April 1, 2016. It is anticipated that the implementation of GST will have profound effects for inter-state commerce and development of India’s supply chain infrastructure, and will enhance cost efficiencies for business operations. * *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T05:35:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
