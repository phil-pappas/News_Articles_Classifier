Toshiba President Hisao Tanaka resigned on Tuesday, telling reporters that the company will take seriously a third-party panel’s findings that executives were involved in systematic overstating of profit.\n“Raising money based on false information is fraudulent,” said Etsuro Kuronuma, a professor at Waseda Law School. “Toshiba violated the interests protected by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.”\nToshiba said it will correct at least 152 billion yen of pretax profit, based on accounting statements stretching back to the year ended March 2009. The panel’s investigation found that top executives set unrealistic earnings targets, leading to the flawed financial reporting.\n“Toshiba raised money knowing that investors were making decisions based on improper financial statements, which is deceitful,” said Mitsushige Akino, executive officer at Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Market participants feel resentment toward Toshiba.”\nJapan’s Financial Services Agency hasn’t alleged any wrongdoing by Toshiba or its management.\nApology Bow After bowing in apology at a press conference, Tanaka said the company takes seriously the possibility that investors were misled, while adding that he didn’t directly order inappropriate accounting. Hirokazu Tsukimoto, a spokesman for Toshiba in Tokyo, declined to comment on any penalties stemming from the misstatements.\nToshiba’s shares have tumbled and its bond risk has jumped since May, when the maker of personal computers and nuclear reactors withdrew earnings forecasts, canceled its year-end dividend and widened the internal accounting probe beyond estimates used on infrastructure projects to include the whole company.\nTakuji Yano, a spokesman for the FSA, declined to comment on whether the agency will take action against Toshiba. Financial Services Minister Taro Aso said on Tuesday that the matter was “extremely regrettable.”\nUnder Japanese law, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission can recommend that the FSA impose fines against a company that sold securities based on a material misstatement. For stock offerings, the fine can total 4.5 percent of the amount issued and for bonds it can reach 2.25 percent, according to article 172-2 of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act .\nNikko Cordial That would put Toshiba at risk of being fined as much as 30 billion yen, according to Bloomberg calculations corroborated by Kuronuma. A charge of that size would be the biggest in Japan for misstating earnings, overtaking the 1.6 billion yen imposed on machinery maker IHI Corp. in 2008.\nThe FSA fined Nikko Cordial Corp. 500 million yen in 2007 after it inflated profit and later sold 50 billion yen of bonds. The brokerage, the predecessor of SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., said at the time that it was restating earnings because “inappropriate accounting” led to errors.\nSeparate provisions in the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act carry criminal penalties for false financial reporting. People who submit false financial statements may face as long as 10 years in prison or maximum fines of 10 million yen. Companies can be fined as much as 700 million yen.\nNo Charges “Criminal charges, civil liability and administrative fines are all possible,” said Tatsuo Uemura, who teaches law at Waseda University in Tokyo. “I suspect that what Toshiba did was window dressing, which goes beyond just inadequate accounting.”\nNo criminal charges have been brought against Toshiba or its employees. Toshiba’s Tsukimoto said any pursuit of a criminal case is up to Japanese authorities and he declined to comment further.\nNomura Holdings Inc., which was among arrangers of the bond and stock sales for Toshiba, declined to comment. Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC, the manufacturer’s auditor, will examine the third-party report, assign more accountants and audit the revised earnings, said spokesman Hiroyuki Sato.\n‘Padding’ Profit Toshiba commissioned the committee’s investigation in May. The four-member panel of lawyers and accountants found “organized involvement including top executives,” and said the chipmaker’s improper accounting was conducted for the purpose of “padding” profit.\nShares of Toshiba rose 1.1 percent to 404.2 yen in Tokyo morning trading on Wednesday, remaining higher than the 333 yen price it offered new stock to investors in 2009. The shares have dropped 21 percent this year, compared with an 18 percent gain in the benchmark Topix index.\nThe cost to insure Toshiba’s debt has doubled since the end of April to 105 basis points, credit-default swap data from CMA show.\nStandard & Poor’s put Toshiba’s BBB long-term credit rating on a watch for possible downgrade on Tuesday, citing the impact of the earnings revisions on its cash flow and leverage.", "external_links": ["http://www.fsa.go.jp/common/law/fie01.pdf\\", "http://www.waseda.jp/top/en\\"], "published": "2015-07-22T11:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T07:03:22.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
