They will be “ glued to zero ” to prevent recession and “policy mistakes” (e.g. 1937) and offset worsening demographics, at least until the “dread risk” of debt deflation fades, and a capex boom in the west begins. And we believe the combination of such extreme monetary policies and (crucially) a gradual economic recovery means that Greece, China & Puerto Rico should be viewed as isolated “black sheep” rather than contagious “black swans.\" \nThe term \"black swan\" was coined by scholar and statistician Nassim Taleb in his 2007 book of the same name . It is meant to describe an event or occurrence that is so remote that it is completely unforeseen. Black swans are contagious, like the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, which had an immediate effect on the rest of the banking system. \n\"Black sheep\" by contrast are big market-moving events that are are not likely to spill over to the rest of the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T18:43:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
