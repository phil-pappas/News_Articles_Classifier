The government also downgraded its reading on April and May job growth.\nWhile the downbeat report gave investors little to cheer about, it was not gloomy enough to compel them to tweak their expectations for the timing of the Fed’s tightening.\n“We do not think that the report will significantly shift opinion within the Fed about timing of the first rate hike, which we continue to expect in September,” strategists at Barclays wrote in a note.\nCaution also reigned ahead of Greece’s Sunday referendum on an international bailout deal that could ultimately determine whether it stays or not in the euro zone.\nThe International Monetary Fund warned on Thursday that Greece would need an extension of its European Union loans and a potentially a large debt writeoff if it cannot implement economic reforms and its growth slows.\n“Investors will probably look to JPY as a risk-hedge going into the referendum,” Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX strategy at Citi, said in a note to clients.\nFirst Published on July 3, 2015 8:24 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T09:12:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
