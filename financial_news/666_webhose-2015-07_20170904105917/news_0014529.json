But SABIC shares came well off their early high of SR102.75 and the main Tadawul All-Share Index fell 0.8 percent to 9302 points as most banking stocks and other blue chips dropped. The Kingdom's biggest lender National Commercial Bank fell 1.5 percent. \nSaudi Arabian Mining Co. (Maaden) lost 1.3 percent after the price of one of its products copper fell to a six-year low as Chinese manufacturing contracted by the most in 15 months in July. \nSahara Petrochemical Co. dropped 2.3 percent having reported a 94 percent decrease in second-quarter profit. \nBanque Saudi Fransi fell 2.6 percent as its shares no longer carried a semiannual dividend. Herfy Food was down 1.0 percent for the same reason. \nDubai's index fell 1.3 percent to 4148 points as all but a handful of stocks declined. Lender Emirates NBD down 2.3 percent was one of the main drags on the benchmark. It had risen 10.4 percent last week on strong second-quarter results. \nAmlak Finance which had gained about 150 percent since the stock resumed trading in early June dropped 3.6 percent. Many institutional investors believe the stock's dramatic rise was fueled by speculation and it is overvalued by commonly used metrics. \nNational Central Cooling Co. (Tabreed) was one of just a few gainers climbing 0.7 percent after posting a 2 percent increase in second-quarter profit. \nAbu Dhabi's market slipped 0.4 percent to 4881 points and Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA) whose earnings are sensitive to oil prices tumbled 4.2 percent. Another energy firm Dana Gas fell 5.1 percent. \nQatar's index edged down 0.3 percent to 11909 points and heavyweight Ezdan Holding was the main drag sliding 1.1 percent ahead of its second-quarter earnings announcement. After trading closed the firm which has interests in real estate finance and other industries reported a 30 percent rise in second-quarter net profit. \nEgypt's market gave up early gains and closed 1.0 percent lower at 8005 points with most stocks in the red. \n\"I think it's just profit-booking in some property names and banks\" said Harshjit Oza analyst at the Cairo-based Naeem brokerage. \nAlso Palm Hills Development tumbled 6.2 percent ahead of the addition of new shares placed through a rights issue which will dilute the existing stock.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T13:35:14.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
