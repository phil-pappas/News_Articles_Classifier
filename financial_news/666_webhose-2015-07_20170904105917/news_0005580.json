The central bank on 9 July announced it would maintain interest rates at 0.5% and the asset purchase programme at Â£375bn following a two-day meeting. \nInvestors will be interested to see how many Monetary Policy Committee members voted in favour of the move when the minutes of the meeting are released. \nAhead of the minutes, Governor Mark Carney reportedly indicated that interest rates could rise at the turn of this year. \n\"Short term interest rates have averaged around 4.5% since around the Bank's inception three centuries ago,\" he said in a speech at Lincoln Cathedral last Thursday. \n\"It would not seem unreasonable to me to expect that once normalisation begins, interest rate increases would proceed slowly and rise to a level in the medium term that is perhaps about half as high as historic averages.\" However, Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club , argued that the speech was misconstrued. The EY Item Club in its quarterly predicts interest rates are unlikely to rise until autumn 2016. The economic forecasters see interest rates rising 1% by the end of 2016 and climbing 1.75% in 2017. \nUS housing data A report on US existing home sales is expected to show a 0.9% gain in June to 5.40m units when it is released in afternoon trading. \nThe house price index is projected to rise 0.4% in May compared to 0.3% a month earlier. \nCompany results ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) reports its second quarter with Numis predicting in-line results and full-year guidance maintained. Consensus forecast is for earnings per share of 7.5p, up from the previous year's 5.4p. Revenue is pegged at $356m, an increase from $310m the year before, driven by demand for its chips for smartphones in China and stronger royalties per device at Samsung. \nA batch of trading statements will be also released from Easyjet (Other OTC: ESYJY - news ) , Euromoney, Fenner (LSE: FENR.L - news ) , Johnson Matthey (LSE: JMAT.L - news ) and Sage Group (LSE: SGE.L - news ) . \nWednesday 22 July INTERIMS 32Red, ARM Holdings, Entu (UK) , Morgan Advanced Materials , PJSC Magnit GDR (REG S), Staffline Group (LSE: STAF.L - news ) QUARTERLY PAYMENT DATE Assura INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ANNOUNCEMENTS Crude Oil Inventories (US) (15:30) Existing Home Sales (US) (15:00) House Price Index (US) (15:00) MBA Mortgage Applications (US) (12:00) Q2 ARM Holdings GMS (Taiwan OTC: 6481.TWO - news ) Torotrak FINALS Great Eastern Energy Corp Ltd.
