Most of these investors and analysts don’t publish their own personal track records so there’s no good way to tell how talented they really are at picking stocks. Imagine a platform where every stock pick is tracked so actual stock picking prowess can be measured and ranked against other users. investFeed has just created that system.\ninvestFeed - the new social media platform that is equal parts Twitter and brokerage trading account - has developed a system that gathers quantifiable trading data and uses it to build a performance stats tracker into every user profile. It then uses the data it has collected to assign an overall ranking to each user. It gives other users (affectionately referred to as “feeders”) and potential subscribers the transparency they covet in order to make the best decisions possible for their own investment portfolios.\nHere’s how it works.\nThe investFeed algorithm captures all of the data that you’d expect - stock posts, bullish and bearish prices, etc. - but also takes into account the user’s level of conviction (referred to as “sentiment”) in the stock post that’s being made. Successful stock picks that are made with greater conviction are given a heavier weight than those made with less conviction. Also considered is the time frame of the post. A stock pick that earns 5% within a few trading days would be ranked higher than a stock pick that takes a year to earn 5%. All of this is compiled and analyzed in order to create a ranking for every user.\ninvestFeed has already been capturing mainstream attention throughout the financial services industry by offering users a unique way to turn their own Wall Street expertise into a monthly income stream. Now, it further sets itself apart by offering investors a cutting edge tool that allows them to see exactly how well individuals are able to make investment choices.\nUsers who offer their own “premium” feed on the site (where they provide exclusive content to paying subscribers) can now use investFeed’s measurable track record and ranking as a selling point. Individuals looking for guidance for their own portfolios can now gain an extra measure of confidence by being able to see the actual track record of other investors and traders. It’s a true step forward for beginning and sophisticated market professionals alike.\nWhile the investFeed social network is close to wrapping up its beta testing phase it has already garnered over 140,000 followers on Twitter.
