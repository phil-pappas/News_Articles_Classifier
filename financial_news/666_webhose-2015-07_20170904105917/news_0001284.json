He told analysts he was \"spending more time on the road to make sure that we truly understand what's going on in these individual businesses.\" \nThe lowered outlook is a setback for Hayes, the company's former finance chief. Since taking over as CEO in late November, the company cut its profit forecasts in January and June. \nOne analyst described the repeated cuts as \"water torture\" on the conference call. \nThe company's shares are down 11 percent for the year to date, against a nearly 3 percent increase for the S&P 500 index (.SPX). The shares have underperformed those of rivals General Electric Co (GE.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N). \nSterne Agee analyst Peter Arment said investors were particularly caught off guard with the forecast for UTC Aerospace Systems (UTAS), for which the company expects to see about $300 million less in profit before tax this year than it did in March. \n\"That was not priced into the stock,\" Arment said of the aerospace outlook cut. \"Clearly, they need to transform some of the businesses so they can get back to growing.\" \nFor Otis, United Tech dimmed its view of new equipment sales in China and for service revenue in Europe, cutting its profit forecast for the business by $200 million this year. \n\"We just got way too aggressive on the aftermarket at UTAS, and the European recovery, and it hasn't happened,\" Hayes said. \"It all ultimately falls on me.\" \n(Additional reporting by David Gaffen in New York; Editing by Bill Rigby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T01:55:13.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
