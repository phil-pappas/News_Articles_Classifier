In return, sanctions that have slashed the oil exports of OPEC's fifth-largest producer will be lifted and billions of dollars in frozen assets unblocked. \nThe Islamic republic's exports could reach a potential 2.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2016, from 1.6 million bpd in 2014, according to data from economist Charles Robertson at investment bank Renaissance Capital. \nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries -- whose 12 members including Iran pump one third of global oil -- is mindful that Iranian oil could worsen a global supply glut and depress oil prices further. \nOPEC decided at its last meeting in Vienna in June to maintain output levels, extending its Saudi-backed strategy to preserve market share and fend off competition from booming US shale. \nOil prices sank last week, hit by the Iran nuclear deal and the strong dollar, raising jitters among some OPEC members who next meet on December 4. \nLondon Brent oil slid to about $56 per barrel and New York's West Texas Intermediate dropped to around $52 a barrel. \n- Divisions in cartel - \nPoorer OPEC members Angola, Algeria and Venezuela -- whose budgets are heavily reliant on oil revenues -- may again argue for less output to support prices, analysts say. \nRicher Gulf producers, led by OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia, remain eager for the cartel to preserve valuable market share and force out high-cost US shale producers with lower oil price levels. \n\"Clearly there is a divide between the countries on this new policy of seeking new market share,\" Ann-Louise Hittle at consultancy Wood Mackenzie told AFP. \n\"So it could be a contentious (OPEC) meeting and there could be pressure for an emergency meeting before December.\" \nFaced with stubbornly low prices, Algeria's energy minister Salah Khabri indicated to state news agency APS last week that an emergency OPEC meet could be needed. \n\"The real problem starts when OPEC members begin to fight for quotas amid oversupply and market share disputes,\" said Jassem al-Saadun, head of Kuwait's Al-Shall Economic Consultants. \n\"If Iran, Venezuela, Algeria and Libya -- all of which need to pump more -- enter into a dispute with the Gulf producers, then it could be the end for OPEC,\" he warned. \nDanske Bank analyst Jens Naervig Pedersen said such countries had been \"really hit\" by low oil prices. \nBut he added: \"Their collective power is probably not great enough to turn the mind of Saudi Arabia and the core members of OPEC in the Middle East.\" \n- Global demand key - \nIn June, OPEC's collective output ceiling was left at 30 million bpd -- where it has stood for three and a half years -- despite an oil price collapse between June 2014 and January that slashed precious revenues. \nThe organisation appeared to shrug off calls from some members, including Iran, for a \"reasonable\" oil price of between $75 and $80 per barrel. \nOil is forecast to languish at an average of just above $62 per barrel next year, according to French bank Natixis. \nHittle cautioned that low price levels could slow down US shale energy production and make room for returning supplies from Iran -- provided that global energy demand does not falter. \n\"When we look at fundamentals (of supply and demand) in the next year, with prices at this level we do expect to see a much slower growth in US oil supply,\" she said. \n\"So there might actually be some room for Iranian production to start up, as long as oil demand growth holds up and continues.\" @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Hockey dangling tax cuts for next election AAP \nTreasurer Joe Hockey is aiming to take the promise of tax cuts to the next federal election.
