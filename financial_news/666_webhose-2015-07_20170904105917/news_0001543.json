The U.K. plans to start selling its controlling stake this year, even as RBS faces a U.S. misconduct fine that may reach $13 billion.\n“Material uncertainty remains around the terms on which various conduct issues may be resolved, but does little to diminish our buyback expectations” given “the emergence of material surplus capital driven by planned RWA reduction,” Gordon, who rates RBS a buy, said in a report. “We continue to anticipate at least a 10 billion-pound share buyback in 2016.”\nChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is preparing to sell shares in RBS as early as September, probably at a loss to the Treasury, as the government seeks to end seven years of ownership and return some of the 45.5 billion-pound bailout to taxpayers. Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan, 57, has reversed RBS’s global expansion and is focusing the lender on U.K. consumer and commercial banking, reducing assets at the investment bank and closing businesses abroad.\nRBS shares fell 1 percent to 343.4 pence at 11:20 a.m. in London, extending its decline this year to 13 percent.\nA large fine could affect the timetable for returning RBS to private ownership. U.S. regulators told the bank it could pay as much as $13 billion if it loses a lawsuit over its handling of American mortgage securities.\nThat sum “appears very much worst case,” Gordon said. “We think RBS’s existing 2 billion-pound provision would be short by only a few hundred million dollars.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T14:22:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
