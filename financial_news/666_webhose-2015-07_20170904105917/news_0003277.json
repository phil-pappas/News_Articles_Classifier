San Francisco, CA (PRWEB) July 22, 2015\nThe Global USA Green Card Organization (GUSGC) has just released a unique and advanced web application for applicants of the Diversity Visa (DV) Lottery. As a private organization, GUSGC assists international clients applying for the annual DV, or Green Card, Lottery by offering supplemental advisory services before the annual submission of application materials each October.\nOperating through the US Department of State, the DV Lottery grants 55,000 American green cards each year in order to encourage immigration to the US by citizens of countries with presently low levels of natural immigration.\nGiven the complex and rigid structure of the government website’s application, as well as its limited accessibility which is only open one month per year, GUSGC offers 24/7 support and guidance that ensures the successful submission of all Lottery application materials. Emma Louise, the Head of Customer Service at GUSGC, notes that “up to 90% of our applicants submit initially ineligible photos and information, which the company then corrects and validates for an acceptable application.”\nGUSGC’s new user-friendly web application includes a free version of required forms and photo uploading. A variety of packages are also available for purchase, including automatic resubmission of materials over the course of several years, as well as consular interview consulting, relocation services, and career advice. GUSGC’s official website has already attracted 360,000 unique visitors this calendar year, 40,000 of whom have already registered to receive support from one of the company’s highly experienced immigration experts.\n“The Green Card Lottery is an exceptional federal program that has absorbed hundreds of thousands of immigrants into the United States, further diversifying American culture,” Louise says. “Here at GUSGC, we pride ourselves on providing our clients with an honest and transparent procedure of actualizing their American dreams, which all starts with our easy-to-use web application, continues with helpful communication and friendly customer service, and strives toward successful immigration to the United States and easy acclimation to American culture.”\nAbout Global USA Green Card Organization (GUSGC)\nGUSGC offers trustworthy guidance and support to applicants of the US Diversity Visa (DV) Lottery program. The organization guarantees the successful submission of application materials, both on time and in full, and strives to make the immigration process as clear, simple, and streamlined as possible.
