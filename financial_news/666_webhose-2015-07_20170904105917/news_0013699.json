I am proud that Silver Cross is still a truly British business,\" Mr Halsall wrote in an article in The Daily Telegraph in 2012. \nThe funds raised from a transaction would be used to expand the company, including accelerating its growth in China, where it has stores in Hong Kong and Shanghai, the source said. \nLast year, the company recorded sales of £28.5m and pre-tax profits of £4m, with turnover this year expected to hit £31m. \nThe source said it was conceivable that a deal would value Silver Cross at about £50m. \nSince acquiring the company, Mr Halsall has taken it into the wider nursery furniture market as well as securing distribution deals in Europe and the Middle East. \nThe most recent accounts filed at Companies House for Silver Cross Nurseries Ltd, covering 2013, refer to \"a challenging year for the group\", partly as a consequence of \"the wider economic situation within the worldwide economy... and competitor activity in a crowded market\". \nA Silver Cross spokeswoman declined to comment, while Fosun could not be reached for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T21:37:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
