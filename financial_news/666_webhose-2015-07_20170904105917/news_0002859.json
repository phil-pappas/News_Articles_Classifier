The lender is aiming for cost savings of $1.8 billion by the end of 2018. \nStanChart's shares fell by a third over the past two years, hurt by problems including fines from U.S. regulators for misconduct, plunging commodities prices and a weakened trading environment. \nThe stock has recovered by 5 percent this year, after the lender said in January it would eliminate around 4,000 jobs and close its struggling equities division. Winters, a former JPMorgan (LSE: JPIU.L - news ) banker, took over in June. \nThe new structure sees Winters take over StanChart's investment bank, commercial and private bank, and retail banking divisions, the three major units that had previously reported to Rees. \nRees, who was deputy to previous Chief Executive Peter Sands and who oversaw the buildout of the investment banking division, is the most senior survivor of the bank's previous management regime. \nRees will work with Winters on the formulation of the bank's strategy, StanChart said.
