The fees you pay are mostly fixed, unlike managed investments.\nFor example, having $150,000 in an SMSF with a passive strategy and minimal advice requirements could cost as little as $2,000 through an accountant (including an audit), which is the equivalent of 1.3 per cent in fees.\nIf you were to double the amount of funds to $300,000 with the same passive strategy, the costs remain at $2,000, which halves the management fee to 0.65 per cent compared to a pooled investment that will continue to charge the same percentage-based fee.\nIn this example, an accountant will prepare the SMSF's accounts to a professional standard that the auditor can work with and also prepare the tax return and provide the tax advice.\nDespite this, some may consider reducing costs further by using a cut-price online provider or lodging the return themselves. But are either of these options really worth the risk?\nThere are plenty of services offering cheap SMSF compliance and administration, and if you are highly engaged in the running of your SMSF and interested in tax issues, then this may be a viable solution.\nBut for mere mortals, it may end up being more costly than anticipated.\nBefore you select an administration service provider, here is a list of questions you should ask:\n - Is the paperwork being done offshore?\n- Who owns the service provider?\n- Is the process automated or is there an experienced, qualified accountant involved?\n- Will they review the tax being paid and suggest tax strategies for better outcomes?\n- What happens if something goes wrong?\nCase studies Dealing with a qualified accountant will almost always produce a better tax outcome than simply feeding your details into an computer program. We'll look at two fictional couples with similar circumstances to show why.\nAndrew and Claire use an accountant and value the expertise that a good accountant brings. They start an SMSF knowing that all ongoing costs, including the accounting fees their SMSF incurs, are a tax deduction against income generated by the fund.\nWhile preparing the accounts, their accountant reminded Andrew and Claire of the tax benefits available from a transition-to-retirement scheme once they turn 55. Because of their taxable personal incomes, though, this option didn't quite stack up tax-wise. Once they had turned 60, though, this had changed and their accountant recommended that they get financial advice and re-examine a transition-to-retirement scheme to extract the maximum tax benefits.\nTheir accountant also reminded them of the tax savings power their SMSF could produce by owning direct shares with fully franked dividends, which they were receptive to, and decided to also broach with a financial adviser.\nIn combination, these basic and relatively simple strategies improved their financial position by tens of thousands of dollars.\nCoupled with that, a few years before this, Andrew and Claire (who always do the right thing with their SMSF) made a mistake and inadvertently paid a personal bill from their SMSF's bank account. Their accountant was able to pick it up, advise on how to rectify it immediately, and advise the auditor about the rectified compliance issue.\nWhile the auditor was forced to lodge a contravention with the ATO, he was also able to lodge it with a resolution, which passed scrutiny with a minimum of fuss.\nAndrew and Claire's friends Adam and Kate also have an SMSF. With a mix of investments, their portfolio is dominated by a series of managed funds. Picked at random on the advice of friends, the funds just aren't generating the same tax benefit as direct shares, and to make matters worse, incur yet another level of management fees.\nThey had also started a transition-to-retirement scheme when Adam turned 55, which meant tax was calculated on his higher income, incurring much greater tax than any benefits inside the fund. To make matters worse, when Adam and Kate inadvertently paid a utility bill from their SMSF's cash account, they didn't pick it up until it was too late.\nThe electronic compliance company they used to file their returns struck them from its books, as they didn't handle non-compliance issues, forcing Adam and Kate to seek specialist help to urgently rectify the situation, which they found both costly and stressful.\nNearly every year there are changes to SMSF rules and regulations, and while both couples enjoyed keeping on top of new developments, they also knew it really wasn't their area of expertise.\nAndrew and Claire also both had wills, but weren't sure about how that worked with their SMSF. Once again, their accountant was able to provide assistance with the lodging of binding nominations (with their lawyer's help) to ensure their wishes were preserved.\nThere are many issues to consider each and every time an SMSF tax return is lodged. The sixteen page form has tripped up many very experienced businessmen and women, even former BHP chairman Don Argus had a very public stoush with the ATO that was settled out of court earlier this year.\nIf you like the intellectual challenge of looking after your own tax affairs and have enough experience to be comfortable with the outcome, go for it. If you prefer to have the certainty and benefit from the insight of a professional accountant, then that's good too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T14:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:56:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
