The company said depreciation and amortization expenses rose 33.5 percent.\nSales rose 8.5 percent in the quarter, driven by a strong performance in its satellite TV unit Sky, which added 120,582 subscribers, and its cable TV businesses, which saw sales jump 43.8 percent.\nTelevisa's advertising segment reported a 16.4 percent drop in revenue, partly due to a strong quarter last year during the FIFA World Cup, and the mandatory airing of political ads ahead of Mexico's midterm elections in June, the company said.\nEarlier this month, U.S. Spanish-language media company Univision, which is part-owned by Televisa, filed for an initial public offering in the United States.\n($1 = 15.6950 pesos at end of June) (Reporting by Christine Murray ; editing by Diane Craft )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T02:27:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
