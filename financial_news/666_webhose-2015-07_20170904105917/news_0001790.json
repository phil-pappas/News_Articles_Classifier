Advice poured in: keep your plans simple and avoid overnight flights.\nAs a younger couple, our vacations usually involved international destinations, backpacks and complicated itineraries. As new parents, we decided to take the “keep it short and simple” advice and run with it. Or, rather, drive with it — just down the coast from our San Francisco home to the Monterey Peninsula, where we hoped to enjoy scenic walks, a trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, lots of time in the kiddie pool and, hopefully, some relaxation.\nResort vs. Airbnb, baby edition Vacation rentals are great for families who need space, and sound barriers, and are usually more cost effective than hotels. Access to kitchen facilities is handy for cleaning bottles and storing milk and baby food. But the idea of having immediate access to services and amenities ultimately convinced us to pay the premium for a hotel resort. Call it the kiddie-pool premium.\nTaylor Shaw Even on two hours of sleep, the grounds at Carmel Valley Ranch call out to be explored. Picking a ‘baby ready’ hotel Amie O’Shaughnessy, founder and managing editor of family vacation-planning resource Ciao Bambino Inc., says that separation for sleeping should be the top concern in choosing a hotel or resort when traveling with an infant. Suites or connected rooms might be cost prohibitive, but extra space for you to have while the baby is sleeping is crucial — even a balcony could do in a pinch.\nProximity to restaurants and services is also key: this might not be the time to sacrifice a central location for a cheaper price. And, depending on the age of your infant, bigger might be better: “When they are young and more prone to crying, having a hotel that’s too intimate can increase stress,” O’Shaughnessy says.\nNot all kid-friendly hotels are what Ciao Bambino has designated “baby ready.” Baby-ready hotels will offer quality cribs and high chairs — and quality matters, since many destinations worldwide do not have the same safety standards as the U.S. — and often amenities like infant sun products and shampoo.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T17:27:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
