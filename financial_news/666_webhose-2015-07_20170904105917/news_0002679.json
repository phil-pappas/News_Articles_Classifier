( http://s.nikkei.com/1f8Sxu3 ) \nQuarterly sales were expected to fall by 3.2 percent to 600 billion yen. \nSharp officials weren't immediately available to comment. \nThe figures were both slightly weaker than markets were expecting, and shares in Sharp fell 3 percent in morning trade. Analysts on average forecast an operating loss of 21 billion yen on sales of 612 billion, according to Thomson Reuters Estimates. \nSharp has struggled to cope with falling prices for liquid crystal displays sold to smartphone makers. In May, it secured a $1.9 billion bailout after falling deep into the red. \nSharp's earnings for the July-September period would have to improve \"significantly\" for the company to reach its targeted operating profit of 10 billion yen for the April-September half, the report said. \n(Reporting by Sneha Banerjee in BENGALURU and Ritsuko Ando in TOKYO; Editing by Richard Pullin and Kenneth Maxwell)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T04:17:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
