By Katie Morley | Telegraph – 2 minutes 38 seconds ago 39.24 0.00 \nA mysterious call which appeared in a man's mobile phone bill remains unexplained by EE. Katie Morley finds it is not an isolated case... \nHow many times have you complained to your telephone provider because your bill is bigger than you expected? \nIt happens to most of us at some point and there's usually a plausible explanation. Your friend borrowed your phone and made expensive calls, or perhaps you didn't realise that the helpline you spent 40 minutes on hold to had a chargeable number. \nBut for a number of phone owners, their costly calls and texts remain unexplained. \nTwo such calls appeared on the phone bill of Dr Ellie Cannon, an EE customer who had recently taken a trip to New York. \nAs a regular traveller, she knew she needed to ensure that her voicemail was not able to receive messages before she caught her flight in order not to rack up a huge bill from calls back home. EE charges for voicemails received overseas - Telegraph Money has previously reported the case of a reader charged £86 for messages left on her EE mobile by cold callers. \nSo Dr Cannon changed her mailbox message to say: \"If you need me, text or Whatsapp me.\" Whatsapp is a smartphone app that allows you to send messages over the internet. \nThe calls happened at 5.39am UK time and lasted seven seconds each. That would have been 00.39am in New York time, when she was asleep. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) more confusingly, the calls appear to come from Dr Cannon's own number. EE said she dialled her own voicemail and was therefore charged £1 each time. \nA spokesman said: \"The voicemail was switched off so she would not be charged for incoming voicemails. However, when abroad she would be charged the applicable rate when making an outgoing call to her voicemail. In this instance voicemail was dialled from Dr Cannon's phone.\" \nBut Dr Cannon said: \"EE said the call to the voicemail was definitely made, but I cannot see how. If you look at the times they were supposedly made, it doesn't add up. I don't believe I made that call.\" \nEE refunded the cost of the calls on Dr Cannon's bill. \nPhantom calls are widely reported online. A quick internet search throws up reams of similar stories from customers of the major phone providers. \nScores of users claim to have been charged for ringing the speaking clock. In every case the customers said they had not used the service. \nOne EE landline customer told Which!, the consumer lobby group, that he found a charge of £5 against a purported call to 118500, a directory inquiries number. He said neither he nor his wife was at home at the time of the call. \nAnother phone user, this time a Vodafone mobile customer, claimed that calls to strange phone numbers had appeared on his bill for three months. He said: \"The numbers are not in my call history and I do not recognise any of them. I download my itemised bills into an Excel spreadsheet every month and cross reference them to a list of numbers I keep updated in another Excel spreadsheet. \n\"I can identify every number on my bills except for these ones. I have reported the issue to Vodafone several times, have spoken to several people about it and gone through all the escalation channels. They say the itemised call data comes directly from my Sim so I must have made the calls. \n\"They have given me several excuses, none of which explains the situation.\" \nWhether phone proivders are planting these calls remains to be seen, but if you've had an unexplained call added to your bill, then we want to hear from you. \nEmail: katie.morley@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T18:35:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
