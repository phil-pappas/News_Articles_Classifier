Gold’s 14-day relative strength index earlier fell as low as 13, Jones said. A reading below 30 suggests oversold conditions.\nYet some technical analysts say after a move of Monday’s magnitude, a recovery is likely to be limited.\n\"For me, if gold got back towards ($1,143), you’d be looking to start reselling it,\" Credit Suisse analyst Christopher Hine said. \"What today’s move does is kick off the bigger bear trend. $1,087 is the next downside target... then, for me, $1,044, $1,033, $1,006 and $1,000 is where we’re gunning for.\" Gold’s 2010 low is located at $1,044, while $1,006 is the high from February 2009, the top of the initial leg of the rally from the metal’s 2008 lows.\n\"That could end up being too conservative when you look out three to six months from here,\" Hine added.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T02:05:29.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
