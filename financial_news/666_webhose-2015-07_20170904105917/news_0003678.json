The La Tasca auction is being handled by BDO. The restaurant is currently owned by Icelandic bank Kaupthing and German lender Commerzbank (Xetra: CBK100 - news ) , which took control from entrepreneur Robert Tchenguiz in a debt-for-equity swap in 2013. The chain struggled after the recession with soaring liabilities and became addicted to discounting including “all you can eat” promotions. \nRecently, La Tasca has overhauled its menus, ditching frozen foods and making meals more authentic by working with Spanish suppliers. \nLa Tasca sells traditional Spanish food including paella and tapas dishes \nThe sale of La Tasca comes on the back of a string of restaurant deals with investors keen to involve themselves with the booming consumer trend of eating and drinking out as the economy improves. \nLast week CBPE, a private equity firm, sold French restaurant chain Cote to rival BC Partners for £250m, while Prezzo was recently taken private by TPG (Taiwan OTC: 6521.TWO - news ) . The chain was founded by leisure moguls the Kaye family, who also created the Garfunkels, Café Uno and Ask and Zizzi restaurant chains.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T22:29:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
