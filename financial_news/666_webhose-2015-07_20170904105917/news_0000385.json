Diesel drivers ‘overcharged by £250m’ in past month By Andrew Critchlow | Telegraph – 22 minutes ago Print \nRAC Foundation accuses retailers of not passing on wholesale savings in diesel to motorists \nDrivers of diesel cars have been overcharged by as much as £250m in recent weeks because retailers have not passed on wholesale fuel savings, it can be revealed. \nAccording to an analysis by the RAC Foundation, the price of diesel at the refinery gate fell six weeks ago below that of petrol and has been about 2p per litre lower ever since. \nHowever, on the forecourts diesel has been around 4p a litre more expensive over the same period. While the retail margin on petrol at the start of July was 1.8p per litre, it was 10.2p per litre for diesel. \nThe RAC Foundation estimates that motorists would have saved £250m if diesel had been priced at the same rate as petrol over the period. \nSteve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said: “While it can take a couple of weeks for shifts in the wholesale price of fuel to feed through to the forecourts, it is now six weeks since the cost of petrol at the refinery gate overtook that of diesel. If ever there was a case of sticky prices, this looks like it.” \nIt is estimated that there are 10.7m diesel cars in UK and 18.6m petrol cars. \n“It is not unreasonable for retailers to make a fair profit but once again we need to ask why pump prices need to lag so far behind wholesale prices,” said Mr Gooding. Consumers have seen fuel prices for petrol tick higher in recent months after edging towards a £1 per litre earlier in the year . \nHowever, the renewed slump in oil prices has seen petrol and diesel trade at parity at some UK retailers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T09:24:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
