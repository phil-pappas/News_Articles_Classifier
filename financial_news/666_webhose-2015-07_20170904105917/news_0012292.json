Uber says this process typically should take a few weeks. \nSubsequently, the internet ride-sharing service has kicked off a petition this week to drum up public support for its service. \n\"We wanted to show the city and the province that Capetonians really want Uber, that they need Uber,\" Samantha Allenberg, Uber's communications associate for Africa, told Fin24. \n\"There is a need and there is actually demand for this service in the city,\" Allenberg said. \nAllenberg said Uber is not commenting at this stage on what exactly it plans to do with the petition. \nHowever, she said that because the petition is online, it would make it easy for relevant authorities to take a look at it. \n\"It's less about pressure; I would say it's more about awareness,\" Allenberg told Fin24. \n\"This process is something that should take a couple of weeks, but it has taken over six months for our driver-partners. \n\"Riders want the service; drivers want the service. The fact that it's taking over six months is not acceptable,\" Allenberg said. \nMeanwhile, the Western Cape provincial government on Thursday released a statement on driver permits in the region. \n\"The Provincial Regulatory Entity (PRE) in the Department of Transport and Public Works is currently considering 343 applications for operating licences which have been supported by the City of Cape Town, 201 of which are applications from Uber partners,\" said the province. \n\"The PRE will meet next week to finalise its decision. \n\"Regarding the current batch, the PRE must apply itself to each and every application. This is as important for commuter safety as it is for the responsible management of the meter taxi industry. It is essential that operations within the industry are regularised to promote fairness and to avoid conflict,\" added the province. \nCape Town pressure \nUber's partner drivers have come under particular regulatory pressure in Cape Town as opposed to other South African cities. \nIn Johannesburg, Uber partner drivers have chartered service licences which are less onerous to obtain than metered taxi licences. \nDemand for Uber in South Africa has also been surging as the internet ride-sharing company said this week that there have been over two million local rides so far this year, double that of 2014. \nUber petitions go global \nCape Town is not the first city in the world where Uber has resorted to petitions amid regulatory pressure. \nIn January, Uber launched an online petition in Chicago in a bid to put pressure on city officials there to allow UberX drivers to pick people up from O'Hare and Midway Airports. \nIn June, Uber also launched an online petition calling on San Francisco local government officials to allow drivers to work on the city's Market Street. This online petition, though, was reportedly hacked. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T18:51:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
