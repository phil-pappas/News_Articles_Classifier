Photo: Bloomberg\nThe International Monetary Fund reiterated its unwillingness to provide more financing to Greece without debt relief by euro-member states and further reforms from the Greek government.\nThe Washington-based lender's management won't support a new loan program unless Greece's debt is sustainable in the medium term and the country's budget is fully financed for 12 months, an IMF official told reporters Thursday on a conference call. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe IMF will require an explicit, concrete commitment of debt relief from euro-member countries before moving forward with a new loan, the official said. European countries haven't had detailed discussions with the IMF on a debt restructuring, according to the official.\nGreek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos asked the IMF for a new loan in a letter dated July 23 addressed to fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde.\nGreece has an active loan program with the IMF that expires in March and has about €17 billion that could still be disbursed.\nIn agreeing to a bailout this month that could give Greece as much as €86 billion, most of it financed by euro-zone countries, Greece agreed to seek continued IMF financing beyond March.\nIMF staff told the fund's executive board on Wednesday that Greece doesn't currently qualify for a loan, the Financial Times reported Thursday, citing a confidential summary of the meeting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:22:42.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
