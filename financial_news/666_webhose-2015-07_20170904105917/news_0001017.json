Share on twitter by Mark Mulligan Central banks have two effective tools for taking the heat out of an overvalued currency, and talking about the problem is one of them.\nWhen lowering interest rates fails to devalue a currency to where exporters and import-exposed businesses have an advantage over competitors, central bankers, and sometimes politicians, step up to talk the currency down.\nConvincing currency traders and investors that any mismatch between economic fundamentals and the value of the local unit is due an adjustment often triggers a bout of selling that, indeed, drives the currency in question lower.\nThe practice, known as \"jawboning\", is a regularly used weapon in the arsenal of Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens, to name just one, and has proved effective, if short-lived, on various occasions in the last few years.\nAnalysts will on Tuesday be running a fine comb through the minutes of the RBA's latest interest rate decision for any attempts to talk down the Aussie, which Mr Stevens views as overvalued.\nA speech by Mr Stevens on Wednesday will give the market another insight into the governor's thinking on where the currency should be.\nMore rare However, jawboning a currency up is more of a rarity, and is usually only deployed when depreciation overshoots to where the impact on importers outweighs the lift to exporters, or where the unit's weakness becomes a proxy for the economy at large.\n Such is the case of New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, who on Monday helped push the local dollar up nearly 1.5 per cent , to US66¢, by telling his weekly post-cabinet press conference that the kiwi had fallen too far.\nHis upward jawboning was part of a broader attempt to dispatch gathering gloom about the New Zealand economy because of sinking dairy prices.\nWith gross domestic product growth of 3 per cent, the country boasts one of the strongest in the developed world despite recent setbacks.\n\"Here in New Zealand we need to keep things in perspective and not needlessly talk ourselves into a gloomy mindset,\" Mr Key told journalists.\n​\"We should back ourselves to meet these latest challenges.\"\nHis comments, which also gave a little boost to the Australian dollar, have come three days before the Reserve Bank of New Zealand meets to consider whether or not to cut the official cash rate for a second time this year, after a 25 basis point reduction in June.\nMost analysts believe the central bank will follow up with a second reduction.\nSome said Mr Key's comments signalled the extent to which it should ease monetary policy further.\n\"Market participants interpreted this to mean that the central bank would only lower rates another 25bp this year instead of the 50 that is priced into the market,\" BK Asset Management's managing director for foreign exchange strategy, Kathy Lien, said.\n\"We would feel the same if these were RBNZ governor [Graeme] Wheeler's comments but they are not,\" she said.", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=6&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDMQqQIoADAFahUKEwjxmMOxl-vGAhUhH6YKHZNjDGc&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newstalkzb.co.nz%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Fpm-bad-economic-news-overblown%2F&ei=LK-tVfHSHqG-mAWTx7G4Bg&usg=AFQjCNE0pvG2m9CTm8VjzQ2BCw8See-r8w&sig2=BXSV3C2UYYnOenl7xpIyLA&bvm=bv.98197061,d.dGY", "https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=8&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDgQqQIoADAHahUKEwjxmMOxl-vGAhUhH6YKHZNjDGc&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fxstreet.com%2Fnews%2Fforex-news%2Farticle.aspx%3Fstoryid%3D49af3626-92d9-4f7b-a89b-07492dcd9e1f&ei=LK-tVfHSHqG-mAWTx7G4Bg&usg=AFQjCNEBw6ycjWzXhaSeY2oXpDBK_zGqnQ&sig2=0yySBTuhkx_EJR913-1x4A&bvm=bv.98197061,d.dGY", "https://twitter.com/@MulliganMark"], "published": "2015-07-21T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:12:03.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
