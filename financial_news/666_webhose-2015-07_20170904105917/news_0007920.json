The company had to pay $536m for extra development work on the new jet’s fuel system. \nIn-flight refuelling allows aircraft to complete much longer missions without having to land \nThe new tanker has a complex arrangement that allows it to deliver fuel to other jets in the air. \nEventually Boeing hopes to deliver 179 tankers to the US military, and estimates the global market for the aircraft will be $80bn, meaning the extra cost is worth absorbing for potential future returns. \nOver the half-year Boeing reported a net profit of $2.4bn, down 7pc on the same period last year. \nA record 381 commercial airliners were delivered over the six months, up from 342 last time around, and the division’s revenues for the six months rose by 19pc to $32.3bn, while operating profit was 8pc down at $2.8bn. This decline was caused by the tanker charge and the fact that Boeing produced more of its 747 and 787 airliners, which are more expensive to manufacture. \nBoeing, which has almost 5,700 airliners on order and a backlog worth $489bn, is looking at how to reduce the cost of producing its 787 Dreamliner jet, which uses advanced materials and systems to make it more efficient - features that are set to make it one of the company’s biggest selling aircraft. \nBoeing is hoping to speed up production of its 787 Dreamliner jets \nThe \"deferred cost\" of producing the Dreamliner rose 2.9pc during the quarter to $29.9bn. Accounting rules allow Boeing to delay the overall cost of developing and producing the 787 over a long period, meaning it can book profits from sales of the jet even though it is currently losing money on each 787 it currently sells. \nDeferring early costs is normal practice in the industry, as designing and building new airliners requires huge capital investments. However, the fact that cost is still rising hints that the company could take longer than expected to start making a profit on each jet when total costs are factored in. \nBoeing has previously said it expects 787 costs to climb this year, as it prepares to raise production rates by 20pc. The company is trying to speed up 787 production from the current rate of 34 in the last quarter to 12 per month next year, when deferred costs should begin to decline. \nReducing the cost would improve the cash flow at Boeing, an issue that has been increasingly worrying investors. \nThe company’s defence, space and security division had half-year revenues of $14.3bn, down 7pc on a year ago, and net profit was 5pc lower at $1.3bn. An earlier charge of $322m on the tanker programme contributed to the decline. \nThe company cut its 2015 core earnings forecast to reflect the charge related to the tanker programme and it now predicts earnings per share of $7.70 to $7.90 for 2015, down from its previous forecast of $8.20 to $8.40. \nOver the quarter Boeing bought back $14m of its own shares for $2bn, leaving it with $7.5bn of its repurchase programme to go, a scheme it expects to complete over the next two years. \nDennis Muilenburg, pictured left, the recently appointed president and chief executive who replaced Jim McNerney just three weeks ago , said: “Record commercial aeroplane deliveries to customers worldwide drove solid revenue growth, and the strength of our portfolio and focus produced significant operating cash flow. \n“Strong operating performance across our commercial and defence production programmes partially offset the tanker charge and enabled us to maintain our commitments to return cash to our shareholders and invest in innovation and our people.” \nHe added that the company was making the resources available to the “vitally important” tanker programme so it meets its schedule. Boeing is set to deliver the first batch of KC-46 tankers by August 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T19:19:10.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
