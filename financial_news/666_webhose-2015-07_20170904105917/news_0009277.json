By Nicole Blackmore | Telegraph – 3 minutes 21 seconds ago 10.50 0.00 \nAsk an expert: We look at how the new inheritance tax rules apply to workers who live in \"job-related\" accommodation \nThe total inheritance tax (IHT) threshold for those who own a family home will increase from April 2017 until it reaches £500,000 in 2020. This means that married couples and civil partners will be able to pass on assets worth up to £1m, including a family home, without paying any IHT. \nBudget 2015: How inheritance tax changes affect you \nBut the mechanics of the new rules are complicated and Telegraph Money has been inundated with questions from readers about how they will apply in practice. \nHere, tax experts from accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg provide answers. \n--- \nI am a tenant farmer and my tenancy agreement requires me to live in the farmhouse. I own a bungalow with a value of approximately £300,000, which is currently let. \nMy other assets would come to more than the current IHT allowance for myself and my wife. \nThe plan is to leave half our estate to the remaining spouse, the rest to the children. We are both 80. \nThe question is can the bungalow classify as our main house, although we do not actually live there at the moment? DA, via email \nThe draft legislation defines a “qualifying residence” as one that has at some point been your residence or, if you currently live in job-related accommodation, one you intend to occupy as a residence in the future. \nOn this basis, if the bungalow is the only residence you actually own at your death and you have either lived in it at some point in your ownership or (if you die while living in the farmhouse) you intend to live in the bungalow at some point, the residence allowance should be available on your death. \nNote (Stockholm: NOTE.ST - news ) that “job-related” accommodation is specifically extended to working farmers. \nDepending on your circumstances it may be prudent to consider formally electing the bungalow as your main residence. \nGot a question for our experts?
