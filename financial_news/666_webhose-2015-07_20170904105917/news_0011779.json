A stronger British pound versus the euro is bearish for UK gas prices. \nAnother external factor of note was Ukraine's decision to halt Russian gas imports. \nAnalysts at Energy Aspects estimated that Ukraine will need to import around 700 mcm of gas per month from Europe between now and September in order to refill its storage sites for winter and to avert disruption to transit supplies bound for Europe. \nRussian gas flows to the European Union via Ukraine were unaffected on Friday. \nGas prices for winter 2015 delivery were unchanged at 47.70 pence per therm. \nDutch day-ahead gas prices at the TTF hub were 0.05 percent lower at 21.02 euros per megawatt-hour. \nEurope's benchmark carbon price was 0.13 percent lower at 7.45 euros per tonne on ICE Futures Europe.
