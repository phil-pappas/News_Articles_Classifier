The SUV will be exported from Okazaki to North America from the next model year. A final board decision is pending July 30.\nMitsubishiâ€™s move follows that of Suzuki Motor Corp., which exited the U.S. car market in 2012 after three decades. While U.S. auto demand is recovering, smaller Japanese car companies are finding it difficult to get enough orders to run their plants economically. A weaker yen also makes producing in Japan for export more viable.\nProduction at the U.S. plant, opened in 1988 as a joint venture with then Chrysler Corp., fell to as low as 18,500 units a year in 2009 from a peak of 222,000 units in 2000 due to the economic crisis and the end of supplying Chrysler. A slump in Russian demand since last year also dented output at the Illinois factory, which produced vehicles for export.\nMitsubishi Motors rose for the first time in four days, trading 3.6 percent higher at 1,080 yen as of 10:02 a.m. in Tokyo trading.
