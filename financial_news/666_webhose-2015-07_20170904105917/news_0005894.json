Hickton said there are about 800 criminal Internet forums worldwide, showing that the tools to commit cybercrime are widely available.\nThree defendants in the case are accused of taking part in a scheme to maintain a spam botnet, or a network of hijacked computers, that used “bulletproof” hosting servers in China to exploit vulnerable routers in developing countries.\nThose so-called bulletproof hosting servers represent cybercriminals’ favorite hide-outs by hosting malicious activities while putting on the appearance of legitimacy and operating out of countries with lax laws to avoid authorities, according to a report released this week by the Tokyo-based security company Trend Micro. They host phishing, pornography, fake shopping and other criminal websites and are essential for cybercriminal groups.\n“Real-world crooks may rent out an apartment or a shop as a front to hide the shady dealings that go on in their back rooms,” the report says . “The building owners will let them do whatever they want as long as they pay rent. The same applies to cybercriminals…providers are known to allow customers to host any type of content — even if they’re malicious — just as long as the latter pay.”\nForums like Darkode represent one leg of the stool that is the problem of criminal hacking, says Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer at Trend Micro, because these shutdowns send a warning to American cybercriminals that they may be arrested. A takedown of this scope shows law enforcement worldwide is cracking down on the illegal sale of consumers’ information, though challenges remain.\n“The root of the whole hacking epidemic that we’re facing is not only are hackers better than the defenders, because they only have to be right once,” Kellermann says. “These forums would not exist without the support of bulletproof hosting to maintain them and insulate them.”\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/major-computer-hacking-forum-dismantled", "http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-criminal-hideouts-for-lease.pdf"], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T15:54:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
