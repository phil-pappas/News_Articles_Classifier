Louise Kennerley by Fleur Anderson Workplace reform must consider the interests of smaller businesses, unlike the current industrial relations rules, which were written by the \"club\" of big business, major industry groups and the union movement, Small Business Minister Bruce Billson said.\nOne of the solutions promoted by small business advocates to the Productivity Commission, which has been asked to come up with new workplace rules, is a new industrial award for businesses with fewer than 20 staff and with simplified rates of pay and conditions.\nThe Productivity Commission will next month give its draft recommendations to the Abbott government for an overhaul of the contentious workplace relations arena and Mr Billson, a cabinet minister and, this week, Australia's most senior economic minister, has backed small business complaints of a collusion between big business and big unions.\nThe Abbott government's pitch to small business has become one of its electoral strengths since the May budget's $5.5 billion small business package, which included a 1.5 per cent company tax cut, a 5 per cent tax discount for unincorporated businesses and an instant asset write-off of up to $20,000 until 2017.\nCouncil of Small Business Organisations of Australia chief executive Peter Strong complained to the Productivity Commission, which has been asked by government to review the current workplace laws, that smaller businesses were closing because of a \"business class warfare\" that pitted one set of industrial rules for small business against different and more attractive rules for big business.\nPenalty rates in the retail sector is the flashpoint for small business complaints. Mr Strong claimed retail giants Coles and Woolworths were able to negotiate lower weekend penalty rates with the main retail union, the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees' Association, whose members are 95 per cent Coles- or Woolworths-employed.\nSmaller retailers have not been able to negotiate the same penalty rates and are forced to close their doors on weekends and public holidays because they were unable to compete.\nPenalty rates reason for inquiry Mr Billson has backed small business complaints about penalty rates and said it was the reason the Abbott government announced the Productivity Commission inquiry last December.\n\"This is why we've got the review into the workplace relations regime,\" Mr Billson said.\n\"We know the workplace relations framework is largely developed by the 'club' of big business, their advocacy groups and the union movement, yet 96 per cent of the respondents to that framework are small businesses who feel as though the regime has not been designed with their interests in mind.\"\nSDA national secretary Gerard Dwyer last week hit back at Mr Strong's claims of collusion between the union and major retailers to lock out small operators, but Mr Billson has indicated the claims of collusion are being taken seriously.\n\"That's why I have been urging small business to be very active in the PC to ensure the workplace relations framework is right-sized, effective and well suited to the needs of small businesses and enterprises,\" Mr Billson said.\nWhile most of the political attention has focused on the impact of penalty rates on the hospitality industry, the hair and beauty industry is also hard hit, given it is a retail-based industry that is also required to train apprentices to cater to customer demand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T11:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:53:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
