Rob Homer by Michael Bailey Servcorp's chief operating officer Marcus Moufarrige says the serviced office provider is offering more co-working space in response to customer demand, but he distances the company his father founded in 1978 from the new darling of subleasing, WeWork.\nWith its free beer, arcade games and targeting of tech start-up tenants, New York-based WeWork raised eyebrows this month with a $US10 billion ($13.7 billion) valuation following its latest fundraising round.\n\"It's got that start-up tag so it's become the darling of Silicon Valley, despite doing half our revenue and losing money,\" Moufarrige says. Servcorp's market capitalisation is now less than 6 per cent of WeWork's – $587 million – despite the Sydney-based company being comfortably profitable .\n\"We've been around 37 years, but the co-working membership model is still unproven. Can you build a sustainable business out of the kind of tenant that it attracts? Not everybody wants a scooter in the hall or a ping pong table at work,\" he says.\nHe notes that even WeWork started out with a common area model, but has recently shifted focus to renting discrete offices.\n\"It's like what you've seen with gyms. A lot of people join initially, they pop up all over the city but then a lot of members don't end up using them, don't renew, so you're left with only a couple of the bigger gyms surviving.\"\nNevertheless, Servcorp is introducing more co-working space as a ploy to retain customers, in particular the 40,000 globally who use its 'virtual office' product.\nStart-up space \"We've found 12 per cent of them eventually take a serviced office with us, but they go elsewhere before that. We've priced the co-working option squarely between the $325 a month for the full VO product and the minimum $1500 a month for a serviced office.\"\nThere could be pent-up demand for start-up space, according to a Galaxy Research survey of 500 Australian business owners recently commissioned by Servcorp. It found 53 per cent of them took more than a year to set up their business after having the original idea, with money worries and fear of failure the two biggest blockers.\n\"We want to help push those people out of the plane, so to speak, by making the office establishment process as easy as possible,\" Moufarrige says. \"Sixty (60) per cent of our clients are branch offices of multinationals but we don't want Australia to become a branch office country ... we see our brand of co-working as an extra option that will appeal to some entrepreneurs.\"\nCo-working space forms part of the World Trade Centre floor Servcorp opened three months ago in New York where Moufarrige says the 65 per cent overall occupancy is \"smashing targets\". Part of a floor will also be devoted to co-working at Servcorp's headquarters in Sydney, at MLC Centre on Martin Place.\nHowever there's not a free beer tap or arcade game in sight, and the co-working zone's sweeping central business district views align with the \"five star\" ethos that Moufarrige says has served the company well since inception.\n\"A lot of our start-ups are coming from the 'boutiqification' of financial services with investment bankers being forced out,\" he says.\n\"They want something commensurate with what they had before, they don't want to go and work in [grungy, inner-suburban] Surry Hills.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/now-worth-10-billion-is-wework-a-2000-redux-1436910924", "http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20150219/pdf/42wq2v480tssvs.pdf", "http://www.servcorp.com.au/en/virtual-offices/"], "published": "2015-07-27T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T05:08:55.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
