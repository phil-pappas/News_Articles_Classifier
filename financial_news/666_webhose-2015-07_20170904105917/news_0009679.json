Representatives for Charlottesville, Virginia-based SNL and McGraw Hill were not immediately available to comment. \nMcGraw Hill provides ratings, analytics, data and research to financial institutions and individuals and is the parent of the Standard & Poor's ratings agency. \nIn August 2011, New Mountain Capital purchased a majority stake in SNL in a transaction which valued the entire company at $450 million. \nSNL was founded in Hoboken, New Jersey by Reid Nagle in 1987. Nagle remains on the company's board. \nBloomberg first reported news of the deal on Sunday. \nThomson Reuters Corp (TRI.TO) competes with McGraw Hill in providing information related to financial and commodities markets. \n(Reporting by Mike Stone; Editing by Paul Simao)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T00:22:53.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
