The re-establishment of the Authority came at the request of the Prime Minister at the end of April, 2015. Subsequent to the request, the Ministry finalised the draft regulation based on an assessment of the sector, which was carried out with the collaboration of the Ministry of Trade (MoT) and the Ethiopian Institute of Agriculture Research (EIAR) in 2013. \nCurrently, MoA is responsible for the development of coffee and tea, while MoT controls and regulates the trade facet. \nGovernment's assumption and ambition to promote the products through these separate entities has not been satisfactory, admitted Fikru.

It will be responsible to MoA, which will also shoulder the work of drafting policies, rules and regulations and enforcing them as well, according to the draft. \nIts base will be in Addis Abeba with additional branch offices in regional states, having a budget allocated by the federal government. \nAn expert at MoT complained that the Bill missed including research in the area.
