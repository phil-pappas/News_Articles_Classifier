(commonly known as A&P), has filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, as it is unable to service its existing debts. The 156-year old supermarket chain reportedly listed its assets value to be $1.6 billion and liabilities at $2.3 billion. \nA&P filed the case in the US Bankruptcy Court in New York. The grocery chain listed supplier C&S Wholesale Grocers Inc. as its largest unsecured creditor with $39.4 million in claims. Other such creditors are McKesson Drug Co., Facility Source LLC, Coca-Cola Enterprises and Mondelez Global LLC. \nThis is the second time that A&P has filed for bankruptcy in the last five years. The grocery chain, currently owns 300 stores under brands like A&P, Waldbaum's, SuperFresh, Pathmark, Food Basics, The Food Emporium, Best Cellars and A&P Liquor. \nHowever, reportedly A&P is in advanced talks to divest 120 stores for approximately $600 million. The company has also decided to close 25 outlets that have been incurring operating losses. The divestment and store closures will result in 28,500 job cuts. Per the 2015 filing, the company cited 50-60 underperforming stores which were kept open for several months as the main reason behind the bankruptcy. \nThe New Jersey-based company was established in 1859 by tea and spice merchants George Huntington Hartford and George Gilman. By the 1940s, the company had nearly 16,000 stores. A&P opened the first national supermarket chain in the United States in 1936, which was acquired by Germany-based Tengelmann Group in 1979. \nA&P’s fortunes turned sour as a result of several strategic mistakes, industry changes and financial hurdles, in turn lowering the same-store sales. Stiff competition from supermarket chains like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, Target Corp. TGT and Supervalu Inc. SVU added to the woes. Whole Foods market Inc. WFM, offering healthy food items, ate into A&P grocer’s market share. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days .
