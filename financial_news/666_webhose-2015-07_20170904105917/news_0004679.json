That topped the 4.91 billion-euro average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Operating profit, excluding some items, advanced 13 percent to 1.39 billion euros, compared with the average 1.4 billion-euro estimate.\nChief Executive Officer Bill McDermott is counting on a new version of the company’s flagship accounting and supply-chain software called S/4 Hana to increase sales in coming years as businesses upgrade to take advantage of new capabilities. Walldorf, Germany-based SAP introduced the product in February to refresh its market-leading Business Suite by letting customers pull data from online maps, social media and other sources to help accelerate decision making, and it’s offering incentives for customers who make the shift now.\n“Even slight upside can help revive interest” in SAP shares, which have underperformed European stocks since it started acquiring online software companies in late 2011, UBS analyst Michael Briest said in a July 7 note to clients, upgrading SAP to a “buy” rating. “Cloud momentum in Q2 was strong.”\nWeb Software SAP’s customers are shifting to software delivered online instead of programs that run on their own server computers, disk drives and networks. SAP, like business-software rivals Oracle Corp. and Microsoft Corp., is letting customers run more of their computing work in its data centers, often at the expense of greater profits.\nShares of SAP rose 18 percent this year through Monday in Frankfurt, compared with a 20 percent increase in Germany’s DAX index of 30 companies.\nSales of cloud-computing subscriptions more than doubled to 552 million euros, while sales of traditional software licenses rose 2 percent to 979 million euros.\nIn January, SAP cut its profit target through 2020 as it trades upfront payments for software subscriptions. The company today reiterated its 2015 sales and earnings targets, including its goal for cloud and on-premises software revenue growth.\nThe weakening value of the euro has helped SAP’s results, as it translates overseas sales into its home currency. The dollar has gained about 12 percent against the euro this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:33:08.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
