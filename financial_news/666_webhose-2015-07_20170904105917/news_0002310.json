It, meanwhile, said that all banknotes in the denomination of Rs 100 issued by the bank in the past will continue to be legal tender. RBI said that, in consultation with the government, it has been improving security features of banknotes in order to check counterfeiting and make it easy for the public to identify genuine banknotes.
