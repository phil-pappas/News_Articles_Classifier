Australia always has been innovative: the first Aboriginal people learnt more than 50,000 years ago how to survive in what can be a very hostile climate, including developing the use of fire as a form of farming. The earliest European settlers had to adapt and innovate to survive in a very different country to what they left behind.\nBut in recent years our commitment to innovation has been mixed. Both private and government investment in research and development in Australia is low compared with many other OECD countries. Patent filing data, which is often used as a reasonable proxy for innovation, is also down compared with other OECD countries.\nWhy is this? Sometimes it is blamed on the economy's heavy reliance on mining and farming, but both of these activities have seen a lot of innovation here. There has also been a switch over time in the Australian economy from manufacturing to services. Yet some countries, such as Switzerland and Denmark, although still manufacturing are not regarded as manufacturing powerhouses.\nSo why is innovation so important to Australia? Innovation can mean different things to different people, but one common definition is the commercialisation of inventions. This helps distinguish innovation from invention, which is more about the creation of new ideas.\nThe distinction can be critical. For example, consider the following list of Australian inventions: the refrigerator (1856); the torpedo (1874); the electric drill (1889); the notepad (1902); the military tank (1912); the electronic pacemaker (1928); the ultrasound (1961); the black box flight recorder (1958); Wi-Fi (1992); and the atomic absorption spectrophotometer (1952).\nIt's an impressive list – and yet all of these inventions were commercialised, and the bulk of the rewards captured, outside Australia, thus depriving Australia of the opportunity to gain the high-paying jobs and company taxes that technology commercialisation can provide.\nIn contrast, compare this with the iconic American inventor Thomas Edison. Edison patented his light bulb, among many other inventions, and then went on to found what was to become the global multinational General Electric, which now employs 300,000 people in more than 140 countries.\nMaking sense of citations Patents can provide a 20-year monopoly for inventors or their employers, and so provide protection for the investment required to commercialise new inventions. Almost all modern technologies are patented in one form or another, and so the patent literature can provide an excellent record of the state of innovation in any country or area.\nHowever, in recent times that patent system has almost become a victim of its own success. Every year, globally, 1.9 million new patent publications join the 85 million already published patent applications. Searching and finding the most important of these patents would overwhelm almost anybody.\nFor this reason, Melbourne-based start-up Ambercite has been developing innovative patent searching and analytic metrics using the citation links that connect patents together (patents \"cite\" earlier patents for similar inventions). As part of this we have developed a metric, known as AmberScore, for predicting the importance of a patent based on its citation connections.\nUsing AmberScore values, we can now rank the importance of Australian patents. This does raise the question of what constitutes an Australian patent, but in this case we decided that an Australian patent was a patent for an invention (filed anywhere in the world) that has been commercialised by an Australian company. We also made a rule of ranking no more than one patent per invention or technology, in order to show the broadest possible range of inventions.\nThere are some other well-known Australian patents and innovations, such as the CSIRO Wi-Fi patent, Ric Richardson's Uniloc software registration patent, Gardasil and polymer banknotes, among a number of others, that simply did not make the top 10 list, despite being very worthy inventions and otherwise high-scoring patents.\nWorld of difference This list proves that Australian inventors and companies can be world leaders in innovation. However, it also shows the difference between good ideas (such as the electric drill and the black box flight record) and the commercialisation of good ideas, as demonstrated by the likes of Aristocrat Leisure and ResMed.\nOther implications include the role of public support. Half of these top 10 inventions (ResMed, Cochlear, RAFT polymerisation, Safe-T-Cam and the bionic eye) are based on inventions or activity supported by federal government funding either at universities or CSIRO. Conversely, the other half come from the private sector. This suggests that both the private and the public sector have a role in supporting new innovation.\nDevelopments in medicine and medical technology are also crucial. Two of the three multibillion-dollar companies in the list, and three of the patents, are related to medical technologies – not to mention the importance of the Gardasil patent to the $41.5 billion CSL.\nNot all great patents make money for their owners or inventors. Before being involved in patent litigation, Alice Corporation tried very hard to create its own trading system, but without commercial success. Even litigation was ultimately unsuccessful. Similarly, while now the world's most prolific patent filer, Kia Silverbrook once lost control of his company, as well as his personal stake in it, after a falling-out with US investors.\nThere is no doubt that innovation is hard. But the mining industry is now cycling down, and Australia will need a full range of economic options beyond selling houses to each other and to foreign investors, and lending money for the same.\nThe good thing about both invention and innovation is that they are inherently human – even little children love to invent new things, and local markets all over Australia are filled with people creating and selling new products.\nBut of course there is a huge gap between a new type of homemade sauce and the next Microsoft. It is therefore imperative that Australia does all it can to encourage high-tech entrepreneurship, and to provide the best possible environment for innovation. Besides the obvious prerequisite (ambitious entrepreneurs with great ideas), this must include: access to capital, particularly start-up capital; clusters of like-minded people; and skilled technicians who are able to convert the ideas into commercial products.\nAnd what about the role of the government? Picking winners is always fraught with risk, but the fact remains that half the patents in this list are based on ideas initially supported by federal funding. Even Apple in the United States is reputed to have benefited from public funding in its very early days.\nIn Australia, governments of both stripes have supported R&D and early stage commercialisation in various forms over the years. This survey suggests that it is in Australia's best interest for them to continue to do so.\nMike Lloyd is Ambercite's senior vice-president of business development.\nLike Boss on Facebook .
