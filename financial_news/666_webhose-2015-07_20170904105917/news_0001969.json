By contrast, the Labor Department’s employment cost index showed private-sector wages climbing 0.7 percent in the first quarter and up 2.8 percent in the 12 months through March, the biggest gain in more than six years.\n“Now that wage growth is starting to take off, based on the most comprehensive indicators, it offers further confirmation that the labor market is nearly healed,” Williams said. “All signs point to a labor market that is zeroing in on full employment.”\nPrices have yet to show a clear sign of advancing, which Williams cited as a concern. The Fed’s preferred gauge of price pressures rose just 0.2 percent in May from a year earlier.\n“I still don’t have everything I want: Inflation is still well below our 2 percent goal,” Williams said. Even so, he sees “all the factors in place to meet our inflation goal by the end of next year” as the economy nears full employment and wages pick up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T21:27:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
