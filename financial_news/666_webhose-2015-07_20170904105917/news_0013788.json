Trading suspensions tend to slow market activity and defer risk until later. \nThe stock market slide was a dramatic reversal of a 150 percent charge in the 12 months to its peak last month, fuelled by tens of millions of retail investors using borrowed funds. \n- IMF: little impact - \nChina's economy, the world's second largest, is already faltering. Gross domestic product expanded 7.4 percent in 2014, the slowest pace since 1990, and weakened further in the first three months of this year. \nBut the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Thursday that there was no reason to lose faith in China's economy because of the bursting stock market bubble. \n\"There is no particular reason to have lost confidence,\" IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard told a news conference in Washington. \nThe spillover of the market rout into the economy was \"likely to be small\", he added. \nAuto and property sales have been affected, media reports say, though analysts expect the overall impact on consumption to be relatively small. \n\"Not only have the stock market gyrations had a smaller impact on household wealth than many believe, they are unlikely to make a meaningful difference to consumption,\" Julian Evans-Pritchard, China Economist for Capital Economics, said in a note on Friday. \nThe market boost has included allowing insurance companies to invest more assets in stocks and a programme to buy the shares of smaller companies. \nThe country's 111 major state-owned enterprises were also barred from selling shares in their listed subsidiaries by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, which oversees them. \n\"The volatility of this market has led many investors to question where China?s equity market is headed,\" Andy Rothman, investment strategist for Matthews Asia, said in a research report this week. \n\"However, given the market is driven primarily by retail investors, it is impossible to predict how their sentiment may evolve.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T07:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T08:35:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
