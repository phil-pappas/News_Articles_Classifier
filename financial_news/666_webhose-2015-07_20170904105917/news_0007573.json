On the other hand, the manufacturer John Deere, which accounts for the vast majority of domestic sales of combine harvesters, reported a 38 per cent fall in sales. The total value of agricultural machinery exports was down 41 per cent, with the number of units shipped down 18 per cent. \nGlobal grain prices have seen an increase in the last few weeks, partly in response to a drought in the American Midwest, nearly approaching the peak levels reached in mid-2008. \nLast week on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, soybean prices hit an all-time high of $16.79 a bushel, while corn price futures rose by around 35 per cent in the last month. \nBrazil's economy has witnessed bubble-like increases in credit-to-GDP ratio since 2010, and currently struggles to recover from the excesses caused by earlier lax policies. \nThe government has revised its GDP estimate for this year to a contraction of 1.20 percent, which would be Brazil's worst economic performance since 1990. \nIn the latest update of its World Economic Outlook report published last week, IMF predicted that Brazil will contract 1.5 per cent, revising its earlier forecast that Brazil's economy would shrink 1 per cent. \nIMF also revised downward its growth estimates for Brazil for next year, projecting that Brazil will grow 0.7 per cent, down from 1 per cent. \nBrazil, together with Russia, another member of the so-called BRIC block of countries, has been struggling to get out of a deep recession. \nWith the aggregate BRIC growth rate down to only about 2 per cent in April, and the potential for economic success seemingly held back for another generation, some may wonder whether it is time to bury the BRIC acronym altogether. \nFor more information on the global agriculture equipment market, see the latest reports: Global Agriculture Equipment Market \nFollow us on Twitter @CandMResearch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T22:37:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
