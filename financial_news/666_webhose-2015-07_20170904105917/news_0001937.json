More Call for greater drawdown protection \nThe measure — to fund an increase in the inheritance tax limit to £1m — was far more broad ranging than originally trailed. Before the Budget the government suggested only those earning £150,000 or more would see their annual allowance tapered. \n“Not just top rate, but also high rate earners will be affected by this measure because the definition of ‘earnings’ is broader than just salary,” said Jason Butler, chartered financial planner with Bloomsbury Wealth. \n“What an employer pays in pension contributions, and the employee’s own, will also count towards the £150,000 definition of adjusted earnings. So this could mean that someone earning more than £110,000, with a maximum annual pension contribution could be caught.” \nUnder the changes, to come into force from April 2016, the rate of taper reduction is £1 for every £2 that the adjusted income exceeds £150,000 subject to a maximum reduction of £30,000. Those with income, excluding pension contributions, below the £110,000 threshold would not be subject to the taper. \nSeparately, the government made technical changes to “pension input periods” to align them with the tax year, easing the introduction of the taper. \nExperts said the new tapered allowance would make it much harder for higher earners to plan their pension saving. \n“First, they won’t know their income until the end of the year, so they won’t know how much they can save without incurring tax penalties,” said Stephen Green, a senior consultant at Towers Watson. \nHe added that cutting back on pension contributions to avoid penal rates of tax may be unwise: “It can mean losing matching contributions from the employer — though we expect that many employers will respond to this change by offering cash alternatives to affected staff.” \nAdvisers said that top rate earners had a chance to claim up to £81,000 in tax relief before the taper came into force. \nLeon Buckley, director financial planning Tilney Bestinvest, the financial planning firm, said: “As the new regime comes into effect next year, there is clearly a window of opportunity, for those likely to be impacted, to consider maximising their pension contributions while they can do so under the existing reliefs, including potentially mopping up any unutilised allowances from the three previous years via carry forward.” \nA top rate earner could receive £81,000 in tax relief by carrying forward three years’ annual allowances and maximising their current allowance, he said, so their total contribution would be £180,000. \nHowever, he added they should bear in mind the lifetime allowance, “and consider whether or not they should take out fixed protection, directing future investments into Isas or non-tax wrapped investments and making efficient use of their annual capital gains allowances.” \nSeparately in the Budget, the government announced it was delaying until 2017 plans to launch a second-hand annuity market . \nThe launch of the market allowing existing annuity holders to trade their annuity income had been due to take place in 2016. But the plan was pushed back by a year to ensure an “in-depth package of support was in place to help consumers make their decision”.
