But mortgage approvals have picked up in most months this year, according to BoE data. \nWhile the survey showed availability of corporate lending was little changed over the last three months, lenders said they expected this to improve in the third quarter. \nDemand for lending from small business hit its highest level in a year, and respondents predicted this would continue to rise modestly in the third quarter. \nThe BoE has long highlighted the lack of credit for companies as a hindrance to Britain's economic recovery. \nCredit card lending demand was little changed in the second quarter, having fallen at the start of the year, but banks expected this to recover over the next three months. \nThe BoE survey was conducted between May 22 and June 12.
