Erin Jonasson Share on twitter by Amanda Saunders Even as Fortescue Metals Group races to hammer down production costs, the leaner miner faces the prospect of becoming the marginal producer of the large iron ore players, once Brazil's Vale brings its new mega expansion project online, analysts say.\nIron ore crashed spectacularly overnight on Thursday – falling 6 per cent to $US55.63 a tonne – its biggest one-day decline in a year. It snatched back much of the modest recovery made since hitting a record low of $US47 a tonne in early April.\nUBS mining analyst Glyn Lawcock told AFR Weekend that \"the concern the market has is that the all-in cash delivered price that FMG needs to be cash-neutral is ultimately going to be the dictator of where the long-term price settles\".\nFortescue could become the highest-cost of the large producers – Vale, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, and newcomers Roy Hill and Anglo American, he said.\n\"As more low-cost supply comes on, and high-cost supply is pushed out, ultimately the risk is that Fortescue becomes the most significant size marginal player.\n\"So even with their newly discovered cost base, they could still find themselves not making cash.\"\nCosts inflated by hedged freight Vale sealed a major $US16.5 billion ($21.6 billion) expansion last month with financial backing from China that will allow the miner to produce 90 million tonnes of high-quality iron shipped to China at a cost close to that achieved by industry leader Rio Tinto. The project – called S11D, with cash costs of $US11 a tonne – should be finished next year.\n \"We would expect S11D to drop Vale below FMG on an all-in cash break-even basis to China,\" Mr Lawcock said. Vale's costs are inflated by hedged freight, but that will also change.\nFortescue chief financial officer Stephen Pearce told AFR Weekend last month that the miner has a cost structure superior to Vale's, and believes some investors have failed to recognise this.\"We believe we are well-positioned in terms of the four global iron ore majors and we expect [on a break-even basis] to even come a little bit below where Vale sit.\"\nBarclays mining analyst Amos Fletcher told the AFR Weekend that \"whether the higher cost producer is FMG or Vale, the cost curve is going down; so investors should stick with the lowest cost producers – BHP and Rio.\n\"If FMG's financial 2016 cost targets are achieved – and I would question if not the achievability, then certainly the sustainability – e.g. maintenance capex at $US2 a tonne is probably not sustainable for FMG – that would see them at a lower cash break-even than Vale,\" Mr Fletcher said.\nBut the London-based mining analyst agreed that S11D could see Fortescue become the marginal producer among the big four. Fortescue is targeting production costs, also known as cash or C1 costs, of about $US18 a tonne this year, from $US26 in the June half.\nOther producers fit profile Fortescue put its current break-even at about $US39 a tonne, while Mr Lawcock estimated it at about $US44 a tonne. Vale's break-even is about $US43 a tonne, and it is targeting $US40 this year.\nOver the next one to two years, there are other producers that potentially fit the marginal cost producer profile: some Chinese domestic mines and producers in non-traditional exporting countries such as Iran, Iraq and Mexico, but they will be replaced by low-cost supply, Mr Lawcock said.\nGina Rinehart's Roy Hill project will come onto the market later this year with a lower break-even than Fortescue; that will likely start creeping up in one to two years as sustaining capital costs and strip ratios increase.\n\"Fortescue has got cash today but the risks are that if they hold their cost base down here, the question ultimately is … will the price come down to meet them?\" Mr Lawcock said. \"Then they will be in just as much trouble as if they'd been running at a $US50 cost base.\"\nThe miner is thought to have held talks with China's biggest conglomerate, CITIC, and its biggest steelmaker, Baosteel, about a potential capital restructure.\nRecord shipments were made from the Pilbara last month, up 14 per cent to 38.4 million tonnes on the year-earlier period, while Brazilian exports also hit an all-time high in the month. The new figures could have contributed to the price woes this week.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mandaksaunders", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-pain-for-miners-20150703-gi46bn"], "published": "2015-07-03T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:04:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
