Walter Thomson advertising networks and which said already generates group revenue of $1.6 billion in Latin America, signed a contract with state-owned advertising firm Palco Group under which it will base an executive in Cuban capital Havana. \nThe company said it had been in contact with a number of Cuban agencies and enterprises since February and had maintained contacts with Cuban and international firms to provide its services from a local base in the near future.
