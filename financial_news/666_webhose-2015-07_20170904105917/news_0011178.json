Christopher Pearce Share on twitter by Philip Baker It's that time of the year again when all of a sudden everyone is talking to their broker. It's reporting season and investors want to know what matters and what they should be looking out for.\nIn reality it all should be so much more than just taking notes and getting interested twice a year when companies report their latest numbers.\nIndeed, some experts think there should be a quarterly reporting season, as in the United States; others argue that that would make companies way too focused on short-term outcomes.\nSo what do professional fund managers look out for when the profit season starts ?\nAccording to the head of equities at UniSuper, Simon Hudson, there are a few ways of analysing a company's operating performance, \"but the reality is that earnings, and the quality and sustainability of those earnings, represent an important 'scoreboard' for investors to monitor a company and its management team's progress.\"\nHere are a few questions he always asks himself when looking at the latest profit numbers.\nFirst, are the industry and company performing in line with management expectations? Are they doing better or worse, and are they open or defensive about it?\nSecond, is management doing what they said they would?\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

How do the results compare to other company results in other industries? Let's face it, there are many industries that are interrelated.\nFifth, are there any trends, cyclical or structural changes occurring that are showing in the numbers?\n\"Are they short-term or long-term trends? This can really be really difficult to judge, and is usually heavily debated in the market. The supermarket industry in Australia is one such area at the moment,\" he says.\nSixth, how much risk are companies taking and what's being reflected in their cash-flow statements and balance sheets? Are they getting stronger or weaker?\nFinally, Hudson always looks at where earnings and dividends, for a company, industry and the market overall, are heading, and what value to put on them.\n\"Paying the right price for a company is crucial and so valuation is all about discipline, and relativities with other assets and other asset classes,\" he says.\nOne aspect he will look at closely this season is the positive impact on revenues and earnings from the lower Australian dollar.\n\"This could make quite a difference over the next year, particularly as so many companies and industries have done it tough with a very strong $A over the last five years,\" he says.\nThis profit season isn't expected to be a good one. Thanks to the resources sector, Morgan Stanley has forecast earnings-per-share growth to be minus 1.5 per cent for the nation's top listed companies.\nThe broker has also told clients the outlook for earnings growth over the next 12 months will be the worst since the global financial crisis.\nCost cutting and that boost from the Australian dollar might deliver some pleasant surprises, and if investors take out the miners, earnings per share is forecast to improve to around 4.6 per cent.\nUniSuper's Hudson also says dividend growth will again be in the spotlight amid talk about how high payout ratios can and should go.\n\"There is a serious balancing act between how much to pay out in dividends versus retaining capital for future growth, and is a real challenge for company management and boards. High dividend yields have been a positive feature of the Australian market versus international peers for a long time, particularly so in a lower-growth environment,\" says Hudson.\nGoldman Sachs equity strategist Matthew Ross says that although the bar has been set towards the low side for this reporting season, he too thinks there will be some downgrades to earnings over the next 12 months.\nThe low $A will help but it will also lead to a rise in costs for companies who import .\nHe has listed a few talking points for clients and notes that the high-growth companies have been a safe haven for investors over the past few reporting season but says this time around many of them are looking expensive, with high PEs and some \"negative earnings momentum\".\nStocks that might disappoint include Sonic Healthcare, Seek, Wesfarmers, InvoCare, Medibank and Challenger.\nHe also says that the PEs of domestic cyclicals are now 8 per cent higher than in the first six months of the 2015 financial year, although for some offshore names and defensives the PE has contracted slightly.\nHe also says \"a spike in impairments is likely with ASIC putting asset valuations under scrutiny\" while there will also be a focus on mining-related firms and those sectors likely to be affected by digital disruption such as media and retail.\n\"Watch for stocks where debt covenants or dividends could come under pressure\" he also warns.\nOn a brighter note he says there are a number of companies where sentiment is very poor, and yet they might just surprise investors with some good news.\nOn that note keep an eye out for JB Hi-Fi, Downer EDI, FlightCentre, Ansell and Cabcharge.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-07-31T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T10:11:06.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
