Refiners were minting money by converting excess supply into diesel and gasoline, which could be exported freely to a range of countries, including Colombia and Brazil. \nWhile oil drillers are reeling from a free fall in crude oil prices, refiners such as Phillips 66 (PSX) and Valero Energy (VLO) are churning out healthy margins. The excess supply of crude as a result of OPEC production and low pump prices have contributed to a revival in domestic demand. \nAs the above chart shows, refiners such as Tesoro (TSO) continue to post profits at a time when drillers such as Transocean (RIG) are bleeding losses. Refiners TSO, VLO, PSX, and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) make up about 10% of the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE). Good times may be coming to an end \nAs per an analysis of export and refining capacity data by Reuters, refiners may see good times come to an end. As regional economies within Latin America undergo an anticipated contraction, key Latin American customers, who are the major importers of US fuel exports, are expected to import less in response to lowered demand. \nAdditionally, a set of three refineries (Ecuador’s Esmeraldas refinery, Ecopetrol’s Reficar refinery in Columbia, and Petrobras’s RNEST refinery in Brazil) are expected to unleash 300,000 bpd of new capacity by 4Q15. This could potentially dent the demand for exports by US refiners.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T22:30:04.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
