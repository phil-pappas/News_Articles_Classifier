The hospital had hoped to start work this summer. \nThe seven-story building would include 128 private patient rooms. \nHospital spokesman Mike Noble said Wednesday that there's a provision under the rules to seek relief from some of the conditions. \nPresident and CEO Dr. John Brumsted said the medical center still has some work to do to meet the board's conditions. The hospital says staff members are reviewing the decision and are in the process of developing a plan to address those conditions. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T00:36:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
