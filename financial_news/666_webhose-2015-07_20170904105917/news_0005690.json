In addition to early booking, this deal comes with some stipulations such as a minimum stay or weekend stay as is common with many airlines across the globe. \nMbuvi Ngunze, Kenya Airways Managing Director and CEO said: “We have introduced new, lower entry fares on some of our markets. We are keen to have our guests grab the “KQ Hot Deals” and enjoy a whole new experience with us. Our customers will benefit from a whole new range of ticket prices and we expect this to open up air travel to more people in the region. We also want to encourage our customers to plan and book early to enjoy these low fares.” \nThe fares will be available from now for flights in August 2015. \nResearch has shown that many passengers in Africa book their tickets two or less days to the date of their flights unlike their counterparts in Europe and Americas. \nDomestic and regional flights are especially affected in Sub-Sahara region. Kenya Airways is seeking to compel its passengers to take advantage of early flight booking to ensure they get the best deals for their travel. \nRecent research by on online ticket booking engine Expedia.com confirms that buying at least two months in advance for domestic travel and six months in advance for international travel puts travelers in the best position to get a good deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T20:33:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
