It will also support the Irish government’s plans to take a golden share to protect Aer Lingus’ Heathrow slots.\n“We believe the IAG offer for Aer Lingus is a reasonable one in the current market and we plan to accept it, in the best interests of Ryanair shareholders. The price means that Ryanair will make a small profit on its investment in Aer Lingus over the past nine years,” Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary said.\nHe added that the sale is “timely,” as Ryanair’s original strategy for Aer Lingus—as a mid-priced brand to offer competition to flag carriers at primary airports—has been overtaken by its “ Always Getting Better ” push. Under this strategy, Ryanair has moved into primary airports, increased business traveler appeal and stepped up customer service.\nRyanair’s stake in Aer Lingus has been available for sale since May 2012. This was linked with a competition case that concluded with Ryanair being ordered to sell down its Aer Lingus stake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T18:41:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
