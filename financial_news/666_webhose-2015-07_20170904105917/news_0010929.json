Up to Wednesday's close, the stock had risen about 33 percent this year. \n(Reporting by Amrutha Gayathri in Bengaluru; Editing by Kirti Pandey) Basic Materials Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T15:30:53.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
