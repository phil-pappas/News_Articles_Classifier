From the 22 – 24, \"Scopers\" from the world over will gather up in New York City for an event that should for all intents and purposes, take live streaming to a whole new level. Announced in a press release on July 13, 2015 and hosted by the Periscope Community Summit, New York Scope Week, is the first ever user-generated conference for and by Periscope users. In this, its inaugural year, the summit expects nearly 400 scopers and over 500,000 live stream viewers to tune in.

We are honored to pull together this event that was the brainchild of members within the Periscope community.” \nSummit attendees can expect to experience a variety of panels, workshops, and breakout sessions that will take place at The New World Stage. Keynote speakers are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. In addition to a full schedule of educational opportunities, one will also be able to enjoy several parties that will also take place around the city during the week. \nThe current list of speakers includes, but is not limited to the following: \nAmanda Oleander is a freelance professional contemporary artist and Periscope personality.
