So, we have to find a solution to it and we are very close to that,\" Malhotra added.\n\nFor instance, he said if the property on the block is an industrial plot then the bidder wants to know the legal status of the plot, facilities like availability of water, electricity and approach roads.\n\nMalhotra said in previous auctions, the bank was not able to provide such details to the bidders and therefore the tepid response.\n\n\"Now, we are trying to make a package of information which will address all of these issues. Such detailed information will also help the buyer make a comparison and can then take an informed decision,\" he said.\n\nSBI is preparing a special website which will furnish all such details of distressed commercial properties in future auctions.\n\nMalhotra said he hopes the website will be ready before the December quarter online auction. It will serve as a good source of information for bidders who are interested in commercial properties.\n\nThe bank has fixed the second Friday of the third month of every quarter to auction distressed assets and have conducted two such auctions so far.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T15:38:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
