An indicator below 50 indicates a contraction. A result of 50 means no change. Despite softening in business activity, businesses remained optimistic about near-term prospects. \nEleven of the 15 future expectation indicators increased in June compared to May, when 13 future expectation indicators declined. \nEach month, up to 200 formal-sector businesses in different sectors in Kenya respond to questions on the country's current and future economic conditions. \nStanChart indicates that although most of the respondents polled are Nairobi-based, with some in Mombasa, businesses that they represent are active across Kenya. \nRespondents are asked whether business activity has increased, decreased, or remained the same, compared with the previous month. They are also asked about their expectations over the next quarter. An indicator above 50 shows an expansion. \n\"Businesses are concerned about rising imbalances, a depreciating exchange rate and the potential need for more tightening to stabilise the Kenyan shilling,\" StanChart's chief Africa economist, Razia Khan, said. \nThe shilling, which has depreciated by about 9 per cent to the dollar, opened trading today 99.20/30 to the greenback. The shilling has come under pressure from high demand for dollars by importers, declining forex inflows from key earners such as tourism, coffee and tea.
