The placement and choice of the ads is dependent in part on a proprietary calculation of the relevance of the search string to the ad copy. \nRunning a successful campaign on AdWords is all about relevance. Click-Through Ratio (CTR) is the primary metric that determines whether or not your ads are relevant (The % of people who are seeing your ad who click on it). If you can learn how to maximize your CTR, you can pay a lower amount per click, have a higher CTR, and get a higher position for a lower price. \nThe term “Call-To-Action” (CTA) is pretty standard in marketing; and it’s very important when working with Google AdWords. A CTA basically tells viewers of the ad exactly what you want them to do. Some studies have shown that adding a CTA to any marketing method has improved results substantially. \nHaving a clear CTA is important because it moves viewers to literally take action. Your ad copy should be keyword-rich and provide some sense of urgency. When you combine these with a solid CTA, many viewers will be enticed to click to learn more. \nIn order to convert your leads once they click on your ad, the landing page has to be right and ready. Whether you’re sending them to a page on your website, or a stand-alone lead capture page, the success of your Google AdWords campaign is highly dependent upon the landing page. \nHaving relevance between the search term, the AdWords ad, and the landing page is critical. Otherwise, you’ll simply lose money on your campaign in the end; AdWords campaigns can be expensive for some keyword phrases, so you definitely want everything to be intact for the best results. \nInstead of trying to do it themselves, many small business owners hire an expert who knows how to do perform keyword research, analyze the target audience, and craft compelling ads. This way, they can get started on the right track without risking their budget. \nWhen it comes to generating new leads online, of course you can always work towards getting your website pages to rank higher in the organic listings. However, this tends to take some time. \nIf you’re looking for a quick way to drive highly-targeted traffic to your website, Google AdWords is a great local business marketing strategy to use. \nNeed help using Google AdWords?
