I recently hired a cab from the city centre to Nyabugogo and offered to pay Rwf3,000, but on arrival the meter was showing Rwf2,000, I ended up paying more\". \nThe next day, Ruhongeka added, he took a cab to Muhanga after agreeing to pay Rwf30,000 to and fro and, at the end of the day, the meter calculated Rwf50,000. \nA cabdriver who operates around Amahoro National Stadium in Remera, who did not want to reveal his identity, said he preferred not to use the meter as the basis for determining fair but negotiations, especially since passengers are only cooperative when they make short distances. \n\"If I negotiated with a passenger I may get paid Rwf5,000 from here (at Amahoro) to the airport, yet with the meter I could end up getting paid only Rwf1,500,\" he said. \nInnocent Ndikuriyo, the chairperson of Kicukiro cabdrivers union, said there is need to overhaul all the fares because there are factors that were never considered while setting the current rates. \n\"There is need to factor in cases like traffic jams, poor roads, difficult terrains and waiting time,\" he said, adding that they had contacted Rura requesting for a meeting over these and other issues. \nHe also questioned the rationale of having taximeters operational even when one is transporting family members or other people that won't be paying, adding that sometimes drivers tend to uninstall the devices because they are targeted by thieves. \nBut Rura's Asaba warned that installing the devices and ensuring they are functioning accordingly was not optional.
