The new tool, which will rely in part on previously unpublished data, is the Department’s answer to a 2013 request from President Barack Obama to rank colleges on categories such as graduation and student loan repayment rates and tie the disbursement of federal student aid funds to those metrics .\nAfter pushback from higher education leaders and Republican members of Congress arguing the rankings could be arbitrary and unfair, the Department walked that plan back last month, instead opting for a tool that will provide information for students and families to make their own judgments and not rank individual schools .\n“Much of what we are focused on falls under the heading of asking better questions,” Jamienne Studley, the Department’s deputy undersecretary, said of the rankings as part of a presentation to a small crowd of financial aid professionals at their annual conference in New Orleans Sunday. “We helped turn the conversation from simply access and getting to the door of college to the notion of concentrating on college completion.”\nHigher education experts and policy makers have been critical of traditional college rankings, such as those published in U.S. News & World Report, in recent years, arguing that they focus too heavily on students’ standardized test scores and grade point averages when they enter school and not enough on how graduates fare once they leave. Companies , nonprofits and think tanks have gone so far as to develop their own ranking systems that focus on whether students get decent paying jobs and are able to pay back their loans.\n“I would say that I would never raise the subject of U.S. News rankings in conversation -- even if we got better,” Studley said of her time as president of Skidmore College. She noted that colleges and universities expend a lot of energy “trying to compete in things that don’t actually benefit students,” such as selectivity, in order to move up in the rankings.\nThe hope is that the Department’s tool as well as systems developed by other experts using the Department’s data will help change the kinds of questions people ask when trying to make an informed decision about college. And ultimately it’s still possible that the Department’s findings could be used to determine, in part, how much federal financial aid funding a school receives.\n“But that is not an immediate part of the plan,” she said.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://www.iontuition.com/ionMatch/Dashboard/Index", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-to-propose-college-ranking-system-that-could-increase-affordability/2013/08/22/73e674c0-0b17-11e3-b87c-476db8ac34cd_story.html", "https://scholarmatch.org/"], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T00:30:31.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
