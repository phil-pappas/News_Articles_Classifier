Until last year, it received supplies from state refiners who used to be compensated for selling fuel at below-market rates. \nThe government freed diesel pricing last October, providing a level playing field to private companies like Reliance and Essar Oil. \nThe Reliance source, who was not authorised to speak on the record, said the company has been selling a \"small quantity\" of diesel to the railways. \nIt was not immediately clear how much it sold in 2005/06.
