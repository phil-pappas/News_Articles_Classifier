We have been looking for ways to expand into peer group discussions for some time and FETT offers a proven format that has been embraced by CFOs. Tampa, Florida (PRWEB) July 20, 2015\nIn a joint announcement today, Frazier & Deeter , one of the top 60 CPA and advisory firms in the country, and the Tampa Bay Chapter of Financial Executives International (FEI) announced the expansion of Financial Executive Think-Tank (FETT) to Tampa Bay. FETT is a forum for senior financial executives to share insights regarding important issues and emerging trends with their peers in a confidential small-group setting.\n“FEI Tampa Bay is excited to offer this roundtable program to the financial community,\" said Mike Delp, President the Tampa Bay Chapter of FEI. Delp noted, “We have been looking for ways to expand into peer group discussions for some time and FETT offers a proven format that has been embraced by CFOs.”\nFETT began in 2011, when Frazier & Deeter partnered with FEI’s Atlanta Chapter to address the need for a CFO leadership exchange in which small groups of financial executives with similar interests could share their issues and insights in a round table session. In each session a CFO acts as the discussion leader to explore a topic of his or her choice. The roundtables have addressed topics such as transforming the finance function, the evolving role of the CFO and the CEO/CFO relationship.\nFETT Tampa has assembled an advisory board of financial leaders from the Tampa Bay area to help guide the organization. The advisory board includes Mark Cabrera, CFO of Saddle Creek Logistics Services, Mike Delp, Director of Finance at Advantage Waypoint, Randy Lay, CFO of Lazydays, Scott Marrs, Consultant at Cadence Corporate Performance Solutions and Todd Sakow, CFO of Carter Validus.\nMark Kingery, Managing Partner of Frazier & Deeter’s Tampa Office, noted, “We are excited to build on the previous success of FETT while we tailor it to meet the unique needs of financial executives in the Tampa Bay area.”\nAbout Financial Executives International – Tampa Bay Chapter\nThe Tampa Bay Chapter of Financial Executives International is a private association for senior financial executives from public and privately held firms.
