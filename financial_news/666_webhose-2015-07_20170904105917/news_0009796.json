So, that is the broad time schedule — whether it will happen in August or January, I can't say,” Mehrishi had said. “It doesn't have to wait for the Budget because it is a process that is ongoing and we can always seek additional funds within the supplementaries. So, it doesn't have to wait for the Budget.”\n\nThe government has already assessed the capital requirement of PSBs, after receiving presentations by them.\n\nThe central bank had earlier also flagged concerns over inadequate capital infusion. Last week, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan had said banks should have enough capital, so that they can clean up their balance sheet.\n\n“The way to get out of financial stress is to address the problem early... and some of the banks may need some capital to do that. Hopefully this capital infusion will help,” he added.\n\nEven RBI Deputy Governor S S Mundra had also said earlier that the amount budgeted for investment in PSBs wasn’t enough.\n\nAccording to an estimate, PSBs would need additional capital of Rs 2.40 lakh crore by 2018 to meet the Basel-III capital adequacy norms. Keeping these in mind, the Union Cabinet in December 2014 had allowed PSBs to raise up to Rs 1.60 lakh crore from markets by diluting the government holding to 52 per cent in phases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T01:05:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
