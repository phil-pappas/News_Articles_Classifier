For years, the venue has used the public feed that’s fractions of a second slower than direct feeds from stock exchanges that many competitors use. The wholesale market-making unit, which has less than 5 percent market share, will begin scaling back in coming weeks, a person with direct knowledge of the plans said.\nRaj Mahajan, hired this year as head of the equity electronic-execution business, is pushing to establish the firm as a top player in automated trading. The company last week said second-quarter equities revenue jumped 21 percent to $1.97 billion, trailing only Morgan Stanley among U.S. banks.\nGoldman Sachs hired Ralston Roberts from SunGard Financial Systems to be co-head of Mahajan’s group in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, starting next month, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the changes aren’t public. Roberts will run the group alongside Justin Brickwood, and both men will report to Mahajan.\nPartner Level Mahajan, the first partner-level hire in the bank’s equities group in more than a decade, joined in January from Allston Trading. He previously worked at SunGard with Roberts. Mahajan’s group added Keith Casuccio from Morgan Stanley to complement an investment in software and trading infrastructure, Bloomberg reported last month.\nGoldman Sachs’s dark pool was the seventh-largest in the U.S. for trading the biggest stocks, according to data from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\nRetail market-makers usually pay brokerages for their individual customer orders and execute them internally. Goldman Sachs’s share is well below rivals such as Citadel Execution Services and KCG Holdings Inc., as well banks including UBS Group AG.\nImproving the dark pool while winding down retail market-making is part of Mahajan’s overhaul strategy, which is based on winning business from quantitative hedge funds that already are clients of other parts of Goldman Sachs, such as the prime brokerage. The company believes the group could achieve revenue growth of more than 10 percent from those clients if the changes succeed, a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg last month.", "external_links": ["http://www.gset.gs.com/Products/Equities/LiquidityAccess/\\"], "published": "2015-07-22T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T22:00:42.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
