The number of new loans advanced for house purchases in May was down almost 16pc compared to the same month last year, according to figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Similarly, the number of remortgages was down 4pc year-on-year. \nWith rates still hovering around all-time lows however, now could be a good time to re-evaluate your mortgage deal. \nOur guide tells you everything you need to know about fixed rate mortgages and the best deals available. It will be updated with the latest information as events change, so bookmark www.telegraph.co.uk/fixedrates \nYou can also see more deals on our mortgage best buy tables . \nWhat affects fixed mortgage rates \nThe pricing of fixed mortgage rates is dependent on several factors, but mostly whether banks can get their hands on cheap money to lend out. They usually get this from savers or by borrowing from other banks. They do this on money markets, buying money at a certain rate – the \"swap\" rate – for a certain time period. \nThese swap rates react to expectations of future interest rates and inflation, which affect the price of mortgages. \nTwo and five-year swap rates were driven down for much of 2013 so the price of fixed rate mortgages fell. But those swap prices increased towards the end of 2013 and in early 2014, and with them, the average cost of new fixed mortgage deals. \nBut swap rates dropped sharply again earlier this year and deals were as cheap as they've ever been. Rates plummeted as lenders battled it out for a spot in the best-buy tables. Ten-year fixed rates fell below 3pc for the first time in February and five-year fixes fell below 2pc for the first time in April. \n• One minute mortgage check \nDavid Hollingworth, of broker London and Country, said the level of competition in the market remains extremely high and the rate war amongst lenders continues. \n\"That is forcing lenders to price their mortgage deals very sharply in order to attract borrowers,\" he said. \"Locking in when Bank Rate is at an all-time low can produce savings even now and that saving will only grow if rates start to climb. \n\"Borrowers still need to look beyond some of the eye catching rates as the very lowest rates can come with hefty arrangement fees. However lenders are catering for all types of borrower and will usually have a range of rate and fee combinations to suit every homeowner.\" \nWhat is the difference between fixed and variable rate mortgages? \nIf you take out a fixed rate mortgage, the interest rate you pay will be fixed for the initial special period, regardless of rate changes made by the Bank of England. Fixed rates are typically two, three, five and occasionally 10 years, with the interest rate rising accordingly. Once the fixed period ends, borrowers are pushed onto the standard variable rate which can be much higher. \nVariable mortgage rates can vary during the mortgage term, meaning borrowers will not have the security of knowing how much their repayments will be every month. However, if the UK economy dips, interest rates will decrease, making the repayments substantially cheaper. Also, because the mortgage comes with the uncertainty of interest rates either rising or falling in the future, the initial rate is often much cheaper than with fixed mortgages. \nThe cheapest fixed deals \nIt's not all about rate. Lenders like to add extra charges, such as arrangement fees. \nWe have calculated the full cost on some of the best deals based on a £350,000 home with a loan of 25 years. We used a buyer with a 40pc deposit - £140,000 - and a buyer with a 10pc deposit, or £35,000. \nFor those who want the peace of mind of having a fixed monthly cost, and for anyone who doesn't want the risk of fluctuating interest rates, fixed rate mortgages are appealing. \nBelow we list the best on the market, according to broker London and Country, using the two different deposits. \nTwo-year fix \nThe Post Office currently offers the cheapest deal once you factor in the arrangement fee. \n• The Post Office 's 1.65pc deal has no arrangement fees.
