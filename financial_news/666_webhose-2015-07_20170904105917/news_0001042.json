Brendon Thorne Share on twitter by Sue Mitchell Supermarkets relying on freshly baked bread, heritage tomatoes and aged beef to lure customers from discounters such as Aldi and Costco may be fighting a losing battle as value for money becomes more important than fresh food.\nAccording to a survey of more than 1500 consumers by Morgan Stanley, value for money and good promotions have become more important drivers of shopping behaviour in the last two years, while quality of fresh foods and the range of fresh foods have become less important.\nAbout 44 per cent of respondents rated value for money as being the most important factor in selecting a supermarket, compared with 39 per cent two years ago, while 27 per cent cited the quality of fresh foods as being most important, down from 30 per cent in 2013.\nThe trend was most pronounced among women aged 35 to 54, almost half of whom (45 per cent) rated value for money as the most important factor when choosing where to buy groceries.\nAlarm bells for Woolworths, Coles The finding will ring alarm bells at Woolworths and Coles, which are increasingly relying on the freshness and breadth of their offer in fresh foods such as fruit and vegetables, meat, poultry and dairy to differentiate themselves from discounters Aldi and Costco .\n\"As Aldi and Costco move into the mainstream, they appear to be having an impact on what consumers look for in a supermarket,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath.\n\"We think that differentiation within fresh (food) departments has reduced as Coles and Aldi have improved their fresh offer, which has led to consumers placing less importance on this factor,\" Mr Kierath said.\n \"Potentially this is an alarming development for the full line supermarkets as this is one of the only areas where they have a clear point of difference with the discounters, in our view,\" he said.\nWoolworths and Coles are cutting grocery prices to reduce a 15 per cent price gap with Aldi and increasing the frequency and depth of promotions.\nHowever, as Woolworths and Coles can never compete on price alone with the low-cost operator, they are attempting to differentiate their offers by improving their fresh food ranges – devoting more floor space to fruit and vegetables, installing bread ovens and in-store butchers, cheese counters and sushi bars – and fixing supply chains to reduce the time it takes to get fresh food into stores.\nCheeky Tweets The survey findings were released as Aldi kicked off a cheeky new social media campaign urging consumers to tweet when they \"made the switch\" to the discounter.\nFigures released last week showed that Aldi's sales have risen by about 20 per cent a year over the last two years, albeit off a lower base, reaching $6 billion in 2014.\nIn comparison, Woolworths's food and liquor sales have risen an average 4.7 per cent a year and Coles's sales by around 4.9 per cent a year since 2013.\nMorgan Stanley says consumer awareness of Aldi has risen from 82 per cent to 87 per cent as the chain opens new stores and advertises on TV, while awareness of Costco has risen from 54 per cent to 68 per cent as the members-only discounter opens new warehouses.\nHowever, while awareness has risen, only a minority of consumers shop at Aldi and Costco on a regular basis, due to their smaller store networks and, in the case of Aldi, its narrow range of mainly private label products.\nThe Morgan Stanley survey found that 52 per cent of respondents had shopped at Aldi and 11 per cent at Costco in the past 12 months, and even fewer were regular shoppers (Aldi 27 per cent and Costco 4 per cent).\nAldi's newest customers are coming increasingly from Coles, rather than Woolworths, because of superior value for money and promotions, the broker said.\n\"Looking ahead we think awareness (of Aldi and Costco) will continue to move higher and likely finish somewhere near Coles and Woolworths, which should drive overall customer visitation,\" Mr Kierath said.\nMorgan Stanley believes Aldi and Costco will increase their share of the market to more than 13 per cent by 2020, taking customers from Woolworths, Coles and independent supermarkets supplied by Metcash.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/suemitchellafr"], "published": "2015-07-15T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:10:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
