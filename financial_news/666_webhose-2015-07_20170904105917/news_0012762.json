Those three fields produced 273,000 barrels of oil and natural gas equivalent a day in May, about 10 percent of Petrobras' total Brazilian output.\nThe preliminary ruling by an arbitration panel is a precautionary measure and does not touch on the merit of a claim by Brazil's oil regulator, the ANP, for another 2.2 billion reais in royalties dating back to the second quarter of 2014, Petrobras said in a statement.\nThe decision was made by the International Court of Arbitration on Thursday.\nThe extra tax will crimp the finances and profit at Petrobras as it struggles to boost production and pay down its more than $120 billion of debt, the largest of any oil company in the world. It will also help a Brazilian government seeking additional revenue as the general tax take slips along with a slowing economy.\nThe payments, a windfall-profits tax known in Brazil as \"the special participation,\" is an additional royalty paid to the government on large and especially productive fields above and beyond the standard 10 percent per barrel.\nIn some cases the special participation can raise the per-barrel royalty to 40 percent.\nPetrobras sought the arbitration after the ANP said that the seven oil fields - Baleia Anã, Baleia Azul, Baleia Franca, Cachalote, Caxaréu, Jubarte e Pirambu - that make up the Parque das Baleias, or \"Whale Park,\" oil area should be considered a single production zone.\nThis made the area subject to the special-participation royalty.\nPetrobras said it will continue its legal and administrative battles against ANP's decision and the additional charges.\nWhale Park is located in the north end of the Campos Basin about 120 kilometers south, southeast of Vitória, Brazil, the capital of Espirito Santo State.
