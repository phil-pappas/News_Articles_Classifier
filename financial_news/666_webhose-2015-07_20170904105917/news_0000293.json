We hope that Europe and its leaders understand the message ... that you can't force anyone to sign their own death warrant.\"\nThe South American grains behemoth defaulted on $100 billion in bonds in a 2002 crisis that thrust millions of middle-class Argentines into poverty. By the next year, helped by a massive soy crop, Argentina started growing again.\nBut the 2002 crisis continues to plague its finances.\nFernandez regularly blasts bondholders who have sued the country over the debt it failed to pay 13 years ago.\nMost holders agreed to restructurings that paid about 30 cents on the dollar, while a group of hedge funds sued for full repayment.\nThe country defaulted again last year when a U.S. judge barred it from honoring its restructured debt without reaching a deal with the funds, which Fernandez denounces as \"vultures.\"\nArgentina became one of the world's fastest expanding economies after its default, growing at an averaging above 8.5 percent between 2003 and 2007, when Fernandez was first elected.\nSince then she has ordered trade and currency controls that have slowed investment while government fiscal accounts deteriorate due to high state spending.\n(Additional reporting by Jorge Otaola; Editing by Nick Macfie )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T05:44:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
