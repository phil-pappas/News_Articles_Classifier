Chae is Blackstone’s head of international private equity and a senior managing director.\n“After seven terrific years during which he helped transform the firm from a small partnership to a premier global institution, Laurence Tosi has decided to move to a new leadership position with one of the rising stars of Silicon Valley,” Blackstone Chief Executive Officer Steve Schwarzman and President Tony James said in the filing. “We will miss him, but respect his desire to run something himself.”\nBlackstone fell 3 percent to $38.54 at 12:50 p.m. in New York.\n“L.T.’s expertise in hospitality and finance is the perfect combination to help take Airbnb to the next level,” Brian Chesky, the company’s CEO, said in a separate statement. “We’re thrilled to have someone join our team who thinks just as boldly and creatively about building great businesses as we do.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T20:13:46.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
