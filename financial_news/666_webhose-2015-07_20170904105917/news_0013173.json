Tisu.com.gh has been offering amazing daily discounts with free delivery within Accra, Tema and now Kumasi. \nAccording to Tisu Merchant, Jemima Ashietey who deals in jewelry, 'The Tisu Marketplace gives us the opportunity to physically interact with and appreciate those who patronize our products. As a merchant on the website, we never get to personally meet them so I believe this is a great platform not only to do so but introduce them to other products we may have. With special discounts on this day only, who would want to miss out?' \nAccording to her, the event will give her the chance to meet other merchants. \nAt Tisu, there are top quality brands and discounts of up to 75 percent on items such as fashion, electronics, leisure, home & living, restaurants and travel deals. \nA business desk report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T19:47:33.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
