More Mobius steps down from Templeton EM trust \n“As a result, and in the best interests of our investors, we plan to close the fund,” the company said. \n“Suspending dealing will enable the properties of the fund to be sold in an orderly manner which will help to maximise the sales values achieved.” \nProperties owned by the fund include prime commercial real estate in Sydney and Tokyo. It had performed poorly over the past two years, shedding 6.6 per cent of its value so far this year, according to Morningstar. \nThe suspension follows the switch last week of the £2bn open-ended Aviva Property Trust to “bid pricing”, in which sellers receive a price based on the returns and costs of immediately selling the assets in the fund. This reduced the sale value of investors’ holdings by almost 5 per cent. \nAviva made the pricing switch after big outflows followed the departure of manager Philip Nell, who was replaced by Mike Luscombe. \nLaith Khalaf, senior analyst at the fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown, said the Asia fund’s suspension “highlights how liquidity is one of the key risks of investing in a property fund, and you may not be able to access your money as quickly as you like”. \n“Whereas shares like Vodafone and BP can be bought and sold at the click of a button, properties cannot, and this adds an element of risk investors should be happy to shoulder before investing,” he added. \nInvestors may not get their money back for one to two years, he said. \nSeveral property funds were forced to suspend redemptions during the financial crisis, as investors sought to withdraw money at a rate faster than properties within the funds could be sold. \nAnother option for property investors is to buy investment trusts, which are traded on a market and therefore are not forced to sell their holdings at times of large outflows.
