In the case at hand, the Court decided that the language of the FHA prohibits such policies or practices. \nIn 2008, the Inclusive Communities Project (“ICP), a Texas nonprofit organization, sued the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs over the way it distributed low-income housing tax credits. ICP claimed that the Department caused continued segregation by granting too many tax credits for developments in mainly African American inner-city neighborhoods and not enough in predominantly Caucasian suburban neighborhoods. ICP argued that the Department’s policy kept low-income housing out of wealthier, non-minority neighborhoods. \nThe Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs argued that ICPs lawsuit was invalid, and that the real issue was whether the FHA allowed this type of a claim. The Texas Department emphasized that specific FHA language excludes disparate impact liability and requires a plaintiff to prove discrimination occurred because of his or her race. \nThe divided Court ultimately held that disparate impact claims are cognizable under the FHA. \nThe majority opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, relied on previous interpretations of two other anti-discrimination statutes, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”) and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (“ADEA”), to support its finding that the FHA authorizes disparate impact claims. The Court found similarities between the “results-oriented” outlooks of all three Acts. The Court analogized the FHA phrase “otherwise make available” to the phrase “otherwise adversely affect,” found in sections of both Title VII and the ADEA. The Court held that this language refers to the “consequences of an action, rather than the actors intent,” and thus supports disparate impact. \n’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T02:12:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
