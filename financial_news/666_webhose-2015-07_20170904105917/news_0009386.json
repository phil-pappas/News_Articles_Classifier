By senior management that figure has fallen to 18 per cent. Beyond that the numbers are so vanishingly small that the list starts and ends with Gadhia herself. \n“We will need to do our research,” says the 53 year-old mother-of-one. “But my gut feeling is that, over and above women deciding they want to leave and do something different, it’s down to alpha male banking: wanting to win at all costs, rather than doing the right thing. I needn’t point out that sort of attitude has landed us all with a lot of problems already.” \nQuite so. With hindsight, an awful lot of alpha male bankers might have acted differently if they’d had an inkling of the sub-prime mortgage crash of 2008 . \nWith foresight, Gadhia did realise what was happening and, although unable to prevent what was by then inevitable, refused to have any part in it. In 2007, she walked away from her top-flight job with RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) , where she had been working closely with Fred “the Shred” Goodwin , who was later vilified for his role at the heart of the financial meltdown. \n“We were being pushed harder and harder and I realised that RBS was going to be another Enron,” remembers Gadhia, who was and remains based in Edinburgh. When her concerns were overruled, she picked up the phone to Richard Branson: “Within a week of making the call, I had a new role as CEO of Virgin Money , and I spent the next few months bringing my RBS colleagues over one at a time so I wouldn’t be accused of poaching them,” she chuckles. \nJayne-Anne Ghadi with Richard Branson - a major shareholder in Virgin Money \nEven for a banker or for anyone £3.65 million a year Gadhia chuckles a lot. She catches herself talking about having “fun” at work so often that she feels it incumbent to pause occasionally, and emphasize that she takes her position very seriously. \nOf that there is no doubt; but “fun” is very much the Virgin way to conquer the disillusioned masses, whether airline passengers or disgruntled savers. Earlier this year she launched the company’s hugely successful new Sex Pistols credit card, bearing the upfront legend “Never Mind the Bollocks”. \nShe might prefer Donny Osmond, but she is canny enough to realise he wouldn’t play as well with her core customer base. \nBy her own admission, Gadhia her surname comes from her accountant Indian husband, Ashok, known as Ash, whom she met at university has never been a Bransonite hipster. \nShe is, however, outspoken, fearless and driven; when she ran this year’s London Marathon (slow but steady and raising £65,000 in the process) she would get up at 4am at weekends so her training wouldn’t interfere with family time. \nTruth be told, she’s been doing battle with alpha males since her earliest teenage years. She grew up as an only child in the Midlands and when her parents moved to Norfolk they enrolled her in a fee-paying school, which had had just turned co-ed. Gadhia, who was among the first cohort of girls - and nearing 6ft tall at 14 - was mercilessly bullied by the boys, who would hide behind walls, jump out and scream in horror at her appearance, every day, before running away in pretend terror. \n“The confidence you see today is learned rather than natural,” she says crisply. “I used to lie in bed at night worrying about how to fit in. I never told my parents because they struggled to pay the fees, so I projected this image of happiness,” she says. \n“It was sink or swim and I refused to let myself be pushed under. I was good at passing exams so I threw myself into my schoolwork, which I loved. Over the years I’ve used my experience to fight back and never give up.” \nHer emotional resilience has reaped other rewards too. She and Ash, who have been together 35 years, have a 13-year-old daughter, Amy whom she describes as her “miracle”, given it took six rounds of IVF to conceive her. After a further six, which proved unsuccessful, she and her husband accepted that there would be no sibling. \nAsh gave up work when Amy was born, so he could stay at home and Gadhia could return within six weeks. It was, she says, a “big mistake”; she suffered severe post-natal depression. \n“I thought I could have it all and that a baby would just slot seamlessly into our lives,” smiles Gadhia, ruefully. “I think less of myself for having returned to the office [so quickly]. We need to work out what “having it all” means. I would say you can have everything you want, but not all at the same time; I wish I’d known that as a young woman.” \nConfession time: Ghadi is more into Donny Osmond than the Sex Pistols \nThese days, Gadhia is determined to put clear blue water between Virgin Money and conventional banks . Set up in 2007, it suffers none of the sins of their past: “We said ‘no’ to PPI. We weren’t involved in LIBOR manipulation. We are about doing things right and doing the right things,” she says. The bank motto “Everybody Better Off” is literally woven into the carpet in her office. “Most banks just want their shareholders to be better off.” \nInterestingly, she cavils at sweeping post-rationalisations that, had there been more female bankers, the financial meltdown would never have happened. \n“If I’m honest, it’s not just about women, it’s about diversity. When you walk into rooms and see a bunch of white, middle-aged men with similar educational backgrounds, is it any wonder if they all think in the same way and find it hard to change?” she asks rhetorically. \nGiven a new study, this week, revealed that the middle classes are protected by a “glass floor” once they reach positions of relative power, it would seem that one man’s floor is another man’s ceiling, just as much as it is a woman’s. \nShe’s keen to crack it for everyone: “Our customers aren’t all identical, they reflect our vibrant British society,” she says. “We, in turn, need to reflect that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T22:42:11.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
