Aggrieved clients are required to provide a string of paperwork to substantiate their claims and to be eligible for redress under the funds' detailed criteria.\nCap on claims The guarantee fund holds $103.7 million. But due to restrictions on the total claims that can be made involving any one market participant, claims relating to property entrusted with BBY are effectively capped at around $11 million, and if that is exceeded may be settled on a pro-rata basis.\nThe spokesman said while it was \"not practical\" to put in place bulk processing of BBY claims, due to the individual nature of losses, the SEGC was seeking to make the process more efficient.\n\"There are steps that the SEGC can take to make the process more efficient. For example, we are looking to appoint a panel of law firms that will be available to advise potential applicants,\" he said. \"Panel law firms will be across the detail of the application process and will undertake this work on pre-agreed terms.\"\nBBY went into voluntary administration in May and several of its main entities were placed into liquidation last month. The company collapsed after failing to repay a loan to lender St George, with a report to creditors suggesting BBY may have also been trading insolvent since June 2014. Creditors and clients are owed more than $40 million.\nOne former BBY client, who declined to be named, said last week he had to ring the guarantee fund six times and email three times just to receive a claim form.\nThe fund has also faced criticism for paying out just two claims in the wake of the global financial crisis. It had two claims being reviewed as at June 30 last year, but directors did not believe provisions needed to be made in relation those.\nThe ongoing client angst has litigation funders assessing whether to take up a BBY class action.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:05:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
