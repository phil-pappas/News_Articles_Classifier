Rob Homer Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow \"The bankers are back on top at Goldman Sachs,\" said the Wall Street Journal over the weekend.\nRival business media outlet Bloomberg went one further and anointed Goldman's chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, a billionaire ( worth US$1.1 billion , or $1.5 billion in our money).\nBut it's a different story Down Under, at least on the research side of Simon Rothery 's patch of the integrated bank.\nWe wrote on Friday about the departure of Goldman Sachs Australia's co-head of investment research, Christian Guerra . The well-regarded media and telco analyst's 15 years with the bank ended last week.\nEven the happy news that Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein is now a billionaire hasn't cheered up the miserable bastards at his operation Down Under. Rod Clement It turns out Guerra is far from the only recent Australian departure.\nThe highly experienced head of Goldman's institutional equites desk in Melbourne, Nicholas Fay , has also recently departed Rothery's shop in head scratching circumstances.\nOther recent departures include infrastructure and utilities analyst Andrew McCusker and property analyst Andrew MacFarlane. At least three associate analysts have also left.\nThe exodus has more than few very important clients confused. Some reckon the strategic decisions come out of Goldman's Hong Kong and New York offices.\n Whatever the cause, it has has lead to a noticeable slump in morale.\nIncredible as it seems, even the happy news that their ultimate boss Blankfein is now a billionaire doesn't seem to have cheered up the miserable bastards.", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-posts-weaker-results-1437046793", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-17/blankfein-becomes-billionaire-riding-goldman-s-shares-to-riches", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow"], "published": "2015-07-19T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T04:05:49.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
