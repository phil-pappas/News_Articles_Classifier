Nic Walker by Katarina Kroslakova When it comes to charitable causes, the founder and chairman of Aussie Home Loans John Symond leads by example.\nHow do we encourage people to share wealth?\nFor people who have been fortunate enough to achieve success in business and make a buck, I think there’s really an obligation to give back to society.\nI learnt at an early age that you’re in a far better position if you can afford to give, rather than have to put your hand out wanting help. I thank my lucky stars that I’m on the right side of the table now. That was different 20 years ago when I lost everything.\nI invite a lot of my friends to charity functions I put on at home, I take tables at charity dinners, invite people and a lot put their hand in their pocket. It’s the old story, you have to lead by example. Whether it’s in business or philanthropy, I try to set a good example. My kids have grown up knowing the importance of helping others. We’ll never help as many as we’d like, and I never push anyone to donate.\nDo people expect more in return for the philanthropic dollar today?\nPeople who I know are generous. They give and don’t expect anything back.\nYour favourite cause or charity?\n Sydney Children’s Hospital, Westmead, the arts – the art gallery, the symphony, opera … until recently I was chairman of the Sydney Opera House Trust. St Vincent’s Private Hospital recently built a new wing to treat youth in depression, it’s the only designated facility in the country for people under 30. [Symond pledged $2 million for the facility.]\nFirst luxury purchase ?\nI was always into cars, even as a youngster. My first car was a VW, then an MG, then an Alfa, then E-Ttype Jag in 1970. The list goes on.\nFavourite car now ?\nMy Bentley. Although I don’t drive it enough.\nYour idea of luxury ?\nI enjoy a beautiful home. I enjoy my art, I’m an avid art collector. I am very lucky to be able to live in a nice part of Australia, on Sydney Harbour, I’m fortunate enough to go onto the harbour in a nice boat. On holiday I like to stay at lovely hotels. At my age, now 67, I’ve worked damn hard for 40 years and am now in a position where I can spoil myself, but I wasn’t in a position to do so for a long time. So I’m a lucky guy. But I’m also sensitive to those who need help.\nFavourite drink ?\nRed wine. Although I don’t mind a Bailey’s on ice, as a nightcap.\nSeriously, Bailey’s? I pictured you as a whisky kind of guy.\nWell, my fiancee Amber [Keating] loves a whisky.\nThe first time we had dinner, I was trying to find the finest French champagne, and when she asked if I had a whisky instead, I nearly fell over.\nDo you have a favourite watch?\nI own a number of watches. Today I’m wearing a Breguet.\nFavourite technology?\niPhone.\nYour favourite way to travel ?\nDefinitely on a plane.\nPointy end?\nOh yes. Although I recently travelled with the kids and we went business class. It was still OK. But if you can afford the pointy end, why not?\nMost inspiring place to visit?\nSouth of France.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T10:09:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
