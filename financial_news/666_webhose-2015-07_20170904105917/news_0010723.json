By Richard Evans | Telegraph – 16 minutes ago 0.0015 0.0000 \nComment: The bubble in the Shanghai market is deflating. Should I sell my Asia funds now, wonders Richard Evans \nAs China’s stock market bubble deflates , what should investors with money in the region do? \nThis is a question of more than professional interest for me, as I have quite a large proportion of one of my Sipps (self-invested pensions) in Asia funds. \nMany investors, of course, have more direct exposure via funds that invest exclusively in Chinese shares. \n• Chinese markets bounce back as Beijing steps in \nIt’s always frightening when stock markets fall sharply and it’s a natural human instinct to want to sell before prices fall further. \nBut I’m inclined to hang on and I think there are a few points worth making to anyone tempted to sell. \nFirst (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) , the Chinese market is still massively higher than it was a year ago. The only people who have lost money, assuming that their fund has performed roughly in line with the Shanghai stock market, are those who invested after mid-March this year, when the bubble really started to get going. \nOf course further falls are possible, even likely. Investors happy to trade in and out could well make money by selling their China or Asia funds now in the hope of buying back more cheaply in, say, a few weeks or months. But we don’t know when the market will stop falling, so such an approach could backfire. \nChinese stocks put on ice in attempt to stem market crash \nAs a long-term investor, I prefer to pick a fund whose manager I trust and hold on through the ups and downs essentially a “buy and forget” approach. \nBut I also want a balanced portfolio, including all the major regions of the world. I certainly don’t want to miss out on the opportunities for growth in Asia, which despite all the volatility still has huge scope to grow. \nMy Asia funds Aberdeen Asia Pacific & Japan Equity and First State Asia Pacific Leaders have both produced positive if unspectacular returns since I bought them a few years ago. In fact, over that period they have underperformed my UK and European funds. But over the next decade or so I hope and expect them to reflect at least some of the economic dynamism of Asian countries. \nI wouldn’t be at all surprised if my funds fell to some degree as the current turmoil on the Shanghai market plays out. But I’d rather remain invested than risk quitting at the wrong time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T15:03:00.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
