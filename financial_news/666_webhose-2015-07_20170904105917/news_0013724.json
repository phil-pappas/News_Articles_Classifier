In the commercial, the Dubai-based carrier references the legendary service of Pan Am's Jet Clippers of the 1950s and 60s.

For what it's worth, Emirates — along with fellow Middle Eastern carriers Qatar and Etihad — is embroiled in a contentious dispute with a coalition of US airlines. American, Delta, and United Airlines accuse the Gulf trio of having received more than $42 billion in government subsidies over the past decade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T00:39:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
