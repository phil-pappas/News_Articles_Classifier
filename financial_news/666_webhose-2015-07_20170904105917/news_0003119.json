Editor's Pick   NEW DELHI: In a significant simplification of the foreign direct investment regime, the union cabinet is expected to clear a proposal to do away with the distinction between different types of foreign investments through a composite cap on all kinds of foreign investments. The cabinet is expected to consider the proposal in a meeting on Thursday. The simplification, aimed at promoting ease of doing business in India, was announced by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the budget for the current fiscal. The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), the nodal agency in charge of foreign investment in the country, has moved the proposal for consideration. \"Investors want clarity in policies for safety of their investments. The aim is to attract foreign investment by clearing ambiguity in the existing FDI policy related to sectoral caps and conditionality,\" said a government official. The composite foreign investment caps will encompass all types of foreign investments. These will include foreign portfolio investment, NRI investment and depository receipts, and also include foreign currency convertible bonds and fully and mandatorily convertible preference shares or debentures. \"To further simplify the procedures for Indian companies to attract foreign investments, I propose to do away with the distinction between different types of foreign investments, especially between foreign portfolio investments and foreign direct investments, and replace them with composite caps,\" Jaitley had said while presenting the budget in February. DIPP had floated the note for inter-ministerial consultation last year but met with resistance from certain quarters including the departments of pharmaceuticals and economic affairs. Composite cap is already applicable to sectors including defence, telecom and insurance. India is ranked a poor 142 out of 189 countries in the World Bank's doing business index. The government is aiming to break into the top 50 in the next two years. In the past few months, the government has liberalised FDI regime in sectors including medical devices, construction, railways, defence and insurance. The government had in April raised the FDI threshold to Rs 3,000 crore from the earlier limit of Rs 1,200 crore, requiring cabinet approval that will help attract bigticket investment in infrastructure and manufacturing sectors. India has seen a significant growth in FDI inflows since the launch of Make in India campaign, recording a 48 per cent growth between October 2014 and April 2015. The FDI inflow under the approval route saw a growth of 87 per cent during 2014-15 with an inflow of $2.22 billion.
