Photo: Supplied\nBetween a bidding war over iiNet , and TPG Telecom's attempt to block the merger between Vocus and Amcom , the telecommunications industry has drawn plenty of attention of late.\nHowever, there's one smaller telecommunications company still flying under the radar, at least relatively speaking.\nBut just because it's small, doesn't mean it's unproven. In fact, MyNetFone (ASX: MNF), an Australian telco with a market capitalisation of $234 million that specialises in voice over internet protocol (VOIP) services, has already laid down an impressive track record.\nFor starters, the share price is up around 35 times in five years, making long-term shareholders a very happy bunch. More importantly, profits are up by more than 17 times in the same period.\nAdvertisement One of the reasons we like MyNetFone is that it benefits from the ongoing guidance of its founders, and one of them, Rene Sugo, is still CEO. But arguably, losing the current management team is one of the biggest risks facing the business.\nThat's because the history of MyNetFone shows that its management knows how to spot an opportunity - and take it. To wit, the company started by selling cheap VOIP packages to residential customers in Tasmania. However, the game-changing acquisition of Symbio, a wholesaler also founded by Mr Sugo and Andy Fung, catapulted the company onto the national stage.\nImportantly, this acquisition was on fair terms for \"mum and dad\" shareholders in MyNetFone, demonstrating that the directors (who are all shareholders) have a lot of integrity. Not all related-party acquisitions are so fortuitous for the retail investors who are invested in the listed company. Where directors and managers can empirically demonstrate they have acted in shareholders' interests in the past, it's likely they will continue in the same vein.\nOrganic and acquisitive growth The next stage of MyNetFone's development was a mixture of organic growth and growth by acquisition.\nThree smaller business purchases were funded by issuing shares in MyNetFone at what, in hindsight, was a very attractive price for the new investors. The acquisitions were integrated successfully, and the profits came rolling in, once again signalling that these directors know how to make a good purchase. And the company continued to pitch its services, with some success, to enterprise and government.\nMore recently, the company has focused on growing its margins by selling value-added services. That means that they're providing the VOIP billing and management capabilities to other smaller operators for a monthly fee, providing cheaper voice services to small and medium enterprises, as well as wholesaling VOIP minutes from Symbio. The software-based, value-added services fetch a higher margin, and make the wholesale customers more likely to stay.\nHaving implemented this strategy in Australia, MyNetFone is taking it international with the purchase of Telecom New Zealand International . In contrast to past purchases, the company has decided to use $25 million of debt to fund the acquisition. While this is absolutely the right move, given past successes, it does increase risks, because the business was previously debt free. More recently, the company took advantage of a buoyant share price to raise $15 million at $3.70 a share, and we can't help but note that three of the four board members sold shares just prior to the private placement, albeit at slightly higher prices.\nNonetheless, the international expansion could generate significant value for shareholders. Telecom New Zealand International has 220 partners spanning four continents, and if MyNetFone can sell a significant number of its high margin value-added services, then the acquisition price will pay off in spades.\nFoolish takeaway MyNetFone is not going cheap. Having said that, I wouldn't bet against it. After all, the business has good economics, an international growth pathway and top-notch management. That's the kind of small-cap you can hold for the long term.\nInvestors, don't miss out: Low interest rates mean dividend-paying shares are very attractive, compared to term deposits.
