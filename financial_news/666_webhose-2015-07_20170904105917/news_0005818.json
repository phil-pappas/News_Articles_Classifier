According to FSFE, this offering is the first of its kind in the US and gives employers options for traditional or voluntary programs. The firm's traditional financial wellness programs are employer-paid while their new offering is employee-paid.\n\"The vast majority of employers want to offer some type of financial wellness program to their employees,\" said company president, Travis Freeman. \"Now they have the freedom of choice to fit their budget and their needs. This will expand the horizon of the financial wellness industry,\" added Freeman.\nThe voluntary program, called PlanWell, was launched after FSFE discovered that 59% of employees were \"likely\" to share \"some cost in a financial wellness program if it could help them toward their financial goals\" in their 2015 FSFE Financial Wellness Survey. Another 25.8% of employees answered \"possibly\" to the same question. A total of 572 employees were surveyed.\nPlanWell is being offered to employers on a limited basis through the remainder of 2015. Those interested in learning more may contact Anna Fruits, Director of Marketing, at Anna.Fruits(at)FSFE(dot)com.\nAbout Four Seasons Financial Education Four Seasons Financial Education provides workplace financial wellness services to companies throughout the US to help them improve their bottom line.
