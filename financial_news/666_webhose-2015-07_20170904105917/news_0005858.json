Nifty stayed above this level throughout this week and closed at 8,609.85, up 2.98% from the last week’s closing. On Friday, Nifty opened at 8,623.65, touched a high of 8,642.95 and a low of 8,593.15 before closing at 8,609.85. The S & P BSE Sensex closed this week at 28,463.31, up 3.0%. The Sensex opened Friday at 28,480.92 and touched a high of 28,576.32 and a low of 28,417.46. The Bank Nifty closed this week at 19,094.70, up 2.0%. On Friday, Bank Nifty opened at 19,175.30 and touched a high of 19,229.05 and a low of 19,069.30. Over the week, the indices have performed, as fears about Greece’s exit from Eurozone and a crash of Chinese market, abated. On Monday, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras accepted a compromise on German-led demands for the sequestration of Greek state assets to be sold off to pay down debt. With the Greece deal being struck, indices were up by around 1% in Monday’s trading. European Council President Donald Tusk said that EU leaders had unanimously reached an agreement on a third bailout for the cash-strapped southern European country of Greece. This was positive news for stock markets worldwide. On Tuesday, it was a listless day of trading with a flat close after lower-than-expected retail inflation data dampened hopes of an interest rate cut by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) next month. Rise in food and fuel prices propelled India's retail inflation to 5.40% in June from 5.01% in May, official data showed. Foreign funds were net sellers of $87 million on Tuesday. Good buying was observed in IT and healthcare sectors, while selling pressure was seen in auto and banking sectors. In Wednesday’s trading, Nifty and Sensex closed with healthy gains while Bank Nifty was subdued. Expectations of a rate cut in August by the Reserve Bank of India and cheaper oil imports from Iran cheered investor sentiments which led the Sensex to gain more than 265 points on Wednesday. The uptrend continued in Thursday’s trading, as positive global and domestic cues lifted investors' sentiments. Sensex gained more than 247 points on Thursday. On Friday, S & P BSE Sensex and CNX Nifty closed in the green, while Bank Nifty closed marginally in the red.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T17:55:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
