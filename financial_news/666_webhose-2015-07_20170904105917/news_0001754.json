These crimes include hijackings, house robberies and now the murder.\" \n\"This has been discussed at CPF meetings and we have asked that the current commander provide us with a plan to combat this and bring it under control. \n\"To date, the only commitment we have had is that the members are running extra patrols. To the members' credit, they have made a few good arrests related to certain crimes,\" Myers said. \nMyers said that over four months ago, when the last station commander had been promoted and was expected to leave the province, he had tried to approach the cluster commander of the area to apprise her of his concerns. \n'Lacking quality leadership' \nHe alleges that the commander cancelled one meeting and didn't show to the second. \n\"I have never received an apology. This is especially offensive, as members of the CPF like myself are businessmen that volunteer our time to the cause and can at times ill afford the waste of time.\" \n\"The main point I wanted to make to the cluster commander was that they had a very well managed station in Westville and that it would be a feather in their cap if they appointed the right commander to take over and maintain the management level. \n\"This meeting has never transpired and with the recent events we are even more determined to ensure that the right person be appointed to the job, so far as to say is that we would like to be part of the interview and selection panel,\" he said. \n\"Westville has some really good policemen, going even as far as to say the vast majority of them. These members work extremely hard at fighting crime in Westville and work very closely with the community and the CPF members. \n\"It is, however, becoming very evident that these members are lacking quality leadership and it is impacting on their morale. \n\"If it wasn't for their commitment to the community, I think these members would be falling into a huge hole. \n\"To be quite honest, I don't think the acting station commander understands just what a crisis the station is in. \n\"As the chairman of the CPF I must thank all the committed and passionate policemen and women at the station on behalf of the CPF and the community. They are Westville's valuable assets and need to be looked after,\" he said. \nAll the allegations were put to the police through official spokesperson Major Thulani Zwane, who acknowledged receipt of the e-mail but had not been able to comment at the time of publishing. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:09:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
