It was not immediately clear Friday if Jamaica's deal will retire all of its Petrocaribe debt. \nThe finance ministry said this week's bond issue transaction was \"the largest capital markets fundraising ever undertaken by the government of Jamaica.\" \nJamaica's Petrocaribe settlement is similar to one the Dominican Republic negotiated with Venezuela earlier this year. That Caribbean country dismissed $4 billion in Petrocaribe debt in exchange for $2 billion. \nOn Thursday, IMF Communications Director Gerry Rice said the organization supports Jamaica's debt buyback. \n\"It's an important step in reducing the value of the country's public debt and will help to put debt firmly on a downward trajectory,\" Rice told reporters. \nJamaica is in the third year of a four-year $930 million loan package with the International Monetary Fund and it has passed consecutive tests without shortfalls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T03:09:53.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
