During the quarter, revenues increased by 11.6% to 126,238 million yen compared with the same period last year. Pre-tax profit for the quarter was 30,901 million yen, while profit for this quarter was 23,650 million yen, both of which marked gains of 37.7% and 31.7%, respectively. \nIn the Information Technology segment, demand for semiconductor- and liquid crystal panel-related products drove sales expansion. On the other hand, sales in volume terms of glass disks for HDDs decreased due to the PC market downturn. Among imaging-related products, the Company is developing applications other than digital cameras, and sales overall held firm. In the Life Care segment, sales in the eyeglass lens business expanded mainly due to expansion in overseas markets. The contact lens retail business reported a major increase recovering from negative impact of Japan’s tax hike last year. In the medical related products businesses, sales of medical endoscopes weakened, however, in part because of the ongoing recovery sales in the intraocular lenses business for cataract surgery, overall sales were generally strong. In addition, along with the positive impact of the depreciation of the yen, segment sales rose year on year. \n\"Eyeglass business achieved favorable growth. Especially in Europe our steady sales efforts became successful,” said Hiroshi Suzuki, chief executive officer of HOYA. “As for overall business result, we increased profit while revenue declined. This is mainly because we took swift measurement last year such as consolidation of production sites.” \nHOYA also announced the forecast for the first six months ending September 30, 2015 as shown below.
