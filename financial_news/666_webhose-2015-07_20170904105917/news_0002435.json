Sam Richmond Brown, portfolio manager for the Natixis Seeyond Multi Asset Allocation Fund, expects the VIX -- also known as the \"fear index\" -- to make a comeback in the coming months as the Federal Reserve starts gently accelerating its efforts to sop up the liquidity it injected into the system during the financial crisis. \n\"There is still a lot of stimulus in the system,\" said Brown. \"Going forward, some of that is retracted from the U.S. and as things do diverge both from a monetary policy standpoint and also growth standpoint, we would expect, logically, the VIX to increase back to its historical levels, because it's obviously well below that currently.\" \nThe VIX jumped above 18 this week after spending most of 2015 below 14. The Natixis Seeyond Multi Asset Allocation Fund, down nearly 1% so far this year, invests in volatility as an asset class in order to manage risk or generate a non-correlated source of return. \nBut while he expects the ride to be bumpy and advises that investors protect themselves, Brown is still constructive on stocks. \nMust Read: Greece-Inspired Volatility Proves Value of Alternative Mutual Funds \n\"We think there's light at the end of the tunnel,\" said Brown. \"The U.S. economy and U.S. growth should remain supportive and we see also opportunities in Europe with low euro, low oil, low inflation, additional QE, which should play into, obviously, the equity markets in the eurozone, and so we remain constructive on equities. We think that an interesting tool to have within the portfolio is a currency positioning in the dollar, so we've been long dollar for a while, which we believe is a more effective trade then piling on additional interest rates.\" \nAs for Greece and its impact on the market, Brown believes there is more to Europe than a single troubled country. And when it comes to the emerging markets, Brown said he is finding better opportunities elsewhere. \n\"We think there are greater risks than opportunities in emerging markets,\" said Brown. \"We also view potential currency weakening. Increasing percentage of foreign debt to GDP ratios in these regions is a real risk, so we don't have a very constructive view on emerging markets currently.\" Check Out Our Best Services for Investors \nPortfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.
