We are waiting to see which proposals the Greek government makes to its European partners,\" he said. \nAnd Seibert played down the significance of the resignation of Greece's flamboyant finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who repeatedly attacked the reforms-for-aid strategy championed by Berlin. \n\"It is not about people but rather positions,\" he said. \nAsked how Merkel felt about Varoufakis leaving the stage, Seibert gave a tart response: \"Varoufakis was never an interlocutor of the chancellor so I won't comment on his departure or any feelings. I don't think there were any.\" \nIn an opening statement, Seibert said Berlin had \"acknowledged the clear 'No' vote\" in Sunday's referendum and \"respected\" it. \n\"Of course the German government remains ready to talk, as the chancellor said last week in the Bundestag (lower house of parliament), the door for talks remains open,\" he said. \nBut he and Jaeger stressed that the terms laid out by Greece's creditors had not changed. \nSeibert called Sunday's vote \"a rejection of the principle that has governed aid to countries (stricken eurozone members), the principle that solidarity and reforms go hand-in-hand\". \n\"The German government remains true to this principle,\" Seibert said, adding that other debt-mired countries had seen \"major progress\" through budgetary discipline and structural reforms. \nMerkel is due in Paris later Monday for talks with French President Francois Hollande ahead of an extraordinary eurozone summit Tuesday in Brussels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T14:00:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
