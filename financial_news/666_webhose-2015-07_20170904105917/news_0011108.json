Consumer credit grew 7.6 percent year-on-year, the biggest rise since April 2006. \nDespite only weak rises in wages for much of the past five years, Britain's economic recovery is still heavily reliant on spending by households. \nA separate survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed British annual retail sales growth slowed in July, despite a big rise in clothing purchases, and is expected to weaken further next month.
