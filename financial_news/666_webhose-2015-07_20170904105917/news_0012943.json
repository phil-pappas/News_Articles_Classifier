Photo: Jessica Shapiro\nIOOF has paid $2.8 million in compensation to 57 customers of its authorised financial planners during the past two years, as more evidence comes to light about the company's oversight and compliance.\nFairfax Media can reveal several planners authorised through IOOF's subsidiaries have been banned from being financial advisers in the past 10 years, with at least one spending 21 months in jail for defrauding clients.\nAll the planners were working for a subsidiary of IOOF or Australian Wealth Management (AWM), which IOOF purchased in 2009. Chris Kelaher was appointed IOOF chief executive in 2009 after running AWM since 1989.\nThe revelations come as Mr Kelaher fronts a Senate hearing on Tuesday to answer questions that relate to allegations of misconduct by senior IOOF staff, including insider trading, claims of front-running, misrepresentation of performance figures, and junior staff asked to cheat on training and compliance modules on behalf of their boss.\nAdvertisement IOOF is believed to have reported 13 adviser-related breaches to ASIC in the past two years, with the company contacting 89 customers of those advisers to see if they had any concerns about their advice.\nAn IOOF spokesman claimed only eight client files of the group of 89 were found to have issues with their advice. He said following further contact from the company, the customers said they were satisfied with the advice they had received from their planner and required no remediation.\nThe company has also confirmed that since mid-2013, 57 IOOF customers have been compensated to the tune of $2.8 million after client complaints. It is unclear whether these clients were compensated as a result of private legal action, or because of breach reports filed before mid-2013.\nIOOF has released statements in the past few weeks saying that, to the best of the company's knowledge, no client has lost money because of its compliance issues.\nThere has been a string of financial planning scandals in the past few years, including CBA, which reported 16 planners to ASIC for \"significant breaches\" and five breach reports filed by National Australia Bank.\nCBA and NAB have more financial planners than IOOF, which has the sixth-biggest network with 1120 advisers operating under its brands including Bridges Financial, Plan B, My Adviser, Lonsdale Financial, Consultum, Ord Minnett and Wealth Managers.\nIt is also unclear how many planners operating under IOOF's brands have been terminated. Fairfax Media has uncovered several examples of planners being moved on from IOOF's brands without breach reports being filed.\nAustralian court registries identify legal actions brought by disgruntled clients that are either on foot or have been settled in favour of the client, with at least two of those planners involved never being subject to a breach report.\nIn Perth, Consultum settled a $1.4 million claim brought by the Broadhurst family in 2010 against planner Anthony Torre and Consultum over their investment in MFS Premium Income Fund in 2007. Mr Torre, who bills himself on his blog as having completed \"24 glorious years of supremacy in the financial world\", declined to comment.\nIOOF confirmed to Fairfax Media: \"No breach report was filed with ASIC as there was no evidence of a breach having occurred.\"\n\"Consultum is currently responding to a number of complaints from Mr Torre's clients and these will be dealt with objectively and fairly,\" the spokesman said.\nAnother planner, David Williams Griffiths, of Perth, joined Consultum as an authorised financial adviser only four months after his ban from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission for poor compliance and record keeping lapsed in 2006.\nA spokesman for IOOF said the company thoroughly vetted Mr Griffiths before he joined Consultum, adding: \"One client complaint was received while Mr Griffiths was authorised by Consultum\". Mr Griffiths, who stopped working with Consultum in 2011, has not returned Fairfax Media calls or emails.\nMeanwhile in Brisbane, the Dyne family is suing Consultum planner Andrew Duncan Bird for $1.6 million, over the allegedly poor advice he gave to them while he was at My Adviser between 2002 and 2012.\nCourt documents show Mr Bird advised the Dynes to invest in a unit trust that owned a subdivision that allegedly had no planning overlay. Mr Bird also allegedly failed to disclose to the Dynes that he owned the majority of the units in the trust.\nMr Bird declined to comment. IOOF's spokesman said the claim was being defended \"on the basis that no recommendation was made to clients in respect of this investment\".\nFairfax Media has also identified three planners who have worked at an IOOF subsidiary during its ownership of that subsidiary who have been banned, including Alan Leslie Brown, who was sentenced to three years for fraud, Ki Suk Humphrey, who was banned for five years and Justin Robert Fraser, who was banned for six months after a remuneration dispute with the company. Mr Brown and Mrs Humphrey could not be reached. Mr Fraser declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T01:10:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
