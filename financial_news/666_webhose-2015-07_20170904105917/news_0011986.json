Because it was a short-term situation, Mead agreed to rent out two extra bedrooms. \n\"We had a blast. It was so much fun I decided to get over myself and start thinking about my space in a new way,\" said Mead, 68, whose career interests helped her see her situation differently. She still does some organizational effectiveness and change management consulting after retiring from a similar position in local government. \nHousing wealth accounts for a big chunk of retirees' net worth, but tapping that wealth can be fraught with as much emotional baggage as financial -- one reason some financial advisers shy away from pushing the issue with clients. \n\"Most of the time the money aspect of it is just a rationale that they use to justify what they're doing,\" said Dan Moisand, a financial adviser and principal with Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo in Florida. Advertisement \nOther times, he said, downsizing isn't the windfall many retirees expect, particularly in markets where home price gains are modest. \nThrough a fledgling online introduction service targeted to women, roommates4boomers.com Mead began corresponding in January with Deborah Halverson, 57, a nurse who recently relocated to Denver to be near family. The pair hit it off and Halverson moved in last month after completing an apartment lease. For now, at least, industry entrepreneurs say demand for elder shared housing is largely among single women. \nThe arrangement cut Halverson's housing costs by a little more than half, and it covers about half of Mead's monthly mortgage payment. \nRooms for rent typically generate about half the going rate of a one-bedroom apartment, said Bonnie Moore, founder of goldengirlsnetwork.com . (Moore and Karen Venable, founder of roommates4boomers.com strongly recommend clients check the backgrounds of any potential candidates before sharing personal information. They and several home sharers we spoke with also suggested detailed meetings about how expenses like cleaning services, food and alcohol will be shared.) \nOther retirees are leveraging the home-sharing concept in different ways. \nIn Chicago, a small company called Point in Time ( pointintimellc.com is developing shuttered Catholic convents into upscale shared rental housing for people 62 and up. Each one will house about a dozen residents, with private bedrooms but common kitchen and living areas. Together, the groups will decide what shared services, such as chefs and vehicles, they wish to purchase. \nSome retirees are offering reduced rents in exchange for tenant-provided handyman or other services. \nFinancial adviser Sheryl Garrett, founder of the Garrett Planning Network, remembers talking with a 62-year-old client about potentially needing to downsize her home and rent a smaller apartment. \n\"When we finally got to the bottom of it, we realized she wouldn't be saving much if she moved out and paid rent,\" Garrett said. \"What she really needed was a live-in handyman, so she made a few upgrades in her basement and found a tenant who could pay a little rent and take over shoveling the walks, mowing the lawn and other jobs.\" \nTo find him, Garrett advised her client to contact her county aging department. Many of these departments screen potential candidates, but it is still important to check out anyone you are considering thoroughly. Another good source is the National Shared Housing Resource Center ( nationalsharedhousing.org .) \nBringing on the tenant bought her client time to stay where she really wanted to live, and it preserved her ability to pick up more home equity over time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T06:52:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
