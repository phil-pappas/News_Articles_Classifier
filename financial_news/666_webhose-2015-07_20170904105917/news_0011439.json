Elizabeth Parker by Bina Brown Top 10 Australian growth stocks How to succeed in a low-growth environment Continuing uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets will ensure some investors leave the decision making about which stocks to buy to the professionals.\nWith the long-term expectations of leading asset consultants slightly higher for global equities than domestic equities, international fund managers or Australian equity managers with exposure to overseas revenues are seen as offering some of the best potential.\nNotwithstanding Greece's debt problems, some of the greatest opportunity is seen among European stocks, while steady growth is continuing in the United States, adding strength to the outlook for US companies.\nOther fund strategies expected to do well in this environment of enhanced volatility are equity long/short managers because they're able selectively to buy the shares that are expected to outperform and short-sell those that are expected to underperform.\nMarket neutral funds – which may use traditional long/short strategies to deliver returns independent of the performance of the sharemarket – may also be well positioned in this low-growth environment, says Zenith Investment Partners senior investment analyst Rodney Sebire.\nThe combination of higher investment exposures provides greater scope for specialist managers of long/short and market neutral funds to generate returns, he says, as well as the ability to profit from underperforming stocks.\nFrontier senior consultant Rob Hogg says many of the usual forms of downside protection (such as fixed income) may not operate in a diversified portfolio in the traditional way. So investors should look to managers using other sources of protection such as options. Hogg says managers with exposure to property and infrastructure are also likely to be well placed.\n According to the latest Rice Warner survey of leading asset consultants, the two asset classes expected to have the highest long-term returns are emerging markets (with an expected median return of 9.5 per cent a year) and private equity (9.4 per cent). They were also the two asset classes expected to experience the highest levels of volatility.\nAlso expected to generate high long-term returns are unhedged international equities (8 per cent a year), mortgages (8 per cent), infrastructure (7.7 per cent) and Australian equities (7.7 per cent).\nPrescott Securities equities specialist Travis Adams expects high quality international equities to be the key to unlocking higher rates of growth.\n\"Platinum and Magellan are often willing to take a compelling offering to their customers through challenging their own systems and process delivery. This will attract the higher rates of growth and be the best places for investor capital in a low-growth environment that Australia may be facing,\" says Adams.\nJust because investors choose to invest in active Australian equity managers doesn't mean they won't be exposed to economic growth overseas.\n\"The globalisation and interconnectivity of markets in general means that the average Australian listed company doesn't just do business in Australia,\" says Zenith's lead analyst on the Australian equities sector, Quan Nguyen. \"Where a company is listed versus where a company does business and generates revenues is a concept that the majority of Australian equities managers are fully embracing, particularly given Australian economic growth has been relatively benign.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T08:23:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
