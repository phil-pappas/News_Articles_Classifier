Many times, stocks are off investors’ radar screens for a reason, though there are some hidden gems that could be worth uncovering by those with a high risk tolerance. \nOne way to find these underappreciated stocks is by looking at companies that haven’t seen their share prices move higher lately, but have observed analysts raising earnings estimates for their stock. This trend could signal that investors haven’t quite embraced the rising estimate story yet, but that the potential for a big move higher is definitely there. \nOne such company that looks well positioned for a solid gain, but has been overlooked by investors lately, is Silver Standard Resources Inc. (SSRI). This mining - silver stock has actually seen estimates rise over the past month for the current fiscal year by over 100%. But that is not yet reflected in its price, as the stock lost 3.2% over the same time frame. \nYou should not be concerned about the price remaining muted going forward. This year’s expected earnings growth over the prior year is significant, which should ultimately translate into price appreciation. \nAnd if this isn’t enough, SSRI currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) which further underscores the potential for its outperformance (See the performance of Zacks' portfolios and strategies here: About Zacks Performance). \nSo if you are looking for a stock flying under-the-radar that is well-equipped to bounce down the road, make sure to consider Silver Standard Resources. Solid estimate revisions and an impressive Zacks Rank suggest that better days may be ahead for SSRI and that now might be an interesting buying opportunity. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
