CP has argued that it should not be held responsible for the tragedy. \nUnlike other companies targeted by a Lac-Megantic-related class action lawsuit, CP did not agree to the settlement and challenged the provincial court's jurisdiction in approving the deal. CP also asked the court in Canada's French-language province to shield it from future litigation. \nIn his judgment, Quebec Superior Court Justice Gaetan Dumas dismissed CP's motion as a \"not so subtle attempt\" to disrupt a settlement that called for C$430 million in compensation for victims of the rail tragedy. \nAlthough CP is not part of the fund and thus would not be on the hook for any of the promised funds, it is being threatened by a separate lawsuit. \nA spokesman for CP said the company is currently reviewing the judge's decision and has no further comment at this time. \n($1 = 1.2741 Canadian dollars) (With additional writing by Allison Martell; Editing by Christian Plumb)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T21:24:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
