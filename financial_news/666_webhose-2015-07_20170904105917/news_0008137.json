these concerns include issues of potential unlawful conduct and/or serious management failings.\n\"The Lenders will not consider resuming debt funding until NewSat demonstrates more direct action to address on a deeper level the underlying management and corporate governance weaknesses which appear to be persistent at NewSat.\"\nDeutsche Bank also asked the NewSat board to explain \"incidents of potential mismanagement\" such as \"related party transactions, remuneration and disclosure\" and detail how it would prevent re-occurrence.\nDays after the letter was sent, NewSat's three independent directors and then chief financial officer flew to Washington to meet EXIM Bank executives who demanded the removal of Mr Ballintine and Mr Green as a condition of the bank's relationship with NewSat continuing.\nAn EXIM spokeswoman this week confirmed the demand was made in December and repeated in February.\nBut Mr Ballintine was still chief executive when NewSat collapsed in April and Mr Green was still listed as chairman however it is understood he had stopped attending meetings and fellow director Fred Grimwade acted in his role.\nMr Ballintine and Mr Green had a close working relationship, with the chairman approving the chief executive's lavish expenses, awarding him a $1.2 million bonus last year on top of his $1.07 million salary, and, according to several sources, lobbied to get Mr Ballintine membership of the exclusive Melbourne Club.\nIn response to questions from BusinessDay , Mr Ballintine said the EXIM Bank considered each and every allegation in the Ferrier Hodgson report and \"determined to note the contents\".\n\"Following discussions with the independent directors and EXIM, I indicated I was prepared to continue with NewSat as founder / head of strategy and also aware that Richard Green was prepared to stand aside in favour of Fred Grimwade as chairman of NewSat and that these positional changes were dependant on certain waiver conditions being implemented. I was not required to relinquish the role until the waiver conditions were agreed and met.\"\nHe also maintained his comments in the Business Spectator interview were accurate. Mr Ballintine told Business Spectator \"our shareholders have had a very, very rough time from the lenders.\"\nThe Deutsche Bank letter also raised the apparently mistaken $357,000 payment from NewSat's Jabiru-1 satellite account to Mr Ballintine's personal tax adviser, BMK Partners, which also did some work for NewSat. BMK Partner's Jason Cullen is the chief financial officer of Mr Ballintine's Cresta Motor Yachts business.\nIt also raised Mr Ballintine's failure to comply with a condition of the August 2014 waiver which required him to pay a $558,000 bill to the Australian Taxation Office arising from his $1.2 million bonus by November 15 last year.\n\"Mr Ballintine did not repay that amount. In addition, it appears NewSat does not intend to enforce the promissory note covering Mr Ballintine's PAYG obligation, which was put in place as a contingency in the event that Mr Ballintine failed to pay the amount in full when due,\" the letter stated.\n\"That the PAYG amount remains unpaid is obviously concerning (particularly given the potential for action against the company by the Australian Taxation Office). Moreover, the lenders are concerned that this issue reveals persistent problems with the corporate culture and leadership of NewSat.\"\nAt the same time as Mr Ballintine was declining to pay the tax bill arising from his bonus and accepted a $915,000 loan from NewSat, he was able to loan Cresta more than $2.6 million, according to Cresta's 2014 balance sheet.\nBusinessDay can also reveal the extent of Mr Ballintine's business relationship with a Greek-Cypriot businessman paid almost $12 million by NewSat to secure orbital satellite slots from the Cyprus government.\nCompany records show Greek-Cypriot businessman Angelos Pieri to be a shareholder in Cresta, alongside several other extraordinarily well remunerated former NewSat directors, consultants and shareholders.\nThe revelation of Mr Pieri's involvement in Cresta comes as Mr Ballintine has put his luxurious Gold Coast waterfront mansion on the market for $3.495 million.\nMr Ballintine said he told the NewSat board of Mr Pieri's small shareholding in Cresta and interest in giving the company a Mediterranean presence. Other senior former NewSat figures are adamant no such disclosure was made to the board.\nInternal NewSat documents show Mr Pieri's Kyprosat company had received almost $12 million in cash and shares from NewSat between 2011 and 2015 in return for securing orbital slots from the Cyprus government for the Australian company's planned satellites to use. Kyprosat had been sub-licensed by the Cypriot government.\nA NewSat briefing paper prepared in November last year regarding a proposed new deal with Kyprosat reveals a lump sum payment by NewSat of 1 million euro, an increase in the monthly payment to Kyprosat to 57,000 euro and the issuance of a further 2.5 million NewSat shares to the Cyprus company. These new payments were approved in January.\nA damning review by consultant Brendan Rudd on behalf of NewSat's previous independent directors Andrew Plympton, Mark Fishwick and Brendan Fleiter in mid-2014 also raised the issue of the payments to Kyprosat, warning that five of NewSat's eight slots were soon to lapse and that the Cyprus company was refusing to do anything unless it was paid more money.\n\"It is highly questionable whether the remaining slots are worth this amount. The management of this activity has been appalling and there is a significant difference between company statements made publicly regarding the value of these slots and their real value,\" Mr Rudd wrote.\nDespite Mr Ballintine last week claiming that Mr Rudd's review was not provided to the NewSat board last year and instead was given to EXIM Bank, BusinessDay has confirmed that Mr Rudd gave his review to the trio of independent directors, as well as NewSat's then chief financial officer, Michael Hewins.\nMr Plympton, Mr Fleiter and Mr Fishwick resigned from the board on June 30 last year. They were replaced as independent directors by Roderick Sage, Fred Grimwade and Patrick McVeigh.\nMr Pieri and Mr Green did not respond to questions.", "external_links": ["https://www.scribd.com/embeds/272455908/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&show_recommendations=true"], "published": "2015-07-24T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T23:25:11.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
