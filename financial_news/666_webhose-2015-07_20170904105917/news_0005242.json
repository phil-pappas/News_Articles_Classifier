This report offers a precise incisive profile of Ireland's mobile and fixed telecommunications markets based on comprehensive proprietary data and insights from our research in the Irish market. Published annually this presentation-quality executive-level report provides detailed analysis of the near-term opportunities competitive dynamics and evolution of demand by service type and technology/platform across the fixed telephony broadband and mobile sectors as well as a review of key regulatory trends.\n\nKey Findings \n- In 2014 Ireland's telecom services market generated US3.3bn in service revenue or 1.3% of GDP making Ireland one of the smallest markets in Western Europe (WE). We expect to see overall service revenue grow at a 4.3% CAGR from 2015 to 2020 to 3.2bn.\n\n- Competition in the Irish telecom market has intensified in the past three years as a result of the reorganization of the sector following the economic crisis. In June 2014 3 Ireland acquired O2 Ireland for 885.7bn (€850.0m) becoming the country's leading mobile phone operator both in terms of subscriptions and revenue. UPC has announced plans to offer mobile voice and data services in 2015 in association with 3 Ireland. This will allow the cable operator to launch quad-play service bundles across the country. \n\n- The increasing uptake of LTE and NGA networks across the country will create an opportunity for operators to offer new value-added services and media content. Bundling these services in an innovative way will be key to competing effectively in the market particularly as quad-play service bundles become more widely available. Moreover with data traffic growing rapidly investments in NGN networks will continue to present opportunities for vendors in the 2G 3G and 4G/LTE and NGA (VDSL cable and FTTx) segments. \nComplete report available @ . \n\nSynopsis \nThis report provides an executive-level overview of the telecommunications market in Ireland today with detailed forecasts of key indicators up to 2020.
