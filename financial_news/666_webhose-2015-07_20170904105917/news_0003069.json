Negotiations next week stand to end two months of public quarreling in a standoff that put the $19 billion debt restructuring at risk.\nThe breakthrough reduces the likelihood that Ukraine will impose a moratorium on interest payments before its next one comes due July 24. The government in Kiev has threatened to stop servicing its Eurobonds if its proposal, including writedowns to principal, wasn’t accepted, while the main creditor group insists the nation’s restructuring goals can be met by pushing back due dates and cutting interest payments.\n“People are coming back to more positive expectations on the outcome of negotiations, and that is reflected in the bond prices,” Gintaras Shlizhyus, a Vienna-based strategist at Raiffeisen Bank International AG, said by phone. “The chances of default in July have been partly mitigated.”\nUkraine is changing terms on its debt after a conflict with pro-Russian separatists in its easternmost regions sent its currency into a tailspin and drained reserves. Its economy was dealt another blow on Tuesday when Russia took away most of a price discount for natural gas, prompting Ukraine to halt purchases. Russia has threatened to take its neighbor to court if it fails to pay back a $3 billion Eurobond due in December.\n‘Possible Solution’ The agreement with private creditors will “allow principal-to-principal negotiations on the substance of a possible solution to start next week,” Ukraine’s Finance Ministry said in an e-mailed statement Wednesday. A spokesman for the four-member creditor group, which holds about $9 billion of Ukraine’s bonds, verified the information in the statement and said the group had nothing further to add.\nThe accord follows weeks of statements and counter statements in which each side blamed the other for the lack of progress. Ukraine has said the deadlock was due to creditors’ refusal to sign a confidentiality agreement that would clear the way for non-public information to be discussed. Bondholders said they have been prepared for weeks for restrictions on negotiations, but that Jaresko’s legal team was blocking the accord.\nHaircut Percentage “Creditors will probably have to accept the haircut, and an agreement will be reached after both sides agree on the percentage,” Ian Hague, a founding partner at New York-based Firebird Management LLC, said by phone Wednesday.\nUkraine asked for 40 percent writedown in a proposal sent to creditors on June 19, pledging to return some of those losses should the economy rebound, a person with knowledge of the talks said that day.\nThe bondholder committee has insisted a writedown isn’t needed to meet terms of a $17.5 billion International Monetary Fund loan. It’s said it is being saddled with an unfair burden to help the country recover and argued that forcing a haircut would delay Ukraine’s return to international debt markets by late 2017, as assumed under IMF targets.\nWhile analysts including Nicolaie Alexandru at JPMorgan Chase & Co. have also questioned the need for cuts to principal, Ukraine is seeking long-term debt relief.\nWashington Meetings The IMF revised its forecast for the country’s 2015 economic contraction to 9 percent from 5.5 percent in May, but is yet to make public its updated estimates for debt-to-gross domestic product, one of the baseline assumptions on which its targets are based.\nThe confidentiality arrangement follows meetings in Washington D.C. on Tuesday between Ukrainian Debt Envoy Vitaliy Lisovenko, members of the creditor committee and representatives of the IMF. Jaresko didn’t attend, noting previously that they were technical meetings to discuss economic forecasts and not debt negotiations.\nThe first Eurobond to mature is a $500 million, 6.75 percent note due Sept. 23, which is trading at 53.03 cents on the dollar, up 1.7 cents, by 2:39 p.m. in Kiev. A $120 million interest payment on that security is due this month.", "external_links": ["http://www.minfin.gov.ua/control/en/publish/article?art_id=420389&cat_id=264727\\"], "published": "2015-07-02T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T15:12:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
