Costco Is Going Higher on Strong Performance, Overseas Expansion \n\"You felt like when she spoke, she was speaking to you,\" said Marshall Cohen, a retail analyst at NPD Group. \"That was a big difference in what she did -- she personalized the brand.\" \nAt a time when women faced a choice of power suits inspired by menswear or ruffled dress shirts, Karan's Seven Easy Pieces \"capsule wardrobe\" spawned innumerable copycats. Karan would later expand to street clothes via her DKNY brand. \nBut younger consumers have not gravitated to Donna Karan in the same way, and so the label is scaling back. Karan will still advise DKI with a hand in creative development as well as its licensing business. She will also continue work on her Urban Zen product line and its associated foundation. \nDKI parent company LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton's portfolio also includes luxury brands Sephora cosmetics, Cheval Blanc hotels, Louis Vuitton fashion and TAG Heuer watches. LVMH purchased Donna Karen International for $243 million in 2001. DKI was first listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1996. \nKaran's exit recalls a few other icons whose style profiles set the agenda for shop windows and became the darlings of consumers. Here are a few other favorites. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T11:43:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
