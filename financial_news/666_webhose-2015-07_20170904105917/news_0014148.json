Government accounts remained negative at 15.4 billion in May. This came on the back of a net withdrawal from the government deposits and reserve accounts totalling 20.5 billion in May according to the chartbook. \nIt said that key consumption indicator data was up in May month-on-month as a seasonal uptick ahead of Ramadan pushed up consumer spending. \nThe report said that ATM withdrawals and point of sale transactions increased by 7.8 percent and 10 percent year-on- year respectively. \nPMI fell to 57 its lowest level in 2015 owing to slower seasonal activity ahead of Ramadan. \nCement production and sales grew in May by 9 percent and 7.1 percent year-on-year respectively but are likely to fall in coming months due to slower seasonal activity in Ramadan. \nBank credit to the private sector recorded a monthly acceleration in May following a slowdown in each of the previous four months according to the chartbook. \nBoth net credit issued and bank profits broke their five year maximum levels for the month of May reaching SR17.2 billion and SR3.8 billion respectively. \nBank credit to the private sector accelerated to 1.3 percent month-on-month. Newly issued credit reached a record level at SR17.2 billion compared to the five year maximum for the month of May said the Jadwa report. \nMonthly profits also reached a five-year high for the month of May increasing by SR3.8 billion. \nIn May total bank deposits increased by SR20.1 billion month-on-month. Both demand deposits and time and savings deposits rose. \nThe growth in total deposits also spanned both the government and private sectors. Healthy growth in both credit and deposits caused the loan-to-deposit ratio to rise marginally in May. \nDemand deposits rose by SR10.7 billion month-on- month while time and savings deposits recorded a SR12.8 billion increase the highest in ten months. The growth in deposits spanned both the government and private sectors according to the chartbook. \nIt said that the healthy growth in both credit and deposits resulted in marginal increase in the loan-to-deposit ratio to 79.3 in May up from 79.2 in the previous month. \nIn May Saudi CPI rose to 2.1 percent year-on-year its first rise in nine months but this was mainly due to a lower base effect. Food price inflation recorded a small year-on-year rise but showed a deceleration in monthly terms. Subdued food inflation is affected in part by a continued deflationary trend in international food prices stated the Jadwa report. \nIn April nonoil exports increased slightly from the previous month but remained 16 percent lower year-on-year. Imports fell by 2 billion month-on-month to reach 13 billion but volumes imported increased slightly. New LOCs opened point to a likely fall in imports in coming months according to the chartbook. \nIt also said that the Tadawul All-Share Index (TASI) fell month-on-month in June due to the beginning of Ramadan and weaker sentiment related to a possible Greece default. Although a downturn in stock market activity is normally observed during Ramadan this has been exacerbated by events unfolding in Greece. \nThe TASI has trended downward for two consecutive months. Subdued trading during the start of Ramadan led to traded volumes dropping by 19 percent month-on-month in June. Traded volumes usually average their lowest in the year during Ramadan as retail investors become less focused on the stock market according to the report. \nLower trading activity and a sell-off in shares during the month of Ramadan has seen price-to-earnings (PE) in the TASI drop toward its two year average although it is still comparatively expensive to regional markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T22:56:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
