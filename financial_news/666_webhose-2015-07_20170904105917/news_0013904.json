The European Union's competition authority said FedEx's proposed 4.4 billion euro ($4.9 billion) takeover of TNT Express could reduce competition.\n\"(We) are confident that the combination of both companies will increase competition and create benefits for customers,\" said David Binks, FedEx's president for Europe.\nThe deal is also being reviewed by Dutch, Chinese and Brazilian authorities. TNT Express said it would continue with its own turnaround strategy while the approval process was in train.
