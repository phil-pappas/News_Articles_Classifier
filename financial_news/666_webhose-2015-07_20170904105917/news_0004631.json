Weak Apple forecast hits shares in chip designer ARM By Tara Cunningham | Telegraph – 9 minutes ago 130.75 -1.32 \nARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) tumbles to the bottom of the FTSE 100 despite posting a 32pc jump in second-quarter profits, as Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) 's disappointing results drag the stock lower \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in chip designer ARM Holdings plunged to a six-month low after Apple, one of its biggest customers, revealed sales and iPhone shipments fell short of market expectations . \nThe tech giant’s disappointing results overshadowed ARM’s bumper 32pc rise in second-quarter profits, driven by royalties from devices such as Apple’s iPhone 6. It also said it would increase its interim dividend by 25pc over last year to 3.15p a share. \nARM supplies microchip designs to Apple and other smartphone makers and receives a royalty on every chip shipped. The company said on Wednesday it expected strong royalty momentum in the second half of the year. ARM shipped 3.4 billion processor-based chips in the second quarter, generating a 26pc increase in royalty revenue on the previous year. \nManagement now anticipates full-year revenue will be in line with current market expectations of $1.48bn (£950m), entering the second half of the year with \"a robust pipeline of licensing opportunities\". \nThe FTSE 100 company signed 54 process licences, its highest number of signings in a quarter. \n“In the second quarter ARM signed licences for many new products and this licensing activity will help to grow the royalty revenue opportunity for years to come,\" said Simon Segars, chief executive. \nIan Thornton, head of investor relations, said he did not see anything in Apple’s results that would change ARM’s outlook for the year, even though analysts estimate that Apple accounts for a sizeable chunk of processor royalties, at around 20 to 25pc. \nSome analysts have suggested ARM could be hurt by a slowdown in the global smartphone market . However Julian Yates of Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) noted: “the company has not seen any material signs of slowing in its end markets”. * Game over? How the slowdown in new technology will affect us all Meanwhile, ARM was not the sole supplier feeling the effects of Apple’s weakness as graphics chip designer Imagination Technologies (Other OTC: IGNMF - news ) and components supplier Laird (LSE: LRD.L - news ) also fell into negative territory, falling 0.5pc and 2.8pc respectively. * Apple share price drop knocks tech stocks across the globe However, Mr Yates believes ARM’s falling share price offers a good entry point for investors, “especially if Apple weakness mutes the stock”. \nShares in the Cambridge-based company were changing hands at 998.5p on Wednesday morning - down 3.9pc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T15:30:54.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
