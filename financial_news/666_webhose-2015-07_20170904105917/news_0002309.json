Subsequently, taxes and penalty have to be paid by 31 December, 2015 and acknowledgement of acceptance is to be provided within 15 days of taxpayer`s intimation of payment of tax and penalty. EY \nSurabhi Marwah \nAs promised, with the objective to deal with the menace of black money stashed away abroad, the Government of India has come up with some measures and an institutional move in this direction is enacting ‘The Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015’ (“the Black Money Act”). This law has come into force from 1 July, 2015 and will be applicable to individuals qualifying as Resident and Ordinarily Residents (ROR) of India. \nIntriguingly, India is neither the first nor is it the only country to create a specific law to track income abroad. It follows in the footsteps of the landmark Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) brought into force by USA. Whilst certain countries have no exact equivalent in tax legislation but UK for instance has several different anti avoidance laws, including a disclosure regime for any tax avoidance schemes and a wider law to prevent money laundering such as the Proceeds of Crime Act. \nIndia has also joined the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on 3 June, 2015 in support of its various tax transparency initiatives including Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI). AEOI results in sharing of information without making a specific request for it. It also helps to facilitate sharing of bulk tax payer information in a systematic and periodic manner amongst various jurisdictions which have joined this agreement. \nThe Black Money Act has stringent provisions in the form of a 30% tax and a penalty amounting to three times the tax along with prosecution proceedings which can extend upto ten years. It also specifies that no exemption, deduction, set off or carry forward of losses, which the Indian tax laws ordinarily permit in the calculation of taxes, shall be allowed. \nThis law also offers a one -time compliance window for a limited period as an opportunity for the taxpayers to voluntarily disclose overseas undisclosed assets which are acquired from the income which was taxable in India for any year prior to 2015-16, but not offered to tax in India. Under the one-time compliance window, the taxpayer will pay tax at 30% in addition to a penalty of 100% of such tax. The taxpayers availing benefit of the one time compliance window will be granted immunity from prosecution under this law and under the Income tax Act, 1961, Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, Wealth tax Act, 1957, Companies Act, 2013 and Customs Act, 1962. \nHowever, the compliance scheme will not be applicable for taxpayers, whose tax assessments/ tax proceedings are initiated/pending finalization under the Indian tax laws or where any information on the undisclosed assets has been received by the competent authorities, on or before 30 June, 2015, under the agreements entered by the Indian Government or for taxpayers on whom any proceedings/ prosecution/offences under the Indian laws are pending. \nAs the compliance window is now notified, the taxpayer will need to furnish a declaration of undisclosed overseas assets to the tax authority by 30 September, 2015. Subsequently, taxes and penalty have to be paid by 31 December, 2015 and acknowledgement of acceptance is to be provided within 15 days of taxpayer’s intimation of payment of tax and penalty. \nIt is clearly set out in the Black Money Act that the undisclosed assets shall be taxed at fair market value. Accordingly, the rules have been prescribed for the valuation of undisclosed assets. For example, value of immovable property/bullion/jewellery has been defined as higher of cost, market value and value given by a registered valuer (recognized by the government of the specified jurisdiction). Similarly, value of bank account has been defined as sum of all deposits since date of opening of such undisclosed account. FMV shall be first determined in the currencies as permitted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the same shall be converted into local currency as per reference rate, provided by RBI as on the valuation date. The CBDT has also provided clarifications in respect to the issues that are open to different interpretations in its recent circular dated 6 July, 2015. \nThe one time compliance window that has been set up follows the principle of natural justice by providing an opportunity to the taxpayers to come out clean before stringent actions are initiated against them. Taxpayers who desire to avail the facility will need to act fast as the compliance requirements, apart from being time sensitive, involve collation of old records of various assets. Apart from assets such as property, bank accounts and so on, individually working in and outside India will also need to evaluate disclosure requirements of pension, endowment, social security and similar plans overseas. This will be based on a careful evaluation of the plan to understand the vesting rights in the plan, conditions for withdrawal and so on. \nIt should be noted that misrepresentation or suppression of facts or information will make the declaration void and will expose taxpayers to stringent consequences of penalty and prosecution under the Black Money Act. Further, tax and penalty paid will also be forfeited in such cases. \n(Author is Tax Partner with EY) \n(Digvishesh Pahwa, Senior Tax Professional, EY contributed to the article) \n(Views expressed are their personal) Post Your Comments (1)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T12:48:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
