In both cases, Tsipras was forced to rely on opposition parties to get the legislation passed. \nWhile the 40-year-old premier is riding high in opinion polls, some analysts believe the split within Syriza could force him to call early elections, just six months after he blazed to power on an anti-austerity ticket. \nGovernment spokeswoman Olga Gerovassili admitted the government was facing a \"political problem\", telling reporters after the vote: \"The divide in the parliamentary majority is clear.\" \nGreece and its creditors are under huge pressure to finalise the terms of the rescue before August 20, when Athens is scheduled to make a loan repayment of 3.2 billion euros to the ECB that it cannot currently afford. \n- 'Pain doesn't stop here' - \nThe latest batch of reforms sparked fiery debate on Wednesday night, with weary lawmakers clashing on everything from Marxism to submarines and the speaker of parliament comparing the bailout deal to \"a coup\". \nIn a passionate speech to the chamber, Tsipras argued Greece had to adapt to the \"new realities\" of the agreement if it wanted to avoid a default on its debts and a messy exit from the euro. \n\"The painful path does not stop here, unfortunately,\" he said. \n\"We were at the limits of our economy and our banking system, and at the limits of Europe -- where conservative forces, obsessed with austerity, dominate,\" he added. \nSome 6,000 anti-austerity demonstrators protested near parliament ahead of the debate, with a handful of them lobbing petrol bombs in the direction of the police. \nAhead of the vote, Vassiliki Georgiadis, a political science professor at Athens' Panteion University, said it would be \"difficult\" for Tsipras's Syriza-led coalition to remain in power if he was forced to rely on opposition MPs to get laws passed. \nTsipras was forced to reshuffle his cabinet last week, sacking three ministers for voting against the first bailout bill. \nGerovassili, the government spokeswoman, previously said the administration had \"no intention\" of calling early polls. \nTsipras told parliament on Thursday that he would keep fighting for Greece's best interests, adding he would not \"voluntarily abandon\" the job.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T21:16:15.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
