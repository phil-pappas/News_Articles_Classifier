He insists no legal mechanism exists to make it drop out of what is meant to be an \"irreversible\" monetary union. \nVaroufakis has vowed to resign if a 'Yes' prevails, and the pressure would be on Tsipras to do the same. \nVoting was to close at 7:00pm (1600 GMT), with results expected a couple of hours later. \n- 'Impossible to understand' - \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) though many grumbled that the long and technical question they were voting on was impossible to understand, minds for the most part were made up. \nMichelis, an 80-year-old first through the doors of a primary school being used for the vote in central Athens, said he too was saying 'No' \"because they (the creditors) will take us more seriously\". \nTheodora, 61, a retired journalist, said she was voting 'Yes' because \"it's a 'Yes' to the European Union\". \nIn the largely middle-class Pangrati neighbourhood, voter turnout was high, with even the very elderly making their way determinedly up a flight of 40 steps to reach polling booths. \nSumming up the uncertainty felt by around one in 10 Greek voters, 56-year old Katerina had still not made up her mind which way to vote, even as she collected her ballot paper. \n\"It is very confusing, it's very hard, not at all easy to decide,\" she said, admitting that she had voted to elect Tsipras but was disappointed by his failure to strike a deal with the country's creditors. \n- Merkel's hardball - \nGreece was officially declared in default on Friday by the European Financial Stability Facility, which holds 144.6 billion euros ($160 billion) of Greek loans, days after becoming the first developed country to miss a debt payment to the International Monetary Fund. \nWith its credit lifeline reduced to a trickle, the government this week closed banks and capped daily ATM withdrawals to 60 euros ($67). \nThe banks' liquidity was expected to dry up entirely within days unless the European Central Bank (ECB) -- a major creditor -- injected funds quickly. \nTsipras has called for the ECB, IMF and European Commission to forgive 30 percent of the 240 billion euros ($267 billion) they have loaned Greece over the past five years and allow it a 20-year grace period before it starts repaying the rest. \nSo far, the German government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel has been playing hardball with Greece. Some reports suggested it wants to force a Grexit as a lesson to other lagging eurozone nations. \nBut that was causing a split among the big eurozone economies. \nIn an interview published Sunday, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said that, no matter the referendum's result, \"we must start talking to each other again -- no one knows that more than Angela Merkel\". \nFrance's economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, said that even if Tsipras gets his 'No', bailout talks must resume. And in what could be seen as a thinly-veiled jibe at Germany, he warned that Europe cannot \"crush an entire people\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T14:58:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
