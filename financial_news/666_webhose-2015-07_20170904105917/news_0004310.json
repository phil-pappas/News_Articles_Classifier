But with economic growth stalling in the first quarter -- mostly due to \"transitory factors\", the Fed says -- the path toward the initial hike and a series of slow increases toward a \"normal\" rate has remained in question. \nAnalysts until recently were expecting the Fed to act in its September policy meeting. \nHowever, some weaker data, including a poor report on consumer spending released on Tuesday, and worries about eurozone fragility due to the Greek debt crisis and China's market meltdown, now have some economists expecting a move in December at the earlier, and possibly not until next year. \nYellen, in semi-annual testimony to the Financial Services Committee of the House of Representatives, stuck to the position of the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. \n\"If the economy evolves as we expect, economic conditions likely would make it appropriate at some point this year to raise the federal funds rate target, thereby beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy,\" she said. \nShe stressed though that the decision remains dependent on what data tells the Fed, and noted \"uncertainties\" clouding the picture. \n\"Foreign developments, in particular, pose some risks to US growth,\" she warned. She pointed to the still-unsettled situation between Greece and its creditors over a third massive rescue plan being prepared. \nAnd she noted that China \"continues to grapple with the challenges posed by high debt, weak property markets, and volatile financial conditions.\" \nOn the other hand, she said, \"economic growth abroad could pick up more quickly than observers generally anticipate, providing additional support for US activity.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:01:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
