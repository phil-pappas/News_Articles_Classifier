The assessment is designed to “ensure the continued confidentiality and integrity of data entrusted to FSA by students and families” and will identify security deficiencies of the Guaranty Agencies based upon NIST publications. It appears through the notice that the Guaranty Agencies will be required to conduct a security self-assessment and attestation to FSA. \nAlthough approval was requested by July 20, 2015, comments to the proposal will be accepted through September 14, 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T22:55:39.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
