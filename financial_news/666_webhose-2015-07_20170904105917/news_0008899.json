The tender documents are ready maybe in a week or two we will be giving them (prequalified companies) the tender documents. Give two months for bidding, one month for evaluation, so in four months' time the project can start,\" he said. \nAfDB is the administrator of Zimfund. So far, the fund has been financed by Australia, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden and the UK to the tune of US$145,5 million since May 2010. \nNdabanita said the project was meant to enhance efficient power transmission facilities in the country. \n\"For electricity we are reinforcing the substations in the country to make sure the transmissions network improves. Don't forget we can have enough power generation but still have constraints on transmission,\" he said. \nThe revamping of electricity substations across the country under the Emergency Power Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project phase 11 is earmarked for major cities such as Gweru, Bulawayo, Mutare and Zvishavane and is funded to the tune of US$32,9 million. \nNdabanita said under Phase 1 seven electricity substations in Norton,Harare, Bulawayo and Mazowe, among others, were rehabilitated. \nPhase 1 of the project, launched in December 2011, was completed by end of last month. \nUnder phase 1, Zimfund provided US$43,6 million for the Urgent Water supply and Sanitation and Rehabilitation Project (UWSSRP). The US$43,6 million was channelled into Harare, Mutare, Masvingo, Kwekwe and Chegutu water works. \nNdabanita said the UWSSRP phase two was targeting Harare, Chitungwiza, Redcliff and Ruwa at a cost of US$35 million, adding tenders for the projects were set to be advertised soon. \n\"We need to replace pipes. We also have to do booster pumps in areas like Mount pleasant and other places so that people start getting water. We have been doing studies to get to know what exactly we need to do. Tender documents are now ready. We are ready now to go to tender. In the next two months you will see those tenders being advertised, people submitting expressions of interest. The process might take a month or two,\" he said. \nSocio-economic challenges during the last decade crippled infrastructure in the country which saw water and sanitation and electricity supply deteriorating to deplorable levels.
