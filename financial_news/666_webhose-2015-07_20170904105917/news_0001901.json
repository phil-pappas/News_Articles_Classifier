Important for institutions to consider these in their assessment.\" \nThe heads of all 28 EU member states will discuss the proposals at a \"decisive\" summit on Sunday. \nThe plan was put forward as Germany, Greece's biggest creditor, appeared to make a small concession by acknowledging Athens would need some debt restructuring as part of any new bailout programme. \nThe hardline German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble suggested there could be movement on Greek debt as the deadline approached on Thursday night. \nEurozone leaders decided at an emergency meeting earlier this week that Greece should have one more chance to present a credible rescue plan. \nAthens has already promised to start reforming its tax and pension systems next week. \nIt promised the economic reforms as it announced a new bid for funds from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the EU organisation that provides financial assistance for eurozone members. \nThe three-year loan would enable Greece to cover its debt obligations, the Greek finance ministry said, preventing it from defaulting and ensuring it does not have to drop out of the euro. \nBanks in Greece are staying closed until at least next Monday and cash machine withdrawals are limited to €60 (£42) per day as the country teeters on the brink. \nMore follows...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T00:42:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
