PUBLISHED: 21:33, Sun, Jul 19, 2015 | UPDATED: 21:36, Sun, Jul 19, 2015 GETTY More homes are now for sale \nThe number of owners taking steps to sell has increased by 7.1 per cent in the past month compared to the previous month and a rise in the number of properties being marketed in the same period has occurred in more than two thirds (67 per cent) of major towns and cities. Online estate agent HouseSimple.com has compiled a Property Supply Index looking at the number of new properties listed every week on the property internet portal Rightmove, in more than 100 towns and cities.The f igures also reveal a distinct North-South divide, with owners in the North of England and Scotland appearing to be more active in June and July in marketing their properties.Nine out of 15 of the new property listings risers are in the North or Scotland, including Liverpool (30.4 per cent), Lancaster (24.3 per cent) and Edinburgh (17.2 per cent). Towns or cities in the Midlands that also feature include Coventry (21.1 per cent), Hereford (19 per cent) and Lincoln (17.6 per cent).Although the Wiltshire town of Swindon has experienced the biggest rise (47.3 per cent) in new property listings in the past month, Oxford (17.5 per cent) is the only city in the South to feature in the list of biggesrisers. New listings have fallen dramatically by 17.9 per cent in the past month in Winchester, Hampshire.In Hull they have fallen by 13.7 per cent.The London property market has slowed in recent months.However, the figures show that the capital has experienced an 8.1 per cent increase in new properties being listed in the past month compared to the previous month.There has been an increase in new proper t ies being marketed in the past month in more than three quarters (78.1 per cent) of London boroughs.The biggest rises in new property listings in the capital have been in Bexley (30.6 per cent) and in the City and Westminster (29.5 per cent).The biggest fallers have been Bromley (11.2 per cent) and Kingston upon Thames (6.6 per cent).Alex Gosling, chief executive of HouseSimple.com, said: “A stampede of sellers coming to market was expected after the General Election result but that stampede never materialised.“In fact, for the first few weeks there appeared to be a fair amount of caution and reluctance among sellers to market.“Now it appears sellers have waited long enough and we’re starting to see some movement.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T00:32:52.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
