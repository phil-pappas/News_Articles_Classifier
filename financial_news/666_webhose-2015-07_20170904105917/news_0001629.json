Restrictions on the movement of poultry in the surrounding area were lifted a month later.\n“We have a strong track record of controlling and eliminating previous outbreaks of avian flu in the UK,” Defra said in a statement.\n 10, 2015 10:52 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T06:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T04:45:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
