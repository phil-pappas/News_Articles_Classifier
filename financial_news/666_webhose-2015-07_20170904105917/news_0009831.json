But Nomura's Andrew Ticehurst said the result was consistent with the RBA's own forecasts published in May. \"We believe the RBA retains the capacity to ease the cash rate further, in response to sluggish economic growth, and we continue to look for another 25bp (quarter percentage point) cash rate cut following its early-November policy meeting,\" Mr Ticehurst said. St George Bank's Jo Horton said inflation would not stop the RBA if it wanted to cut again, not that she's expecting it. \"We expect the RBA to leave official interest rates on hold this year, although there is a risk the RBA could cut rates again, if economic data deteriorates,\" she said. Commonwealth Bank's John Peters said the RBA was content to let the economy undergo the transition away from growth driven by mining investment. But that's not guaranteed. \"Any failure of the economy to pick up despite the much desired lower AUD (now below USD0.75) and the current 2.0 per cent cash rate - against the backdrop of tame inflation - could see the RBA moving again to lower the cash rate somewhere down the line,\" Mr Peters said. In any case, the governor's speech confirmed that despite the historic low for the cash rate, another cut to below 2.0 per cent was still \"on the table\". But JP Morgan's Ben Jarman pointed to the governor's highlighting of the risks associated with more cuts. \"Perhaps most significantly, in the absence of alarm bells on the domestic data, the Governor now feels the decision to ease again is balanced by the medium term constraints of potential growth and financial stability which define whether further rate cuts are sustainable.\" In other words, the speech showed what Royal Bank of Canada's Su-Lin Ong had seen the day before in the minutes of the RBA's latest policy meeting - a \"reluctant bias to ease\". That reluctance was also noted by ANZ's Cherelle Murphy. \"Stevens noted that reducing rates further even in a disappointing growth environment with contained inflation was not without danger,\" she said. Another widely noted aspect of the speech was the suggestion by Mr Stevens that the economy's potential growth rate had slowed. HSBC's Paul Bloxham dusted off some research that suggested the speed limit had been lowered from over three per cent, possibly to the 2.50-2.75 per cent range. \"If the 'new normal' is, indeed, as low as we estimate, Australia will have lost over two years of possible growth by 2030,\" he said.
