Well that's no reason to stop your workouts! If you are facing these problems, we have some help. Three experts spill all on the right way to handle your skin and hair after an exercise session.\nSkin care\nDr Jaishree Sharad, CEO, Skinfiniti Aesthetic Skin & Laser Clinic, Mumbai, Vice President, The Cosmetic Dermatology Society of India (CSI)\nAvoid the sweaty rub: Avoid wiping your sweat with dirty hands. You may end up with boils or acne. Use wet wipes or a clean napkin instead.\nTake a shower with normal to cold water: Wash your face with a mild face wash. Avoid hot water as it will remove the body's natural oils and leave your skin dry and itchy. Do not use a scrub after working out. Apply a generous amount of face and body moisturizer. If you do not shower immediately after a workout, or continue wearing your gym clothes, you might develop back acne, acne, boils, fungal infections and friction burns.\nDon't repeat gym clothes without a wash: Make sure you dump those sweaty clothes and socks in the washing machine. Do not repeat them the next day without washing. If you have back acne, make sure you use a salicylic acid-based body wash to fight the breakouts.\nDr Sonia Mangal, MD at Myra Skin & Hair Solution, New Delhi\nRemove make up: Always remove your makeup before working out. As you sweat, your pores open up and wearing makeup can clog them, leading to acne cosmetica. Even if you are not wearing makeup, always cleanse your face well prior to and after gymming.\nSunscreen: If you are doing outdoor workouts, a good sunscreen with adequate UVB and UVA protection is a must.\nWash right after a workout: To avoid build up of any bacteria, clean your face immediately after workouts. Use an anti-acne face wash for acne prone skin, or one containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide.\nIf you sweat a lot, use antiperspirants for underarms or get Botox injections on your palms and soles which temporarily inactivate your sweat glands. You can also opt for underarm laser hair reduction. This reduces sweating and odor because hairs accumulate more bacteria than the skin.\nHair care\nDr Sonia Mangal, MD at Myra Skin & Hair Solution, New Delhi\nDon't wash your hair everyday: The common mistake most women commit is washing their hair after every workout. Exercising can build up sweat and makes you feel that your scalp needs a good scrub. However, you should shampoo 2-3 times a week regardless of how often you sweat. Excessive shampooing deprives the scalp of its natural oils. You may use a dry shampoo for the days between wet shampoos when your scalp feels too oily and greasy. However, do remember that dry shampoos are not a substitute for regular shampoos and you can't condition your hair after a dry shampoo.\"\nUse a deep moisturizing conditioner: To protect your hair from the harmful after effects of excessive shampooing, always use a deep moisturizing conditioner on the hair, preferably with an inbuilt sunscreen. This will help protect your strands from the harsh UV rays of the sun, especially during outdoor workouts.\nDon't tie your hair too tightly: Very tight ponytails can cause traction alopecia, giving the impression of a receding hairline over time.\nNew York Dermatologist, Dr. Kiran Lohia, MD and Medical Director of Lumiere Dermatology\nTry to keep your hair dry: Tying your hair back can really make a difference between a frizzy mess and cool waves. Taking hair restraint further, it's even better if you cover up your strands with a sweat wicking material. Use a scarf or head wrap. Even a sweat resistant headband can help! These materials will protect your tresses from workout trauma, while helping to absorb that frizz-inducing sweat.\nDon't overwash: Most people shampoo their hair after every workout. The more you shampoo your hair, the drier it will become. That's because it contains detergents that strip the natural oils and nutrients. Instead of washing daily, cleanse your hair with plain water and apply conditioner afterwards.\nSulfate-free shampoo: Shampoos contain harsh ingredients that strip away crucial moisture from your hair strands. The worst offenders are sulfates. They are known irritants that are strong enough to steal a huge percentage of the hydration from your skin and hair. Using a sulfate-free shampoo helps prevent a lot of that dehydration because it contains much gentler cleansing agents. So when you shampoo, you are cleansing, not parching. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=workout,skincare,skin,Shampoo,Hair Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-07-28T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:52:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
