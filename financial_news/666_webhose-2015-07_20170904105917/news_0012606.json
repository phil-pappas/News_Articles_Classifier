Jessica Shapiro Share on twitter by Tony Boyd The trials and tribulations of global law firm Slater & Gordon will reinforce the general reluctance of professional services firms to abandon the cosy private partnership model in favour of sharemarket listings.\nMurky accounting has put Slater & Gordon in the cross-hairs of short sellers who have capitalised on the uncertainty surrounding how the firm accounts for its work in progress.\nThe short sellers could well have taken inspiration from famous New York fund manager Jim Chanos who once said: \"When the accounting gets murky, people tend to shy away from rigorous analysis and rely on management and just take earnings per share at face value. Therein lies the opportunity\"\nThat is not to say that Slater & Gordon's management led by chief executive Andrew Grech is not to be trusted.\nAndrew Grech, CEO of a firm now in the crosshairs of short sellers. Louie Douvis But the company's ability to refute the attacks on the reliability and predictability of its revenue has been severely harmed by its admission that the historical cash flows in a business it bought in the United Kingdom contained about $64 million in accounting errors for 2013 and 2014.\nThe company said on June 29 that an arithmetic error in the consolidated spread sheet for the UK business included Value Added Tax twice in receipts from customers. This effect was wholly offset by the same amount being added to the calculation of total payments to suppliers and employees.\nOne error offset the other which meant that \"net cash derived from operating activities in all periods was unaffected and remains as reported\", the company said.\nAt the same time as reporting these errors, Slater & Gordon revealed it was assisting the Australian Securities and Investments Commission with a routine review of the audit process by the company's long standing auditor Pitcher Partners.\n The tenure of Pitcher Partners at Slater & Gordon is on a short tenure for reasons totally unrelated to the ASIC review of its audit. The board of Slater and Gordon has recognised it needs to have one of the big four global accounting firms looking after its accounts given its $1.2 billion purchase of the Professional Services Division (PSD) of UK law firm Quindell.\nQuindell is itself the subject of regulatory inquiries in the UK. It is yet to publish its full year accounts for the year to December 2014 although there is some expectation that will happen next week.\nQuindell's directors are likely to \"kitchen sink\" just about every thing they can into those accounts considering they already have the cash from Slater & Gordon. That will play into the hands of the short sellers.\nShadow cast on good news The UK problems and the domestic inquiries being conducted by ASIC tend to cast a shadow over the fact that Slater & Gordon is one of the few companies building a global business in the services sector.\nServices are supposed to be one of the future growth sectors for the Australian economy. That has been recognised by the major commercial law firms but they have tended to expand internationally while preserving the partnership structure.\nHowever, the preservation of the traditional business model has only served to remind the management of such firms that Australia is increasingly uncompetitive because of the high cost of doing business.\nThe PSD acquisition served to magnify the company's work in progress which added to the doubts of the short sellers.\nThis is where the ASIC inquiry will prove to be critical not only for Slater & Gordon's management and shareholders but for professional services firms more generally.\nIn Australia, the firm's work in progress comprises 45,000 personal injuries cases. The firm has carved out a reputation as the master of handling such cases and only takes on matters it knows it can win.\nBut the firm's interpretation of Accounting Standard 118, which relates to the tricky issue of when to recognise revenue for work that involves the delivery of future economic benefits, throws up several questions.\nLogic suggests that if work in progress is included in the balance sheet as a current asset then the amount of money involved will be collected in the following 12 months.\nBut in the case of Slater & Gordon that has not been the case over the life of the firm as a listed company.\nThe company took the view right from the start when it listed in 2007 that it could treat work in progress as current even though it may be collected over two or three years.\nIt is believed it discussed this with ASIC. But it should be noted that ASIC does not comment on specific companies and their prospectuses and the fact that a prospectus is lodged with ASIC does not mean that ASIC approves or endorses the nature of a particular company's business plan or investment scheme in any way.\nSlater & Gordon's treatment of work in progress as current stems from the fact that the majority of personal injuries cases are settled.\nThe ASIC inquiries will serve a useful purpose not just for shareholders in Slater & Gordon but for the overall market. It could provide timely guidance of how to treat revenue recognition as Australia seeks to build global services businesses trading on exchanges.\nChanging CEOs It is always preferable to appoint an internal candidate to replace the outgoing chief executive for continuity, cultural fit, maintaining the morale of senior executives and for the purposes of seamless leadership transition. There have been some excellent recent examples of this including the following appointments: Brian Hartzer at Westpac Banking Corp, Jon Sutton at Bank of Queensland, Ryan Stokes at Seven Group Holdings, Peter Tonagh at News Corp Australia and Chris Smith at CSL.\nThere are several other internal CEO appointments made this year but the circumstances leading up to the changeover meant they could not be classified as seamless including Alberto Calderon at Orica and Richard Umbers at Myer Holdings.\nBut overall the directors and management of these companies served shareholders well by providing internal candidates to fill the most important role in the company.\nThey passed the \"CEO under the bus test\" by ensuring internal talent was waiting in the wings notwithstanding the fact that the final choice would have been calibrated against the available external talent.\nThe second best option when it comes to best practice in succession planning is the one pursued by GPT chairman Rob Ferguson. The GPT board replaced Michael Cameron with Bob Johnston , an outstanding property executive who was working for rival property group Frasers Australand.\nFerguson and Cameron came to the succession issue with a strong hand. There were at least four internal candidates. But they did not have Johnston's depth of experience across a range of different property specialities.\nWhile there is nothing dramatic to be done in relation to strategy at GPT, Johnston will undoubtedly crank up the growth.\nFerguson spoke to about 10 major shareholders in GPT before making the final decision to opt for Johnston. These conversations threw up a range of ideas about how one of the largest owners of property on the eastern seaboard should be run.\nA range of fresh ideas were also given to the board by the internal candidates. They also provided a critique of the way the company was run under Cameron.\nCameron's approach to succession planning at GPT was shaped by his experiences at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. He was chief financial officer when Ralph Norris replaced David Murray.\nNorris started his succession planning as soon as he arrived. The board opted for an internal candidate in Ian Narev.\nJohnston's pay package is $1.4 million base pay, maximum short term incentive of $1.75 million and maximum long term incentive of $2.1 million. The icing on his cake is a sign-on bonus of $1.3 million to cover short term incentives foregone and $2.1 million to cover long term incentives foregone.\nCameron joins Suncorp in September. He will replace Patrick Snowball, who leaves the company is in great shape.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-07-21T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:12:30.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
