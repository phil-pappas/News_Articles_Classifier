It is about proposing structured projects,” said Mayaki. \nMeanwhile, the NEPAD Agency, SDSN, UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and Washington-based think tank, Brookings Institution, have agreed to set up a working group that will move Africa’s regional infrastructure financing agenda forward. \n– CAJ  //cajnewsafrica.com/?p=6755   14 2015.
