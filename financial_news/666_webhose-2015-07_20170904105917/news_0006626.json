Eugene DiGirolamo's proposal Thursday came amid a stalemate between Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf and the Legislature's Republican majorities. \nDiGirolamo (dee-jhir-AWL'-uh-mo) wants an overall spending increase, including more education aid, and tax increases that are less than what Wolf wants, but more than the Republican budget bill that Wolf vetoed. \nSpending would rise 7 percent, including $600 million more for education. A new 3.2 percent tax on Marcellus Shale natural gas production and an income tax increase of a quarter-percentage point are partly necessary, he says, to fix a budget deficit. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:07:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
