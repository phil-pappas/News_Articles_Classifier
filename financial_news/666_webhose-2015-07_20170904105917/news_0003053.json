Even in a single month from April to May, the number of card transactions increased by 12 million. \nSpending per transaction is also falling as customers use debit and credit cards for smaller and smaller purchases. While the number of transactions increased by 10pc, the amount spent on plastic increased by 7pc on the year to £51.1bn in May. \nThe average card payment fell by more than £1 on the year from £47.97 to £46.92, \nThis fall in the size of payments is largely driven by the rise of contactless payments , the UK Cards Association believes. \nOne key customer is Transport for London, as travellers use contactless cards on the Underground and train networks in the capital, as well as buses. In April, commuters made 1.2 million contactless payments per day. \n\"More and more consumers are now choosing to reach for the cards in their wallets first when they come to pay. With the contactless limit increasing to £30 from September, it’s expected that the growing trend of using cards rather than cash will continue,” said Richard Koch at the UK Cards Association. \nThe current maximum spend per contactless transaction is £20. \nSuch a mass-move to contactless payments represents another shift in the rapid change away from traditional banking. It comes after British Bankers' Association numbers showed that mobile banking accounts for more interactions with customers than any other form of contact, while Halifax data showed that even when customers do visit branches, they tend to use self-service machines rather than the staffed counters. \nMeanwhile, the Financial Conduct Authority praised banks and credit card firms for making progress in helping customers who had suffered from fraud or other unauthorised transactions. \n“It is encouraging that firms are making good progress on this issue. Consumers have a right to feel confident that if someone takes money from their account without their permission they will get it back,” said the FCA’s acting director of supervision Linda Woodall. \n“Our consumer research showed just how distressing unauthorised transactions can be and we are pleased that firms recognise this.” \nHowever, the regulator also said lenders need to make it clearer to customers that they have up to 13 months to make a claim for an unauthorised transaction, and that sometimes firms place onerous responsibilities on customers who want to make a claim.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T17:11:06.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
