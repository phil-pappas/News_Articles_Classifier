More Shake-up of pensions tax relief considered \nOn Tuesday, Mr McClymont, 39, said his new role would focus on developing Aberdeen’s strategy for “defined contribution” pensions, where savings are expected to grow significantly. \n“My focus will be on developing a strategy for Aberdeen in response to the new retirement market and ensuring the company is a significant player in that space,” he said. \nAs shadow pensions minister, Mr McClymont campaigned for all pension schemes to acquire scale, reform their governance and deliver lower costs to savers. \nMr McClymont said he remained a member of the Labour party, though was not politically active, and that Aberdeen shared his “strong pro-consumer views”. \n“Aberdeen are equally committed to developing good products at a fair price,” he said. \nIn a 2013 paper for the leftwing Fabian society, Mr McClymont wrote that pensions in the UK were a “cottage industry in need of the efficiency and expertise that scaling up has produced in other countries”.
