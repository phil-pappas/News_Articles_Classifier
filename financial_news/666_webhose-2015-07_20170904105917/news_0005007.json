Share on twitter by Lucille Keen A Melbourne cafe has been docking staff pay as punishment if they have collected torn cash notes or the cash register didn't add up.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman has fined the Doncaster restaurant for taking staff pay if the cash register was short, for accepting cash notes that were torn and for breakages.\nIt was only discovered after the business was audited by the ombudsman.\nThe employees at the cafe also did not receive penalty rates and overtime for weekend shifts.\nIt is now required to repay staff almost $9000.\nBut it's not the first time a cafe has unlawfully penalised employees.\nLast year a Perth cafe was fined after it was found to have docked employee pay for being five minutes late for work, the wrong placement of tomato in a sandwich and serving cold pizza.\nThe cafe docked $30 from staff if tomato was placed in the wrong layer of a club sandwich, $18.90 if a hair was found in a breakfast dish, $12 for overcooking a waffle or burning an omelette, $12 for serving cold pizza and $10 for failing to prepare parsley for the following day.\n Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said deductions from wages as punishment or a performance management tool were unlawful.\n\"Clearly these deductions only benefited the employer, which is why we have taken this matter seriously and sought a commitment from the business this behaviour will not be repeated,\" Ms James said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/lucillekeen"], "published": "2015-07-14T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:06:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
