Dominic Lorrimer Share on twitter by Misa Han Professionals using LinkedIn should have at least 100 connections, upload photos and videos and check their business partners' profiles before meetings, LinkedIn regional director Cliff Rosenberg says.\nMr Rosenberg said quality of connections was more important than quantity, but having fewer than 100 connections could come across as not being active.\n\"There is no magic number, but less than 50 or less than 100 shows you're not very active,\" he said. \"I think having too few says something about you.\"\nHe said he often accepted LinkedIn requests from people he had not met before and he also reached out to other people he had not met. But when considering whether to accept a request, he looks at the person's profile and considers whether they are potentially a good connection.\n\"When you're reaching out, customise your connection request. If I'm interested, I might email them. It's social media.\" he said.\nWhen Mr Rosenberg left his role as Yahoo! managing director for Australia and New Zealand to head up LinkedIn in Australia, he was the only employee in an office half the size of a boardroom.\nNow LinkedIn Australia has about 240 employees and Mr Rosenberg heads LinkedIn in Australia, New Zealand and south-east Asia. About a month ago LinkedIn moved to a new office on 1 Martin Place in the heart of Sydney CBD. The New York Stock Exchange-listed company share price plunged as much as 27 per cent on May 1 after the company forecast revenue by US$45 million .\nMr Rosenberg said it was imperative for users to have a professional, \"good looking picture\" and upload videos if they want to stand out. His personal LinkedIn profile features a professional headshot and a YouTube clip of him speaking at a conference.\n \"I was speaking to recruiters who had two candidates and they were ambivalent about them. And one person had a video of himself delivering a keynote address and it completely got him over the line,\" he said.\nHe also uses LinkedIn to find common ground with business partners he works with. Before meetings, Mr Rosenberg would check other people's key interests and hobbies to see if he has any common interests. His interests include photography, neuro-linguistic programming, golf and tennis.\n\"I'll look for commonalities rather than just asking, 'How's the weather'? I might say, 'I've noticed you like photography, what camera do you use'?\"\nWhen hiring, he also prefers candidates who have used the platform to look at his profile and take every step to gather as much information about the prospective employer as possible. \"It takes two minutes to check the profile.\"\nHe will meet a selected number of headhunters who reach out to him, even when he's not actively looking for a job, depending on how they reached out and who the referral is from.\n\"It's always good to know what you're worth,\" he said.\nThere are now about 7 million LinkedIn users in Australia. About 80 per cent of ASX 100 companies now use the networking platform for recruitment, sales and marketing.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan", "http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=290719&trk=send_invitation_success_message_name&goback=%2Enppvan_cliffrosenberg"], "published": "2015-07-16T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:11:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
