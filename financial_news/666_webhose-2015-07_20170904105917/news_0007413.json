We will remain on the lookout for similar conduct and will address it as we find it.”\nCiti said in a statement that it “previously discontinued sales of the products included in the agreements,” like credit monitoring and debt-protection products.\nThe enforcement action comes from the consumer watchdog agency established exactly five years ago under Dodd-Frank. The agency has been tough on credit card practices and just earlier this month took action against JPMorgan for selling bad credit card debt.\nGet The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:51:45.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
