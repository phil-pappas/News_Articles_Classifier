When challenged, he said he made “no apology” for living in social housing. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) the Chancellor is expected to use Wednesday’s Summer Budget to announce an end to a system that sees hundreds of thousands of higher earners using the benefit system to claim taxpayer-funded subsidies for their rent. \nMr Osborne is likely to announce that from 2017/18 those on incomes above £40,000 in London and £30,000 in the rest of England that live in housing association and local authority properties, will be charged a market or near market rent. \nThe move follows steps taken over the last five years that enabled housing associations and local authorities to charge market rents to those on incomes of more than £60,000. \nThe Government estimates that higher income social tenants benefit, on average, over £3,500 per household from reduced rent and represent approximately 9% of all social tenants in England. \nThis includes over 40,000 social rented tenants with household incomes in excess of £50,000 per year; and a further 300,000 with incomes over £30,000 per annum. \nThe additional rental income that local authorities receive from ending these taxpayer-funded subsidies will be returned to the Treasury and used to reduce national debt. \nDubbed \"Pay to Stay\" in Whitehall, the crackdown will raise up to £250m per year in 2018-19 towards reducing the deficit and generate extra income for housing associations to reinvest in affordable housing. \nThe emergence of a purge on rich council house tenants follows the disclose by Sky News that Mr Osborne will use his Budget to announce raising the inheritance tax thresholds for couples to £1m .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T02:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T05:58:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
