A toy company wants to put a talking dinosaur in your kid’s bedroom.\nElemental Path, a New York based smart-toy company, has created a smart dinosaur toy that aims to tutor children on educational subjects. The toy can learn its owner’s name and adapt to their personality, thanks to technology provided by the IBM IBM, -0.16% Watson supercomputer. It is expected to ship this December.\nThe toy is aimed at children aged 5 to 9 due to the level of the educational material and use of speech recognition. It can greet its owner and answer questions, if asked, or prompt him or her to play an educational game.\n“As the child progresses through...it changes and adjusts the content based on how well the child has done that project,” said CEO Don Coolidge.\nIt also tells knock-knock jokes.\nThe toy can adapt to a child’s preferences. Thus if a child tells the dinosaur, which it can name, that his or her favorite color is red and favorite sport is soccer, the dinosaur will use red soccer balls as the object in counting games, Coolidge said.\nThe dinosaur has an on-off switch, and won’t respond until the user pushes the button on its stomach and speaks to it.\nThat function should allay concerns about privacy -- a hot topic around smart devices after Samsung Electronics said its TV may be listening to you -- or a toy randomly talking in the middle of the night, Coolidge said.\n“It’s never listening unless you’re holding the button down,” Coolidge said\nThe company was created after Coolidge and his co-founders won an IBM mobile app developer challenge, in which they pitched a toy that would use the program to learn and grow with the child, meaning it wouldn’t be stowed away once the child reached a certain age.\nCoolidge and his team launched a Kickstarter campaign in February, which reached $275,0000, surpassing the initial goal of $50,000. Around the same time, the company raised just under $1.1 million in a seed round from angel investors, he said.\nThe toy doesn’t draw from the wealth of all of the Internet. Instead it connects to the Internet to connect to the Elemental Path platform, which has set answers for questions.\nBecause children often ask philosophical or nonsensical questions -- for example, Coolidge said a child recently asked “Why is a goat a goat and why is a chicken a chicken?” -- the company has to find a way to provide some kind of answer.\n“Kids do ask all sorts of crazy questions,” he said.\nThe company is taking pre-orders on its site, with the toys listing at $119.99. It has created prototypes of the toy and completed manufacturing runs, but the founders have to conduct a 90-day testing period before delivery can begin.\nElemental Path may look into retail partnerships in 2016.\nThe Kickstarter community has helped with the design of the toy, suggesting the makers add eyes, Coolidge said.\n“We didn’t know if the eyes add a little bit of a creepy factor, and they don’t,” Coolidge said. “They make it adorable.”\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T20:14:28.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
