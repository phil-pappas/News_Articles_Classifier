We run the rule over the health of the UK economy \nUK business lending saw the sharpest fall in at least four years in June, while mortgage lending and consumer credit expanded at a pace not seen since before the financial crisis, Bank of England data showed on Wednesday. \nMany experts argue a sustainable economic recovery can only come from supporting businesses, yet the figures showed lending to non-financial businesses fell by almost £5.5bn in June, representing the biggest decline since records began in 2011. \nMeanwhile, mortgage approvals continued to pick up speed, and consumer credit grew at the fastest pace in almost a decade. \nThe figures were released just a day after official figures showed UK growth picked up speed in the second quarter. The Office for National Statistics said the UK economy grew by 0.7pc in the second quarter , following growth of 0.4pc in the first three months of the year. \nBut is growth being fuelled by a consumer credit boom? And will business lending ever pick up? We delve deeper into the numbers: \n= Mortgage approvals on the rise = \nMortgage approvals rose to 66,582 in June , from 64,826 in May and against expectations for a more moderate rise to 66,000. \nThe data also showed the value of mortgage lending rose by the largest amount in almost seven years, as house prices continued to rise. Net mortgage lending increased by £2.6bn in June, representing the biggest increase since July 2008. The figure was also much higher than the £2.05bn expected by economists. \nActivity is picking up, and experts are predicting a stampede for fixed-rate mortgages as banks and building societies begin to withdraw their best deals in anticipation of interest rate rises, which could begin at the end of this year . \nBank data on Wednesday showed the average rate on a new mortgage dropped to 2.56pc in June , its lowest since records began in 2004. This pushed down the average outstanding mortgage rate to 3.09pc - again a record low. \nEconomists say a pick up in activity signalled a healthier mortgage market. Paul Hollingsworth , an economist at Capital Economics, said: \nThe bounce back in mortgage approvals following an election-related dip in May is unsurprising, given the strong economic backdrop and low mortgage interest rates. \nOfficial data shows more people are now opting to fix their mortgages, which leaves them less exposed to changes in the bank rate - which is used as the starting point for banks’ and building societies’ saving and borrowing rates. According to Bank of England data, almost 78pc of new mortgages are linked to a fixed-rate deal, compared with 46pc before the financial crisis hit. \nBrian Murphy , head of lending at the Mortgage Advice Bureau, said: \nDespite the holiday season approaching, we are likely to see a burst of transactions continue into the second half of the year following [Bank Governor] Mark Carney’s comments about an early base rate rise, as more people look to secure a loan before the curtain comes down on the era of low-cost mortgages. \nWhile mortgage approvals have picked up, they remain well below pre-crisis levels of more than 100,000 a month . The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) , which is in charge of maintaining financial stability, took steps last year to try to prevent the market from overheating . \n= Consumer credit picks up = \nCheap borrowing on credit cards and loans means consumer credit is also on the rise. \nConsumer credit grew by 7.6pc in the year to June , representing the biggest rise since April 2006. Bank data showed consumer credit rose by £1.22bn last month , compared with forecasts for a rise of £1.1bn. \nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) , the Government's official forecaster, expects the household debt-to-income ratio to keep rising until the end of the decade, returning to its pre-crisis peak of just under 170pc at the beginning of 2020. \n• Jeremy Warner: The UK is living off borrowed time - and money \nHowever, the OBR has revised down its household debt forecasts over the past year, with around two thirds of the downward revision to the level of total debt reflecting \"an assumption that tighter mortgage lending conditions will prevail for a longer period\". It also believes more people will have their credit card and loan debts written off over the next few years. \nOthers believe Britain will not see the \"credit fuelled binge\" that the OBR is forecasting. Experts at the EY ITEM Club , which uses the same economic model as the Treasury , believe the debt-to-income ratio will rise only gradually over the next few years. \nMartin Beck , senior economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, says: \nDespite June’s further uptick in lending, we are still a long way from returning to pre-2008 conditions. From 2000 to 2007, household borrowing grew at an average annual rate of 11.4pc, while monthly mortgage approvals averaged 107,000. Granted, with growth in real incomes in 2015 likely to reach a 14-year high and mortgage rates set to stay depressed, prospects for lending remain favourable. But the evidence of a structural downward shift in households’ willingness to take on debt remains fairly compelling. \n= Business lending = \nWhile lending to households is picking up, a shock fall in credit extended to businesses has dealt a blow to efforts to steer Britain away from a reliance on consumer spending to drive growth. \nBusiness lending plummeted to its lowest level in at least four years in July. The supply of credit to non-financial companies fell by almost £5.49bn in June , from a rise of £818m in May. This was the biggest drop since records began in May 2011. \nHowever, lending to small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) rose by £353m. \nWhile the Bank of England said there was no anecdotal evidence to explain the decline, which policymakers consider key to driving a sustainable economic recovery, analysts have highlighted in the past that many businesses remain cash rich, while others are looking to alternative sources of finance to meet their lending needs. \nThe Bank's data showed net lending to non-financial businesses fell by £2.2bn in June, while lending to SMEs rose by £0.2bn. \n= Time (Xetra: 17T.DE - news ) to panic? = \nWhile Wednesday's figures may suggest Britain is on the brink of another debt-fuelled binge, mortgage approvals remain below pre-crisis averages, and caps introduced by the Bank of England are aimed at trying to prevent lending from growing out of control. \nAs Mr Beck highlights, the crisis has made people more careful about taking on debt. So while policymakers will keep an eye on how quickly credit is growing, especially as interest rate rises draw closer, June's figures on their own do not pose a major cause for concern - yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T19:49:53.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
