Investigations related to other staff have either been completed or are ongoing,\" the bank said in a statement.\nANZ said it is continuing to cooperate with the ASIC investigation . The banks internal review \"initially this was focused on the analysis and provision of information to ASIC\" but the bank said that more recently the investigation focussed on compliance with internal codes of conduct.\nAdvertisement \"To date, this has involved a significant number of people working on the identification, analysis and provision of many hundreds of thousands of documents and records to ASIC and the consideration of complex issues.\" the bank said in a statement.\nIn November 2014, ANZ stood down seven traders on full pay amid a probe by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission investigation into potential manipulation into the bank bill swap rate, which is used to set rates on billions of dollars of securities and is a key determinant of lending rates.\nThree foreign banks - BNP Paribas, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS - have agreed to enforceable undertakings but so far the ANZ suspensions have been the only action taken by a major banks. In recent weeks rumours have surfaced that another major bank trader that may have been involved in trading BBSW was suspended, although the suspension may not have been related to interest rate rigging.\nASIC chairman Greg Medcraft however has expressed his frustration about the banks 'defensive and overly legalistic approach to the investigation and called on bank chiefs and boards to do more help the regulator in its probe and restore market integrity.\nA recent ASIC report into benchmark rates said benchmark rates were manipulated to increase the value of positions held by a certain bank, to trigger stop losses among clients and force them into losses, by sharing confidential client information and submitting low rates to force down an institution's cost of funding.\nThe investigation into rate rigging was understood to have been prompted by international intelligence gathered by offshore regulatory bodies that were exploring manipulation of global interest rates.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/anztraders-sidelined-during-asic-investigation-20150104-12hq2v", "http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/anz-named-as-one-of-the-appalling-banks-in-ratefixing-probe-20150603-ghg0sz"], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:27:15.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
