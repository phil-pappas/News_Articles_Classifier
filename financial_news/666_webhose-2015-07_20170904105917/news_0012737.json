It is, therefore, completely understandable that investors are panicking over the events in Greece. That panic is almost certainly unwarranted, however.\nGreeks voted to avoid the pain of further austerity. Europeans want Greeks to face their fiscal responsibilities. Both sides would rather have Greece remain in the Eurozone, but each is playing “chicken” to get better terms. Greece has the most to lose and seems likely to back down. Politically, however, they probably cannot do that without another vote.\nEven if the two sides fail to reach agreement, this does not look like a train wreck for the rest of Europe or other parts of the world. At most, Greece looks like a bad pothole. In full-blown financial crises, large defaults cascade to other financial institutions in a “contagion” that causes a broad cross section of lenders to fail. With five years to prepare for Greek default, however, any lender who has not reduced exposure to a manageable level probably needs to find a new business.\nThe credit and equity markets also indicate that any dislocations from Greek defaults will not cause much impact for the financial markets or for many economies beyond Greece. Remember, too, that the Federal Reserve and other monetary authorities may also intervene dramatically if the Greek tragedy threatens to spread to other economies.\nWithout economic damage, equity prices may correct but will likely not suffer a deep and prolonged bear market. Also, since market prices often overreact, corrections built on panic can be a great time to buy. The U.S. economy and financial markets seem largely isolated from Greece, but in panics, the righteous suffer along with the sinners, so the S&P 500 has declined as European security prices have fallen. If conditions do deteriorate in Europe, international money will flood into the United States, and that will help support prices here. Adding exposure to U.S. equities, which we believe have a strong outlook, is the safest way to take advantage of a Greek selloff.\nStronger returns are more likely when you buy assets closer to the epicenter of the problem. While we would not buy Greek bonds or equities, long-term European exposure makes good sense either with or without Greece. European equities will likely fall further if worries about Greece continue to fester. Since overseas investments are vital to long-term diversification, this may prove to be a good buying opportunity for adding to that exposure.\nThere are never any guarantees with investing. Yet, panic without any meaningful economic damage typically provides buying opportunities. We have not had a meaningful correction in equities for a long time. The tragedy in Greece may be enough to provoke one. That would be an opportunity we would not want to miss!\nThis material is presented for informational purposes only and should not be construed as individual tax or financial advice.
