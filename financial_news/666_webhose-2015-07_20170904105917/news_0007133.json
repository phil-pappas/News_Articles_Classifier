Wikimedia Commons by Catie Low Cut price German retailer Lidl has sought the ear of the Victorian state government in a move that is likely to be read as further proof of its serious interest in the Australian market.\nIt's understood the discount retailer has met with the state government on several occasions in the past six months, including meetings at the Frankfurt office of Invest Victoria.\nDetails of these discussions have not been revealed or which party instigated the meetings however it's believed the latest took place within the last month.\nThe state government confirmed \"discussions\" had taken place with Lidl but a spokesperson said the government regularly spoke to interstate and overseas businesses about the strength of the Victorian economy and the \"great opportunities there are in investing in our state.\"\nThere are several ways the state government can smooth the way for the entry of a new retailer like Lidl, from assisting with planning permissions to providing grants or payroll tax exemptions.\nDenis Napthine's state government invested $3.4 million through the Geelong Region Innovation and Investment Fund to support the $8.72 million expansion of retailer Cotton on Group's head office in Geelong.\nLidl stated in June it had \"no current plans\" to launch in Australia but that doesn't shift the market fundamentals, which analysts claim are ripe for the entry of a new discount retailer.\nRevelations this week that Aldi's sales have rocketed by about 20 per cent in the past two years, to $6 billion in 2014, bolster this analysis along with the strong margins on offer in the Australian supermarket sector.\n Coles' food and liquor sales have grown by 4.9 per cent a year since 2013 and Woolworths' have increased by an average of 4.7 per cent a year in the same period.\nAldi is believed to have about 10.8 per cent of the retail market on the east coast of Australia and its reputation for low prices is luring customers from the two supermarket giants, Coles and Woolworths as well as the IGA chain.\nMorgan Stanley predicts the discount retailers, including Costco and Aldi will boast more than 13 per cent of the market by 2020.\n\"The discounters are having a significant impact in the market and they don't need 30 per cent of the market to be influential,\" one analyst said.\n\"They only have 7 or 8 per cent in the UK but they still have an impact on price.\"\nLidl is believed to have established a Melbourne office and it registered its trademark way back in 2000.\nSince then the Schwarz Group-owned retail behemoth has registered hundreds of product trademarks in Australia, most recently in 2009.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T12:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T11:58:24.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
