Russia has other ideas. Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe The diplomatic skills of Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop face a stern test, as a recalcitrant Russia threatens to block the government's push to set up a United Nations tribunal to prosecute those who shot down Flight MH17 and killed 39 Australian residents.\nMs Bishop is scheduled to arrive in New York on Monday to lobby UN Security Council members to establish an international criminal tribunal to hold to account those responsible for the downing of the flight near the Ukraine-Russia border 12 months ago.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has previously rejected any suggestion of such a tribunal.\nThe Kremlin has been widely accused, including by American and German intelligence officials, of supplying pro-Russian insurgents the deadly Buk surface-to-air missile fired from war-torn eastern Ukraine. Video footage appears to show Russian-backed rebels rummaging through the plane's smouldering wreckage just after the crash.\nAn armed pro-Russian separatist stands at the site of a Malaysia Airlines MH17 crash in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. Reuters Ms Bishop will again come face to face with Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin, whom she fought bitterly against last year to secure a UN Security Council resolution on the MH17 missile strike.\nUntil an eleventh-hour compromise, Mr Churkin threatened to use Russia's veto power at the security council to stop the UN resolution setting up an independent international investigation and to force gun-firing rebels to grant rescue crews access to the site so bodies could be recovered.\nUN sources in New York said Mr Churkin is again signalling that Moscow is entertaining using its veto against the latest MH17 motion. The council's five permanent members – China, France, Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United State – each have veto power.\nRussia has blamed the Ukraine government for the attack on MH17, killed 283 passengers and 15 crew, including 28 Australian citizens and 11 others who called Australia home.\n Ms Bishop said the UN Security Council must send a strong message to the growing number of non-state actors who have the ability to target civilian aircraft that \"such attacks will not be tolerated\".\n\"The UNSC is faced with a critical decision and I am determined to work with the international community to achieve accountability and closure – for the sake of the victims of MH17 and for their loved ones,\" Ms Bishop said.\nAbbott threatened to 'shirtfront' Putin Prime Minister Tony Abbott threatened to \"shirtfront\" Russian President Vladimir Putin over the incident when Mr Putin visited Australia last year.\nThe tribunal has been proposed by the joint investigation team, which hails from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine.\nAn independent safety investigation has been conducted in line with International Civil Aviation Organisation guidelines.\nWhile the investigation is ongoing, the team wants the UN Secretary-General to appoint judges and a prosecutor now to depoliticise the tribunal.\nAustralia is expected to receive strong support from most of the permanent council members, especially the United States, United Kingdom and France.\nMalaysia, which had 43 nationals on the flight bound for Kuala Lumpur, and New Zealand, which this year succeeded Australia as one of the 10 rotating members of the Security Council, are also expected to help lead the charge on the motion, due to be debated Wednesday.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-07-26T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T00:45:51.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
