"Andrew Charlton from Alpha Beta: \"Australian companies are in danger of falling into a self-fulfilling doom loop.\" Christopher Pearce Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Australia's sharemarket is becoming a global backwater sucked dry of investment ambition by a dividend-obsessed superannuation culture and over-cautious business leadership, a report shows.\nWithout a fresh wave of corporate investment into future growth, including in Asia, the worsening trend of dividend paybacks will send Australian companies into a \"self-fulfilling doom loop,\" says Andrew Charlton, a former adviser to prime minister Kevin Rudd and co-founder of economic consultancy Alpha Beta.\nRather than invest in new products or markets, ASX companies are passively handing back to shareholders 63¢ in every dollar of earnings, up 58 per cent from the 40¢ payouts of a decade ago, according to a research report by Alpha Beta.\nASX firms pay out more of their profits than counterparts in almost any other advanced sharemarket, with London companies paying out 50¢ and American companies just 29¢.\n\"Australian companies are in danger of falling into a self-fulfilling doom loop,\" said Dr Charlton. \"Weak investment is leading to low growth, which further discourages investment.\"\nAt the same time, Australia's biggest companies have an \"anaemic\" outlook for earnings growth of just 6.6 per cent over the next five years – on par with firms in Japan, and just under half the forecast 11 per cent gain expected by US S&P 500 companies.\n'Earnings growth has contributed nothing' Yet despite this defensive and future-fearing posture, total returns on the ASX200 index have soared 63 per cent over the last five years.\n Dr Charlton calculates that around half of that increase has come from dividend payouts, with the rest coming from increases in price-to-earnings ratios, which have been artificially inflated by falling official interest rates.\n\"Earnings growth has, on average, contributed nothing to ASX shareholders,\" he said.\nAlpha Beta cautions that record low Reserve Bank of Australia interest rates are likely to be nothing more than a one-off sugar hit for stock prices rather than a source of sustainable growth.\n\"If Aussie companies don't start investing, our index will become a global backwater, a dividend cow for domestic super funds, not an attractive destination for global capital,\" said Dr Charlton.\nMajor consequences for corporate profits The findings coincide with a dramatic warning last week by Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens that Australia's potential economic growth rate may have fallen since the global financial crisis to below 3 per cent – a shift that if confirmed will have major consequences for corporate profits and government budgets over the coming decade.\nMr Stevens has also opened a contentious debate with corporate boards this year, after accusing them of failing to lower their so-called investment \"hurdle rates\" for expected future returns.\nBank of England chief economist Andrew Haldane bought into the issue over the weekend, accusing UK companies of \"almost eating themselves \" after hiking payout ratios from 10 per cent in the 1970s.\n\"One of the reasons – the main reason really – why world growth has been sub-par is that businesses have not been investing sufficiently,\" Mr Haldane told the BBC.\nWhile the issue exists abroad, the growing size of Australia's superannuation system appears to be contributing to the problem, with total assets now sitting at $2 trillion, 1.3 times gross domestic product.\nMatthew Linden, director of public affairs at Industry Super Australia, said there was no evidence to support the view that union-dominated funds were showing a particular bias towards domestic shares, with large slabs of savings devoted to offshore equities, and unlisted assets.\n\"If there was an usually large allocation to domestic listed equites, you might be able to make that case,\" he said.\nRetail and industry funds tend to invest around 25 to 30 per cent in domestic shares; self-managed super funds opt for 45 per cent.\n\"People are being handed back their cash, and they're reinvesting it back into the shareholding,\" Dr Charlton said. \"That's a short-term value gain.\n\"The only long-term way to create value is through long-term earnings growth.\"\nRecord-low interest rates have tended to exacerbate the trend, by forcing more savers to pursue regular dividend payouts as a result of falling returns from fixed-income investments.\nAustralian investors in particular are used to getting their strong returns, he said.\nDr Charlton, who advised Mr Rudd at the height of the global financial crisis, says Australian companies will find growth harder to come by over the next decade, increasing the need for governments and businesses to work in tandem.\n\"Governments will need to forge ahead with structural reform to lift barriers to investment, including tax policy, trade policy and regulatory reform,\" he said.\n\"They also need to lead the way with smart investments in infrastructure and sensible industry policy to boost our non-resources sectors.\"\nHe added that regardless of whether Canberra shows leadership on such issues, companies need to re-examine whether an internal \"bias against risk\" is preventing them chasing attractive opportunities.\n\"While capital costs have fallen, many companies retain overly high hurdle rates for investment,\" he said.\n\"Second, as the mining boom comes off, Australian businesses need to think creatively to gain exposure to new sources of growth, especially in the non-resource industries that will benefit from the lower dollar, lower interest rates and technological advances.\"\nThe third push should be a renewed focus on expanding into faster-growing offshore markets.\n\"There is a huge opportunity for Australian companies to match their commercial skills to the rapid development of south-east Asian economies,\" Dr Charlton said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-07-27T12:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled":
