This book explains why Africa is now open for business - with entrepreneurs leading the way.\" - Steve Case, Co-Founder of AOL and CEO of Revolution \n\"In this bold and intelligent work, Jake Bright and Aubrey Hruby give insight into the trends that GE saw that influenced their prioritization of African as a region of choice for investment.\" - J ay Ireland, President and CEO of General Electric Africa \nThe world will interact very differently with Africa in the coming decades. A wave of transformation driven by business, modernization, and a new cadre of remarkably talented Africans is thrusting the continent from the world's margins to the global mainstream. \nTHE NEXT AFRICA: An Emerging Continent becomes a Global Powerhouse (Thomas Dunne Books; July 21, 2015; $25.99) by Jake Bright and Aubrey Hruby explains this shift. The book details how Africa's core trends have driven President Obama's decision to make the second trip to Sub-Saharan Africa of his presidency in late July 2015. His visit to Kenya for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit and Ethiopia highlights business, innovation and the growing importance of Africa on the international stage. \nIn THE NEXT AFRICA, Bright and Hruby pair their collective decades of Africa experience with several years of direct research and interviews to introduce readers to the continent's burgeoning technology movement, rising entrepreneurs, groundbreakingphilanthropists, and cultural innovators making an impact in music, fashion, and film. \nTHE NEXT AFRICA suggests a fresh framework for global citizens, public policy-makers, and CEOs to view Africa. It will no longer be \"The Hopeless Continent\", nor will it become an overnight utopia. The authors offer a more nuanced, net-sum, and data-rich approach for analyzing Africa, reconciling its continued challenges with rapid progress. Bright and Hruby contend the magnitude of Africa's markets and rising influence of its people will intersect with other key trends to shape an era in which the continent's progress finally overshadows its challenges. \nTHE NEXT AFRICA outlines Africa's future as a more globally-connected continent where its leaders and citizens wield significant economic, cultural, and political power—a future in which Americans will be more likely to own African stocks, work for companies doing business in Africa, buy Kenyan hits from iTunes, see Nigerian actors win Oscars, and learn new African names connected to tech moguls and billionaires. \nABOUT THE AUTHORS \nJAKE BRIGHT is a writer, consultant, and Whitehead Fellow of the Foreign Policy Association focused on global finance, business, and Africa. He is a contributor to publications including Fortune, the Financial Times, and U.S. News & World Report. \nAUBREY HRUBY is a senior advisor to investors and Fortune 500 companies doing business in Africa. As a Visiting Fellow at the Atlantic Council, she speaks and writes regularly on African business issues in global media including the Wall Street Journal, and the Financial Times. \nTHE NEXT AFRICA: An Emerging Continent Becomes a Global PowerhouseBy Jake Bright and Aubrey HrubyThomas Dunne Books I July 21, 2015Hardcover: 9781250063717 I $25.99eBook: 9781466868724 I $12.99 \nHighlights from THE NEXT AFRICA \nTHE NEXT AFRICA brings together the continent's transformation story of the past 15 years, and its chapters on growth, investment, and a rising consumer class provide a snapshot of the trends shaping Africa's growing \nprominence on the world stage. \nTHE NEXT AFRICA showcases the continent's emerging tech industry, with a special focus on Kenya. \"'Africa Has a Tech Industry?' The Rise of Silicon Savannah\" provides an exclusive account of the people, events, and innovation from 2005-2010 that led to Kenya's recognition as an African tech hub and IBM's decision to open a $100 million research lab there in 2013. This includes the arrival of M-PESA mobile money, a globally recognized app (Ushahidi), Africa's tech hub movement (iHub), and the Kenyan government's leadership in demonstrating a genuine commitment to information communications technology policy (ICT). President Obama will focus on many of these subjects and themes while visiting Kenya. \nTHE NEXT AFRICA illustrates the growing ties between the United States and Sub-Saharan Africa's burgeoning technology movement. It highlights African innovation such as the Brck device and profiles the continent's junior and senior tech leaders, from 30 year old startup CEOs to teenager Kelvin Doe, whose IT inventions led him to become MIT's youngest visiting practitioner. The book traces the increasing connections between African tech and Silicon Valley and Nigeria's emergence as a hotbed for startups. THE NEXT AFRICA also offers a first time account and valuation of VC funding to African startups, in collaboration with TechCrunch's Crunchbase. \nTHE NEXT AFRICA profiles business leaders who are changing their countries and the perception of Africa globally, in line with White House's Young Africa Leaders Initiative (YALI). A wave of entrepreneurial African young professionals \nis returning to the continent to launch new businesses or take up positions in existing companies. The majority of these leaders have studied at elite U.S. universities and worked in U.S. blue-chip companies. Additionally, the book highlights Africa's emerging women leaders in business, tech, and public policy. \nTHE NEXT AFRICA details growing investment of U.S. companies in African markets, including GE, IBM, Microsoft, West Rock Coffee, Walmart, and others. Authors Bright and Hruby gained exclusive access to many U.S. firms expanding on the continent and their new African partners, such as Africa's richest man Aliko Dangote. A number of these firms will be highlighted during the President's July 2015 trip. \nTHE NEXT AFRICA also connect Africa's transformation to its contemporary immigrant diaspora, illustrating how this increasingly affluent group (particularly in the U.S.) is becoming pivotal to the continent's success by driving investment and startup culture in African markets. \nTHE NEXT AFRICA highlights the greater cultural linkages bringing the U.S. closer to African nations. It acquaints readers with Africa's breakout stars in music, fashion, and film who are showing up on New York's runways and in \nHollywood studios. \nTHE NEXT AFRICA captures the concerns that are often voiced by the White House about the need for mass job creation and institutions that respond to young people's needs and aspirations. Bright and Hruby devote an entire chapter to potential obstacles to Africa's continued growth, and some of these issues will likely be brought up around the President's trip to Kenya and Ethiopia. \nTHE NEXT AFRICA updates the narrative around Africa in the United States. It dispels the view of the continent as disconnected from the international economy, defined by conflict and corruption, and heavily dependent on foreign aid.
