Reuters by Jeremy Chunn Fund managers work all day. If it's an international fund, they work all night as well. The results for 2014 show they're struggling. Of the 47 global large cap equities funds included in Morningstar's sector overview for last year, 35 returned less than the MSCI World Ex-Australia index when reported in Australian dollars.\nIf you picked a fund randomly on January 1, you'd have had a one-in-four chance of beating the global index by December 31.\n\"It was really quite a bad year for active managers in the global large cap space,\" says Morningstar senior analyst Kathryn Young.\nIn conducting detective work to find what went wrong, the research house found fund managers were held back by assessments which would have sounded perfectly reasonable at the time. \"An underweight exposure to the US and the US dollar was by far the biggest contributor to underperformance,\" she says.\nThe US market's 23 per cent return in 2014 was boosted by the Australian dollar's 9 per cent stumble against the greenback, says Morningstar analyst Matthew Wu in the report.\nTechnology, healthcare to fore Managers would have felt justified in their assessment that US stocks were overvalued if they believed prices had been driven higher by the US central bank's policy to keep interest rates very low. Profit margins in the US were at all-time highs last year, Young says, \"and yet the US market continued to rally so hard\".\nThe global large cap funds which did best in 2014 tended to favour technology and healthcare companies, she says, and were \"less underweight\" US equities.\n The typical outperforming active fund also had lower weightings to oil stocks, and was consequently not so severely struck down as oil ended the year 47 per cent cheaper than when it started.\nFunds which did badly were underexposed to the US and favoured smaller companies and companies in the emerging markets.\n\"In many cases managers tend to have a lower average market cap exposure than these market indexes, and they often find stocks that fuel outperformance in that region, but in this case it really just tended to be a drag,\" Young says.\nSo 2014 wasn't great for global large cap managers, but it's too simplistic to say a passive strategy beats an active one. \"This is a one-year period,\" Young says. \"We would suggest looking at it over a much longer period.\"\nIf the MSCI World Index beat three-quarters of active managers, how did the passive funds do? Not that much better. Of nine major region large cap exchange-traded funds Smart Investor looked at three did better than the MSCI world index: an S&P500 fund (up 22.09 per cent in 2014) and China Large-Cap fund (up 18.63 per cent), both offered by iShares, and Vanguard's US Total Market Shares Index fund (up 20.50 per cent).\nThe MSCI World Index returned 15.01 per cent in 2014.\nThe iShares fund over the Russell 2000 index in the US came close, at 13.25 per cent for the year.\nInvestors must understand index funds never actually provide index returns, of course, because they are not free. The China fund IZZ costs 72 basis points a year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:36:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
