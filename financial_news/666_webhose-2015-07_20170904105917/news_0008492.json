Contagion would have to be much sharper to really register as a proximate risk sufficient to affect U.S. policy,\" Englander said.\nThe dollar index, which tracks the U.S. unit against a basket of six major rivals, was steady on the day at 96.552 , after falling as low as 96.288 on Monday, its lowest since July 14.\nThe euro was steady at $1.10905 after scaling a nearly two-week peak of $1.11295 on Monday as risk-averse investors pared their euro-short positions.\nU.S. data on Monday showed non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft rose in June, but shipments of core capital goods used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement slipped 0.1 percent.
