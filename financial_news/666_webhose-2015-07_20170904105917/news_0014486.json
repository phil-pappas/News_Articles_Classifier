Picture: Peter Cronin Source: News Corp Australia\nHow much is certification costing businesses?\nMeat processing director: “We pay 60 cents per head for our certification fee and when you start adding up the money we get for lung, liver and heart overseas, you’re looking at an extra $50 per head in revenue through halal certification.”\n“It provides revenue to the Australian market by using the whole carcass and selling it overseas, you can’t give away lung here but it can be sold in Asian countries for a couple of dollars per kilo.\nNick Hutchinson, Fleurieu Milk and Yoghurt: “It costs us $1000 a year to be certified and it works out to cost an extra $0.002 per product per year, which is then just absorbed in house, nothing passed onto consumers at all.”\nWhere does the money raised by halal certification go?\nHalal Australia: “The service fees paid to Halal Australia for halal certification and accreditation are used to maintain the normal costs of running a registered business in Australia.”\n“These include overhead costs such as utilities, rent, inventory and supplies, and employee salaries, as well as income taxes paid to the Australian government.”\nAustralian Crime Commission: “The Australian Crime Commission is not aware of any direct links between the legitimate halal certification industry and money laundering or the financing of terrorist groups.”\nDr Muhammad Khan, CEO, Halal Australia: “Any of your readers are more than welcome to not only read the FAQ’s on our website but also on the Australian Crime Commission’s but I will say this — we have absolutely nothing to do with terrorism.”\n“99.9 per cent of Muslims are kind, loving people — we don’t condone any kind of violent activities anywhere in the world, it has nothing to do with Islam.”\nA spokesman from Vegemite says certifying their products as halal has not changed the way they’ve made their product, or the ingredients in it. Source: News Corp Australia\nWhy do products that are not edible require certification?\nColes: “We don’t require suppliers to provide Halal certification for products other than in specific ranges aimed at customers for who this is important.”\nDr Muhammad Khan, CEO, Halal Australia: “It’s not only edible products but pharmaceutical products and toiletries which can be use or applied on the skin, as it can contain some of the impurities from ingredients that are not halal.”\n“All food products, processed food products or anything that may contain gelatine coming from pig skin needs to be certified.”\nDoes halal certification change the way companies make their product?\nVegemite: “For the record, we’re proud to make products to suit our diverse Australian population and export markets.”\n“Certification doesn’t change the way we make our products or the ingredients in them.”\nColes: “We are advised by our suppliers that the Halal process does not significantly alter the way the product is manufactured or processed and does not affect the ingredients, quality or taste.\nIs the certification really worth the benefit to the economy?\nNick Hutchinson, Fleurieu Milk and Yoghurt: “It’s a great thing for state and national economy, we have picked up economic benefit through the Emirates contract and there are other companies right across Australia who are putting millions of dollars back into the economy through being halal certified and exporting to countries like Indonesia.”\nDepartment of Agriculture report: “In 2012-13, Indonesia (which has the world’s largest Muslim population) was the third-largest market for Australian food exports.”\n“The value of Australian food exports increased to $31.8 billion in 2012—13, $1.3 billion or 4.3 per cent higher than 2011—12. The main contributor to the increase was meat (up $538 million), largely reflecting increased export demand.”\nJames Mathews, AFGC: “The alternative is if you get rid of it, we’re completely losing our market — handing other companies the opportunity to pick up the overseas market.”\nOriginally published as Fact vs. fiction in halal debate ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/fact-vs-fiction-in-halal-certification-debate/story-fnkgdftz-1227462138699?sv=6a8351943184a005ae428bdef3a1f592&title=Fact+vs.+fiction+in+halal+debate", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/fact-vs-fiction-in-halal-certification-debate/story-fnkgdftz-1227462138699?sv=6a8351943184a005ae428bdef3a1f592", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Fact+vs.+fiction+in+halal+debate&c=TERRORISM+funding+and+fast+food+rage%3A+the+halal+debate+remains+cloaked+in+rumour+and+myth.+Here%2C+we+clear+some+of+it+up+for+you.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/fact-vs-fiction-in-halal-certification-debate/story-fnkgdftz-1227462138699?sv=6a8351943184a005ae428bdef3a1f592", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/fact-vs-fiction-in-halal-certification-debate/story-fnkgdftz-1227462138699?sv=6a8351943184a005ae428bdef3a1f592&title=Fact+vs.+fiction+in+halal+debate", "http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/halal-certification-frequently-asked-questions-answered/story-fnmd7bxx-1227461282226", "http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/halal-in-australia-top-questions-on-halal-certification-explained-by-australian-food-and-grocery-council/story-fnmd7bxx-1227359887153", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/fact-vs-fiction-in-halal-certification-debate/story-fnkgdftz-1227462138699?sv=6a8351943184a005ae428bdef3a1f592", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/fact-vs-fiction-in-halal-certification-debate/story-fnkgdftz-1227462138699?sv=6a8351943184a005ae428bdef3a1f592&h=Fact+vs.+fiction+in+halal+debate"], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T11:57:58.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
