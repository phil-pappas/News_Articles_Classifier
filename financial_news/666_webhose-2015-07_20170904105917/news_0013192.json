Photo: Reuters\nThe Shanghai Composite Index had a wilder day, opening 7.8 per cent higher before briefly falling into the negative in late afternoon trade after the Chinese government threw lifelines to stem the volatility.\n\"A pull-back during the day is probably a better assessment of the reaction to the no vote,\" QIC chief economist Matthew Peter said.\n\"What would be required for a dramatic impact on the Australian economy and consequently the sharemarket would be a large-scale contagion,\" he said.\nDr Peter said even if a Greek exit from the eurozone did occur, the market reaction would probably be sanguine, because they would factor in a large scale response by the European Central Bank to maintain liquidity.\nBut the local sharemarket's fortunes this week would be led by the overnight market responses in Europe and the United States, he said.\nCMC chief markets analyst Ric Spooner said the overnight markets including European and US equities and European bonds would be watched closely to gauge reaction from markets closer to the drama.\n\"It all might provide some insight in the thinking of the potential for contagion,\" he said.\nDownward moves The mining sector struggled today after the iron-ore price slumped 11 per cent last week to $US55.26 a tonne, the lowest price since April.\nRio Tinto fell 2.5 per cent to $51.16, BHP Billiton lost 2.2 per cent to $26.01 while Fortescue Metals Group shed 5.8 per cent, taking its share price to a six-year low of $1.71.\n\"The downward moves in iron ore and oil in particular are a couple of leading concerns for mining and energy stocks at the moment,\" Mr Spooner said.\n\"In the case of iron ore, shipments are increasing again, putting downward pressure on spot prices, while with oil, I think the market's reacting to the fact that the much-awaited cuts in US shale oil have not occurred,\" he said.\n\"I also suspect there is some defensive action being taken against when the oil market will be lifting sanctions against Iran,\" he said.\nWhile oil plunged, gold prices enjoyed some safe-haven buying, and spot gold prices rose 0.3 per cent. The day's share winners were gold miners Evolution Mining, up 7.4 per cent, and Northern Star Resources, up 3.3 per cent.\nThe banks were all down, with Commonwealth Bank down 0.4 per cent, Westpac and ANZ Banking Group down 0.8 per cent and National Australia Bank down 0.7 per cent.\nTelstra fell slightly down 0.2 per cent, Woolworths was down 1.8 per cent and Wesfarmers lost 0.9 per cent.\nDr Peter said he wouldn't be surprised to see volatility similar to last week's sell-offs and rallies.\n\"Volatility is going to be a feature of financial markets going forward, the reason for that is there is what seems to be a gradual recovery in the major economies of Europe, the US and Japan, but they're in a pretty fragile state, and shocks like Greece or disappointing data in China will magnify the responses of the market.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/news/world/asia/china-159-billion-state-pension-fund-told-dont-sell-caijing-report-20150706-gi68hu", "http://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/whats-next-for-financial-markets-after-greece-votes-no-20150706-gi5r49"], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T19:06:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
