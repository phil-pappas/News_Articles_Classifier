China’s growing middle class is increasingly fond of European food which led to Italian restaurant chain Pizza Express being sold to China’s Hony Capital last year for £900m. \n“It’s been another busy year for the group, and the success of our newer brands is evident in the excellent growth figures that we are witnessing at present”, said Marcello Distefano, managing director at San Carlo. \n“We’re focused on maintaining this momentum, and are looking to offer our innovative concepts to new and exciting markets.” \nSan Carlo founder Carlo Distefano and his son Marcello \nSan Carlo also has a tie-up with Italian-born celebrity chef Aldo Zilli who has created a range of dishes for San Carlo’s Cicchetti restaurants. \nThe business continues to be family run by Sicilian-born Carlo Distefano, 71, and his son Marcello, who started the business in 2004. \nThe success of San Carlo is a tale of entrepreneurial success after Distefano arrived in Britain in 1962 aged 17 with just £12 loaned to him by his brother and a job at a barbershop. He set up his first restaurant 30 years later.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T00:44:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
