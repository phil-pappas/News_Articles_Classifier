Photo: Jim Rice\nSpecialist hospital operator Pulse Health's recent bid for ophthalmic surgeries business Vision Eye Institute appears highly opportunistic but faces one major roadblock (more on that shortly).\nVision is Australia's largest provider of ophthalmic care, and operates along Australia's east coast. The company operates eight day surgeries, 18 ophthalmic consulting clinics and six laser refractive clinics. Pulse operates eight specialist hospitals and both the existing chairman and fairly new chief executive Phillipa Blakey have made it clear Pulse's strategy has been to grow as a niche operator of specialist private hospitals, and specialised facilities – such as those that Vision operate.\nThis from Pulse chairman Stuart James in the 2014 annual report: \"As a private hospital operator that is not wedded to large multi-service line hospitals with high numbers of beds, I believe that Pulse is ideally placed to meet the growing demand for more niche, individualised service provision …\"\nThe specialist hospital operator sees the merger as the combination of two specialised businesses looking to expand into complementary businesses.\nAdvertisement The bid comes just eight weeks after Vision's former CEO and managing director Brett Coverdale resigned, and the company has yet to select a replacement, suggesting Pulse sees this as a moment not to be missed.\nVision's initial response to the bid doesn't exactly drip with enthusiasm for the deal. It stated \"the board notes the unsolicited and opportunistic nature of the offer …\".\nAnd it seems investors think the deal won't go through either, with shares trading at a 12 per cent discount to the bid price of 1.6 Pulse Health shares for each Vision share. At current prices that equates to about 88.8 cents per Vision share, which are currently trading at just 78.5 cents.\nPrimary block The biggest block in Pulse's path is medical centre, imaging and pathology specialist Primary Health Care. The company owns 22 per cent of Vision and Pulse needs at least 90 per cent of Vision's shareholders to approve the deal. The company would have known about Primary's holding in Vision, and clearly expects the largest shareholder in Vision to sell its stake.\nIf Primary declines, there's no chance of the deal going through. But Pulse is clearly betting on Primary's recently appointed CEO Peter Gregg wanting to exit the eye care company. The medical centre operator built up its stake in Vision prior to his arrival and increased its stake to 22 per cent in July 2014 from 20 per cent.\nGregg was appointed CEO and MD of Primary in February. What's more, the company's CFO, Andrew Duff, resigned on June 19, but will stay until end of September, so there are plenty of changes happening at the company.\nGregg may see the 22 per cent of Vision as a non-core holding, and could very well see this as a chance to exit the stake.\nThe problem is that selling out to Pulse could see Primary end up with a 10.3 per cent stake in the combined Pulse-Vision company, rather than a wad of cash of around $31.3 million. It's entirely possible that Primary wouldn't mind that. It gives it a blocking stake, much like the one they had previously, and gives them a price well above Vision's pre-bid trading price of around 68 cents.\nPulse has already received the support for the takeover from another of Vision's major shareholders, Viburnum, which holds 15.9 per cent of the company, which is a good start at least.\nOne option that the market is clearly discounting is Primary making a higher bid, but that could be a possibility. Pulse's bid values Vision at around $160 million – loose change for Primary and its $2.5 billion market cap.\nFoolish takeaway Primary clearly holds the key to the takeover with its 22 per cent stake, and the health care company is probably being courted by both Vision's and Pulse's representatives. Vision's doctors also hold a substantial combined 7 per cent, so they hold a powerful position in any negotiations.\nGiven the tailwinds in the health care industry, this could be one story worth following. The combined group could well be a target for Primary or hospital operators Healthscope and Ramsay Health Care down the track.\nInvestors, don't miss out: Low interest rates mean dividend-paying shares are very attractive, compared to term deposits.
