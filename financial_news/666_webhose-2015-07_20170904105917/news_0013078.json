A binding death nomination \"binds\" the trustees of your super fund to direct your super to a dependent beneficiary of your choosing on your death.\nTrue, if you don't have a binding death nomination your super will \"most likely\" be passed through your will to your beneficiaries at your will's direction and those assets will then fall outside the attractive taxation structure of super. This might be the case for industry, corporate or retail funds. It will also be open to the whims of the estate planning process, including probate and the possibility of legal challenges that can slow down the distribution process.\nA more sensible option for superannuants in all fund types is to sign a binding death nomination, where your beneficiaries receive your assets within the tax-effective structure of super. This is especially important for surviving spouses to continue receiving the tax-free income streams or superannuation payout on death, called a reversionary pension.\nFor SMSFs, your executor slips into the position of trustee on your death and therefore will have the power to control the fund.\nRegulations require your binding death nomination to be updated every three years, unless you have a non-lapsing nomination that is available now in some newer trust deeds. They are also helpful for looking after dependent children, including the disabled. Take heed and update now.\nMy fiancee has a residential property that is held in her own name. Can she transfer it to our recently established SMSF?\n You can not transfer a residential property from a personal name, joint names or trust into an SMSF. Interestingly, the reverse is possible. A DIY super fund can sell or transfer a property to a member in some circumstances.\nFor those with commercial property in their personal names, it is possible to transfer an asset classified as business real property – for example, a commercial property or possibly a family farm – into an SMSF.\nYou need to be aware of the capital gains tax consequences of the transfer, as well as stamp duty. Also for consideration might be the ability to borrow and buy property in a SMSF. Seek expert advice if you want to do anything with property in a DIY super fund.\nI am in my 50s and am an employee of the SA government. As well as employer contributions I make salary-sacrificed contributions into the SuperSA SSS fund. This fund allows unlimited salary-sacrificed contributions, although if the balance were to exceed $1.3 million any subsequent withdrawal would be taxed at the top marginal rate. To avoid this possibility, can I roll over previous salary-sacrificed amounts from SSS into another superannuation fund, such as an SMSF or industry super fund, while still making salary-sacrificed contributions to SSS? What are the tax consequences?\nYour SA super fund is indeed unique – and accompanying its many advantages are a range of restrictions. In fact, I don't know another fund quite like this one!\nYou are correct in assuming that you have unlimited salary-sacrifice capability up to a maximum lifetime limit of $1,395,000 and you do not have a contribution cap of $35,000 (for over 50s) like everyone else. If you earn more than $300,000 you might be affected by the division 293 rules of additional 15 per cent tax so please be aware of this.\nI had a client recently salary-sacrificing $250,000 a year into his SSS account and I had to ring SA Super three times before I believed this was possible.\nAnother big advantage is that you can split your contributions with your spouse and have an annual opportunity to do so.\nYou will, however, be taxed at 15 per cent on the withdrawal from the fund and you must reach a condition of release before accessing the funds. These include being older than 65 or retiring between the ages of 56 and 64.\nTo answer your question, you can not roll out your funds from the SSS scheme until you stop working for the SA government or associated entity. You can therefore not roll any funds into your SMSF or any other fund and thus there are no tax consequences.\nFinancial planner Sam Henderson, chief executive of Henderson Maxwell, will be answering your questions while veteran AFR DIY super columnist John Wasiliev is on indefinite medical leave. To submit a question, please email Q&A@fairfaxmedia.com.au. Readers wanting to pass on their best wishes to John can do so by emailing dcleveland@fairfaxmedia.com.au .\nThe best way to manage these funds is to tip as much as you can into the fund up to the lifetime cap and then at retirement start a pension and pay your 15 per cent tax progressively as you draw down your income. This will marginalise your tax obligations over a lifetime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:14:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
