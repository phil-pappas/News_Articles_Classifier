The vestigial trauma from 1920s-era hyperinflation which helped usher in the Nazi era still colours the national thinking. \n\"Consumers in Germany have little desire to experiment,\" said Carl-Ludwig Thiele, a Bundesbank board member. \nBut \"changes in how people pay are coming, step-by-step\". \nIn a revolutionary move by German standards, discount retailers Lidl and Aldi started accepting Visa (Xetra: A0NC7B - news ) and MasterCard this month, after electronics chains Media Markt and Saturn took the same decision in late May. \nAnd from the autumn, Media Markt and Saturn customers will be able to check themselves out at the till by scanning their cards or mobile phones. \n\"It is no longer relevant to talk today of Germany as a country of cash payers. Perhaps the Germans just need a little longer than others to be convinced of the benefits of the new payment systems,\" said Horst Rueter of research institute EHI in the western city of Cologne. \nBuyers who came of age in the Internet era are rapidly embracing a world without cash, with 20 percent of German 14 to 29 year olds already paying using their smartphones, according to a survey by the high-tech industry federation Bitkom. \n\"With the technical possibilities now available, coins and notes are an anachronism,\" Peter Bofinger, one of five Wise Men experts advising the German government on economic policy, told Der Spiegel news magazine. \nBeyond the benefits to consumers, he said, less cash would improve efficiency and make it easier to combat money laundering and other financial crimes. \n- Kind of freedom - \nHowever, reassurance about the safety of payment methods and a ceiling on costs are crucial because \"the willingness of consumers to pay for payment services is extremely low,\" said Thiele. \nThe European Union this month passed a regulation capping fees on payments made with debit and credit cards, which should also spur their use. \n\"The trend towards less cash will continue, although this will be a continuous and slow process,\" Rueter said. \nCash will only cover less than half the payments in the \"medium term\", the Bundesbank said. \nFor its defenders, cash offers a kind of freedom. Three in four Germans said they would object to merchants refusing cash in the future, according to a survey by polling group YouGov (LSE: YOU.L - news ) . \n\"Each country has its own way of paying,\" Rueter said, based on \"a mixture of cultural specificity, specific needs and common sense\" which can evolve with time. \nGermany, for example, stopped using cheques about 15 years ago, calling them obsolete.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T08:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T08:53:21.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
