HERNDON, Va. (PRWEB) July 22, 2015\nNACHA—The Electronic Payments Association® President and CEO Janet O. Estep has been named as a member of the steering committee of the Federal Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force.\nThe task force was formed to identify and evaluate approaches for implementing a safe, ubiquitous, faster payments capability in the U.S. Its creation is one of the milestones outlined in the Federal Reserve’s Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System paper published in January 2015.\nAs a participant on the steering committee, Estep will help advise the Federal Reserve task force chair on meeting agendas and assist in prioritizing task force activities. The committee also will assist in establishing and recommending the scope of work groups, synthesizing task force perspectives, and determining items in need of task force deliberation.\nThe task force, which has more than 300 members from the entire spectrum of payments system stakeholders, brings together many organizations interested in the future of U.S. payment systems, from financial institutions and technology providers to a variety of end-users, associations and consultants.\n“I am looking forward to further working with the industry and the Federal Reserve on the steering committee, helping to bring forward ideas from many of the task force’s other participants,” Estep said. “NACHA also will share findings from the ACH Blueprint , developed with the industry in 2012, to discuss options for how we can collectively leverage the strengths of the ACH Network as we build for the future.”\nThroughout its history, NACHA has worked collaboratively with many industry stakeholders to help bring diverse groups together via rulemaking and standards creation. In May, the industry took an immediate action to move payments faster with its approval of the Same Day ACH amendment to the NACHA Operating Rules. The rule enables same-day settlement capability for virtually any ACH transaction, creating new payment options for businesses, governments and consumers, as well as functionality that can be leveraged in the future for real-time payments and other products and services.\nSame Day ACH will be implemented in a phased approach, with Phase 1 scheduled to begin September 23, 2016.
