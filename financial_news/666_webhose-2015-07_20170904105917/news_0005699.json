The proximate drivers of our change of view are the announcement of the referendum, the imposition of capital controls and the emphatic NO outcome in the referendum. \nBuiter has a chequered history when it comes to predicting Grexit himself, despite inventing the term. \nHere's a timeline: February 2012: The Citi analysts send out their note, in which \"Grexit\" was first used. He said there was a 50% chance of the event happening then . June 2012: Buiter wrote in the Financial Times that the then-fresh New Democracy-led government meant Grexit was delayed, but suggested that the burdens of austerity made it still clearly possible. July 2012: By this point he raised his probability of Grexit within 12-18 months to 90%. October 2012: He cut that probability back to 60% a few months later. May 2013: Grexit was dropped as Citi's base case, meaning that they thought it was now more likely not to happen. 2013-2014: For much of this period Greece dropped out of headlines, with the euro crisis over (or at least paused). April 2015: A research email from Citi (but under the names of analysts other than Buiter) said \"we continue to see Grexit as unlikely.\" July 2015: Grexit is now Buiter's base case again, with a probability of \"over 50%\" in the next three years. \nSo really, who knows.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T17:58:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
