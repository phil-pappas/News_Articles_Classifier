Bloomberg by Angela Macdonald-Smith The oil industry's fears of a fresh bout of weakness in global crude oil prices are crystalising, as Brent crude oil plunged below $US60 a barrel for the first time since mid-April, punishing local energy stocks, and weakening prospects for a recovery later in the year.\nThe latest dive in prices, after a period of relative stability in recent months, however is better news for motorists signalling a potential easing in petrol prices, although the decline in the Australian dollar will cancel out some of the impact at the bowser, according to economists.\nIn early trading on Tuesday, Santos shares were down 3 per cent, Beach Energy 1.5 per cent, Woodside Petroleum lost 1 per cent and Oil Search, down 1.6 per cent.\nAfter a savage sell-off in recent days, Oil Search is trading below its lows of January at the worst of the oil price collapse. Morgans analyst Adrian Prendergast noted that aside from the oil price issue, Oil Search is being affected by fears that Sinopec, a major customer for the Papua New Guinea LNG project, may cut back on LNG imports.\nBrent crude, the marker for the majority of the world's oil production which had risen 40 per cent from its January lows, dropped 6.3 per cent on Monday to $US56.54. The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, tumbled 7.7 per cent on Monday to $US52.53 a barrel. The drop of $US4.40 was the biggest percentage daily drop since early February.\nCommentators had been warning of the potential for a fresh slump in prices in the near term. Credit Suisse last month told clients that persistently high US oil production, combined with inventories at decades-high levels, posed a risk for a tumble in prices in the third quarter. The prospects for a nuclear deal with Iran that would see sanctions lifted added to the downward risks to prices.\nMeanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is pumping hard, with production up again in June for the fourth straight month thanks to Saudi Arabia and Iraq, to 31.28 million barrels a day, according to the latest Platts survey. OPEC output is at its highest now since August 2012, just when the market is contemplating the prospects of a lot more oil being pumped out from Iran.\nThe June total leaves OPEC producing nearly 1.3 million b/d in excess of its official 30 million barrels a day ceiling.\n Talks between Iran and the P5+1 group, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany, on a nuclear deal are set to reach a climax this week. Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Mark Lewis said he was expecting a deal to be struck, triggering \"short-term downward pressure\" on oil prices.\nBut Mr Lewis says Iran faces challenges to ramping up exports quickly, and is also forecasting US shale oil output to show a \"clear decline\" by late in the September quarter. As a result he is sticking with his forecast that Brent will recover to $US75 a barrel by the end of the year.\nOthers take a less bullish view. FACTS Global Energy chairman Fereidun Fesharaki said he expects a deal with Iran would result in about 500,000 barrels a day of Iranian oil hitting the market by October, with another 700,000 barrels a day increase by early 2016. While demand is a little stronger than many anticipated, it won't be enough to absorb the extra quantities.\nDr Fesharaki put the changes of a $US10-$US20 a barrel slide in oil prices at about 50 per cent, with prices potentially only recovering into the $US60s range by the year end.\nCapital Economics is more bearish. \"All signs point south for oil prices,\" it said, citing the combination of a Greek \"no\" vote, signs of rising US oil production, prospects for an Iranian deal and slowing Chinese oil imports.\nCapital has, as a result, cut its forecasts for Brent oil prices for the year-end to just $US55 from $US60, and its forecast for WTI to $US50 from $US55.\n\"We are also moving our end-2016 forecasts down to $US60, from $US65, for Brent and from $US62 to $US55 for WTI, as we expect increases in US output and extra supplies from Iran to continue to weigh on prices,\" commodities economist Thomas Pugh said in a note to clients.\nThe latest bout of weakness in oil prices coincides with a slide in the Australian dollar, cancelling out some of the benefit that could be seen by motorists from lower global crude prices. The Australian dollar has dropped below US75c for the first time since 2009.\nStill, if oil prices remain low, local petrol prices should drop, said AMP Capital head of dynamic asset allocation Nader Naeimi said.\n\"Given the big fall in crude, petrol prices will be under pressure, though not to the same extent as the fall in crude prices because the Aussie dollar is falling at the same time,\" Mr Naeimi said.\n\"All in all, we should see some easing of petrol prices in Australia.\"\nUnleaded petrol prices averaged $1.451 across Sydney on Monday, according to NRMA.", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QqQIwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.afr.com%2Fmarkets%2Fcurrencies%2Fgreece-turmoil-sends-australian-dollar-below-us75c-for-first-time-since-2009-20150705-gi5q83&ei=kDWbVcO3Novk8AW4o7BQ&usg=AFQjCNHXp5hGLXlCMrZJaYokOmvlWMzUQA&sig2=5AGiY0NNb_L_XrLbIkLv3A&bvm=bv.96952980,d.dGc"], "published": "2015-07-07T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:14:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
