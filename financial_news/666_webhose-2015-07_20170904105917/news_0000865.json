Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Sydney's mid-winter clearance rate picked up as rising prices continued to increase the number of houses being put up for auction.\nOn Saturday, a day after Nigel Milsom was awarded the Archibald Prize for portraits, three-time Archibald winner Eric Smith sold his three-bedroom Woollahra home for $2.96 million, nearly $500,000 above the $2.5 million reserve.\nIt was the first sale since the Smith family moved into it in 1958 and the double-fronted Victorian home was the creative base of a lifetime of award-winning work by 95-year-old Eric Smith.\nThe studio at the back was where he painted his three Archibald Prize-winning portraits, three Sulman Prize-winning paintings, two Wynne Prize-winning landscapes and five of the six works which won him Blake Prizes, daughter Barbara said.\nA five bedroomed worker's cottage at McMahons Point, NSW, sold for $1.96 million on Saturday, $60,000 above the reserve. \"We weren't sure if it would go that high, but we were hoping it would,\" Ms Smith told The Australian Financial Review on Sunday.\nLike many homes in the area, the Small Street property described as a \"rustic cottage\" in marketing material, kept much of its original form, she said.\n\"The gables and front are still very much original because Dad always loved the front of house,\" she said.\nThe NSW capital cleared 82.6 per cent of the 622 auctions in the week to Saturday for which results were reported, CoreLogic figures on Sunday showed. This was up from the 78.8 per cent a week earlier.\n Sydney auctions up Even though auction numbers were higher than at the same time last year – Sydney had a total 768 auctions this week, up from 588 in the equivalent period 12 months ago – overall listings numbers showed there were fewer houses for sale in both Sydney and Melbourne and the heightened competition was pushing sale times of private-treaty sales to record lows .\nThat was clear on the northern side of Sydney Harbour, where a five-bedroom former worker's cottage in McMahons Point sold for $1.96 million, $60,000 above the reserve price, despite it needing a careful and costly renovation.\nThe house at 83 Bank Street had an extra level installed and a back extension 50 years ago.\n\"The house is pretty original condition,\" said McGrath Neutral Bay agent Annika Bongiorno. \"It needed to be reworked, either gutted or rebuilt, but because it's a conservation area, you have to keep the front.\"\nThe lack of stock had driven prices up 30 per cent – almost double the Sydney average – in the McMahon's Point-Lavender Bay area over the past 12 months, Ms Bongiorno said.\n\"It's especially quiet at the moment, so there's a lot buyers wanting to get in,\" she said.\nIn Melbourne, too, the clearance rate slipped to 74.9 per cent on the reported 625 auctions, compared with 77.4 per cent last week. This came even as the number of auctions rose to a scheduled 729 – up on the 674 of the same week last year.\nThe Real Estate Institute of Victoria last week said the median house price in the Melbourne metro area rose to $706,000 for the three months to June 30, up from $671,000 in the March quarter.\nThe clearance rate picked up to 65.4 per cent in Brisbane from 52.5 per cent last week, CoreLogic said. At 115, the number of auctions was similar to the 116 last year.\nIn Adelaide, the clearance rate of 69.4 per cent – reflecting the results of the 49 auctions reported was up from 66.1 per cent last week and in line with the 69 per cent of the same week a year ago.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-07-19T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T11:04:15.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
