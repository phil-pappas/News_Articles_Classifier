There is clearly hesitation from buyers to even consider purchasing gold as we approach the timing of a US interest rate rise and the outlook for gold remains weak.\" \nBy Friday on the London Bullion Market, the price of gold eased to $1,167.95 an ounce from $1,170.50 a week earlier. \nSilver dropped to $15.64 an ounce from $15.83. \nOn the London Platinum and Palladium Market, platinum gained to $1,083 an ounce from $1,074. \nPalladium grew to $701 an ounce from $676. \nBASE METALS: Nickel hit a six-year low point at $10,795 a tonne in a dramatic drop, before pulling back considerably. \n\"The weak Chinese equity markets are clearly preventing metal prices from making any noticeable recovery,\" said analysts at Commerzbank (Xetra: CBK100 - news ) . \nCapital Economics added: \"Weak demand from the stainless steel sector has been one factor in the price weakness\" of nickel. \"Growth in China?s stainless steel output ground to a halt last year and producers drew down nickel inventories,\" they added in a note to clients. \nShanghai stocks plunged almost six percent Friday, capping their worst three weeks in 23 years as analysts warned panic was setting in and authorities pledged more support after recent moves to staunch the blood-letting failed. \nBy Friday on the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three months rose to $5,803.50 a tonne from $5,758.50 a week earlier. \nThree-month aluminium gained to $1,728 a tonne from $1,709.50. \nThree-month lead fell to $1,775 a tonne from $1,787. \nThree-month tin decreased to $14,400 a tonne from $14,865. \nThree-month nickel slid to $12,125 a tonne from $12,560. \nThree-month zinc dipped to $2,025 a tonne from $2,026. \n- Cocoa hits high - \nCOCOA: London-traded cocoa hit a four-year high at £2,191 a tonne as supplies tighten in Ghana. \nBy Friday on LIFFE, London's futures exchange, cocoa for delivery in September reached £2,171 a tonne from £2,161 a week earlier. \nBy Thursday on the ICE Futures US exchange, cocoa for September edged up to $3,288 a tonne from $3,274 the previous Friday. \nSUGAR: Prices extended recent gains. \nBy Friday on LIFFE, a tonne of white sugar for delivery in August grew to $372.60 from $362.80 a week earlier. \nBy Thursday on ICE Futures US, unrefined sugar for October rose to 12.30 US cents from 12.09 cents the previous Friday. \nCOFFEE (NYBOT: KC-ZN15-c.NYB - news ) : Prices fell as the dollar strengthened. \nBy Thursday on ICE Futures US, Arabica for delivery in September slid to 127.40 US cents a pound from 136.75 cents the previous Friday. \nBy Friday on LIFFE, Robusta for September decreased to $1,744 a tonne from $1,818. \nRUBBER: Prices declined as the ringgit strengthened and on fears over the Greek debt crisis, traders said. \nOn Friday, the Malaysian Rubber Board's benchmark SMR20 fell to 149.90 US cents per kilo from 155.00 US cents a week ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T22:41:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
