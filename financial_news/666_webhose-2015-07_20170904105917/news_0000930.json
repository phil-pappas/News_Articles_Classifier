A week after the news that the board had decided to oust Antony Jenkins as chief executive and replace him temporarily with new chairman John McFarlane, the boardroom appears to have descended into something of a modern day farce. \nThe apparent villain of Jenkins’ departure, Sir Mike Rake, seems to be at the centre of the whole story. \nAs deputy chairman and senior independent director, the former CBI president was named last week as the man who led the coup on Jenkins. \nBlamed for being too slow to lead much-needed cost-cutting at the bank, and spending too much time focused on the bank’s image and not enough time on its profitability, Jenkins’ departure was not a surprise to those who have followed the bank’s progress closely. \nSir Mike, the longest serving Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) director, had, he said last week, decided it was time for a change, and for a new face to lead that change. Jenkins skill set did not suit, he said. \nAntony Jenkins \nTo those with a good working knowledge of the Barclays boardroom, that explanation was not necessarily believable - for three reasons. \nOne, McFarlane took over as chairman from Sir David Walker in April, since which point Jenkins’ days have been numbered. Despite Jenkins saying to those who would listen in recent months that he and McFarlane came from similar backgrounds citing the fact they both studied at Cranfield School of Management and both spent time working at Citigroup - to those who know the able Scottish chairman, the decision was always a fait accompli. \nTwo, Sir Mike was on the board that appointed Jenkins. In fact, he played a significant role in choosing him. For him to say now that he has “reflected long and hard on the issue of group leadership” seems a little rich. \nThree, Sir Mike has himself been in the departure lounge for some time. Not only has he served seven years on the bank’s board, he is understood to have unsuccessfully put his name in the frame for the bank’s chairmanship both when Marcus Agius stepped down and again when Sir David retired. To suggest that his final act would be to lead the ousting of the bank’s chief executive again seems a step too far. \nOf course, to keep the corporate governance wallahs happy, it could not be the case that the bank admitted McFarlane had ousted Jenkins purely to put himself in charge, and so the statement had to be worded in such a way as to make it look as if Sir Mike led the process. \nBut in reality, he simply rubber-stamped what was ultimately McFarlane’s call. \nJohn McFarlane \nA week on, however, and the process of events appears to be unravelling. \nA news report earlier in the week that Sir Mike is heading to pastures new seems to have sent the bank’s spinners into something of a state. \nThe original report said that Sir Mike “is preparing to leave” Barclays to take up the chairmanship of Worldpay, which is gearing up to float on the London market. \nCue silence initially from the bank, followed, some 12 hours later after the story was published, by a statement emailed to jouranlists which said that “Sir Michael intends to continue in these positions, and be a member of the board, until at least the end of 2015”. It added that he would only stand down once a new senior indepdent director was in place. \nA full 24 hours after the first statement, a second press release was issued, this time to investors via the London Stock Exchange (Other OTC: LDNXF - news ) , saying largely the same thing, but adding that Sir Mike will only go once a new chief executive has been found and once a new deputy chairman has been named. \nIt also added that “any conflict of interest which may arise in respect of his chairmanship of Worldpay will be managed in the normal manner”. \nReading between the lines, it seems that regulators and investors have called foul here. With Jenkins leaving, and now Sir Mike departing, who would be in charge? It seems to be the case that both are concerned that McFarlane could be in a position to wield too much power without any checks and balances. \nIf so, they shouldn’t be. McFarlane has a good reputation when it comes to delivering change at big financial services organisations. During his time as executive chairman at Aviva , before hiring Mark Wilson as chief executive, he began a considerable cost-cutting programme that resulted in delivering real returns to investors. He also almost single-handedly oversaw the recruitment of Wilson (Oslo: WILS.OL - news ) , who most would agree has been a strong chief executive. \nBarclays is safe in McFarlane’s hands, and despite its recent public relations hiccups, it will be a better bank as a result of his chairmanship, executive or otherwise. \n= Don't get too comfy at Worldpay, Sir Mike = \nWith a major Ofcom review of BT , where he is also chairman, now in train, a busy few months in prospect at Barclays, and the chairmanship of soon-to-float Worldpay, Sir Mike Rake is one of the busiest businessmen in the country. \nBut maybe he shouldn’t worry so much. Just as at RAC (Taiwan OTC: 2237.TWO - news ) , where he was named chairman last summer only for the business to be sold rather than floated, Worldpay’s private equity owners are continuing to flirt with a number of possible trade and financial suitors. Maybe it’ll be second time unlucky for Sir Mike? \njames.quinn@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T19:50:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
