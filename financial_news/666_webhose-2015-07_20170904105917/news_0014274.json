Milos Bicanski Share on twitter by Jacob Greber One of the basic realities of business and economics is that the long-term cost of inaction can far outweigh the short-term cost of action.\nThis is also true of politics, as is becoming increasingly evident in the federal government's go-slow strategy on medium-term budget repair and economic reform.\nWhile most of the world has been mesmerised by the colossal omni-shambles that Greece and its European Union \"partners\" have created for themselves, there are plenty of more prosaic examples for why this stuff is far more urgent than the Prime Minister would have you believe.\nTo be sure, this is often a debate that gets stretched too far. Critics of budget reform in Australia have rightfully lampooned as hysterical alarmism the warnings by members of what they call the \"debt and deficit brigade\" that Australia risks becoming a future Greece.\nThere are many reasons why this criticism is justified. Unlike our Hellenic friends, everyone actually pays taxes in Australia whether they like it or not, the pension age is 65 and rising, the Reserve Bank runs an independent monetary policy and the economy benefits from the \"shock-absorber\" of its own currency.\nThese are among reasons Australia is not Greece or likely to become so.\nBut none of that absolves the political class in Canberra and elsewhere of responsibility for getting on with the job. And it certainly doesn't justify the return to complacency, entrenched recently in the May budget's breezy forecast of a return to surplus early next decade.\nFresh economic signs Almost daily there are fresh economic signs that this is not on the cards. Wages growth is weak, income from exports is falling as China curbs its demand, and productivity – the great driver of living standards – is going nowhere.\nSome commentators believe the only way to shake the political economy into action is to wait for a full-blown crisis.\nAs a deliberate strategy this is morally dubious at best, given the real-world impact of recessions on households, particularly the young and the poor.\nThe most striking thing about the pictures of Greeks standing outside their shuttered bank branches is that most are pensioners. The wealthy and fleet-footed have long ago moved their assets into European banks.\nWhich makes it incumbent on today's policy makers to get ahead of the curve by building a plan for budget repair based on sober assumptions about future growth and building the political case for economic changes that will inevitably run headlong against vested interests. Think industrial relations, tax reform and competition policy.\nFor the Australian debate it should be worth remembering that the consequence of blundering your fiscal policy doesn't need to be as dramatic to matter as it does in Greece, where a deep and lasting impoverishment is now assured. What this does to the social fabric of that region will be a critical question of coming months and years, even if the financial market impact turns out to be modest.\nBudget mismanagement Borrowing money to fund recurrent expenses rarely ends well and is a clear sign of profound budget mismanagement. The failures of today can have a disproportionately large impact in the future.\nAustralia is now showing signs of institutionalising this behaviour, as the Grattan Institute's John Daley and Danielle Wood recently laid bare in their highly recommended report, Fiscal Challenges for Australia.\nBy their calculations Australians aged between 25 and 34 will pay an extra $100,000 in taxes over their lives to pay off today's likely decade-long string of deficits. And that's if the budget gets back to surplus when the Coalition says it will. If not, the bill will be even larger.\nThe government's inflated expectations about the future are creating the justification for doing nothing today. Or, as Daley says of fiscal policy in 2015, \"We are embedding the manana budget\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-07-02T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:08:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
