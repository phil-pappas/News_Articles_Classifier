Photo: Supplied\nA growing number of services are catering to people who are gagging for a drink and don't want to leave home to get it.\nWhen Marc Naggar, co-founder of QuickBottleâ€‹, took an order for 12 bottles of Moet Chandon, he imagined they might be for a wedding that was suddenly running dry.\n\"They just needed 12 bottles and they needed them cold,\" he says.\nAs it turned out, the order wasn't to toast a bride and groom. It was for a funeral.\nAdvertisement \"The family just really wanted to be happy and they wanted to open the 12 bottles at the same time,\" says Naggar, who personally delivered the order.\nHe counts the order among his most memorable moments since he and his brother-in-law launched their alcohol-on-demand service in Sydney's inner west in March 2014. The pair already knew the market from their wine distribution business Wine & Co, and they now service the CBD, eastern suburbs and lower north shore.\nThey are not the only ones seeing an opportunity in providing a rapid-fire alcohol delivery service. Jimmy Brings does 30-minute alcohol (as well as tobacco, condoms, fresh limes and chocolate if needed) delivery in Sydney's CBD, eastern suburbs and inner west, and Liquordrop aims to get orders to customers in Sydney within 30-45 minutes.\nFirefly and The Italian restaurateur and wine-bar operator Daniel Sofo is the latest entrepreneur to launch an alcohol-on-demand service. Sofo says his light-bulb moment for WineRun came when his fiance baulked at going into a bottle shop without him to choose some wines for a dinner party. \"She said, 'It's not female friendly in there and there's too many things to choose from'.\"\nHis service will deliver exclusively to Sydney's lower north shore and feature the pinots and craft beers that appear on his restaurant and wine-bar lists. Like QuickBottle, Sofo has the advantage of already having a warm customer base. When it was time to beta-test the service, Sofo turned to his top 600 customers. One surprise from the early data was take-up by the over-50s. \"I thought our first uptake would be maybe 20s and 30s,\" he says.\nNathan Besser helped launch Jimmy Brings about two years ago and remains a passive shareholder of the company. He says its customers generally fall into the 25-40 age bracket and range from professionals to celebrities.\n\"It's more for people who prefer convenience and are happy to pay for it as opposed to younger people who don't have the budget and are more likely to shop for their liquor at a discount store.\"\nFrom QuickBottle's experience it's not just the \"alcohol emergency\" that prompts people to use the service. People in wheelchairs or parents at home with kids can't always just stroll down to the local bottle shop.\nIt's not surprising that demand tends to peak on weekends. Is it also affected by the weather? \"One hundred per cent,\" says Maggar emphatically. \"About six weeks ago when we had a big storm ... we were running. It was really, really busy. We could easily get three or four orders in the same building.\"\nWeekday demand tends to hit fever pitch during peak-hour traffic so the services rely mostly on scooters to get around. But Maggar says they still turn to a car if they get an order for five cases of beer in the city, for instance.\nApart from meeting their self-imposed tight deadlines, liquor laws and responsible service of alcohol requirements can present challenges.\nBesser says the business took a hit about a year ago when a change to the liquor laws meant he could trade only until 10pm.\nBut he says the biggest challenge in this business is margin. \"Alcohol is a very-low-margin product so no one is ever going to be able to come in and just completely undercut the other person and make money, so it's quite challenging in that respect.\"\nStill, he sees plenty of room for expansion. Thirsty Melburnians will be next on their list, with plans to launch Jimmy Brings there in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T06:48:20.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
