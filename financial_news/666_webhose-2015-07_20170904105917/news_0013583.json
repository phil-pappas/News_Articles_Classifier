The nationwide project is likely to be written into China's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) for development, which is set to be discussed in October, said Lu Kehua, deputy minister of housing and urban-rural development, on Friday. Better urban underground infrastructure will stimulate investment, improve supply of public goods and drive urbanisation, Xinhua news agency reported.
