Our purpose is to provide energy and services to satisfy the changing needs of our customers, and as such we will focus our growth ambitions on our customer-facing activities. \n\"Alongside a major Group-wide efficiency programme, this will underpin long-term shareholder value, as we target operating cash flow growth of 3-5% per year and deliver a progressive dividend policy. \n\"With Centrica delivering solid financial and operational performance in the first half of the year, and making good progress in strengthening its balance sheet and reducing net debt, the Group is well placed to compete materially against the emerging long-term trends in global energy markets.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T20:19:57.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
