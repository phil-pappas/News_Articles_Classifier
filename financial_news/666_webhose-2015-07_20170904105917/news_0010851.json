It could just be that the smelter is wanting to trade and renegotiate its contract and it will probably have 12-18 months to do that.\" \nInvercargill Mayor Tim Shadbolt is confident that the company will remain running. \n\"They're not giving anything away as always… but they are looking very confident. I've been in talks with all the major players and I think it's the transmission costs that could save the smelter $50 million. That is a critical factor in the present day. \n\"The long term future of aluminium is looking really good… it's going to be involved in a lot of uses, [including] medical equipment, dental equipment. It's a great product.\" \nAccording to Mr Shadbolt apprehension levels in Invercargill about its closure this time around aren't high. \n\"The situation is just so different to last time around I think there is quiet confidence.\" \nThe Tiwai aluminium smelter is the country's single largest electricity consumer. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T00:06:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
