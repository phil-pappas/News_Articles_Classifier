That is not how to stabilize the cedi as these are all temporary,' he mentioned. \nGovernment has hinged its hopes on some $20 million promised by the IMF and the EU to stop the free fall of the local currency. \nSince the beginning of this year, the local currency has lost over 30 percent value to the major foreign currencies. In 2014, it suffered a 32 percent cumulatively. \nThe ongoing power outage, also known as Dumsor, is negatively affecting local companies in the country. \nThe development is likely to compel foreigners, who are running businesses in the country to engage in capital flight. \nSome leading economists in the country have criticized government for failing to strength the cedi. \nThe Central Bank has since started pumping more dollars into the system to help halt the free fall of the cedi, but the effect of this activity is yet to be felt by all in the country. \nBy Samuel Boadi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T16:41:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
