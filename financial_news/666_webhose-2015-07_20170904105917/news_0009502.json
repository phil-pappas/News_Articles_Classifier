Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle The Australian Labor Party has emerged from its 2015 national conference having finally resolved workable positions on two issues that have befuddled, constrained and tripped it for more than a decade.\nAsylum seeker policy and climate change are two of the most difficult political issues – and ones requiring complex policy solutions – for governments around the world.\nUnhappy history For the ALP, they have a particularly unhappy history.\nOn asylum seekers, Labor has been left floundering in the wake of a conservative hard line against which it instinctively reacted in 2001, and rejected on the base of advice in government.\nAction on climate change proved a powerful boost to its sweep into office in 2007, yet its incapacity to land a policy, and hold its ground, in the face of a relentless Coalition attack proved disastrous.\nThis is why the capacity of this weekend's national conference to go badly wrong for Labor and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten was so great.\nIt was not just the real risk that votes would not go the right way for Shorten, but that allowing a genuine passionate debate that has not been too stage managed is always risky.\n On the asylum seeker issue, the passion meant it was vital that everyone felt that they had been properly heard.\nThere was even at one point the risk that – facing defeat – the Left may not move an amendment to explicitly stop the party supporting turnbacks, leaving the issue silent and open to Coalition interpretation.\nGreat authenticity That the debate was a public and very genuine tussle conducted in an environment not assumed to have been pre-determined by factional discipline gave it a great authenticity.\nShorten described it on Sunday as real 'tipping point' for Labor not just in policy but in the way it had been conducted.\nCompelling leading speeches by a new generation of Labor MPs – Andrew Giles and Richard Marles – helped reframe the debate in terms of the realities of policy and politics in 2015, rather than being framed by the party's sorry history on this issue over more than a decade.\nBoat turnbacks are without doubt an emblematic issue in the asylum seeker debate, but by focusing on this point alone, Labor has given itself room to manoeuvre to present a more compassionate set of policies to appease its Left, even though the notable silence in the policy about what will actually happen to refugees stuck on Manus Island is at least as disturbing an issue as turnbacks.\nCoalition demonisation of asylum seekers In pragmatic political terms, the suite of policy prescriptions on boosting the refugee intake and treatment of asylum seekers helps buffer Labor against the threat of the Greens on its Left and will appeal to many voters in the centre who are uncomfortable about the demonisation of asylum seekers by the Coalition.\nThe Coalition has already begun an attack on the authenticity of Labor's commitment to turnbacks.\nBut the policy position adopted at conference means the Opposition can move on now in a much less defensive political position on this issue than it has been able to do for years.\nThe Greens clearly emerged as Labor's political focus in the climate change debate at the ALP conference on Saturday.\nThis debate, and the subsequently confirmed platform, cement renewable energy at the centre of the ALP's policy, rather than an emissions trading scheme.\n'Goal', not target Be clear that the proposal to reach 50 per cent renewable energy is a 'goal', not a target.\nThere is no suite of government subsidies attached to this proposal at this point. There is a presumption that much of the task of getting to the goal will now just come about as a result of changing technology, consumer preference, falling prices and industry certainty about policy.\nThe pieces of the climate change policy puzzle that are still to be sorted by the parliamentary party are the ambition of the new emissions trading scheme; the emissions reduction goal Labor will set before the next election (the push by conference was to adopt at the least the Climate Change Authority's 30 per cent by 2025) and; how to meet the call for an agency to assist workers at old power stations who lose their jobs.\nRenewable energy is a clear winner among voters, no matter the muddier politics of carbon prices.\nThe Coalition will still attack on carbon prices but the new platform once again gives Labor a chance to also go on the attack rather than simply defend.\nAll this bodes well for Bill Shorten.\nWith the two political leaders – and their ambivalent relationships with the electorate – being the great weakness for both parties, Labor recognises, and is braced for, the dirtiest and most personal campaign in years which will be focused intensely on the Opposition leader.\nIt has begun with the Royal Commission on trade unions and in Liberal advertising material that has emerged over the past week focusing on his union links and playing up his role in the demise of two Labor prime ministers.\nPreferred vote Yet Labor remains ahead in the two party preferred vote and if it can lock in its credentials on the Left – or even if the Greens vote is sustained – it can focus its attention on trying to win back disaffected voters who switched to the Coalition and Tony Abbott in 2013.\nThe truly stunning political failure at the Conference has been that of the party's Left. For decades, the Left has complained and argued that if only it had a decent hold on the numbers at conference, it would have a chance to truly influence policy.\nYet having finally got to a point of holding half the numbers at conference, the Left's leadership indulged itself and ended up looking both impossibly split and ridiculous.\nYes, there were policy accommodations for the Left, but the incapacity of the parliamentary and union left to have a united set of objectives hampered it.\nDeputy parliamentary leader Tanya Plibersek was left exposed for apparently having one position on asylum seekers in shadow cabinet, another position in the Left Caucus, and a third on the Conference Floor.\nThis is a problem for Plibersek's own ambitions, as well as an obvious rift within Labor's leadership that the Coalition will seek to exploit.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/latingle", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559"], "published": "2015-07-26T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:06:15.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
