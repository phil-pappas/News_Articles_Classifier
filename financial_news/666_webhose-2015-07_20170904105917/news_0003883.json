NewsDay did not bother to seek a comment from Gushungo Holdings. \nIt quoted unnamed sources throughout the article, which it planted on the front page. \n\"As management at Alpha Omega Dairy, we were shocked and surprised by the article which is false, malicious, and we believe that the author of the story did not consult. Had they consulted, we would have told them the correct position,\" said Mr Nhari. \nHe added: \"As Alpha Omega Dairy (Pvt) Ltd or Gushungo Holdings we don't have any business interests or negotiations with anyone related to the alleged false story.

It would be better for the media, both print and electronic, to find out from the authors of the story what their intention is of publishing what is not true and which damages the reputation of the organisation and misleads the public,\" he said. \nNewsDay has developed a knack for false reports on the First Family. \nIn March, the newspaper lied that Cabinet was no longer meeting because President Mugabe was always out of the country. \nIt later retracted the story.
