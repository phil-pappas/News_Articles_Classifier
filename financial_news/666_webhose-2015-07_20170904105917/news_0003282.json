BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) tumbled 5.7 percent to 1,180 pence, and Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) lost 3.6 percent to 2,502.5 pence. \n\"The London market has been hit hardest by the mining sector, which is taking its cues from the financial turbulence in China,\" said analyst David Madden at trading firm IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) . \n\"The wheels are starting to come off in China, and if Beijing is having trouble keeping its stock market in check, it does not inspire confidence in its position as the biggest importer of minerals in the world.\" \nLondon-listed ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) , whose microchip designs are used to help power Apple's iPads, saw its share price dive 6.6 percent to 970 pence on the Apple results, despite an upbeat outlook and dividend hike from the British chipmaker. \n\"The stock market?s reliance on iPhones was laid bare today,\" said CMC Markets UK analyst Jasper Lawler. \n\"A poorly received quarterly earnings update from Apple reverberated across the Atlantic into falling prices across Europe's tech sector and weighed on a broader belief in rising corporate profitability,\" he said. \nOvernight, Apple posted a 38 percent jump in quarterly net profit, but its shares slid as analysts had expected more, while revenue forecasts also weighed on investor sentiment. \nThe US tech giant's profit soared to $10.7 billion on surging iPhone sales in the quarter that ended on June 27, from $7.7 billion a year earlier. \nMicrosoft meanwhile announced a net loss of $3.19 billion in the past quarter, blaming a hefty writedown on the smartphone business it acquired from Nokia. \nElsewhere in the sector, Yahoo revealed it had swung to a loss of $22 million in the second quarter, but revenues grew as the Internet pioneer refocused its efforts on mobile and other growing sectors. \nThat sent Wall Street shares down at the opening bell, where they stayed all morning. \nThe tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index had fallen 0.79 percent to stand at 5,167.22 points in midday trading. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.46 percent to 17,837.62, while the broad-based S&P 500 gave up 0.29 percent to 2,112.96. \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in Apple tumbled 5.2 percent to $123.97, Microsoft's stock dropped 3.3 percent to $45.73, while Yahoo shed 0.81 percent to $39.41. \n- Tech earnings disappoint - \n\"UK and European equities have followed the wider global market lower after both new and old technology results disappointed,\" said Rebecca O'Keeffe, investment head at broker Interactive Investor. \n\"Since Google's performance last week, expectations had been running high that the sector would provide the momentum for further equity market growth. \n\"However, with Apple, Microsoft and Yahoo all failing to meet investor expectations, the outlook has paled amid concerns that prices in the sector have overshot.\" \nAsian markets mostly retreated following the negative lead from Wall Street, where sentiment was also hit by poor earnings news from IBM (NYSE: IBM - news ) and United Technologies. \nElsewhere, the British pound edged higher after the Bank of England (BoE (Shenzhen: 000725.SZ - news ) ) said its nine-member monetary policy committee had voted unanimously earlier this month to hold interest rates. \nThe pound was at $1.5613 in late European trading, compared to $1.557 late on Tuesday. \nBoE governor Mark Carney had indicated last week that Britain's record-low 0.50 percent lending rate could start to rise at the turn of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T20:13:22.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
