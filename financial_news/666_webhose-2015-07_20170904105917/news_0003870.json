Jessica Hromas by Jessica Gardner Patients taking fewer trips to the doctor have contributed to Primary Health Care lowering its earnings guidance for 2014-15 and admitting that it will deliver a 5 per cent fall in underlying net profit.\nThe $2.7 billion company said on Wednesday that extreme weather events in the final quarter of 2014-15, especially in NSW, and a mild cold and flu season had depressed patient volumes.\nIn a statement Primary said that its underlying earnings per share growth has been revised to a 5 per cent fall, from previous guidance of growth of 5 to 12 per cent. The announcement came after the market had closed.\nIncluding the contribution of a one-off net tax refund of about $50 million, Primary's reported earnings per share will rise between 17 and 20 per cent.\nPrimary also clarified how an earlier decision made by the Australian Tax Office will affect the general practitioners working at its medical centres. In June the ATO said that the upfront payment that Primary uses to lure GPs to its centres could be treated as tax deductible by the company . Previously, these payments had been treated by Primary as being capital in nature for taxation purposes.\nHowever, the decision raised questions about potential retrospective and ongoing liabilities for the GPs. On Wednesday Primary said it had agreed to offset tax liabilities on the payments against its tax refund to ensure the doctors are not disadvantaged by the ruling.\nThe settlement will cost Primary about $105 million, leaving it just $50 million from its $155 million tax refund.\nThe agreement covers payments to doctors, which Primary terms \"practice acquisitions\" between 2010-11 and 2014-15.\n Primary managing director Peter Gregg thanked the ATO for helping to resolve the matter, saying the clinicians now have \"peace of mind\".\nThe company said that all future contracts with GPs will be on \"revenue account for tax purposes for both parties\".\nPrimary is also reviewing what effect the settlement may have on franking of its future dividends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:09:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
