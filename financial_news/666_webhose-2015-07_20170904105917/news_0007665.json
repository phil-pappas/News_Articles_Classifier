They were not paying taxes for this fee they were earning for whatever services the flat fee covered,' Justice Torkonoo said. \nShe further stated, 'I was not at all impressed by the glib 'Christian' posturing of Dr. Hale regarding the work NICS was doing at AIS when it came to the records placed before him on the mechanism NICS had designed to move the school's money out of Ghana.' \nForged evidence To justify the transfers, NICS, represented in court by Ace Ankomah, tendered into evidence a Memorandum of Understanding—Exhibit J—purportedly drawn up between NICS and AIS in 2006, but Justice Torkonoo said the MOU was forged. \nThe judge expressed her 'profound dismay' with the Registrar of Companies for the “unbelievably reckless and feckless manner in which so many ventures are set up as non-profit organizations, with no mechanism for monitoring and their income is used for charity instead of as a scheme for persons to earn money without paying tax to a country brought to its knees by poverty.” \n“I believe it is high time Parliament took up its responsibility of setting up a Charities Authority to ensure that income obtained through the activities of alleged non-profit organizations such as churches and other institutions are actually used to partner social development instead of being taken by organizations that effectively dodge the tax net,' Justice Torkonoo declared. \nJustice Torkonoo dismissed all charges and counter-charges involving a former director of the school, Marsden Crosby, who was also a party in the case.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T11:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T15:31:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
