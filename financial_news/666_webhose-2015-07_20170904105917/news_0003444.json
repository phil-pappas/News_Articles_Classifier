The Commerce Department on Friday said sales fell 6.8 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 482,000, down from May sales of 517,000. \"We knew that there would be ups and downs on the road back to a normal housing market,\" said Robert Denk, senior economist with the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). ADVERTISEMENT \"As the economy and job growth strengthens, we expect to see gradual, continued momentum in the coming months,” Denk said. Through June of this year, new home sales rose to 274,000, which is not seasonally adjusted and is a 21.2 percent increase from the first half of 2014, according to an analysis by Selma Hepp, Trulia’s chief economist. “Despite the monthly slowdown, annual increases are very encouraging even though we are starting from a relatively low base — lower than during previous recessions,” Hepp said. Year-over-year sales are also up 18.1 percent. New home sales represent less than 10 percent of the market. Sales of previously owned homes hit their fastest pace in more than eight years in June, increasing 3.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. A stronger labor market and low mortgage rates have fueled the housing market's gradual improvement. Sales of new homes have been lagging behind existing-home sales since the start of the recovery. Regionally, home sales rose by 28 percent in the Northeast, which is still catching up after severe winter weather. The Midwest, South and West posted respective drops of 11.1 percent, 4.1 percent and 17 percent. Inventory of new homes for sale was 215,000 in June, a 5.4-month supply, the highest level of the year and moving closer to the 6 percent mark — considered the sign of a healthy market. \"Despite this month's drop, we continue to hear from our builders that there is solid traffic in sales offices and a lot of consumer interest in new homes, which should bode well for sales moving forward,\" said Tom Woods, chairman of NAHB and a homebuilder from Blue Springs, Mo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T21:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T00:48:51.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
