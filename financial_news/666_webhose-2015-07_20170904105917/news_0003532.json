Eurostar posts record passenger numbers in first quarter despite strikes By Jessica Fino | Sharecast – 4 minutes 33 seconds ago 13.29 -0.11 \n  High-speed rail company Eurostar reported record passenger numbers during the second quarter of the year. Over 2.8m customers travelled on Eurostar during the period, an increase of 3% from same time last year. \nThe record numbers were despite disruption during ferry worker strikes in Calais last month over the sale of the MyFerryLink's ferries to the rival DFDS Seaways. \nSales revenues rose 1.5% to £232m during the second quarter. \nHowever, overall sales revenues for the first half of the year fell 2% due to the impact of the terrorist attacks in Paris during the first quarter and the closure of Eurotunnel (Paris: FR0010533075 - news ) following a lorry fire. \nMeanwhile, Eurostar announced its new fleet of trains is in the final stage of testing. The trains will have more seat capacity and will be launched by the end of the year. \nChief executive Nicolas Petrovic said: \"Over the past three months we have carried more passengers than in any other quarter. With demand for our services at an all-time high we are looking forward to the arrival of our new trains. \n\"The combination of state-of-the-art design, unrivalled comfort and 20% extra seats means that we are well placed to meet the growing demand as passengers increasingly opt for high speed rail over plane.\" A new strike over job cuts in the Channel Tunnel terminal near Calais started this Tuesday with ferry workers blocking access to the tunnel and setting fire to tyres.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:19:01.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
