There's solid production numbers but nothing is shooting the lights out and further writedowns are expected. However, other miners such as Fortescue and Newcrest are rising.\" \nMr Daghlian said investors were keeping a close eye on two data releases on Wednesday - June's consumer price index report and a speech by Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens. \n\"We're unlikely to see any major changes from the RBA's commentary and interest rate cuts are anticipated but whenever the RBA governor talks the market listens closely,\" he said. \nAmong the big miners, at 1034 AEST, Rio Tinto was 33 cents worse off at $53.05, while Fortescue Metals was up 1.75 cents at $1.75. \nAll the big four banks were lower with Westpac falling 33 cents at $34.57, National Australia Bank down 30 cents at $34.47, ANZ shedding 29 cents to $32.76 and the Commonwealth $1.04 worse off at $87.06. \nKEY FACTS \n* AT 1034 AEST, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was down 52.2 points, or 0.91 per cent, at 5,654.0 points. \n* The broader All Ordinaries index was down 48.7 points, or 0.86 per cent, at 5639.8 points. \n* At 1100 AEST the September share price index futures contract was down 51 points at 5,597 points, with 8,338 contracts traded. \n* At 1126 AEST, national turnover was 572,534,931 million securities worth $1.27 billion. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T04:59:33.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
