July 24, 2015 10:00 ET Citizens Community Bancorp, Inc. Reports Fiscal Third Quarter, Nine Month 2015 Earnings, Financial Results \nQuarterly Performance Demonstrates Year-Over-Year Net Income Growth and Strong Asset Quality \nEAU CLAIRE, WI--(Marketwired - Jul 24, 2015) - Citizens Community Bancorp, Inc. ( NASDAQ : CZWI ) (the \"Company\"), parent company of Citizens Community Federal N.A. (the \"Bank\"), a national banking association offering full-service retail banking and commercial lending, today announced unaudited financial results for the fiscal third quarter and nine months ended June 30, 2015. The Company's results reflected year-over-year growth in net income, an increase in non-interest income and strong asset quality. For the three months ended, June 30, 2015, net income was $612,000, or $0.12 per diluted share, up 9.7% compared with net income of $558,000, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2014. For the nine months ended, June 30, 2015, net income was $1.9 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, up 62.7% compared with net income of $1.2 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the nine months ended June 30, 2014. \nEdward H. Schaefer, President and CEO, stated: \"We are pleased with our progress through the first nine months of our fiscal year. Earnings continue to improve as we are able to increase fee income and reduce non-interest expense, while continuing to manage declining net interest income. Additionally, we have simplified our bank's brand and changed our logo to 'CCFBank - Delivering Excellence' to increase our brand awareness. Finally, we are continuing to focus on technology providing progressive, online and mobile banking services that complement our friendly, knowledgeable bankers in our convenient community bank locations.\" \nHighlights The increase in net income during the nine months ended June 30, 2015, over the same period in the prior year, was primarily driven by an increase in non-interest income, a decrease in non-interest expense and a lower provision for loan losses. Net interest income decreased $398,000 or 8.1% for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 compared to the quarter ended, June 30, 2014, primarily due to loan sales of fixed rate longer term consumer real estate loans in the amount of $7.6 million in September 2014 and $8.1 million in October 2014 and the continued pressure on our earning asset yields stemming from the low interest rate environment. Total non-interest income increased $10,000 or 1.1% in the quarter ended June 30, 2015 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2014, primarily due to secondary market and commercial loan origination fees. The Company's provision for loan losses was $150,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2015, as compared to $455,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2014. The allowance for loan losses, as a percent of total outstanding loans, increased at June 30, 2015, to 1.44% from 1.38% at September 30, 2014, due to a decrease in outstanding loan balances and additions to the allowance for loan losses year over year. The Bank continues to maintain a separate restricted reserve account of $1 million, for the outstanding purchased indirect consumer loan balances in the amount of $36.8 million on our June 30, 2015 balance sheet. The allowance for loan losses, as a percent of total outstanding loans, net of these purchased indirect consumer loans, was 1.56% as of June 30, 2015 and 1.49% as of September 30, 2014, respectively. Total non-interest expense was $4.4 million for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared with $4.5 million for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2014, primarily reflecting reduced salaries and related benefit costs, as well as reduced office expenses realized from efficiencies attained over recent years through management initiatives, including through branch closures and technology improvements. The Bank continues to be well capitalized by accepted regulatory standards. The Bank's tier 1 leverage capital ratio to adjusted total assets ratio was 10.4% at June 30, 2015 and 10.0% at September 30, 2014. The Bank's total capital to risk weighted assets ratio was 16.5% at June 30, 2015, compared with 16.1% at September 30, 2014. Total loans decreased $13.2 million, primarily due to a reduction in our indirect and residential mortgage consumer loan portfolios, to $457.2 million as of June 30, 2015, from $470.4 million at September 30, 2014, which decrease was partially offset by an increase in commercial and agricultural loans in the amount of $21.6 million as of June 30, 2015, from their September 30, 2014 balances. Total deposits at June 30, 2015 increased to $456.5 million, compared with $449.8 million at September 30, 2014. Due to the increase in core deposits and a reduction in earnings assets, we were able to reduce maturing wholesale borrowings by $13 million, or 22.1%, from their balances at September 30, 2014. The Company's book value per share at June 30, 2015 increased to $11.32 compared with $11.09 at September 30, 2014, primarily reflecting the Company's growth and operations improvement between the periods. \nAs previously announced, the Bank closed three in-store branch offices in January 2015. As part of our branch consolidation and efficiency strategy, we will be closing a limited service branch office located in Mondovi, Wisconsin and an in-store branch office located in Eau Claire, Wisconsin in September 2015. Both of these branch locations are within a short distance of traditional branch offices located in Altoona and Eau Claire, Wisconsin which will be able to serve our customers banking through these branches, along with our online and mobile banking technologies. \nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2015, we incurred accelerated depreciation expense totaled $317,000 as well as additional fees in the amount of $52,000 related to these branch closures. Excluding these branch closure costs, net income during the nine months ended June 30, 2015 was $2,144,400 or $0.41 per diluted share (non-GAAP) calculated (and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measurement) as follows: Fiscal 2015, Nine Months ended June 30, 2015 Branch closure costs after tax ($369,000*.60) Net income excluding branch closure costs Fiscal 2015, Nine months ended June 30, 2015 Average fully diluted shares of common stock outstanding Earnings per diluted share of common stock \n\"Our focus is on improving our branch delivery channel and enhancing our digital services to improve customer service and meet our customer's needs, while enhancing shareholder value. Strategic decisions have been made in the recent past that have involved branch closures and have put a strain on current earnings. However, these decisions have allowed us to expand in markets which we believe will allow us to diversify our portfolio and increase future profits,\" explained Schaefer. \nIncome Statement and Balance Sheet Overview \nTotal interest and dividend income declined to $5.6 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared to $6.0 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2014, as a result of lower loan volume. Total interest expense increased $49,000 during the quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared with the quarter ended June 30, 2014, due to an increase in interest bearing deposits. \nNet interest income after provision for loan losses was $4.4 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared to $4.5 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2014. \nNon-interest income increased to $931,000 during the quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared with $921,000 during the same period of the prior fiscal year, mainly due to increases in loan fees and service charges from secondary market and commercial loan origination fees. \nTotal non-interest expense decreased $140,000 during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 compared with the quarter ended June 30, 2014, as we continue to trim expenses through operational efficiencies. \nNet interest margin was 3.31% and the Bank's net interest spread was 3.19% for the three months ended June 30, 2015, compared with net interest margin of 3.64% and net interest spread of 3.57% for the three months ended June 30, 2014. \nTotal assets decreased $3.9 million to $565.9 million as of June 30, 2015 from $569.8 million at September 30, 2014. \nTotal loans decreased $13.2 million to $457.2 million as of June 30, 2015, from $470.4 million at September 30, 2014, primarily due to the sale in October 2014 of fixed rate longer term consumer real estate loans in the amount of $8.1 million and a reduction in fixed rate consumer real estate and indirect loans due to payoffs. The decrease in consumer loans was partially offset by an increase in commercial and agricultural loans in the amount of $21.6 million to an aggregate amount of $66.7 million from an aggregate balance of $45.1 million as of September 30, 2014. Mark C. Oldenberg, Executive Vice President and CFO, stated: \"Due to changes in our business model in regards to diversifying our loan portfolio and lessening duration, loan volume has declined, but has had a positive impact on our interest rate risk. We are pleased with our growth in commercial lending and the related customer relationships we are building through products and services designed to build and maintain these customer relationships.\" \nTotal deposits at June 30, 2015 increased to $456.5 million, compared with $449.8 million at September 30, 2014. \"We are pleased with our deposit growth through the first nine months of our fiscal year. We have seen growth in our commercial and municipal deposits, as well as an increase in consumer checking, which has outpaced our deposit runoff due to branch closures. Deposit growth, in part, has enabled us to repay Federal Home Loan Bank advances and reduced our reliance on wholesale borrowings,\" explained Oldenberg. \nThe Company's allowance for loan losses was $6.6 million as of June 30, 2015, compared with $6.5 million at September 30, 2014. Non-accruing loans declined to $855,000 at June 30, 2015, compared with $1.2 million at September 30, 2014. \nNon-performing loan balances as of June 30, 2015 slightly increased $75,000 or 4.7% during the nine months ended June 30, 2015 from their balances at September 30, 2014, while foreclosed assets decreased $131,000 or 12.5% from their balances at September 30, 2014. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets remained steady at 0.46% as of both June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014. \nLoans 30 days or more past due were $3.3 million as of June 30, 2015, compared with $2.8 million as of September 30, 2014. As of June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, loans 90 days or more past due were $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Net loans charged-off during the nine months ended June 30, 2015 were $479,000 compared to $1.4 million during the same period in the previous year. Schaefer explained, \"Although past due loan balances have slightly increased as of June 30, 2015 compared to September 30, 2014, we believe our non-performing loans, charged-off loans and foreclosed assets are well below peer levels. Due to disciplined loan underwriting and strong asset quality, we believe our delinquency and nonperforming asset balances have stabilized with occasional seasonal fluctuations.\" \nAt June 30, 2015, the Bank's total capital to risk weighted assets was 16.5%, tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets was 15.3% and the tier 1 leverage capital ratio to adjusted total assets was 10.4%. All ratios exceeded regulatory standards as of the quarter ended June 30, 2015 for a well-capitalized institution. The Company's book value per share was $11.32 per common share as of June 30, 2015, compared to $11.09 per common share as of September 30, 2014. \nSchaefer concluded: \"We look forward to our new Mankato, Minnesota branch opening in October 2015. We are committed to delivering excellence in the products and services we offer and to gain market share in the communities we serve. We may have a new look, but we are still the same strong, stable, independent community bank. Community banking starts first with the community and we look forward to opportunities that allow us to increase shareholder value.\" \nAbout the Company \nCitizens Community Federal N.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of Citizens Community Bancorp, Inc., is a full-service national bank based in Altoona, Wisconsin, serving more than 50,000 customers in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan through 20 branch locations, including 11 locations in Walmart Supercenters.
