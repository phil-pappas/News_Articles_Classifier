It has said it wants to eliminate the difference entirely, to make the economy more efficient by putting private firms on an equal footing with state institutions.\nSeif said on Wednesday that the central bank would need five to six months after the nuclear deal was implemented to unify the exchange rate. \"Preparations have already started,\" he said.\nThe nuclear agreement will be implemented once the International Atomic Energy Agency has verified that Iran is keeping to its side of the bargain.\nThat may happen around the end of this year, giving Iran access to over $100 billion of assets frozen abroad by the sanctions, according to U.S. officials.\n\"Implementation of a single forex rate is easier for the government when it has enough foreign exchange reserves, so that a market shockwave will not stop the policy,\" government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said on Wednesday.
