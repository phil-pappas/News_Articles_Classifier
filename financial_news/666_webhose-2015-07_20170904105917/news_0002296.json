Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow Queensland has no chance of reclaiming the AAA credit rating in the near future, a review by the state's Treasury has found. It also said the drastic cuts needed were not realistic.\nThe Treasury review, overseen by new Under Treasurer and former Commonwealth bureaucrat Jim Murphy, paints a dire forecast of the former boom state's finances saying Queensland faced \"ongoing revenue challenges\".\n\"Under current economic circumstances, it is neither necessary nor wise in terms of the magnitude of the policy adjustments required, to pursue a return to AAA in the near term,\" the review said.\n\"It is, however, important for Queensland to have a strong and stable credit rating to ensure orderly access to capital markets at a reasonable price. The fact remains the state has the ability to give effect to a substantial reduction in debt should the circumstances require it.\"\nRatings agencies Moody's and Standard & Poor's have maintained their AA+ credit rating for Queensland, although Moody's kept the state on negative watch. Both agencies highlighted the state's persistently high debt, due to reach $78 billion by 2018-19.\nA dramatic plunge in commodity prices and slower population growth put a handbrake on revenue flowing into state coffers.\n\"The Queensland economy now faces considerable challenges in the form of a weaker outlook for Queensland's trading partners, a fall in the terms of trade and lower levels of business investment. This in turn is driving slower growth in incomes and spending,\" the report said.\n\"The issue for policy makers is how to facilitate growth in workforce participation and productivity to mitigate the impact of these factors on living standards at a time when governments are fiscally constrained.\"\n Job challenge Queensland's population growth which had traditionally soared above the national average, as interstate migrants headed north, was now expected to remain on track with the national average of 1.75 per cent.\nWith an average annual unemployment rate of 6 per cent forecast until the end of the decade, there were no longer the jobs in Queensland to attract those in Sydney and Melbourne.\nThe review – which was released after Tuesday's budget was handed down – noted Queensland had the highest gross debt in the country but had the lowest net debt of the states because of its string of government assets and fully-funded superannuation.\nIt argued about overhauling the state's finances, including lifting the gearing ratios of the government-owned corporations to to pay $4 billion off general-government debt.\nBut the report highlighted the precarious debt of the 10 government-owned corporations, who ran assets worth $306 billion with debts of almost $20 billion. It also backed the Labor government's proposed plan to merge the state's energy companies to boost efficiencies.\nTreasury also flagged changes to paying long-service leave at the time it was needed, rather than a central pool, but there was no mention of the controversial plan about QIC investing in state-owned corporations.\nTreasury said it needed to work closely with Queensland Treasury Corporation to better manage the state's balance sheet.\n\"The state has a vast balance sheet which needs to be managed actively to meet government debt objectives and future infrastructure needs,\" the review said.\n\"Some agencies are struggling under the weight of their infrastructure footprints and do not have sufficient funding to maintain their existing assets properly.\"\nOpposition Leader Lawrence Springborg said Tuesday's budget was just accounting tricks moving around debt but which would still have to be paid by future Queenslanders.\n\"These accounting magic tricks fooled no one as ratings agencies warned Labor is putting Queensland back on a trajectory headed for blow-outs in government expenses and more debt,\" Mr Springborg said in his budget-in-reply speech on Thursday.\n\"Labor's sleight of hand budget has left our state defenceless against imminent shocks and it will be future generations of Queenslanders left to pay for this gross fiscal irresponsibility.\"\nThe LNP said it would lift infrastructure spending and cut payroll tax if back in government.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-07-16T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:56:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
