It was the fifth straight month below 50, the level which separates contraction from expansion. \nEuro zone business activity also started the second half on a less secure footing than expected, hit by Greece's near-bankruptcy woes. Markit (NasdaqGS: MRKT - news ) 's flash PMI fell to 53.7 this month from June's four-year high of 54.2. A Reuters poll had predicted a more modest dip to 54.0. \nWhile economies looked weaker in Europe and Asia, better-than-expected U.S. jobless claims kept the Federal Reserve on track for a rate hike in coming months. \nThe U.S. dollar was 0.3 percent higher against a basket of currencies. \n\"What a conundrum we face: commodities are shouting that the global economy is deteriorating, key emerging markets are already seeing major volatility, and yet the world's most important central bank is close to tightening monetary policy,\" Michael Every, head of financial market research for Asia at Rabobank. \nIn a busy day for corporate updates on Friday, BASF , the world's largest chemicals firm by sales, slightly missed expectations with a 2 percent rise in operating profit, with profits of French food group Danone (Paris: FR0000120644 - news ) also falling short of expectations. \nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 hit a one-week low early in the day , but quickly rebounded to trade 0.2 percent higher at 1582.67. Euro zone bond yields fell. \n\"We should keep in mind that the ECB (European Central Bank)has quite optimistic growth assumptions underlying their QE scheme,\" Commerzbank (Xetra: CBK100 - news ) strategist Michael Leister said. \n\"So if we get a comprehensive set of disappointing data it will increase the expectation that the ECB will have to keep QE longer or increase the monthly size.\" \nThe Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for China trades, hit a six-year trough of $0.7295. Slowing Chinese growth means less demand for commodities such as iron ore, one of Australia's chief exports. The recent decline in a wide range of commodities, including oil, has weighed on currencies like the Canadian and Australian dollars. \nLondon and Shanghai nickel contracts both fell 1.2-1.4 percent. \nChina looks set to further reduce interest rates and the amount of cash its banks must hold as reserves to try to keep its economy growing at 7 percent this year, which would be the slowest pace in a quarter of a century, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday. \nThe euro dipped to $1.0952 after the European data, still well above last week's 3-month low of $1.0808. \nGold slid more than 1 percent to its lowest since early 2010 on Friday, on course for its biggest weekly loss in nine months. \nCrude oil futures rebounded from multi-month lows , with U.S. crude up 25 cents at $48.70 a barrel. Oil prices in the United States have slumped more than 20 percent in the past six weeks. Brent September crude was up 7 cents at $55.34 a barrel.
