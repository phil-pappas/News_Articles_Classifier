The exact formula considers the corporation’s profit, its domestic research and development expenditures, and other costs. A summary explanation of the discussion draft is available here . If you really want the technical details, read the “Technical Explanation,” available here .\nGetting into the nuts and bolts, the innovation box would work as follows. A company would calculate its “innovation box profit,” which would be subject to a 71% deduction. Innovation box profit would be equal to its “tentative innovation profit” multiplied against a ratio consisting of its 5-year total U.S. R&D costs as numerator over 5-year total costs as denominator. Tentative innovation profit is generally equal to its gross receipts from qualified property less deductions allocable to those receipts. Qualified property includes patents, inventions, formulas, processes, motion picture films, and computer software.\nThe technical explanation provides a detailed calculation and example, which I will simplify here so you can see the broad strokes.\nAssume that U.S.-based corporation has a tentative innovation profit of $1.9 billion, 5-year total U.S. R&D costs of $2.8 billion, and 5-year total costs of $10.9 billion. Further, the company has a net income of $900 million for the current tax year.\nThe innovation box profit would be calculated as: ($2.8bn / $10.9bn) x $1.9 bn. This equals an innovation box profit of approximately $488.1 million. This $488.1 million would be eligible for a 71% deduction; consequently, the tax liability allocable to the innovation box profit would be approximately $49.5 million. Here’s the math on that: (1 – 0.71) x 0.35 x $488.1 million. As you can see, in this example, that’s an effective tax rate on the innovation box profit of roughly 10% (that is, $49.5 million / $488.1 million).\nGet The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["http://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/FINAL-TE-Innovation-Promotion-Act.pdf", "http://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Boustany-Neal-IP-box-section-by-section-FINAL.pdf", "http://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Innovation-Box-2015-Bill-Text.pdf"], "published": "2015-07-31T12:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T11:46:41.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
