The first question was regarding Ferrari, its valuation, and his view of Fiat Chrysler ( FCAU ) on the whole. With Chrysler's Jeep brand doing well, the Ferrari spinoff under way and good currency translation, \"there seems to be a lot of good moving parts,\" he says. \nCramer would like to see a merger between GM ( GM - Get Report ) and Fiat Chrysler to limit the number of players in the field. Despite Fiat Chrysler's good position, Cramer says that \"in the end, they are an auto company and the auto companies are just not doing well.\" Cramer says to \"stay away\" from the automotive stocks despite their positive positioning, because of the worldwide slowdown. \nMoving to telecom stocks , Cramer responds to a tweet asking about Verizon ( VZ - Get Report ) , saying that Verizon is essentially a \"bond equivalent with some upside,\" but that he \"cannot get very bullish about it.\" Cramer isn't crazy about Verizon because \" T Mobile ( TMUS ) has been so aggressive against everyone\" and it is T Mobile that \"has all of the momentum.\"Changing gears, Cramer responded to an inquiry of his opinion of Twitter. \"Stop saying that it is going to be taken over,\" Cramer said. \"The companies that have been taken over are companies that are doing really well, not ones that are slowing.\" Cramer added that they have trimmed their position in Twitter in the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio but thinks that there will be something big for Twitter investors in October. When asked about ETF's, Cramer thinks that HACK ( HACK ) , the ETF of security companies, has come down enough to be worth buying, also saying that FireEye ( FEYE ) has come down a lot and that Palo Alto Networks ( PANW ) had been recommended as well. When it comes to solar, Cramer likes Sunedison ( SUNE ) . Cramer ends by saying that the Chinese are doing a lot of dumping of steel, he wishes the government were tougher on the Chinese and the yield on News Corp ( NWS ) isn't big enough to attract him to the stock, which is why Cramer says New Corp is so tough to own.Cramer also took a second to congratulate TheStreet's Rhonda Schaffler on her coverage on the Aspen Ideas Festival and tells his readers to read and watch what Schaffler has been doing. \"Aspen is very exciting,\" Cramer said, \"and people have to understand: When you are looking at the new economy, you're not going to get it in New York, you have to go elsewhere.\" If you have a stock question, tweet it @jimcramer using #CramerQ.
