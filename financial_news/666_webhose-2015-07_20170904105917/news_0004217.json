The entire high-yield sector suffered in the fourth quarter of 2014 as lower oil prices dragged down the value of energy-related paper, and Toburen remains watchful of that particular sector. \n\"Certainly, the lower-quality, triple C-rated and distressed paper, some of that is in energy and some in metals and mining; that's an area where we would be very cautious,\" Toburen said. \nMust Read: 10 Stocks Billionaire David Einhorn Loves for 2015 \nOn the flip side, lower gasoline prices have acted like a tax cut for consumers, which is why Toburen likes sectors that rely on Americans opening their wallets. \n\"Consumer balance sheets seem to be in reasonable shape, so anything consumer related, retail or service, we think are good places to invest,\" Toburen said. \nNew issuance so far is on pace with where it was in 2014 at about $190 billion, according to Toburen's calculations. Toburen added that he expects new issuance, a prime determinant of price, to \"remain steady and look a lot like last year.\" \nOf course, the entire fixed-income world is focused on the Federal Reserve and the potential for higher rates ahead. Toburen gives Fed Chief Janet Yellen and her crew credit for being transparent in the process and said he expects the path to higher yields will be gradual. \n\"If interest rates are going up for the right reasons like the economy is doing well and employment is strong, that tends to be a very good time for high-yield bonds,\" Toburen said.
