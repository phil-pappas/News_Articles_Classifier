From next April, firms will have to pay all workers aged over 25 at least £7.20 an hour – compared with £6.50 now – and this will rise to £9 by 2020. \nIkea is one of the first retailers to commit to raising the minimum hourly rate it pays its British staff ahead of government guidelines. \n“Introducing the living wage is not only the right thing to do for our co-workers, but it also makes good business sense. This is a long-term investment in our people based on our values and our belief that a team with good compensation and working conditions is in a position to provide a great experience to our customers,” said Gillian Drakeford, country manager for Ikea UK and Ireland. \nIkea has introduced a number of programmes to reward staff in the past couple of years. \nUnder a programme called “Tack!”– Swedish for thanks – staff who have been in their roles for at least five years receive an annual top-up to their pension if the business hits global sales targets. \nIt has also paid out millions of euros in bonuses to staff after growing its business in Asia and Europe. \nThe living wage makes good business sense, says Ikea boss Gillian Drakeford \nIkea, which has had a presence in the UK since 1987, revealed in April that pre-tax profits had fallen by 10pc to £41.8m in the year to August, due to investments in its staff loyalty programmes and because of a new series of price cuts for customers. \nThe group has 18 stores in the UK, and had planned to open four more this year, although this is now looking unlikely because of planning difficulties. \nIkea plans to boost global sales to €50bn (£35bn) by 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T02:36:20.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
