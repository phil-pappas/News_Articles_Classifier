But Uber says its drivers are being unfairly targeted, and has filed an application in the Federal Court to challenge the ATO's position. The company says its driver should only be required to register for GST if they have a turnover of more than $75,000 a year, in line with other individuals who provide sharing services. \"To be very clear, we believe all our driver partners should pay their appropriate share of tax and meet their tax obligations,\" an Uber spokesman said. \"However, we feel they have been unjustly singled out by the ATO for different tax treatment than truck drivers, bike messengers, Airbnb hosts or any other participant of the sharing economy.\" The company has also called on the federal government to define how ride-sharing fits into the tax system as part of its wider tax review.
