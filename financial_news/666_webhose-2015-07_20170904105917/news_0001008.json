Berg 07/21/15 - 3:25 PM EDT \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) â€” The number of cancer drugs continues to grow at a rapid clip. The Food and Drug Administration has approved 45 new drugs to treat cancer since 2011, more than any other therapeutic area. The specific drugs used to treat individual cancer patients are chosen based on clinical trials on similar patients with the same type of cancer, and stage as well as other factors. But patients don't always have favorable responses, which not only can cost them in terms of their health, but also in the cost of drugs. \nThe IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics recently reported that total global spending on cancer drugs, for both therapy and supportive care, reached the $100 billion threshold in 2014. For the individual patent, chemotherapy can cost thousands of dollars a month -- $10,000 a month for the average brand-name cancer drug, according to the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics -- and because more and more of these medications are taken by mouth at home, rather than administered intravenously at a hospital, insurance coverage is considerably less. Oral chemotherapy is often covered by health insurers like prescription drugs. Many people have co-pays, for example, amounting to 25% of the cost of the drug, which must be paid for at the time of purchase , according to the American Cancer Society.
