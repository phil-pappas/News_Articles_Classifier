Net income for the three month period ended June 30, 2015 was approximately $530,000, versus approximately $421,000 for same period in 2014, an increase of $109,000 or 25.9%.

The Company completed a public offering of 1,015,000 common shares on May 29, 2015, and the underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option for an additional 105,000 common shares in June 2015. The gross proceeds from the offering, including the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, were approximately $4.9 million and the net proceeds were approximately $4.3 million, after deducting our underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. Assaf Ran, Chairman of the Board and CEO stated, “During the second quarter, we managed to continue growing the Company responsibly and constantly. The successful public offering that was completed at the end of the quarter resulted in an increase in the number of outstanding shares while the Company had only begun to realize the significant benefit from the deployment of the proceeds of the offering during the third quarter. This factor resulted in the decrease in EPS even though net income was significantly higher than the correspond quarter of 2014,\" added Mr. Ran. \nAbout Manhattan Bridge Capital, Inc.
