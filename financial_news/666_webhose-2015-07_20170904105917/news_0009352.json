We think it is going to grow at something like 20%. They've got over a trillion dollars that they can invest for their clients. It's a great company.\" \nThe Villere Balanced fund, which sports a trailing twelve-month yield of 1.1%, is up 2% year-to-date. Shares of Financial Engines ( FNGN - Get Report ) are up 21% so far in 2015. The company releases its second-quarter earnings results Aug. 5th. \nYoung is also bullish on car-part distributor LKQ ( LKQ - Get Report ) , which has seen its shares rise 10% so far in 2015. LKQ releases its second-quarter results before the bell on July 30th, and Young said he expects a strong showing despite the bearish case that a drop in metals prices will sink the stock. \"They take refurbished auto parts and supply them to the consumer,\" Young said. \"When the consumer gets into a car wreck they use refurbished auto parts. They may not necessarily know that, but that's why the company is called LKQ - Like Kind and Quality. It's a fantastic company and a good play on the environment.\" Shares of the Howard Hughes Corporation ( HHC - Get Report ) have increased 3.2% thus far in 2015. Young is positive on the real estate and planned community company because it has around 20% debt which is much lower than other property players, plus it has prime locations in New York, Houston and Nevada. Finally, Young is a fan of Flowers Foods ( FLO - Get Report ) , which has seen its stock rise 11% year-to-date, saying the company offers consistency. \"People are always going to buy bread , and this is why it can offer a 2.5% dividend,\" said Young.
