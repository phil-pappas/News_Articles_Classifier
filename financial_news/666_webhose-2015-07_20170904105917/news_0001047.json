Tim Davie, the chief executive of BBC Worldwide, said licence fee payers would be best served by continued ownership of the 50pc stake in UKTV, which also runs Gold and Watch, as part of a 10-strong portfolio of digital channels. Scripps, the US media company that owns the other 50pc, has made repeated approaches to buy out BBC Worldwide over the last year. Mr Davie said that he intended to hold onto the asset, against the backdrop of strong growth at UKTV and an improving advertising market. He said: “I understand there are people who think we should sell but my responsibility is long term returns for the licence fee payer. “Will there be a steep decline in the advertising market in the next year or two? I don’t think so. “Via the joint venture we benefit at each stage of the monetisation of BBC content.” Tim Davie runs BBC Worldwide, selling rights to BBC shows around the world BBC Worldwide sells BBC programmes to UKTV for repeat on its channels, and enjoys an annual dividend from the profits of its advertising and pay-TV sales. Last year the commercial broadcaster’s operating profit rose 9.1pc to a record £72.2m, on the back of increasing audience share . Mr Davie’s stance will frustrate Scripps, which is understood to fear UKTV could fail tor reach its growth potential because its link to the BBC make expansion and investments more difficult. A sale of UKTV is also seen by some BBC and commercial television executives as a rational way to plug any short-term BBC funding gaps created by the new licence fee settlement. The BBC has agreed to fund free licences for over-75s from 2020, at an estimated annual cost of £750m. “It is hard for them to justify £500m sitting on the balance sheet when they are complaining about having their funding cut,” said one senior industry source. Multiple sources claim the divestment would be less complicated than privatising BBC Worldwide itself, another fundraising move that Lord Hall, the director-general of the BBC, sought to resist on Tuesday. He said: “Any proposal to remove it [BBC Worldwide] from the BBC simply doesn’t make economic sense.” Mr Davie resisted the idea of selling UKTV as BBC Worldwide reported a record annual return to the BBC of £226.5m. However, the payment was boosted by the sale of a 49pc stake in BBC America to AMC. Headline profits dropped by 13.5pc to £138.6m as a result of sharing US profits, however. Mr Davie said BBC Worldwide was well positioned to take advantage of the global shift to internet television and increased demand for programming.
