Reffind says the way many businesses communicate with workers - via email, voicemail, presentations, video feeds and training sessions - is outdated and often ineffective. The company says its app makes communication easier, delivering content to staff in short form on mobile platforms, in a fun and \"gamified\" manner. The app is designed to be used by medium and large companies, and allows messages from management to be delivered to smartphones at any time of the day. \"We've only scratched the surface in terms of potential customers with excellent feedback to date,\" Reffind managing director Jamie Pride said. Reffind products have already been taken up by Coles, AMP, Coca-Cola, Lion, Fuji Xerox and Pacific Brands. Funds raised from the share offer will be used by Reffind for expansion into the US, and the development of its sales, marketing and systems.
