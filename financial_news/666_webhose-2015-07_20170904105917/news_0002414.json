Chris Pearce Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan The Labor party has dismissed a bid to expel former cabinet minister Martin Ferguson from the party for alleged disloyalty.\nIn a decision delivered on Monday, the party's Victorian disputes tribunal threw out the complaint by union official Kevin Bracken against Mr Ferguson, saying there must be room for debate and different views within the ALP.\nUnion officials had pushed to expel Mr Ferguson after the NSW Liberal Party used footage during the state election campaign of him criticising state Labor leader Luke Foley's approach to power privatisation.\nIn its decision, the tribunal noted other prominent NSW ALP figures had made comments about privatisation but had not been charged.\nOn Monday a Victorian ALP spokesperson confirmed the complaint had been dismissed. Mr Ferguson, who denied breaching any party rules, declined to comment.\nHe said earlier this year Canberra had supported attempts by former premiers Morris Iemma in NSW and Anna Bligh in Queensland to privatise electricity.\nHe said his views on electricity privatisation had long been known.\n\"So freedom of speech is not allowed now?\" he said.\n Keith Orchison, a long-time energy industry consultant, had backed Mr Ferguson's defence that he did not willingly aid the Liberal Party during the NSW campaign.\nMr Orchison gave the Liberals the footage of Mr Ferguson criticising Mr Foley's approach and did so without asking him.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-07-13T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T21:09:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
