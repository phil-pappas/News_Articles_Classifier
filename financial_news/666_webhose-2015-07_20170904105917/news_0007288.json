This exercise isn’t primarily about getting the public to save more. The principal objective here is to save money for the Exchequer. \nPensions tax relief is hugely expensive. The exact cost is unknown, because although the figures for tax relief on pension contributions are published (around £30bn per year), there are further tens of billions in tax forgone through capital gains tax exemptions, the perk of being able to take 25pc of a pension tax-free, reduced employers’ NI contributions and so on. \nA cost of £50bn is the latest official figure, but some experts, such as Paul Johnson of think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies, thinks it could be higher. \nWhatever the number, the Chancellor wants to cut it. \nMr Osborne’s attacks on pensions to date, such as lowering the lifetime pensions savings allowance and cutting the annual contribution limit for top earners, are signposts at the start of a journey. \nThose two measures will save £6bn per year, the Government says. \nBut the savings now in Mr Osborne’s sights the driver of this consultation are likely to be of a different magnitude altogether. \n• Pensions advice: all the options and what you should expect to pay \n• Two thirds of people will not receive new full rate state pension \nSteve Webb, through his knowledge of the workings of George Osborne, outlines one fascinating potential outcome. Mr Webb envisages two things. First (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) , a move to scrap the tax reliefs on contributions and instead apply them to pension withdrawals. This would make pensions more like Isas: you save out of taxed income, but when you take the money, later, you pay no tax. \nSecond, Mr Webb foresees something truly revolutionary: people with large, existing funds could be encouraged to surrender a chunk of their savings now in return for a promise that in future there would be no tax to pay. \nAs Mr Webb points out, this would be highly attractive to Mr Osborne because of the effects it would have on Government revenues in the near term. \nBut for savers? \nIf, as I’ve argued above, the overall purpose of this project is to lessen the hit to the Exchequer of pension tax relief, savers of all ages need to plan, act and be on guard. \nOlder savers in a position to invest today into a pension either to contribute more into a work scheme, or to make separate savings into a self-invested pension should consider doing so immediately. The tax perks as they stand, even though they’ve been chipped away at, are generous and won’t last. \nYounger savers in their 20s or 30s face a more complex dilemma. They need to ensure that as the tax reliefs fall away, they do not bear an unfair share of the cuts. \nPension investing, for everybody, is set to become less rewarding. \n= For more information on the pensions freedoms, download your free copy of the Telegraph Guide to Making Sense of the New Pensions Changes or for professional pensions advice call The Telegraph Investment & Pensions service for free on 0800 345 7531 =", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T18:42:04.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
