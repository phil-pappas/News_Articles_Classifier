Large state-owned banks are suspected of having stepped into the market to sell dollars on behalf of the monetary authorities to ensure the yuan’s weakness does not trigger even larger outflows in the past few months, traders said.\n“A steady yuan may be the best solution to stop capital outflows from turning into flight for now,” said a trader at a large stated-owned bank in Shanghai.\nFirst Published on July 1, 2015 10:08 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T09:10:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
