Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $14.08 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nThe company also cut its 2015 capital expenditure forecast to $7.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. It had cut full-year capex to $8.7 billion from $10 billion in April. \nRevenue from Intel's data centre business, its second-largest, grew 9.7 percent to $3.85 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier, helped by the continued adoption of cloud services and demand for data analytics. \nThe world's biggest chipmaker has been expanding its line-up of higher-margin chips used in data centres to make up for slowing demand from the PC industry. \nThe company agreed to buy Altera Corp (ALTR.O) for $16.7 billion in April as part of these efforts. \nMicrosoft Corp's (MSFT.O) decision to withdraw support for the Windows XP operating platform last year proved a welcome windfall for Intel, boosting demand from businesses forced to upgrade their employees' PCs and laptops. \nBut with the cycle of upgrades ending and the dollar's continued strength leading to price increases overseas due to the devaluation of local currencies, PC demand has slumped again and is expected to stay weak for the foreseeable future. \nIntel said revenue from the business, its largest fell 13.5 percent to $7.54 billion in the second quarter ended June 27. \nThe company's net income fell to $2.71 billion from $2.80 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share, however, were flat at 55 cents, due to a fall in the number of weighted average shares outstanding. ( http://bit.ly/1Hvmgay ) \nNet revenue fell to $13.19 billion from $13.83 billion, the company said. \nAnalysts on average had expected a profit of 50 cents per share and revenue of $13.04 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \n(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in Bengaluru; Editing by Simon Jennings)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T01:03:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
