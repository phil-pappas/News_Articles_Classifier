Reuters by John Kerin Australia, India, Japan and the US are all stepping up wargames in the Indo-Pacific in response to China's sabre rattling over disputed islands in the South and East China Sea.\nAustralia will despatch warships and aircraft to the Bay of Bengal in October to take part in inaugural wargames with India.\nThe moves come with Japan joining Australia's massive bilateral exercise with the US – Talisman Sabre – which is now under way in Australia's north and involves up to 30,000 US and Australian troops.\nJapan has also been invited to the India's premier wargame with the US – Exercise Malabar, which will also be staged later this year – China bitterly protested when New Delhi extended an invitation to Australia and Japan to take part in the same exercise in 2007.\nAustralia also dispatched 70 troops and an AP-3C Orion surveillance aircraft to Exercise Balikatan staged by the US and the Philippines in April – a drill carried out close to one of the South China Sea territorial dispute flashpoints.\nAustralian Strategic Policy Institute capability analyst Dr Andrew Davies said there were two drivers for what appeared to be an unprecedented level of wargaming in the region.\n\"The US, India, Japan and Australia are all increasing their involvement in military exercises and a lot of that is being driven by concern about China,\" Dr Davies said.\n\"And there are a lot more warships being bought by regional navies and more kit means more strategic competition,\" he said.\n Dr Davies said he didn't believe the wargaming reflected a reconstitution of the \"gang of four\" that involved the US, Australia, Japan and India in formal talks during the the late Howard era.\nAustralia and India pulled out of the process after Beijing complained it was part of a US-led containment policy.\n\"But you can almost see these countries coming together without the formality of an agreement … an agreement would be a poke in the eye to China,\" Dr Davies added.\nThe first joint Australia-India exercise was agreed to as part of a strengthening of defence ties announced by former Defence Minister Stephen Smith in 2013 and his then Indian counterpart AK Antony.\nBut further details have been thrashed out since Prime Minister Tony Abbott struck a security co-operation agreement with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi in November last year where he declared India \"the emerging superpower of Asia\".\nMr Modi in a veiled reference to China's involvement in maritime disputes told the Australian parliament, Australia and India could work together \"to promote a currency of coexistence and co-operation\".\nThe Australia-India wargames will be staged from November 30 to November 4 with India-Japan wargames also to be staged later this year.\nAustralia and Japan are US allies but Mr Modi shares the three countries concerns about China and has enacted a more muscular foreign policy seeking to shore up alliances.\nIndia is also concerned about increasing Chinese activity in the Indian Ocean and Beijing's so called \"string of pearls policy\" that aims to create naval bases from Sri Lanka to the Persian Gulf.\nIn a separate paper titled \"Crowded Waters – Naval Competition in the Asia Pacific\" Macquarie University lecturer in security studies Sheryn Lee warned that \"maritime disputes between China and its neighbours have increased tensions and … have driven the requirement for greater maritime surveillance capabilities … surface combatants with longer endurance, submarines and longer range aircraft\".\nShe says purchases of new submarines and warships are also being driven by concerns about the uncertainty over ongoing rivalry between the United States and China.\n\"In short, these dynamics display some of the important characteristics of an arms race and show the Asia Pacific is becoming more contested and potentially more volatile,\" Ms Lee said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T13:04:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
