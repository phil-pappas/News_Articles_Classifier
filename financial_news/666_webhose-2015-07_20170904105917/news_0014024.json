IMF chief Christine Lagarde has said she will notify her Executive Board \"promptly\" should no payment be forthcoming. \nBefore the non-payment, rating's agency Fitch downgraded the Greek sovereign to 'CC' from 'CCC' citing the country's breakdown in talks and threat of \"a disorderly and more permanent break from the Eurozone's payment system\". \nDefault to the IMF does not however constitute a sovereign default in the eyes of rating agencies. It is also not guaranteed to trigger a series of cross-default clauses on the country's other outstanding debt. Any decision to do so would come at the discretion of its paymasters. \nGreece's current rescue deal also expired at midnight on Tuesday, locking it out of access to €15bn in emergency funds. Creditors rebuffed three separate pleas from Mr Tsipras to extend the programme for at least a month, allowing the nation to go to the polls in a referendum on July 5. \nWith just hours left before both deadlines expired, Athens made an ambitious bid for new a European rescue loan worth €29.1bn to keep the country afloat until 2017. \n• What will happen if Greece defaults on the IMF? • How do you change a currency fast? \nThe funds would come entirely from the eurozone’s permanent rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism, which is guaranteed by the bloc’s 19 member states. European finance ministers convened for a telephone conference on Tuesday and are due to do so again today to mull over the plans. \nThe Leftist government of Syriza is thought to be willing to suspend its plans to hold a Yes/No referendum on its bail-out terms in return for securing some form of debt relief from its paymasters. \n\"From the first moment, we made clear that the decision to hold a referendum is not the end but the continuation of negotiations for better terms for the Greek people,\" said a Greek government statement. \n\"The Greek government will until the end seek a viable agreement within the euro.\" \nDebt alleviation, in the form of modest bond swaps or more ambitious write-offs, have been fiercely resisted by Europe’s governments who are determined their taxpayers take no more losses bailing out Greece. \nGreece's fellow eurozone members have widely rounded on Mr Tsipras for backing a 'No' vote, warning that he must choose between keeping the euro or returning to the drachma. \nGermany’s Angela Merkel told her parliamentarians Berlin would not get back to the negotiating table until after the referendum was held. Her coalition partner and Socialist deputy, Sigmar Gabriel, said Athens had to first “kill” their plebiscite if they wanted to resume negotiations. \nAngela Merkel calls out 'No' to Greece \nSpain’s Mariano Rajoy also seemed to openly call for a change of government in Greece. \nMr Rajoy, who is facing electoral ruin from the insurgent anti-austerity Leftist Podemos party, said a ‘Yes’ would be a welcome development in the country. \n\"If Tsipras loses the referendum, this will be good for Greece. If he wins the referendum, Greece has no alternative other than to leave the euro.\" \nModerate voices in the Syriza government, such as deputy PM Mr Dragasakis are now calling on Mr Tsipras to finally strike an agreement that will stop the bankrupt country from crashing out of the euro. \nHowever, should Greece be granted an ESM loan, it is likely to come with much \"tougher\" demands to cut spending and raise taxes, warned Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the eurogroup of finance ministers. \nApproving the two-year loan is also likely to be a cumbersome and protracted process, even if the Greeks agree to sign up to the terms. The rescue would require ratification and assent from the Bundestag as the German government is the single biggest guarantor of the fund. \nJuly 1 marks the first day the country has not been subject to a formal bail-out programme since its first financial rescue at the height of its debt crisis in 2010. \nGreek pensioners have struggled to get access to their income after enforced bank holiday \nWithout any further aid, Greece is all but bankrupt and will struggle to make payments to its public sector workers and pensioners. \nAll eyes are now likely to turn to the European Central Bank which has threatened to cut off the €88bn in emergency funds it has used to prop up the banking system. Should the ECB decide today to pull the plug, Greek banks will not be able to open after their mandated bank holiday which ends on July 7. \nGreece owes the European Central Bank €27bn and faces an unprecedented default to the central bank on July 20. The government has pleaded for a debt swap to alleviate this burden. But with creditor powers showing no signs of relenting, a failure to repay €3.5bn is likely to result in a disorderly exit from the eurozone and put Greece on the path towards an alternative currency. \nIn a sign of the polarising effects the referendum call has had on Greek society, more than 20,000 people supporting a ‘Yes’ vote took to the streets of Athens last night. \nThis follows around 12,000 protesters who amassed on Monday night backing a ‘No’ vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T03:08:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
