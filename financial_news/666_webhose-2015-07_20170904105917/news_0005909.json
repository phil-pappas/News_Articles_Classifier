If faced with such an expense, many say they'd reduce spending, borrow from friends and family or use a credit card, breaking Money Rule No. 29: \"Use your emergency savings for emergencies.\" I'm Jean Chatzky , and this is Money Rules. \nThe good news? Eighty-two percent of Americans say they are budgeting. The bad? They don't appear to be budgeting in savings as an expense, which would allow them to build an emergency cushion. The beauty of an emergency savings account is that when an unexpected, but necessary, expense comes your way, you can dig into that account, rather than float the bill on a credit card. \nAs for how to get that money in the bank, the best way is slowly but surely. Go over your budget and add a line for emergency savings, even if you can only squeeze in $20 each month. Then when an emergency pops up, don't be afraid to use the money you've set aside. You can replenish it when you're out of the woods.
