China’s request to join hinges on whether the yuan, officially called the renminbi, is deemed “freely usable.”\n“The financial-market reforms in China are advancing, and the renminbi internationalization is continuing,” Rice said. “The recent market volatility is a separate issue from the discussion of the renminbi and the discussion of the SDR.”\nThe IMF, which reviews the composition of the SDR basket every five years, plans an informal board discussion on the issue by the end of this month, followed by formal talks in November, Rice said. The fund rejected China’s bid to include the yuan during the last review in 2010.\nOlivier Blanchard, the IMF’s chief economist, said earlier this month that China’s stock-market drop was “very much a sideshow” that “doesn’t reflect on the fundamentals of China.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T19:43:09.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
