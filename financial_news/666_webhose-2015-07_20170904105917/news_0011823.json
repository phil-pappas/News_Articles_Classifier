Getty Images However, there are still a few potential negatives worrying investors at present that mean it's perhaps surprising that the sharemarket hasn't lost more ground.\nIn no particular order the spot fires include Europe and Greece, China and the effect of those higher interest rates in the US – it's hard to know what to worry about most.\nOn their own, maybe each one of these flare-ups is at best containable.\nBut the real concern is that while all are competing for attention at the same time, they could easily combine to savagely knock investor, business and consumer sentiment around the globe.\n After all, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, once said that we have a crisis every five, seven or 10 years.\nAnd the Greek crisis has been around for five years.\nThe hope is that global investors get bored with all this bickering and focus on the benefits from a gradually improving US economy.\nOne reason why some experts think the Greece issue is \"different this time\" is the rest of Europe is in better shape while the real money was lost in the bailout of 2012.\nStill, on Friday the International Monetary Fund did say Greece needs another €60 billion ($88 billion) over the next three years to survive.\nOne bright spot for global investors is the low level of borrowing costs for peripheral countries when compared to three years ago.\nFor example, the Spanish 10-year bond yield is now 2.2 per cent, when it was 7.51 per cent in July, 2012.\nLikewise the 10 year yield on the Italian government bond is 2.24 per cent, compared to 7.2 per cent in November, 2011, while the Portugal 10-year bond yield is 2.91 per cent, compared to 15.8 per cent at the beginning of 2012.\nAll eyes will be on trading on those bonds on Monday night to see if those borrowing costs can be maintained.\nMeanwhile, a 3 per cent bounce in the Shanghai Composite index was also underwhelming on Monday following the measures undertaken by China to help boost sentiment in their sharemarket.\nIt's true that China's sharemarket is still up about 86 per cent over the past 12 months, despite a 27 per cent fall over the past few weeks.\nBut it's getting harder for authorities to manage expectations now that the capitalists have outnumbered the Communists. At the end of last year there were more than 90 million Chinese people that trade shares, compared with just under 88 million members of the Communist Party, since then another 33 million trading accounts have been opened up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T12:11:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
