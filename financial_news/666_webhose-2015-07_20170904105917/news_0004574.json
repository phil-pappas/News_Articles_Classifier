It is a great day in South Carolina,” Haley said.\n“When the emotions start to fade, the history of actions that took place by everyone in South Carolina is one we can all be proud of,” she added.\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, described it as a good move.\nUS President Barack Obama had last month praised Haley for her bold move.\n“This is a historic day in South Carolina,” Senator Lindsey Graham said.\n“After the horrific tragedy in Charleston, our state could have gone down one of two paths – division or reconciliation. I am thankful we chose the path of reconciliation,” he said.\nFirst Published on July 10, 2015 10:20 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T23:22:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
