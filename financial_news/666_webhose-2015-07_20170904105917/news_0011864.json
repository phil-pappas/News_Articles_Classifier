The tail between the average and lowest accepted prices remained tight at 0.03, while the bid-to-cover ratio edged down slightly to 2.62 from last month's 2.71.\nThe 20-year yield added 4 basis points to 1.255 percent, while the 30-year yield rose 3 basis points to 1.480 percent, with both at their highest levels since June 17.\nU.S. Treasuries prices fell on Wednesday, pushing up yields, after U.S. private employers hired the most workers in six months in June and factory activity picked up.\nUncertainty about the outcome of Greece's debt crisis kept losses in check and made investors reluctant to dump safe-haven assets. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Wednesday urged Greeks to reject an international bailout deal in Sunday's referendum that might decide Greece's future in the euro zone.\nThe 10-year JGB futures price ended down 0.44 point at 146.31 after dropping as low as 146.17, its lowest level since June 11.
