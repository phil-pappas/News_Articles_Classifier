They met a Liberian man called \"Tamba Gibson\" who connected them to a Lebanese man who ran a printing press. As a group the man took the girls to obtained copies of their passports and records from school, still holding that they would be going to school once in Lebanon. But the girls never shared what they thought was good news at the time with their family and friends. If one had the opportunity to study and work aboard, most might share the news with their circle of friends. Both girls who agreed to be interviewed said they didn't tell anyone about their plans to go to Lebanon for fear of being persuaded not to go. \n\"In Liberia people have a saying that Lebanese come to take Liberian girls as prostitutes,\" says Muffttee Panma, 26. She believed in the opportunity that was presented to her. \"I did not want to be convinced.\" Furthermore she spoke to another Liberian girl already in Lebanon who was coerced into telling the newest recruits that the prosperity awaiting them was true. One last warning came from customs at the Liberian airport. \"They told me, 'The Lebanese taking our Liberian sisters to Lebanon and misusing them,'\" said Remar Nypan, 25. They initially sent the girls to speak with customs; still they were allowed to pass into Lebanon. \n\"When we went instead of the supermarket, the restaurant we can work in or serve in, we met house work,\" said Nyenpan. It was then that she demanded to speak to her mother. Her mother commanded Abbas Debs, one of the Lebanese men who helped trafficked the girls into the country to send the girls back. Tomas Dixon, the Liberian working with the traffickers tried to console Remar's mom saying she was just causing trouble by complaining and that she was happy. But it was not so. \n\"I didn't even see $5 from my work, I asked my madam for my money and she said Bashir Lakis is receiving my salary,\" said Nypan. Lakis is currently free in Lebanon. Worse yet Nyenpan, along with many of the other girls were sexually abused, Lakis also threatened and physically abused Nyenpan. \n\"He took a gun from the back and shoved it in my face, and removed my clothes and raped me,\" said Nyenpan. She also describes being locked in a basement for a week. Her account was just over her first two weeks there. There are countless instances of her abuse over the two years and seven months she was in Lebanon. A girl who only wanted to be identified as \"Bernice\" said she found freedom by running into the street and being arrested for not having a passport. Liberian delegates rescued the rest of the girls in March of this year. \nNow that they are back home they still continue to face problems. They say the monthly US$150 allowance from the Ministry of Gender isn't coming regularly. \"Only in March when they came to take statements did they give us US$150, and again on June 8Th,\" said Panma. Until the case is tried August 10th the girls are not allowed to leave the safe house compound. \n\"The department of justice said 'they don't want to contaminate evidence'\" Panma continued. With the scant rations from the Ministry of Gender the girls say it's a struggle to get by. \"Only in the beginning when they came to take statements were we able to eat three times a day,\" she said. \"Our parents can't provide for us because they think the government is.\" Panma subsist off money her sister gives her. \nThe day of the interview Ministry of Gender officials said they brought, flour, rice, plantains, and shortbread among other foods. The traumatized girls all huddled in a room to meet with a human trafficking counselor as the visited concluded. \"The Lebanese always say the Liberia government is in their pocket. We want to show that they are not by justice being served,\" said Nyenpan.
