By Ed Monk | Telegraph – 11 minutes ago 80.35 -0.02 \nThe star manager's exit from Scottish Oriental Smaller Companies Trust has left investors with a decision to make \nInvestors backing renowned Asia fund manager Angus Tulloch in his Scottish Oriental Smaller Companies Trust have been put on alert ahead of his departure from the portfolio. \nFund researchers at Morningstar (NasdaqGS: MORN - news ) said they were reviewing the trust’s “bronze” rating because of Mr Tulloch's exit. It will be deemed “under review” until they have assessed the new management. \nMr Tulloch is leaving the trust following the move to split up First State Stewart, the company that runs the portfolio. \nThe company will divide into FSS Asia, which will continue to run the trust, and Stewart Investors, which Mr Tulloch will head up. \n• Calculator: How your money might grow after a lump sum investment \nJeremy Beckwith, director of manager research for Morningstar, said: “Angus Tulloch has had phenomenal success over a long period. The other members of the team remain but we need to meet the management to understand the future direction.” \nMr Tulloch has provided investors in the £256m trust with benchmark-beating returns over a sustained period. He has returned 87.4pc and 34.7pc over five and three years, respectively, versus 47pc and 31.3pc in the Asia pacific, excluding Japan, sector. \nPerformance has tailed off in the past year, with the trust down 2pc versus a 6.4pc rise among its peers. The slowdown in China has hurt many of the economies in the region in which the trust invests. The trust is 25pc exposed to India. \nThe Scottish Oriental trust has been a good long-term performer.

It carries an ongoing charge of 1.35pc. \nThe departure of Mr Tulloch leaves investors with a decision to make. Those committed to the fund manager at least have the option of investing in one of his other portfolios, albeit in an open-ended fund with slightly different remit. \nJason Hollands, of adviser Tilney Bestinvest, said another of Mr Tulloch’s funds that he will continue to run, First State Asia Pacific Leaders, was the firm’s “longstanding core play”. \n“This fund is invested in large cap stocks and unlike Scottish Oriental can also invest in Australia and New Zealand,” he said. \n“We also like the Schroder Asian Alpha Plus fund, for those willing to accept a more high-octane, unconstrained investment approach focused on large and mid-caps.\" \nFor simple, low-cost exposure to the region, the HSBC Pacific Index C fund tracks a combination of indices and has an ongoing charge of 0.21pc. \n• Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of the best of our investment ideas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T20:40:49.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
