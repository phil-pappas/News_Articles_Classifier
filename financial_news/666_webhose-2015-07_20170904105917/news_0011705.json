If they consider a little longer they will probably remember that they also pay large sums in National Insurance contributions and VAT. \nThey may forget altogether the \"minor\" taxes such as the duties on tobacco and alcohol. Yet these forgotten taxes raise a huge £60.3bn for the Treasury every year, according to figures collated by Smith & Williamson, the accountancy firm. \n• How HMRC's software tracks your finances and your lifestyle \nWhile the biggest earners are income tax (£163.1bn a year), VAT (£111.4bn) and NI contributions (£110.4bn), the amount raised by the minor taxes exceeds the £42.1bn contribution from corporation tax and the £27.2bn raised by fuel duty. \nThe most significant of the minor taxes is stamp duty on property, which raises £10.7bn a year for the Government. Next (Other OTC: NXGPF - news ) comes alcohol duty at £10.5bn, followed by the duty on tobacco on £9.5bn. \n• Countries with the most and least tax on beer and wine \nCapital (Other OTC: CGHC - news ) gains tax accounts for £5.6bn a year and inheritance tax £3.8bn. The full breakdown is shown in the chart above. \nAlternatively, this graphic shows the same information expressed in percentages: \nFOR A LARGER VERSION, CLICK HERE \nBecause the Conservatives have ruled out any increases in the main taxes income tax, NI contributions and VAT the minor taxes may feature heavily in his efforts to raise more revenue and cut the deficit, said Tina Riches, national tax partner at Smith & Williamson. \n“The Chancellor won’t miss this opportunity for hefty revenue-raising in the Budget and the mass affluent will doubtless come off worst,” Ms Riches said. \"The first Budget of a new parliament is often the best time to introduce unpopular measures.” \nShe pointed out that tax relief on pension contributions for higher earners could be among the first to be cut but added: “With the Chancellor’s hands tied to maintaining the rates of income tax, VAT and National Insurance, further revenue can only be raised if he is inventive, potentially widening the tax base or introducing new taxes. \n“His other options are around reducing or adjusting thresholds or reliefs and raising rates of the ‘minor taxes’ such as CGT, stamp duty, the tax on wine, beer and spirits and the bank levy. \n“There are over a dozen ‘minor’ taxes which, taken together, raise more than £60bn a year. So if a further, say, 5pc were raised from these, this could give a boost to tax receipts.” \n• The chart that shows there are 12 rates of income tax", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T22:30:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
