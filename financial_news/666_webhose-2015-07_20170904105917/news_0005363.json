But by the end of the session, Wall Street had given up most of its gains.\n\"There was a bit more optimism this morning and then just a general fall-back as the day went on,\" said Giri Cherukuri, head trader at OakBrook Investments LLC, which oversees $1.3 billion in Lisle, Illinois.\nEuropean shares rallied more than 2 percent as Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras rushed to finalize a package of Greek tax hikes and pension reforms needed to win a new aid lifeline.\nWithout the money it will have to print another currency, probably leading to its exit from the euro.\nHopes of an Greek agreement, which had looked all but doomed a few days ago, as well as more traditional market support from German export data, lifted European shares and southern euro zone government bonds rallied. Still, investors were reluctant to make too big a move given past efforts to reach a Greek deal.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 2.3 percent to close at 1,511.64, while MSCI's all-country world index of global equity performance gained 0.73 percent.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average closed up 33.2 points, or 0.19 percent, to 17,548.62. The S&P 500 gained 4.63 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,051.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 12.64 points, or 0.26 percent, to 4,922.40.\nChinese markets helped boost the global mood as the main stock index rose 6.4 percent, recovering almost as much as it had lost the previous day. The Chinese securities regulator ordered shareholders with stakes of more than 5 percent not to sell for the next six months.\nThe rebound in China sapped this week's gains by the Japanese yen, which tends to rise when markets turn risk-averse, and helped boost uneasy commodity markets.\nCaution stirred by the Federal Reserve's minutes on Wednesday had weakened the dollar.\nThe dollar was up 0.49 percent against the yen at 121.29 . The greenback also rose against the Swiss franc, up 0.3 percent at 0.9484 franc.\nThe euro, meanwhile, was down 0.4 percent against the dollar at $1.1030.\nYields on long-term U.S. Treasuries rose from this week's five-week lows caused by worries about the Greek debt crisis and Chinese equities rout.\nThe benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 28/32 in price to yield 2.3067 percent.\nYields on 10-year German Bunds, the benchmark for euro zone borrowing costs, were up 4 basis points at 0.72 percent\nBrent crude rose more than $2 a barrel at one point as supportive economic data from Germany, firmer stock markets and strong gasoline demand lifted oil prices.\nBrent crude settled $1.56 higher at $58.61 a barrel and front-month U.S. crude futures rose $1.13 to settle at $53.78 a barrel.
