I'm here as a friend who wants Kenya to succeed,\" he said, after being introduced by his sister Auma Obama to a crowd who had secured tickets to attend. \nTo a mixture of applause and laughter, he described being picked up at the airport on his first visit to Kenya in the 1980s by his sister in an old VW Beetle that often broke down. This time, he arrived on Air Force One and travelled in the president's armoured car nicknamed \"the Beast.\" \n\"When it comes to the people of Kenya, particularly the youth, I believe there is no limit to what you can achieve,\" he said, but he told Kenyans building their nation and the economy required personal effort and responsibility. \nCorruption and violence \nOn corruption, an issue often blamed for holding back investment, Obama said money spent on bribes would be better paid to someone \"doing an honest day's work\". \nReferring to ethnic fighting in which 1,200 people died after a disputed 2007 election, he told Kenyans that politics based on ethnicity was \"doomed to tear a country apart\". \nHe also warned Kenya would \"not succeed if it treats women and girls as second-class citizens\". \n\"It was awesome. It was really inspiring especially for us young people,\" Bramwel Rotich, a 24-year-old student, told the Reuters news agency after the speech. \nWhile Obama was greeted by cheering crowds in Kenya, Ethiopians have shown little enthusiasm over his upcoming visit. \nEthiopia's government won 100 percent of parliamentary seats in a recent disputed election. \nRights groups have called on Obama to publicly meet democracy activists on the ground and have a launched a hashtag on Twitter, #EthiopiansMessageToObama, posting pictures of torture and abuses. \nAl Jazeera's Mohammed Adow, reporting from Addis Ababa, said Obama is expected pile pressure on authorities to reform and tackle their dismal human rights record. \n\"Authorities will in turn be eager to deflect attention towards the country's record of growth and poverty reduction as well as increased security cooperation with the United States,\" he said. \nObama planned meetings with the president and prime minister in the capital of Addis Ababa. \nHe will also speak to the continent from the headquarters of the African Union, which plays a role in peace and security on the continent. \nIt will be the first time an American president addresses the AU.
