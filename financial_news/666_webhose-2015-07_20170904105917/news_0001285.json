Mrs. C8j received the new payment and the back payments as well (conveniently paid just at the start of an election campaign (sorry that just slipped out)) for Young C8j, which was nice to see in the bank account. \nBefore you go blow all your new money on “penny whistles and moon pies”, remember this is a taxable benefit . The UCCB is taxable income, but, in the hands of the lower-income earner in the family. For the C8j family (which I think is the Tories target audience, surprisingly) it is not a bad thing, because Mrs. C8j’s income is less than mine, so the UCCB cheque will be a less taxed benefit, but those dual income families where both spouses have high paying jobs, are going to be paying the tax-man (more (depending on their income levels)) for their UCCB cheques. Not Quite As Portrayed \nI claim to be part of the Tory target audience since I also was able to take advantage of the Family Tax Cut as well (this one only works if your spouse makes significantly less than you do). It is kind of weird to think that I am one of their target audience, but bring on the tax breaks!! \nWelcome back the Family Allowance Cheque , we have missed you so (yes this is how baby bonus cheques were handed out and clawed back).
