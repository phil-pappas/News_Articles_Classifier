Sahlan Hayes by Agnes King United States listed CEB has acquired elite C-suite networking group, The CEO Forum, for $13 million.\nIt is a tidy exit for entrepreneurs Chris Cheatley and James O'Toole, who started the company in 1989, and built it up into a $8 million a year support group for Australian-based executives of foreign multinationals.\nThis is a small fry acquisition for CEB, formerly The Corporate Executive Board Company, which has a market capitalisation of $US2.9 billion on the New York stock exchange.\nBut it gives them automatic access to 690 senior decision-makers at some 400 foreign multinational subsidiaries in Australia.\nIt also gives CEB, which is heavily research based, a model to replicate internationally.\nCEO Forum's first client 25 years was Ziggy Switkowski, then chairman and managing director of Kodak Australia.\nIts second client was Richard Warburton, who at the time was Dupont Australia's chief executive and chairman.\nIn 2003 it branched out from its core CEO peer group, into the CFO market. It added to this in 2006 a human resources peer group service.\n The buy-out come comes amid three macro trends which are changing the status quo for C-level executives.\nMany Australian CEO and CFO roles have been thinned out and sent up to Singapore or Hong Kong.\n\"As Asia grows, the relativity of Australia is changing in the mind of global multinationals,\" Mr O'Toole said.\nHe said Australian subsidiaries are frequently used as a cash cow to fund growth in other countries in the region, and are having to fight harder for investment from headquarters.\nCEO Forum has been helping Australian subsidiaries increase their influence with HQ by becoming talent exporters and a test market for new products.\nAt the same time, global organisations are accommodating senior executives in any part of the world in a way they've never been able to in the past, according to CEB Australia and New Zealand managing director, Christy Forest.\n\"People are not forced to relocate as much as they used to,\" Ms Forest said.\nThe by-product of this is a dramatic shift in the characteristics required for leaders to be effective in a new and complex distributed organisational environment.\n\"There's a whole new set of behaviours that are defining success for leaders in that new environment,\" Ms Forest said.\nCEB will use its deep pockets to replicate the CEO Forum model abroad, with a potential Asian entree slated for 2016.\nIt will also extend the format to other executive groups, such as chief information officers, and heads of sales and marketing.\nThese are two long-held aspirations of CEO Forum's founders.\n\"We have a lot of ideas for the organisation that are constrained by access to resources,\" Mr Cheatley said. \"The marriage will provide ability in those areas.\"\nMr Cheatley, 60, and Mr O'Toole, 58, will remain with the company for 12 months to facilitate a smooth transition to its new owners.\nStephen Perse, ex-head of United Airlines in Australia, will step into the managing director role, effective immediately.\nThe CEO Forum brand will be phased out over the next six months, replaced by CEB.\n\"It's a very complimentary acquisition,\" Ms Forest said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T16:32:21.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
