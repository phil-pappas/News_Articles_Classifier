This is what Jim Cramer, Portfolio Manager and Jack Mohr , Director of Research - Action Alerts PLUS , had to say about the company: \nWe have become incrementally negative on GM following the economic/market-related fallout in China, where GM derives a significant portion of its revenues. \nWe are now seeing weakness not only in China but the U.S. and (of course) Latin America as well. We are inclined to sell into any relative strength. \n-Jim Cramer and Jack Mohr ' Weekly Roundup ' originally published 7/17/2015 on ActionAlertsPLUS.com . \nWant more information like this from Jack Cramer and Jack Mohr BEFORE your stock moves?
