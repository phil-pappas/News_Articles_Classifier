The over-55s were told they would be able to take out as much of their money as often as they liked. \nBut a series of disclosures by The Telegraph over the past two months have shown how millions of people have found accessing their retirement funds more difficult than the Government had advertised. \nSome middle-class pensioners are losing as much as £10,000 over their retirements because of high charges, while others are being refused partial withdrawals of their pension pots. \nThe consultation document asks for information about whether there is cause for greater intervention by the Government on such matters. \nAround one in 10 savers faces fees if they withdraw their pensions before a specific retirement date, which will have been agreed when they were sold the policy. \nMany are finding they cannot access their money until age 65 without losing a large portion of the fund. In the worst cases, the cash is locked away until age 75. \nMost of those close to retirement face just a small fee of 1 per cent or 2 per cent. Those further away, perhaps aged 55 with a retirement age of 75, can lose as much as a fifth of the fund to the penalties, experts say. \n• Tax relief on pensions may not be scrapped, George Osborne says \nIndustry figures passed to The Telegraph indicate that a cap could be set at around 2.5 per cent. Insurers believe that just 5 per cent of those with an exit penalty would face fees above this level, and so would be more open to a cap. \nThe Government is understood to have been given this information in private, but is not expected to specify the level of a new cap in until the consultation is complete. \nAlongside exit fees, the consultation paper will also look at making it easier to transfer pensions between different schemes and ensuring that there is \"greater clarity\" surrounding financial advice. \nMalcolm McLean, a senior consultant at pension administrators Barnett Waddingham, said: \"Many of the old 'legacy' pension schemes are trapping people into an arrangement that they simply cannot get out of in an economical way - and in many cases the penalties people face are an absolute rip-off.\" \n• George Osborne must be truly radical if he is to fix Britain’s broken pensions \n\"The inability to transfer out of poor-value pensions has been an issue for a long time. The industry clearly hasn't found it possible to sort itself out and so the Government has been left with little option but to step in.\" \nA Downing Street spokeswoman said: \"Our reforms have already proved extremely popular and are giving people real flexibility over their pensions savings for the first the time. \n\"But it is not on that some people are missing out on that freedom because of expensive fees and other barriers that are blocking them from accessing their own money. \n“Our message is clear: the industry must sort this out or we will take action to guarantee people that freedom.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T06:49:49.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
