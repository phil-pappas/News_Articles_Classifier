Cole Bennetts Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell With skyrocketing bills, dwindling clients and two grim fundraising term sheets from potential backers on the table, Damien Mahoney and Peter Cassidy realised launching a social media start-up with minimal tech experience was probably, in retrospect, a little unwise.\nThe pair had quit their jobs in sport journalism in 2012 to build a business around capturing and showcasing positive social media updates during events as diverse as grand finals to major corporate marketing campaigns.\n\"We learned pretty fast it was a gutsy but foolish decision to build a tech company with no actual tech experience between the two of us,\" Cassidy says.\n\"We reached a point where we had only enough cash for the next few weeks and were arguing about which of two unattractive term sheets we should sign to stay afloat. Looking back, that moment still scares me.\"\nThey had built the first version of Stackla with their own funds and signed up some promising clients including SBS, the NRL and Brisbane Council but all of their early clients were sourced from within their own network.\nServing clients However the pair underestimated the task of serving clients once they had signed on. The early influx meant they needed to pour money into a desperately needed, fully fledged, second version of their software.\nTheir digital agency had originally Quote: d them $8000 for the product but the price grew as the product did and they found themselves staring at a bill of more than $60,000 just as their cash flow was getting painfully low.\n By 2013, the start-up had about 10 clients but was bringing in barely more than $10,000 a month, which just covered staff and rent.\n\"We hadn't run our own business before but we knew we were in trouble,\" Mahoney says. \"We were delaying payments to suppliers, to staff and we realised we'd need to shut down, sign someone big or bring on investors.\"\nStackla's early growth and high profile clients had already attracted the attention of several investors, two of which had offered deals.\nWhile both deals would require Mahoney and Cassidy to relinquish only a minority share of the fledgling company's equity, both terms were requesting significant investor rights that would radically change the dynamic for the core team.\nInvestor demands \"They were very different offers but both would have resulted in us losing control of the business,\" Cassidy says.\n\"But we only had our own capital and it was evaporating fast, so both looked quite appealing.\"\nMahoney describes the first term sheet as \"ridiculous\" and \"illogical\". For a relatively small injection of capital, to the tune of hundreds of thousands rather than millions, the pair had to sign away almost half the equity of their company and pay the investor monthly instalments for the right to continue to fund raise.\nThe second was better but still a humbling offer. For a similar amount, this investor would take a similar level of equity but wanted the right to veto key decisions in the business, even at a management level.\n\"Both investment deals were bad. But we had 10 employees and were getting desperate. We were hitting up anyone who might be interested in Stackla but knew we had only days to face facts,\" Mahoney says.\nJust before the pair's self-imposed decision deadline, an account they had signed the previous year kicked off. They launched a major campaign on behalf of Origin Energy.\nBreakthrough client But the breakthrough wasn't Origin so much as the client, advertising agency Clemenger BBDO.\n\"All of a sudden, we were on the agencies' radars, and calls started flooding in,\" Cassidy said.\nWhile it would take the company months to correct its cashflow drought, the pair had the confidence to decline both investment offers and hold on.\nA few months later, the pair had hired an internal chief technology officer and relocated to the United States. They have gone on to work with McDonalds, RedBull, Toyota and Qantas.\n\"I'm still so relieved we never signed those early deals,\" Mahoney says. \"We would have kept going but we'd essentially have been employees again, not driving our own company.\"\nThe pair added their decision to eschew early capital means they now have more equity and independence going into their series A discussions with US investors.\n\"Australian start-ups have the benefit of growing a company backwards compared to Silicon Valley. We grow the company and then raise money, rather than the other way round.\"\nThis is part of an ongoing series of Startup War Stories.
