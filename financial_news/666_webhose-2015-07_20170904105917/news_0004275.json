Rep. Sandy Levin (Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, introduced the legislation, which is also backed by the top three Democrats in the House: Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.) and Rep. James Clyburn (S.C.). ADVERTISEMENT \"As the Supreme Court recently ruled in favor of marriage equality, my bill would effectuate this equality to all married couples under our country's tax code, providing them with the fairness, dignity, and basic rights we all deserve,\" Levin said in a statement. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) introduced the same legislation on the other side of the Capitol last week, with the support of the entire Democratic caucus. Democrats have also rolled out separate legislation that would take out gender-specific references to marriage elsewhere in the law. Past: 1 day Yellen urges Congress to be wary...
