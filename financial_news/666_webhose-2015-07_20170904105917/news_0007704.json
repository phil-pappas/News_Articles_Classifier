The ICE U.S. Dollar index, a measure of the dollar’s strength against a basket of six rival currencies, remains up about 7.6% since the beginning of the year—little-changed from its level on Monday.\nThe index DXY, +0.26% finished the session down 0.5% to 97.1550.\n“We’re going to end the day basically right where we left home, around $1.0980,” said John Doyle, director of markets at Tempus Inc.\nFalling crude-oil prices were the ultimate driver of most of the day’s activity. Nymex-traded crude-oil futures settled at their lowest level since March 31, which weighed on U.S. stocks. Treasury yields, in turn, moved lower, dragging the dollar down with them, currency strategists said.\nThe dollar strengthened markedly after a report showed U.S. jobless claims fell to their lowest level since 1973 last week, but it spent the rest of the session steadily retracing those gains.\nHowever, the strong jobless claims number will likely help the dollar strengthen in the medium term because it increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve policy makers will vote to raise interest rates at their meeting in September, currency traders said.\nHigher rates would increase the return on dollar deposits, making it more attractive to investors and likely causing it to strengthen further.\nThe euro EURUSD, -0.3004% broke below $1.10 after the data, but recently traded at $1.0990. It traded at $1.0926 late Wednesday in New York.\nThe dollar USDJPY, +0.05% experienced a brief boost against the Japanese currency after the International Monetary Fund said Japan’s debt burden is unsustainable. It briefly broke above 124 yen, but finished the session at ¥123.86, compared with ¥124.02 late Wednesday in New York.\nThe pound traded lower against the dollar Thursday, halting its momentum from earlier in the week, after data showed U.K. retail sales unexpectedly contracted in June.\nThe pound GBPUSD, -0.1547% traded at $1.5517, from $1.5617 late Wednesday in New York.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T11:16:40.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
