Earlier a monthly income plan and categorised as a debt-oriented hybrid scheme, the scheme will now invest to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities in the equity market. Hence, the scheme will now be categorised as an equity scheme. The new avatar of the scheme will now invest 15%-35% in stocks and 30%-70% in equity derivatives for arbitrage opportunities. The balance of the assets will be invested in debt, cash and money market securities. This scheme has another unique feature where the exposure to stocks will be determined by a price-to-equity (PE) based market-timing model. Fund houses have rushed to launch such alternatives to monthly income plans. Tata Mutual Fund on the other hand has converted its existing monthly income plan in to an equity savings fund. This new category of schemes invests in a mix of arbitrage opportunities and net long equity positions. Being equity oriented, the returns are tax-free after a year, unlike MIPs. We have compared MIPs with ESFs here - MIPs Vs Equity Savings Funds . Tata MF has chosen to differentiate its scheme by introducing a market-timing model for the equity exposure; they call it the Tata Red Line Strategy. Here, the equity exposure is decided by comparing the 20-day average trailing PE of CNX Nifty (20DMA) to the long term average PE of the Nifty. The table below gives the exact equity allocation for different levels of PE. As it can be seen, when the market is extremely overvalued, the equity exposure is reduced and vice-versa. Therefore, the (net long) equity allocation will vary from 0-35% depending on the overall market valuation. The long term average and standard deviation is calculated from 1 January 1999 till the date of the observation. The equity exposure will only be rebalanced as above, irrespective of the total weight in the portfolio. The scheme is managed by Akhil Mittal (Debt Portfolio) & Atul Bhole (Equity Portfolio).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T12:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:41:31.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
