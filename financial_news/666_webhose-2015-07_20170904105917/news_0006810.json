You have the crisis in China, the crisis in Greece ... we are in a more uncertain environment if we compare with previous months,\" Calpe said. \n\"Uncertainty can make prices move either way, especially if they come from beyond fundamentals,\" she said. \nWhile sugar and milk prices fell sharply in June, cereals and oils prices firmed and meat prices remained stable. \nMaize crops in Europe and South America are set to be larger than previously expected, thanks to better weather conditions, boosting the overall outlook for coarse grains production. \n\"Favourable worldwide conditions for cereal crops will lead to better-than-expected production this growing season at the global level, despite continuing apprehension over El Ni√±o,\" FAO said in a statement. \"But concerns are growing over a sharp shortfall in maize grown in sub-Saharan Africa as well as poor production in other food insecure hotspot areas,\" it added. \nProspects for rice production in Asia and India have also deteriorated, prompting FAO to cut its production forecast by 1.2 million tonnes to 499 million tonnes, barely 1 percent higher than the 2014 harvest. \n(Reporting by Isla Binnie; Editing by Crispian Balmer)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T12:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T12:40:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
