Photo: Dominic Lorrimer\nThe red-hot housing investor loan market is expanding even faster than thought, with figures showing growth accelerated to 10.7 per cent a year in June after billions of dollars in loans were reclassified as investor mortgages.\nThe Reserve Bank on Friday said its monthly figures on credit growth in the closely-watched housing investor market in recent months was revised up, further exceeding the banking regulator's 10 per cent speed limit.\nThis has occurred after ANZ Banking Group reclassified the figures it provides to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, lifting APRA's measure of ANZ's investor loan book by more than $20 billion.\nANZ financial accounts have not been affected by the reclassification, but the change means industry growth rates are faster than previously thought.\nAdvertisement Previously, the Reserve Bank had reported investor loan growth was 10.4 per cent in recent months until May. However, the latest figures show it has in fact been faster than this.\nThe revised RBA figures show housing investor credit growth has been steadily accelerating since January, increasing from 10.3 per cent to 10.7 per cent in June.\nThe revision comes as APRA is requiring banks slow their lending to landlords to less than 10 per cent by the end of this year amid fears the housing market is overheating, prompting banks to tighten lending to investors and raise interest rates.\nBanks have taken much more aggressive steps in recent weeks , with Commonwealth Bank, ANZ and National Australia Bank raising interest rates for investors and AMP Bank freezing new loan approvals for these borrowers.\nANZ Bank said the changes had occurred following an extensive review of its data classification, to ensure closer alignment between its reporting to regulators and what it reports in its financial accounts.\n\"The changes do not impact ANZ's overall lending and deposit balances, risk weighted assets, regulatory capital or prior financial reporting disclosures including the 1H15 results, and have no impact on customers' facilities,\" the bank said in a statement.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/apra-says-bank-capital-will-not-be-tied-to-international-benchmarks-20150713-giar62"], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:21:39.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
