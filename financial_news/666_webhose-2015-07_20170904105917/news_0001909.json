In the first half of 2015, they were one of the biggest asset gainers — four out of 10 ETF with the largest inflows were currency-hedged products, according to ETF.com . In response to investor demand, ETF sponsors have also been increasing their currency-hedged product offerings by leaps and bounds.\nThis month, BlackRock BlackRock added 11 new products to its currency-hedged iShares lineup bringing it’s total to 16; WisdomTree now offers 16 products as well and Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank has 14. There have also been a bunch of newcomers to the space recently including State Street State Street , PowerShares, ProShares and Direxion. More products are sure to come.\nThe growth in this category is partially due to the fact that ETFs make currency hedging easily accessible to investors for the first time.\n“When we brought currency hedging to the ETF structure, that was the democratization of the strategy. It makes it easy for [everyone to use it] from the smallest retail investors to institutional investors,” Gannatti said.\nIn recent years this category has also benefited significantly from global developments, particularly in Japan and Europe , which have seen increases in their respective stock markets in tandem with steep declines of their currencies against the U.S. dollar.\nPage 1 / 3 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T00:46:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
