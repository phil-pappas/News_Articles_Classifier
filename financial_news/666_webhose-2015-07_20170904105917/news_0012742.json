Hamp said she did not think she had imported an illegal substance, according to the police.\nOxycodone is a prescription drug in both the United States and Japan. Bringing it into Japan requires prior approval from the government and it must be carried by the individual.\nFollowing Hamp's arrest, Toyota said it believed that she had no intent of breaking the law.\nHamp was appointed managing officer as part of a drive to diversify Toyota's male-dominated, mostly Japanese executive line-up.\nShe joined Toyota's North American unit in 2012 and in June relocated to Tokyo, where she was to be based.\n\"We remain firmly committed to putting the right people in the right places, regardless of nationality, gender, age and other factors,\" Toyota said in its statement on Wednesday.
