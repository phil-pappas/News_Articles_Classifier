As per estimates, the EPFO’s incremental deposits for 2014-15 would be around Rs 80,000 crore.\nDuring the current fiscal, the incremental deposits could be around Rs 1 trillion as the body has increased the monthly wage ceiling for coverage under its social security schemes to Rs 15,000 from Rs 6,500 last September.\nEarlier, the EPFO, which has over 6 crore subscribers, has been investing primarily in state and central government securities.\n 12, 2015 5:00 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T08:42:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
