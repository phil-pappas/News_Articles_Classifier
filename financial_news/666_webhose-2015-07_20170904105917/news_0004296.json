Coal exports have also been hurt by the strong U.S. dollar.\nIn the third quarter of 2014, CSX reported earnings per share of 51 cents. The Jacksonville, Florida-based company said a recent train derailment in Maryville, Tennessee, should have around a penny impact on the quarter's earnings.\nThousands of Maryville residents were evacuated earlier this month after a train carrying chemicals derailed and caught fire.\nCSX reported earnings late Tuesday that beat market expectations despite lower coal volumes that pushed revenue down 6 percent. The company benefited in the quarter from a lower fuel bill and improved productivity.\nDuring a conference call Wednesday, CSX executives said the company also benefited from price increases during the quarter of 3.9 percent, or 3.5 percent excluding its declining coal business.
