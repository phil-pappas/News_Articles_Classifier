The paper was not distributed in Brussels, the source added.\nFor Updates Check Economy News ; follow us on Facebook and Twitter\nFirst Published on July 12, 2015 10:15 am", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress", "http://twitter.com/financialxpress"], "published": "2015-07-12T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T23:31:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
