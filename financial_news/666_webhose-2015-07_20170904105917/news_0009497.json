An Arizona Republic report said Welter’s “tenure in 2015 will be short, but meaningful .”\nWho is Welter and what’s her football experience? The 37-year-old played professional football for more than 14 years in women’s leagues, helping the Dallas Diamonds of the Women’s Football Alliance win four titles, according to an ESPN report.\nShe already has at least one other “first” under her belt. She was the first woman to play a non-kicking position in a men’s pro football league when she suited up last year as a running back and special-teams player for the Texas Revolution of the Indoor Football League, ESPN notes.\nThe Revolution then hired her in February to coach linebackers and special teams. She holds master’s and doctoral degrees in psychology and played rugby at Boston College. Her move to the Cardinals comes roughly three months after the NFL hired its first female full-time game official .\nMany Twitter users are enthusiastic about Welter scoring this NFL gig, with some suggesting this was hard to imagine decades ago:\nI teared up at the news of #AZCardinals hiring new coach @JWelter47 .\nDoors r opening that #ICouldOnlyDreamOfAsAKid https://t.co/buDVPCj31d\n— TonjaTriplett (@TonjaTriplett) July 28, 2015 Others see the hiring as an inspiration:\n@jwelter47 great to hear of your appointment at the Cardinals - no doubt inspiring many women and girls across the football world.\n— American Football (@LAAF2015) July 28, 2015 But there are also plenty of skeptics, and here's an example of a PG-rated tweet:\n@AdamSchefter lol, girls can't coach NFL players, this is just dumb.
