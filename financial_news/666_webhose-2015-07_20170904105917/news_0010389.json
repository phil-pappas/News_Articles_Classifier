After five years of constant questions about its strategy and Marc Bolland’s leadership, the recent announcement of a rise in clothing profits for the first time in four years, alongside a first dividend increase in three years, appeared to be firm proof that the debonair Dutchman’s turnaround plan is finally working. Had Britain’s best-loved high street name finally made a comeback? \nIf so, it may prove to be remarkably short-lived. On Tuesday, the chain said clothing sales had slipped back in the first quarter , despite a nearly 40pc rise in transactions on its newly-revamped website. On the other hand, food sales continue to grow, despite a vicious price war among the supermarkets. A familiar and predictable tale of two halves, its critics might say. On the face of it, the numbers are something of a setback. \nMay’s announcement of a revival in clothing sales, after 16 consecutive quarters without growth, was a huge moment, especially given the much chillier weather during spring, which made it a tougher period than usual for fashion retailers. \nCrucially, Bolland claimed the change in fortunes was down to improvements in style and quality, even in womenswear, up 1.3pc in the first five months of the year. For a retailer long seen as being out of touch in the fashion stakes, particularly with its core female customers, it felt like a watershed moment: was M&S finally back in vogue? \nGuests at last week’s bash, which kicked off with a fashion show showcasing M&S’ latest offerings, seemed to think so. Afterwards, as a host of City grandees such as Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) boss Antony Jenkins, British Land (LSE: BLND.L - news ) chief executive Chris Grigg, and property developer Sir Stuart Lipton, shared champagne with Bolland, M&S chairman Robert Swannell, and other board members, the verdict seemed to be overwhelmingly positive. “Very exciting,” said one guest. \nHowever, the mood was in contrast to the cautious tone some analysts struck after its May results. “Just as one swallow does not a summer make, one quarter of positive like-for-like does not a trend make,” David Jeary, at Canaccord Genuity (Other OTC: CCORF - news ) , warned. \nAlthough Bolland’s strategy of revamping stores and modernising the website has clearly brought some improvements, the latest figures suggest it is a little premature for partying. \nBolland himself admitted on Tuesday that sales numbers would be “completely different” if it wasn’t for the big online turnaround. Without the boost, the underlying sales decline in the period would have been 4pc-5pc, one analyst estimated. \nIn his favour, the first quarter’s trading tends to be the least important, but any slip-ups in the second and third quarter, where the significant parts of the autumn/winter clothing season will be recorded, and the same old questions about his tenure will quickly resurface. \n= Power to the people? = \nThe ruling by the Competition and Markets Authority that millions of Britons are overpaying for their energy will be hailed as one of the great consumer victories of recent times and a severe blow to the dominance of the big energy suppliers. \nAfter a year-long inquiry into the energy sector, the CMA has found that the so-called Big Six energy firms have been overcharging customers by as much as £160 each a year, a ruling that is widely expected to lead to a fall in bills for many households. \nWhile consumer groups, and no doubt Labour, whose pledge to freeze prices prompted the inquiry, will celebrate the watchdog’s intervention, the City will be attempting to sift through more than 100 pages of findings and possible remedies to work out what impact this will have on the big suppliers. \nAlthough it’s early days, the immediate feeling is that they will be able to ride this out fairly comfortably. \nWhile some of the language was fairly damning the leading suppliers had been “exploiting” customers, it said the CMA's most radical proposal, a possible transitional price cap on high-cost tariffs, is likely to be in proportion to the CMA’s finding that customers are being overcharged by about 5pc a year. It is also a last resort, the regulator admits. \nOther remedies, such as a price comparison website run by Ofgem, while beneficial to customers, are likely to be fairly inconsequential to the business models of the dominant suppliers. \nEven Iain Conn, boss of Centrica (LSE: CNA.L - news ) , appears relatively unconcerned saying he had questions about some of the proposals but otherwise welcomed the regulator’s findings. \nThat's not to say the parent company of British Gas won't face a fall in margins if the price cap is introduced, but Conn insists the market intervention does not mean the industry should adjust for a new era of lower profits. \nInstead, companies need to become more efficient, he argues, something Centrica is already preparing for. After a collapse in oil and gas prices, the FTSE-100 giant announced a big slump in earnings in February and was forced into its first dividend cut since being created in 1997. As a result, the company is in the process of a far-reaching strategy review due to be unveiled at the end of the month. \nAs Centrica and its rivals prepare for a harsh new world, the regulator had the power to add to the industry's woes significantly. With some pressure groups accusing the Big Six of market abuse, there was a fear that the CMA would recommend their break-up. Instead, its largely toothless report seems to have come as something of a relief.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T04:07:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
