Bloomberg Share on twitter by Karen Maley Alexis Tsipras has secured a minor victory in assuring funding to keep Greece afloat for the next few weeks, but the Greek leader knows that the battle over his country's future is still far from over.\nOvernight, eurozone finance ministers agreed to extend a €7 billion ($10.3 billion) loan to Athens, which should help to tide the debt-strapped country over until its third bailout package is negotiated.\nThe lifeline will allow Athens to meet the €3.5 billion debt repayment it is due to make to the European Central Bank on Monday and to repay the €2 billion that is overdue to the International Monetary Fund.\nMeanwhile, the ECB, confident that Athens will meet its loan repayment, has agreed to give Greek banks, which are running short of cash, access to an extra €900 million in emergency funding .\nTsipras has been granted some breathing space after the Greek parliament this week passed a tough package of reforms and budget cuts. These included increases in sales tax, cuts to the pension and the introduction of a \"golden rule\" that would automatically trigger new spending cuts and tax hikes if Athens looks set to fall short of its budgetary target.\nBut although the passage of these measures are the precondition to Greece receiving a further €86 billion in aid money, Tsipras paid a high political cost.\nAltogether, 39 MPs from his radical leftist Syriza party failed to support the measures , including the former head of finance, Yanis Varoufakis and Parliament Speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou.\nThe backlash from within his own party leaves Tsipras with a dilemma. He's now got little choice but to reshuffle his ministry, but he doesn't want the recalcitrant MPs to resign because he wants to maintain Syriza's hold on power.\n What's more, even among those Syriza MPs who voted in favour of the bailout, many spoke out against the tough conditions it imposed.\nIn this they followed the lead of Tsipras himself. The Greek told the parliament that he was \"blackmailed\" in accepting the agreement, adding that \"there were no good options and I chose the least bad\".\nGiven Athens' obvious resentment over the latest bailout agreement, it's little wonder that there is widespread skepticism as to whether Tsipras and his new ministry will actually implement the tough new measures.\nGerman finance minister Wolfgang Schauble voiced these doubts in a radio interview on Thursday, saying that a voluntary exit from the eurozone \"could perhaps be a better way\" for Greece than its proposed €86 billion bailout.\nNo one in Berlin or in Athens is in any doubt as to the acrimonious negotiations that lie ahead before a third Greek bailout deal is finally agreed.\nIn the first place, Greece's creditors are putting pressure on the Tsipras government to revoke measures that its taken in the past few months, such as the rehiring of 4000 public servants who lost their jobs under previous austerity programs and allowing Greeks to pay their overdue taxes in monthly instalments.\nBut in a television interview this week, Tsipras indicated that his government would not reverse its past measures and would instead find other ways to plug the budgetary gap.\nThe Tsipras government also wants to keep the Greek state television ERT running. The public broadcaster, which was closed in June 2013 under the previous government's austerity program and which reopened in June this year, employs around 2000 people. But ERT's future could also prove a contentious subject of negotiation with the country's creditors.\nThere are also tensions around how Athens intends to shave its military budget. Greece is expecting to cut its defence budget by €200 million this year and by €300 million next year.\nThe country's creditors want these savings to be made by cutting running costs, rather than by reducing spending on military equipment (both Germany and France are big suppliers of weapons to Greece). But again the Tsipras government takes exactly the opposite view.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-07-17T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T05:08:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
