If people at the bottom...don't feel they can rise, that's a problem. In my case, I thought that I could always rise up by working hard and so forth, but many people now don't feel that's the case.\" \nRubenstein said income inequality should be one of the issues discussed in the presidential campaign, along with how to increase economic growth and create \"the kind of jobs that people want to have.\" He also said the candidates should be talking about how to keep the U.S. competitive against countries like China.

Rubenstein said he hopes more billionaires will follow his lead, as well as those of lesser means. \nMust Read: The 11 Highest-Yielding Nasdaq 100 Dividend Stocks \n\"Philanthropy is an ancient Greek word that means love and humanity,\" said Rubenstein. \"It doesn't mean rich people writing checks so you can do many other things to help people, with your time, your energy and ideas and you don't have to be fabulously wealthy to do that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T13:02:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
