This does not deviate much from the financial policy of the country. The deficit doesn't result in rise in inflation. The budget portrays the country's developed muscle to cover its outlays by its internal revenue. \nResponding to questions to MHPs, the premier noted that the budgetary system is one that aims at extirpating poverty. It is one that sets an emulation-worthy model to Africa as well. \nThe 2015/16 budget is designed in such a way that the agriculture sector transforms itself,the industry sector specially the manufacturing sector displays structural adjustment, the involvement of local investors in the nation building task makes an upward spiral as well as the attraction of foreign direct investment turns out to be a hit. \nAs the budget is meticulously designed, it doesn't create inflation. Since the education and road sectors have far reaching effect and prove to be instrumental for the intended sustainable development, they are made to enjoy the larger segment of the budget. \nOn top of the effort underway to augment the country's foreign currency reserve, taking into account quality of goods and competitiveness in the global market, with fervent passion, works will be done to replace imported items by local products, to make locally manufactured products available in lieu of those being imported. Works will also be done to come up with export items. The procurement task will also be made to eye at domestic products. \nThere is no gainsaying that the development journey the country set on need to be buttressed by studies and researches. That is why the government earmarked 100 million birr for fields like bio-technology. When compared with budgets devoted to similar tasks by developing countries Ethiopia's budget stands tall. \nIn the just ensued budget year, reportedly, the government's push to strengthen as well as ensure the active and multifaceted participation of women and the youth in the country's march towards a fair tomorrow will be ensured. Also, the government shall see women and the youth will enjoy a fair share from the national wealth that accrues. \n\"Though the degree of women's involvement in the sociopolitical arena is encouraging, it is not that heartening when it comes to the economic sphere. Hence there is a call for zooming attention towards this task. Relatively speaking the engagement of the youth is not that significant as that of members of the fair sex. Hence works will be done to strengthen efforts already underway,\" the premier said. \nThough coming up with a laudatory budget system is good, monitoring that the apportioned budgets will irrigate the intended purposes is mandatory. As the Auditor General's report indicates procurement and payments divorced from rules and regulation had been done by federal offices from 2009G.C to 2013 G.C resulting in a 2 billion 962 million 57 thousand and 718 Birr loss. The Auditor General had pinpointed institutions involved in such messes. \nThe question that crops up is what punitive measures pertinent organizations are taking to curb the problem that seems recurrent? Giving a non-stop advice only doesn't work, for, reportedly, there are organizations and officials, given pieces of advice over 89 times by the house to mend their wrong ways in vain. \nThe Federal Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission too has declared that it had spared the country from the siphoning of 37 million 15 thousand 929 birr. This is a commendable task. As the commission puts it , it also uses The Auditor General reports as a tip to get hot on the heels of the corrupt. The closing ranks of such sisterly organizations is heartening. This helps close the door left ajar for the corrupt. \nSimply mapping out golden policies is not enough. Unless golden policies are implemented to the letter it is hardly possible to pull out the country from the economic morass it had been submerged for far to long. Commitment and conviction is expected from all stakeholders. \nMoney collected from taxpayers and citizens as well as loans garnered must not lay waste. They have to irrigate set objectives. Otherwise the country's ambition will fall with in the realm of a pipe dream.
