Photo: Craig Abraham CMA\nPrivately owned Chinese developer AZX Group has emerged as the buyer of a Docklands development site that sold for $31.1 million last year.\nListed property group Charter Hall and Flagship Property Holdings (owned by Plenary Group and Kerry Stokes' Premier Capital Development) had proposed a $250 million office building for the site at 685 La Trobe Street, although the buyer is likely to build apartments.\nAZX has bought the 4411-square-metre site on the edge of Etihad Stadium through a holding company, Australia Xing Six, one of a number of shelf companies set up by Chengdu Xinguyan Real Estate Development, one of China's top 10 overseas real estate developers.\nThe company has spent $180 million on development sites in Melbourne. It is also developing projects in Villiers Street, North Melbourne, Hopkins Street, Footscray, and last year paid $60 million to Grocon for land at the CUB site in Carlton.\nAdvertisement Charter Hall announced the deal on Monday, noting it had received $16.85 million for its share of the deal, which was a premium to its book value. It is understood Charter Hall paid $5.5 million to enter the project in 2011. It now carries no assets on its balance sheet.\nCharter Hall and Premier Capital Development announced plans to build a 12-level 35,000-square-metre office building on the site in 2012. However, it soon became clear that residential development would be more lucrative than an office project.\nThe transaction was handled by CBRE agents Mark Wizel, Josh Rutman and Lewis Tong.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T06:48:17.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
