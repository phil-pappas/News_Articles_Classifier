It has also attracted a number of chain restaurants and bars to the area, from Wagamama to Nando's. \nIn April, Quintain formed a joint venture with Swiss private equity house Keystone to construct 362 homes. It has redeveloped York House, a former office, which is now home to 40 businesses. \nThere is also a new 1,300-seat theatre on the way, which will open in September 2016 with the first live show of The Hunger Games . A five-acre park could be finished as early as next year, complete with lakes. \nQuintain was forced to focus on office space instead of residential property when the recession hit , sending the market into chronic decline. “The residential market evaporated in 2009,” said Mr Saunders. ”We didn’t know when it would come back.” \nTo reduce the pressure on cash flow, Quintain offloaded its interests in the Greenwich Peninsula for £230m, which delivered it a £31m profit. Revenue was £13.1m in the six months to 30 September, from £19.9m a year ago. \nLast week Quintain reported half year pre-tax profits of £8m, from a loss of £25.2m in 2014. \nMr Saunders said that Quintain would remain involved in the redevelopment for the next 20 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T12:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T13:02:54.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
