The panel session is scheduled for 13th October, 2015 and will be held at the Convene Conference Center in New York. Private Equity International's 5th annual Operating Partners Forum has become the premier event for anyone involved with value creation in the private equity community.\n“Private equity firms still struggle with execution, which in a hyper-competitive deal making environment is becoming a huge issue,” notes Berkeley, an expert in the profitable growth and expansion of private equity-backed portfolio companies. “In most situations, I observe the issue is one of focus and discipline, and most importantly, resolve, to see that priorities are addressed rapidly by portfolio company managers and early in the value creation phase. The outstanding PE firms have consistent and repeatable approaches to priority setting that identifies where speed enhances quality (equity value creation), and where quality enhances the speed towards an impressive exit.”\nJames Berkeley offers dramatic growth opportunities to private equity portfolio companies. He has worked extensively with private equity firms and portfolio company managers globally to boost top line growth and maximise margins and value through his distinctive approaches to marketing, leveraging relationships, branding and pricing.\nWhether it is consulting top management on profitable growth issues, critiquing value creation plans, changing pricing strategies or an enhanced focused on talent in high-performing organisations, he is known for his Profitable Growth Regime.\nJames’s counsel has been sort by senior executives at an array of private equity-owned businesses such as Hilton Worldwide, ASIMCO Technologies, Caesars Entertainment, CKE Restaurants and over 40 other market-leading organisations around the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T19:53:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
