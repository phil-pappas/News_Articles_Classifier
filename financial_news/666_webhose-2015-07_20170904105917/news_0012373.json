Glenn Hunt by Sue Hoban \"We just want to keep it simple and not have a complex range of investments.\"\nGraham Turner\nFlight Centre co-founder and chief executive Graham \"Skroo\" Turner is well known for the unconventional way he runs his business, so it probably should not come as a surprise that his approach to personal investment is similarly unorthodox.\nBut, while the travel industry trailblazer, whose wealth the 2014 BRW Rich List was put at $945 million, makes a virtue of challenging the conventional wisdom in business, his pared-back investment strategy owes more to personal priorities than any deliberately contrarian approach.\nHis focus is unequivocally on business; personal wealth is merely a by-product of how successful he is at it and not something he wants to be distracted by.\nHe is, therefore, content to have half his capital sitting at call in the bank and the rest devoted to his family company's two major interests: The Spicers Group of luxury boutique hotels (reportedly worth more than $70 million) overseen by his wife Jude, and the Pedal Group (99 Bikes cycle shops) started and run by his son in a 50/50 joint venture with the Flight Centre, both of which the self-described \"empire builder\" would eventually like to take public.\n`\"We're not sophisticated investors, particularly in terms of shares,\" he says of himself and his wife of 38 years. \"We feel that needs to be left up to the experts, but we do know about running small hotels. We just feel we want to keep it simple and not have a complex range of investments.\" Those 10 hotels, located in some prime city and country locations, represent a significant property holding, apart from the food and accommodation businesses they run out of them.\n Turner, whose democratic business style dictates that even the company's top executives share space in open-plan offices and have to manage without PAs, and whose idiosyncratic management philosophy is outlined in the book Family, Village, Tribe , may be one of the country's richest men on paper, but it's debatable whether he will ever cash out.\n\"The only reason we're on that [Rich] list is because of Flight Centre and the value of Flight Centre shares and to realise that, you'd have to sell shares which we're certainly not in the way of doing,\" he says. \"We have just been working on our 2035 destination (20-year business plan) and the aim is for the original founders of Flight Centre Travel Group, including myself, to continue to have control over the shareholding.\"\nTurner, at 65, is fighting fit and still playing in staff touch-football games twice a week. He says he has never looked ahead to any end game. \"We're still building the Flight Centre Travel Group for the future â€“ that's the way I see it. I can't see too much changing in the next 20 years.\"\nCash: 50 per cent\nPrivate business and property: 50 per cent", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T09:02:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
