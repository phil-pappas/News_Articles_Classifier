The sector that accounts for more dividend income than any other, oil and gas, is forecast to offer more modest growth of 5.6pc. \nHere we look in more detail at the dividend prospects for the various sectors. \n= Retailers = \nDividend growth forecast: 23.2pc \nIncome investors in this sector face a tough time. Following this year’s expected fall, Markit predicted a further 15pc cut in 2016. \nTesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) will pay no final dividend for 2015, while Markit predicted that Sainsbury’s payout in November would be around 33pc lower than last year, based on its policy of distributing half its “underlying” earnings to shareholders. Wm Morrison is targeting a payment of around 5p for 2016, a fall of 64pc. \n= Banks = \nDividend growth forecast: +23.2pc \nThe banks had to make drastic cuts to payouts during the financial crisis; finally the tide seems to be turning, although some of the large percentage increases simply reflect how little is paid currently. \nLloyds, for example, should raise its dividend by 30pc when it announces its results for 2015, Markit said. It predicted that the bank would reach its target of paying half its profits to shareholders by 2017, implying “significant” rises in the near term. \nIt predicted growth from HSBC and Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) of 2pc and 8pc respectively. \n= Oil and gas = \nDividend growth forecast: +5.6pc \nDespite the dramatic falls in the oil price (since partially reversed), firms in the sector, which pays more in dividends than any other, are still expected to make modest increases to their payments. \n“The sector accounts for more than 15pc of the total projected payout from large and medium-sized UK stocks,” Markit said. “As such, a dramatic fall in oil prices poses the greatest risk to equity income.” \nBut it added that, “while challenges remain”, it expected BP and Royal Dutch Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) to maintain their payments to shareholders this year. \n• Ten shares for dividend growth until 2020 \n• Income portfolio: 11 shares that can afford the dividends they pay \n“Management at both companies are aware of the importance of the dividends to shareholders and the impact of any reduction on the investment case,” the firm’s report said. \nThe recovery in oil prices from lows reached earlier in the year goes some way to ease the pressure on the oil majors and the relative strength of the dollar is helping to offset the impact of slower growth in payouts across the sector, it added. \n= Drugs and health care = \nDividend growth forecast: +4pc \nBritain’s two drugs giants, GlaxoSmithKline (Other OTC: GLAXF - news ) and AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN - news ) , are hugely important to income investors. Both are expected to maintain their dividends rather than raise them. Growth in the sector will come from smaller firms such as Shire (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) and Smith & Nephew (LSE: SN.L - news ) , Markit said. \nIt pointed out that Glaxo offered an attractive yield of 7.2pc but that, based on analysts’ profit forecasts, the firm would be handing 100pc of its earnings to shareholders this year and 80pc in 2018. This “raises some concerns about the sustainability of the dividend”, the report said. \n“We are forecasting a maintained dividend from AstraZeneca,” it added. \n= Personal (LSE: PGH.L - news ) and household Goods = \nDividend growth forecast: +15.9pc \nThis sector includes major dividend payers such as tobacco firms, as well as housebuilders. \nSince 2008 British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco (LSE: IMT.L - news ) have delivered steady annual growth of around 11pc in their dividends, Markit said. It predicted increases this year of 3.6pc and 10pc respectively. \nDividend increases from housebuilders were expected to be 26pc this year and 8pc next. \n• For fund tips and investment ideas, sign up to our weekly Investor (Stockholm: INVE-A.ST - news ) newsletter \n• Put a question on investment income to our experts: moneyexpert@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T11:28:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
