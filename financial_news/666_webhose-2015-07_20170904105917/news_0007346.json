Chris Hopkins by Lucille Keen As Jimmy Spence looks back at what will most likely be the last Navy ship built at Williamstown it's hard for him to hide his sorrow.\n\"We're pretty much going to lose our jobs in the next few months so we're just sort of hanging on and finishing off the ships that are here,\" the father of two said.\n\"My kids will be heart broken as they love saying their dad builds big ships. It's sad to lose a job that you like doing. I don't know where I can use my skills, but I have to feed my family so I will have to do something, even if it's driving around delivering pizzas.\"\nMr Spence, who has been involved in ship building since he was 16, said he it was a job that needs to be done.\nBAE Systems workers, from left Peter Betts, Jimmy Spence and Ben Peach pose for a photo outside the Williamstown shipbuilding yard. Chris Hopkins \"But this government and previous governments haven't allowed any more work to be done. The navy needs new ships because the fleet is getting old. Also the problem with moving the work overseas means there are different standards.\"\nLooking back at the NUSHIP Adelaide, docked at BAE Systems Williamstown, Mr Spence explains how the hull was brought out from Spain but required significant work as it wasn't up to scratch.\nHis colleague Ben Peach, 31, is worried about finding work as his partner has a baby on the way.\nHe said manufacturing in Australia was being destroyed and it would be hard to find other work.\n \"There are no good jobs out there,\" Mr Peach.\nBut for Peter Betts, who has just finished a three-year apprenticeship at the company, said moving to Adelaide for work was not an option and he'd grown up locally and wants to stay.\n\"I took [Federal Treasurer] Joe Hockey's advice, I got a got a good job and got a mortgage but now I don't know how I'm going to pay for it if I lose my job,\" Mr Betts said.\nLeon White entered the industry as a 15-year-old and has been campaigning to keep the jobs for the past two years.\n\"We've had 30-odd apprentices come through in the last two years, trained up to build ships and now they're going to end up welding six by four trailers, it's a waste of talent,\" Mr White said.\n\"We haven't got the rolling build like other countries. We're ramping up work then ramping it down. It's the cost in training, the time in training.\"\nMr White said the most rewarding part of the job was seeing something that starts out as flat steel ends up being used by the nation's navy defending the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:58:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
