The consortium has said it will redirect money it makes to academic research intended to improve the structure of European markets.\n“While these exclusive discussions may or may not lead to a binding agreement, any collaboration would have to meet Plato Partnership’s underlying principles to be not-for-profit, reduce trading costs, simplify market structure and act as a champion for end investors,” Plato said Friday in an e-mailed statement.\nPlato’s website lists seven companies that were bidding to build the market. Of those, the firms that were seen as the mostly likely to win included Aquis Exchange Ltd., Turquoise and Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.\nWhile Plato has been billed as a joint partnership between dealers and investors, Plato and Turquoise have substantial overlap in terms of bank owners, including Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Stephen McGoldrick, project director for Plato, has been involved in both developments.", "external_links": ["http://www.platopartnership.com/polling-page.html\\"], "published": "2015-07-24T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T14:06:11.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
