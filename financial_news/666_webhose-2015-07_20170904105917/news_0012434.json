It requires you to change your marketing approach drastically.\" \nVan Dijk said that apps have the same goals as websites in that they want to \"offer a good proposition to the customers that they will like. \n\"So if you have the right apps, the app store will be a partner in getting it on people's screen. If you don't have a good app, app stores will try to do their best not to get your app in front of customers.\" \nHe said Naspers is investing in emerging markets where mobile internet scales up fast.
