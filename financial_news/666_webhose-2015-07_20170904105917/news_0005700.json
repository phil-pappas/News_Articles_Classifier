Photo: Martin Leissl\nThere is no televised contest for the world's best central bank leader, but if there was, Perpetual's Matt Sherwood would probably nominate European Central Bank president Mario Draghi.\nThe fund manager's head of investment strategy has described Mr Draghi as \"the greatest central banker ever\".\n\"He has held together an 18-member currency union during periods of major stress, managed the oscillated views of Europe, while containing the power of the masses (namely market forces) and encouraging them to accept lower risk premiums, despite having less than 1 per cent of the funding of these huddled masses,\" Mr Sherwood wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday.\n\"That is a result of which any emperor would be immensely proud and why I think Mr Draghi is the greatest central banker ever.\"\nIn May, Mr Draghi hit back at sustained criticism about the ECB's quantitative easing strategies as well as complaints about a controversial bond-buying program that cost the bank €1.1 billion. The strategy drove the euro down by more than 20 per cent against the US dollar, which was part of the plan to stimulate spending and investment.\nIf there were a competition for \"world's best central banker\", Greece might not back Mr Draghi, as his austerity approach has been met by fierce opposition there.\nSo who is he, and who might rival him for the title?\nBefore his presidency, Mr Draghi was the governor of the Bank of Italy through the onslaught and aftermath of the global financial crisis from 2005 to 2011. From 2009 he served as chairman of the Financial Stability Board before in November 2011, beginning his stint as leader of the organisation that controls the European Union's monetary policy.\nSince then, he has steered the bank and eurozone through standoffs with Cyprus, Ireland, Italy and Spain as they struggled with overwhelming economic challenges that threatened to tear the shared currency union apart.\n\"At this time, ECB president Draghi set about resolving Europe's escalating financial problems one by one, firstly by stating that he would do 'whatever it takes' to hold the union together,\" Mr Sherwood said.\nMr Draghi's strong comments were followed by a greater volume of cheap loans for struggling banks and establishing a fund to mitigate the impact of market forces when crises hit the financial markets. The measures he helped establish are considered one of the reasons the current \"Grexit\" fears haven't rocked global financial markets to the extent they did in previous eurozone crises.\n\"For non-Greeks, contagion fears are the major concern but the market's trust and confidence in the ECB's firewalls remains resolute which is why a 'Grexit' has not cracked financial markets as it did in 2011-12,\" Mr Sherwood said.\nMr Sherwood isn't alone in his praise for Mr Draghi. In 2014, the Italian was listed as the eighth most powerful person in the world by Forbes , while this year Fortune magazine ranked him as the world's second-greatest leader\nThere is in fact an annual award for the Best Central Bank Governor Award , co-ordinated by European financial markets magazine Euromoney .\nThis year's winner is yet to be announced, but last year's gong went the governor of the Reserve Bank of India Raghuram Rajan, for steering the debt-riddled economy of the emerging powerhouse through a storm of plummeting bonds, weakening currency and corruption.\nIn 2013, the prize went to Mexican central bank governor Agustin Carstens for what the magazine described as a daring decision to lower interest rates from 4.5 per cent to a record low of 4 per cent, in Mexico's first rate cut since 2009.\nThe year before Mr Carstens took out Euromoney 's gong, US-based Global Finance Magazine graded the world's central bankers .\nAustralia's Glenn Stevens was one of the six bankers graded \"A\", alongside the central bank leaders of Canada, Israel, Malaysia, Philippines and Taiwan.\nMr Draghi's tenure at the ECB was then worth a \"B\", according to the magazine, as was the performance of US governor Ben Bernanke and Britain's Mervyn King,\nArgentina's Mercedes Marcó del Pont and Ecuador's Pedro Delgado scored the lowest, coming with a \"D\" grade.\nAnother contender for the title of \"greatest central banker ever\" publicly nominated is Alan Greenspan, who was repeatedly described as such by congress members throughout his time as the US Federal Reserve chairman.\nClinton-era Treasury secretary Larry Summers described him as \"the central, most important financial policymaker of the post-World War II period anywhere in the world\".\nHowever, Mr Greenspan's tenure has since come under fire as many critics suggest his easy-money policies contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis in the US, which in turn sparked the global financial crisis.", "external_links": ["https://www.gfmag.com/awards-rankings/best-banks-and-financial-rankings/worlds-top-central-bankers2012", "http://www.euromoney.com/Poll/10682/PollsAndAwards/Central-bank-governor-of-the-year.html", "http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1877351_1877350_1877331,00.html", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11606416/Mario-Draghi-hits-back-at-critics-of-QE-as-Greek-woes-continue.html", "http://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/transformed-into-an-austerity-laboratory-greece-requests-new-bailout-deal-20150708-gi86a0", "http://www.forbes.com/profile/mario-draghi/"], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T05:42:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
