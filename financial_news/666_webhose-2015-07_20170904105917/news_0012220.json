The drama started on Saturday after she posted a picture of the car she bought the husband.\" \nThe source declined to name the hospital saying it would damage Laura's reputation and that of her company Benchmark Solutions. \nSources say Laura has already sent letters to the media to stop them from writing about her. \nTroubled started on July 1, 2013, when Bharatam offered Laura a board of directors position at Iridium Interactive. \n\"We are grateful to you for having given serious consideration to this nomination. With you as part of our board, we hope to foray into many arenas. Your role is critical in fulfilling the mission we have for the company,\" he said in a letter seen by the Star. \nA year later, Laura wrote a resignation letter claiming she was busy restructuring her own business. \nThe source said between 2014 and 2015, Laura started borrowing money from Bharatam but gave various excuses when asked to pay the debts. \nOn March 31, Bharatam filed a case at Milimani Commercial Courts claiming Laura had defaulted in paying him, Standard Digital reported. \nThe businessman said he came to Laura's aid in January 2013 when she experienced financial difficulties. \nHe said he decided to lend her Sh4.9 million cash since they were close and there was no time for bank transactions. \nHe said Laura owed Family Bank Sh40million which she had guaranteed somebody, who had also defaulted, claiming she had been given two days to clear the loan. \n\"In April 2013, Laura reached out to me seeking more funding. She gave me a detailed plan of the new business she intended to start. Her ideas seemed legitimate,\" \nBharatam said Akunga reached out to him again seeking financial assistance after failing to pay one of her suppliers known as Granada Trading. \n\"I coordinated and sent Sh7.35 million by bank transfer and further arranged cash locally making sure she was able to settle the debt,\" he said. \nHe said Akunga indicated that her company makes around Sh80 million to Sh90 million in revenue. \n\"When I asked for financial records, she kept giving flimsy excuses. I later gathered that the company only makes between Sh6 and 8 million in revenue,\" he said. \nHe further accused Laura of lying about having to pay her mother a salary, by claiming she was in her company's board of directors.
