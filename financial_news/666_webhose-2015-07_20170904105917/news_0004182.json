My Brother's Keeper works to change the lives of boys and young men of color, by removing barriers that stand in the way of their success. \"They start off with too many disadvantages and the world has gotten so competitive,\" said Echevarria, who speaks from experience. He grew up in inner city and in his words, was \"probably quasi-literate by the time I got to the third grade.\" Echevarria said he was helped by a program that \"changed me from dreaming of becoming an auto mechanic to going to college.\" Echevarria later became the CEO of Deloitte. He explained that businesses must look for new workers and consider those they might not have in the past. 'The supply side is interesting to the private sector,\" said Echevarria. \"In 2020, there will be about 22-million new jobs created that are highly skilled and highly paid, and there will only be about 18-million people who can fill them.\" Echevarria said government programs aren't enough to solve the problem, and businesses need to understand it's about making an investment in communities, and seeing a return on their investment. \"The business community are the ones who have an ROI here,\" said Echevarria. \"They will all tell you that they can't find any skilled people. They will all tell you how much it costs to train people.\" \nAsked whether he's optimistic about winning over businesses, Echevarria replied \"I'm always optimistic. This is a great country. I'm sitting here talking to you, we're in Aspen. And I'm from the South Bronx.\" The MBK Alliance grew out of an initiative launched by President Obama last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T15:50:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
