Its bonds rallied.\nThe Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, called Prepa, made the principal and interest payment with reserve funds and $153 million from its general fund, the agency said in a statement. Prepa also borrowed $128 million from bond-insurance companies that it will have to pay back in December.\nThe extension of the forbearance pact with creditors until Sept. 15 keeps discussions out of court. The agency must reach a restructuring agreement with creditors by Sept. 1 to keep the forbearance in place, according to Stephen Spencer, a managing director at Houlihan Lokey, financial adviser to Prepa bondholders.\n“We are pleased we were able to reach an agreement that allowed us to make the payment to our bondholders today and avoid a default,” Lisa Donahue, Prepa’s chief restructuring officer, said in the statement. “Today’s outcome would not have been possible without the support of the insurers and other creditors.”\nPrepa’s bonds rallied Wednesday. The price of a bond maturing in 2033 jumped to an average of 77 cents on the dollar in trades between dealers, up 10 percent from Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T17:42:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
