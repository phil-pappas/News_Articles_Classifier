In the case of deafness, this involves injecting a gene-carrying engineered virus into the inner ear.\nThere are currently no approved disease-modifying treatments for disabling hearing loss, which affects some 360 million people, or 5 percent of the world’s population, according to the World Health Organization.\nHearing aids can amplify sounds, while cochlear implants turn sounds into electrical signals for the brain to decode, but such devices cannot fully replicate natural hearing.\nMuch of the hearing loss in older people is noise-induced or age-related, but at least half of deafness that occurs before a baby learns to speak is caused by defects in one of more than 70 individual genes.\nIt is these infants Swiss and U.S. researchers hope to help, after showing that replacing a mutated gene improved the function of hair cells of the inner ear and partially restored hearing in deaf mice.\nScientists from the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne and the Boston Children’s Hospital, who reported their work in the journal Science Translational Medicine, tested hearing in newborn mutant mice by seeing how high they jumped when startled by a noise.\nThe team focused on a gene called TMC1, which is a common cause of human genetic deafness, accounting for 4 to 8 percent of cases. But other forms of hereditary deafness could also be fixed using the same strategy.\nJeffrey Holt of Boston Children’s said the technique still needed “tweaking” but he hopes clinical trials will start within five to 10 years.\nWork at Novartis is more advanced, with the first patient treated last October in an early-stage clinical trial that will recruit 45 subjects in the United States, with results due in 2017.

But it will not help the one to three babies per 1,000 born with severe genetic hearing loss in both ears.\n“There are a big range of deafness types needing different approaches,” said Moser.\n 09, 2015 10:31 am", "external_links": ["http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02132130?term=NCT02132130&rank=1)"], "published": "2015-07-09T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T01:20:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
