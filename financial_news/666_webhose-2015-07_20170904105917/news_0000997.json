Likewise, the euro pared its losses against the yen to stand at 136.55 after an early dip to 135.40. The U.S. dollar barely budged against a basket of currencies at 95.957.\nDemand for sovereign debt lifted U.S. 10-year Treasury futures <0#TY:> 11 ticks, while the S&P E-MINI U.S. stock contract lost 0.5 percent.\nAiding the euro were rumours the European Central Bank had agreed to delay a Greek repayment of 3.5 billion euros that had been due on July 20.\nHopes for some resolution to the Greek drama were dashed on Sunday when euro zone leaders told the cash-strapped Greek government it must enact key reforms this week to restore trust before they will open talks on a financial rescue.\nSix sweeping measures including tax and pension reforms must be enacted by Wednesday night and the entire package endorsed by the Greek parliament before talks can start.\nAsian investors will also be anxiously watching to see if China's stock markets can stabilise after a barrage of government support measures sparked a much-needed bounce.\nAfter a run of torrid losses the CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen ended the week with a gain of 5.7 percent.\nSentiment will be tested by economic data on China's trade flows later on Monday, and the always sensitive gross domestic product report on Wednesday.\nForecasts are that the world's second largest economy slowed to 6.9 percent last quarter, making it harder to meet Beijing's target of 7 percent for the whole year.\nAs if Wednesday were not already busy enough, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is also due to appear before the House Financial Services Committee.\nLast week, Yellen said she still expected a rise in interest rates at some point this year, but repeated concerns that U.S. labour markets were weaker than desired.\nIn commodity markets, gold failed to get much of a safety bid, easing over a dollar to $1,161.80 an ounce.\nOil prices were under pressure as Iran and six world powers neared an historic nuclear deal that would bring sanctions relief and thus more crude onto the market.\nBrent crude was off 70 cents to $58.03 a barrel and U.S. crude eased 60 cents to $52.14.
