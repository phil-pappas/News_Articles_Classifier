fresh 11 per cent plunge taking its price to a 10-year low.\nAt the end of the latest session, benchmark iron ore for immediate delivery to the port of Tianjin in China was trading at $US44.10 a tonne, down 11.3 per cent from its prior close of $US49.70 a tonne.\nOver the past five sessions unprecedented losses of 5.3, 3, 3.9, 4.4 and 11.3 per cent have been recorded, leading it down 25 per cent from $US58.90 a tonne through this period.\nThe current price is a record low since The Steel Index began releasing its data in 2008 and the lowest mark seen since 2005 when miners used to set yearly benchmark contracts with Chinese steelmakers.\nIn April the commodity fell as low as $US46.70 a tonne, but many hoped that would prove the floor price in the ongoing bear market, given a strong recovery back to $US65 a tonne through May and June.\nHowever, the last month has seen an array of red signals rear their head, and the commodity enjoying just one positive session since June 12.\nChief among the current concerns is the health of China's markets and broader economy, given its dominant position as the world's largest consumer of iron ore.\nChina’s benchmark Shanghai stock index closed down 5.9 per cent yesterday, taking it to a three-month low after losing around a third of its value since a high was hit in mid-June.\n“China’s stock market rout is now spreading to other financial markets, creating a sweeping sense of panic and liquidity crunch,” Zheng Ge, an analyst at Wanda Futures, said.\nIron ore has copped the brunt of the selling beyond Chinese stocks, though nickel and copper have also been especially hard hit.\n“Fears about the risks to financial stability and the wider economy have contributed to negative sentiment toward commodities,” analysts from Capital Economics added in a research note.\nPersistent downgrades from analysts have added to the weak sentiment, alongside rising supply out of Brazil and Australia and slumping oil prices, which lowers the price at which tonnes will likely come out of the market.\nPort stockpiles in China have also risen for the first time since April over the past week, furthering concerns about a growing oversupply through the remainder of the year as Chinese steel demand slumps.\nLOCAL PAIN\nAt current prices the only miners that are likely trading in the black are the so-called 'big three' of the sector: Vale, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton.\nThe likes of BC Iron, Mt Gibson Iron and Atlas Iron will all likely be operating in the red should prices stay at $US44.10, while Fortescue Metals will currently be marginal at best as it pursues a goal of reducing its break-even price to $US39 a tonne next year.\nA falling Australian dollar has helped offset the pain, but its 5 per cent retreat over the past week has not been enough to cover the 25 per cent drop in ore prices.\nThe news may also frustrate Atlas' push to raise $180 million and while its boss remained confident on Tuesday of an overbid on the deal, the iron ore price slump of over 15 per cent since will likely challenge that optimism.\nIn local trade on Wednesday, Fortescue share prices hit a six-year nadir after giving up over 6 per cent, while BC Iron sunk over 8 per cent and Mt Gibson retreated 7.5 per cent.\n\"Anything with a four in front of the iron ore price ... does make us pretty nervous but we have to work to where the price is,\" BC Iron chairman Tony Kiernan told the ABC.\n\"If it was to remain this way for the next couple of months, it would be pretty challenging to say the least.\"\nLocal giants BHP and Rio both yielded just over 3 per cent in Australian trade on Wednesday.\nFalls were more sedate in London trade, with BHP sliding 1.5 per cent and Rio inching down 0.3 per cent, though both underperformed a 1 per cent lift in the FTSE 100.
