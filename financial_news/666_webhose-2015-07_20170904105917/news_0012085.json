Photo: iStock\nInsurers are putting the bite on the loveable bitzer dog.\nDogs are more expensive to insure than cats but unlike their feline friends, the breed of dog will significantly affect the insurance premiums.\nBitzer dogs are the most expensive to insure, followed by labradors, German shepherds and border collies, research by financial comparison website Canstar found.\nBreeds such as staffies, pugs and Maltese terriers cost considerably less to insure.\nCanstar research manager Mitchell Watson said different breeds will cost more.\n\"The poor mongrel, the unknown, while very much loved perhaps not as loved when it comes to insurance premiums,\" Mr Watson said.\n\"It's an unknown quantity is probably the best way to put it.\"\nHe said there is a known factor with other breeds in terms of any hereditary issues or common health concerns, whereas with bitzers the unknown factor meant insurance would cost a little bit more to reflect the slightly higher insurance risk.\nCanstar's annual pet insurance report also notes that these days the common garden-variety of bitzer has evolved into a \"designer dog\" produced by the planned crossing of two different pure breeds, such as labradoodles and cavoodle.\n\"These designer dogs, too, must be lumped in with the original bitzer, as far as insurers are concerned,\" it said.\nPet insurance premiums have increased this year, the financial comparison site found.\nAnnual premiums for accident and illness cover for dogs has risen by about nine to 16 per cent (by $80 to $100), depending on the dog's age, while cat cover is up 9-13 per cent (by $35 to $51).\n\"Pets, while they are lovely to have the companionship, if something does go wrong it can result in quite a large vet bill and some people might not have that rainy day fund which is able to cope with such a request of money,\" Mr Watson said.\nAverage annual premiums by types of cover Comprehensive cover (top shelf cover including accident, illness and routine vet care)\n$663.76 dogs $518.34 cats Accident and Illness cover\n$572.37 dogs $400.26 cats Accident only cover\n$233.98 dogs $228.86 cats (Based on three-year-old pets)\nAverage annual premiums for accident and illness cover Dogs\nAged less than one year $625.86 Three year old $661.66 Five year old $756.33 Seven year old $870.41 Cats\nAged less than one year $425.25 Three year old $436.02 Five year old $501.07 Seven year old $569.63 Source: Canstar\nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:23:43.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
