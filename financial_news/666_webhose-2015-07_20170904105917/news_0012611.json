Renzi did not say how much that would cost, but past estimates put annual revenue from the levy at 4 billion euros ($4.33 billion).\nIn the same speech broadcast on his party's website, Renzi said he would cut corporate taxes from 2017 and taxes on personal income and pensions from 2018.\n\"My commitment here before you is to work for five years to make tax cuts that have no precedent in the history of this country,\" Renzi said. \"And we can do it without raising the debt for our children.\"\nLower taxes would help underpin Italy's recovery. The euro zone's third-biggest economy is only now emerging from a three-year slump that drove unemployment up to levels last seen in the 1970s.\nIgnoring criticism from within his Democratic Party (PD) that the prime minister is taking the centre-left party too far to the right, Renzi's pledge to scrap the property tax emulates a 2008 electoral gambit by conservative rival Silvio Berlusconi.\nDuring his speech, Renzi said the PD must \"change its identity\" and become known as a party that slashes taxes, noting that more than 80 percent of Italians own their homes.\nBerlusconi eliminated the tax only to have it restored by the next government as it shored up the public accounts during the 2011 euro zone debt crisis.\nRenzi's predecessor, Enrico Letta, tried to scrap the tax again but was forced instead to keep it -- though under a new name and structure -- because the revenue was needed to run local services without raising the budget deficit.\nThe promised tax cuts may lead to yet another clash with the European Union over the speed with which Italy is cutting its debt, which Rome has said will not happen as quickly as EU rules require.\nOn Saturday, Renzi criticized Europe's focus on public accounts and said that even with the tax cuts, Italy will be among the \"few\" EU countries to lower both its deficit and debt next year.\n\"Europe's austerity policy has been a disaster,\" Renzi said.\nItaly's public debt of more than 130 percent of national output is second only to Greece's in the euro zone. Rome has also promised to keep its annual budget deficit below the EU's 3 percent of gross domestic product ceiling.
