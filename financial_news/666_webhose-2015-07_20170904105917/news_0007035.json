It will be a long day.\" \nMinisters have given no concrete details about the nine-hour meeting, but sources close to the talks suggest divisions over whether Athens has gone far enough with its proposed austerity measures. \nThe proposals, which will serve as the foundation for Sunday's negotiations, include tax hikes and pension reforms similar to those rejected by the Greek people in last week's referendum. \nGreece's biggest creditor, Germany, has long led the drive for tougher austerity measures from Athens. \nIn a document which came to light during the meeting, the German finance ministry once again demanded more concrete commitments. \nFailing that, it said Greece should take a five-year \"time-out\" from the eurozone during which some of its debt would be written off. \nHowever several officials said no one had explicitly raised the possibility of a Grexit in the meeting. \nBelgium, Finland, Slovakia and Slovenia are reported to be among those also taking a tough line in the talks. According to Finland's state broadcaster YLE, the Finnish government had said it does not consider the Greek proposal sufficient to start negotiations on a new loan. \nSky News' Economics Editor Ed Conway, who is in Brussels, said a fundamental lack of trust in Greece after years of broken promises has also proved to be another major sticking point in negotiations. \nAhead of Saturday's meeting, German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said negotiations would be \"exceptionally difficult\". \nEmerging optimism about Greece had been \"destroyed in an incredible way in the last few months\" since Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras won power, he said. \nMeanwhile, Mr Dijsselbloem, warned: \"There is a major issue of trust. \n\"Can the Greek government be trusted to do what they are promising in coming weeks, months and years?\" \nGreece has had two bailouts worth €240bn (£172.5bn) from the eurozone and the IMF since 2010, but its economy has shrunk by a quarter, unemployment stands at more than 25% and one in two young people is out of work.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T09:22:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
