Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin called on authorities Saturday to investigate the allegations against Najib.\n“I am very concerned with the recent expose by the Wall Street Journal,” Muhyiddin said in a Facebook posting. “This accusation is very serious because it can undermine the credibility and integrity of Najib as prime minister and head of government.”\nNo Funds 1MDB on Friday denied it had funneled funds to Najib, rejecting reports saying investigators believed they had found such a money trail. The prime minister said late Friday he had never taken funds for personal gain and documents on which the Wall Street Journal report is based were doctored.\nNajib should give a convincing explanation or denial, Muhyiddin said, adding he welcomed the fact that Najib had refuted the allegations.\nInvestor confidence in Malaysia has been dented by growing scrutiny over Najib’s management of debt-ridden 1MDB, whose advisory board he chairs. In a period of less than five years since it was set up, the company accumulated debt of 41.9 billion ringgit ($11.1 billion).\nNajib has resisted calls from former premier Mahathir Mohamad to step down as the country’s leader over the matter. The Prime Minister’s Office said Friday the claims were part of a “political sabotage” campaign by some individuals seeking to remove Najib from office.\nNajib has rejected Mahathir’s criticism in past months, saying he has a mandate to govern and will remain leader as long as he has the support of his United Malays National Organisation party and citizens.", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10130211234592774869404581083700187014570\\", "https://goo.gl/YCr1ii\\", "http://goo.gl/O9liAc\\", "http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2015/04/04/Mahathir-past-quiet-stage-Najib/\\"], "published": "2015-07-04T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T16:48:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
