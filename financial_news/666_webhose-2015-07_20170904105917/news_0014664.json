On the other hand it's become the most disputed family company in Australia and that's the pity of it.\" \nMrs Rinehart's $13 billion Roy Hill mine in Western Australia is expected to deliver its first iron ore about the end of September. \n\"Gina's great strength, where she'll go down in history, is she took her dad's big dreams and made them big realities,\" Mr Singleton said. \nThe two-part Australian Story will air on ABC1 at 8pm on Monday July 6 and 13. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Rio boss says women need more confidence AAP \nRio Tinto boss Sam Walsh is looking to fill the company's senior ranks with more women, but says female employees â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T12:06:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
