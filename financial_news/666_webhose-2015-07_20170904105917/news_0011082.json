A 'No' result may force Greece to exit the euro, \"which would be hugely disruptive in the short run. But it will also offer Greece itself a chance for real recovery.\" \nThomas Piketty, a highly respected French economist who wrote the influential \"Capital (Other OTC: CGHC - news ) in the 21st Century (Shenzhen: 300078.SZ - news ) \", told French television network BFMTV that Greek voters would be right to reject the bailout offer put to them in the referendum. \n\"For me, it's clear: it's a bad plan,\" he said. \nHe added, though, that he understood many Greeks were afraid of a \"violent\" shock if it led to expulsion from the euro. \nFor them, and other economists, Greece's debt burden -- 323 billion euros ($359 billion) -- is clearly unsustainable and needs to be reduced. \nSeveral of them said Greece's current radical left government, which is arguing for a 'No' result, was not blameless for the worsening mess the country was now in. But they believed Greece would be better off rejecting the bailout deal as it stands. \nAn open letter by 246 Greek economic professors, though, begged to differ. They wrote that \"we strongly believe that, at this crucial point, it is of paramount importance... to preserve our position in the eurozone and the EU\". \n\"We believe that the recessionary consequences of debt default and exit from the eurozone... will be much worse than the effects of a painful compromise with our EU partners and the IMF (International Monetary Fund),\" they said. \n\"A disorderly break of our country from the core of Europe will have disastrous economic, social, political and geopolitical consequences.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T17:45:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
