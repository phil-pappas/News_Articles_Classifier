Obamacare, as the president's law is known, envisions a major expansion of the program, but nearly half of all U.S. states, mostly Republican-controlled, have rejected that part of the law. The Tennessee legislature voted against an expansion in February, joining 21 other states in doing so. Without expansion, 6.9 million low-income Americans, including 292,000 in Tennessee, will not get Medicaid assistance, said the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T15:47:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
