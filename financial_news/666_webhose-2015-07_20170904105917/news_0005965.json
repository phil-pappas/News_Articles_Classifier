It involves a Scania Zimbabwean registered bus belonging to King Lion with registration number ADC2743 which was heading south (Chirundu), coming from Lusaka. \n\"The accident occurred at around 10am after the driver only identified as Nyamande who is still on the run was driving at excessive speed. \n\"He failed to negotiate a curve and applied breaks causing a tyre burst leading to the vehicle overturning,\" said Comm Katanga. \nComm Katanga said they are yet to identify the nationalities of those who perished. \n\"We are still to receive reports to find out the identification of the eight people who died.

They are reportedly out of danger. \nDetails on those admitted to UTH were sketchy, but they were said to be in critical condition. \nEfforts to get a comment from the King Lion Coaches officials proved fruitless, but unconfirmed reports say they had travelled to Zambia soon after receiving news of the accident. \nThis is not the first time buses from the same company were involved in a fatal accident as last year during the same month, Chronicle Business Editor Mernat Mafirakurewa was killed in a head-on collision with a South Africa-bound bus -- a mishap that also claimed the life of a passenger on the King Lion bus.
