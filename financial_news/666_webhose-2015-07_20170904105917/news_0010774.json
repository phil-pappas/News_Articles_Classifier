But then, just before midday, the tide started turning and suddenly Fortescue shares surged before settling in to trade at about $1.73.\nFortescue said it was not Forrest that was behind the buying - the company is, like most others on the Australian Securities Exchange, in the middle of a share-trading blackout for its executives ahead of profit reporting season late this month and next - while iron ore futures predict a recovery in the commodity price tomorrow.\nWhether or not the recovery in Fortescue's share price will hold is another question. The shares have dropped almost 30 per cent in the past month.\nForrest has been entrenched in the top echelon of the BRW Rich List since debuting on the list with $340 million wealth back in 2005. His surname has become synonymous with the nation's wealthy elite. The name Forrest has sat comfortably along the likes of Packer, Pratt, Rinehart, Lowy and Triguboff.\nAfter his debut, Forrest's wealth climbed rapidly. He was well and truly a billionaire by 2007 and the paper value of his wealth peaked at an amazing $8.36 billion in 2008 - enough for Forrest to top the Rich List for the very first time.\n Though those shares lost an incredible $6 billion in value the following year, as the global financial crisis started to bite, Forrest's wealth has stayed between about $2 billion to $5 billion since.\nUntil now. The question becomes how long Fortescue's share price could fall, and Forrest's fortune - which is already down more than $1 billion since the 2015 Rich List was published at the end of May - with it.\nGiven he holds just over 1 billion shares, Fortescue shares would need to be just below $1 for Forrest's status to become \"former billionaire\".\nThat would require an even bigger fall in iron ore prices, which an increasing number of experts are tipping.\nFortescue is in the process of getting its breakeven down towards $US40 a tonne, and will not want the price to fall much further.\nEarlier this year, Citi forecast prices to go as low as $US37 - a price not seen since before the boom times of the mid-2000s and before Forrest was even a Rich List contender.\nIt came at about the same time Goldman Sachs downgraded its share price target for Fortescue to as low as 50Â¢.\nIf that scenario was to unfold, Forrest's days as a billionaire will be over. His shares would then fall to just over $500 million in value.\nThe next question then - something that seemed incredibly unlikely only a couple of months ago - would be if Forrest could stay on the Rich List given the cut-off this year was $286 million.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/twiggy_wealth_hype/index.html", "http://www.brw.com.au/lists/rich-200/2015/;jsessionid=2C75834C45912EDCFE3B4C81A4C50C57", "https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/andrew-forrests-fortune-tipped-to-shrink-as-goldman-sachs-slaps-sell-on-fortescue-20150416-1mmg0j.html"], "published": "2015-07-09T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:12:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
