It therefore comes as a relief to all stakeholders interested in obtaining information of that sort,' the statement said. \nAkua Nyame-Mensah, Managing Director, Lamudi Ghana, said: 'We love being able to provide opportunities to showcase our local developers and agencies as well as provide better information and data to potential investors, property owners and renters.' \n'The information our publications provide will help everyone involved in the sector make better decisions,' she added. \nLamudi Ghana has more than 8,000 listings catering to house hunters and consumers of real estate. The company also undertakes research and provides it free of charge to the public. \nIn November 2014, the real estate expert released a white paper report on the real estate industry in Ghana which was made available online. \nLaunched in 2013, Lamudi is a global property portal focusing exclusively on emerging markets. The fast-growing platform is currently available in 32 countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, with more than 900,000 real estate listings across its global network. \nThe leading real estate marketplace offers sellers, buyers, landlords and renters a secure and easy-to-use platform to find or list properties online. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T12:22:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
