This is up from 32pc a year ago. \nThe rise means current accounts have become the new favourite target for fraudsters since Experian first started collating the data eight years ago. \nFraudulent mortgage applications, where individuals falsely inflate their income, had been the most common fraud, now been pushed into second place with 83 out of every 10,000 home loan applications deemed fraudulent, slightly up from 82 in 10,000 year-on-year. \nAccording to Experian the current account trend has emerged as criminals continue to probe for weaknesses in the seven day switching system, set to make it to encourage customers to move to better accounts. \nAs well as offering a quick win for fraudsters withdrawing overdraft facilities, current accounts can also offer criminals a stepping stone to apply for a wider range of financial products using stolen details, the firm said. \nNick Mothershaw, UK and Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) director of identity and fraud at Experian, said: “It is important for people to take measures to ensure their details remain their own. Knowing what your bank can and cannot ask you for will help you avoid phishing scams. Making sure sensitive mail is shredded is also important. Keeping an eye on your credit report can help you spot any suspicious activity.” \n• 'Fraudsters stole £80k from our bank' \n• Rise in scam texts that aim to steal bank details", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T19:58:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
