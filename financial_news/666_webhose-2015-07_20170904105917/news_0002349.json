Fashion trends come and go, but financial stability never goes out of style. You can look good without compromising your savings account if you learn how to be a savvy, budget-minded shopper. 2. \"Don't tell me what you value, show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value.\"— Joe Biden \nJoe Biden isn't one to bite his tongue — and with regards to why some people can't get ahead, this quote hits the nail on the head. You might say saving for the future and building an emergency fund are important, but if your budget shows you're spending more on entertainment than growing your 401(k) or savings account, you need to adjust your priorities. 3. \"A bargain ain't a bargain unless it's something you need.\"— Anonymous \nWe've all been guilty of buying something we didn't need just because it was on sale. It's easy to justify this bad habit. But in actuality, we're wasting money that could otherwise be put toward a financial goal like growing our savings or paying off debt. Before every impulse buy, ask yourself: Do I need this item? If not, leave it in the store and deposit the money you would have spent into your savings account. 4. \"Saving requires us to not get things now so that we can get bigger ones later.\"— Jean Chatzky \nThe need for instant gratification is real and it gets a lot of people in hot water. People with spending problems unknowingly rob themselves of the opportunity to acquire better things in the future. Think about it. You can't buy a home without a down payment, and you can't save a down payment unless you're willing to curb your spending and make sacrifices. So whenever you feel the urge to spend, think about your future plans and decide whether the purchase is worth delaying your goal. 5. \"Beware of little expenses; a small leak will sink a great ship.\"— Benjamin Franklin \nThis saying perfectly explains the effect seemingly little expenses can have on our personal finances. Tracking your spending might reveal you're wasting money every week on things you don't really need. Spending $2 a day for coffee and $3 for lunch adds up quickly. That's $100 a month or $1,200 a year that could go toward growing your savings. 6. \"Stop buying things you don't need, to impress people you don't even like.\"— Suze Orman \nI absolutely love this quote. Many people won't admit to this behavior, but given how some people go into debt and sacrifice their savings accounts in order to impress others with their bigger homes, nicer cars, and the latest fashions, it's a quote everyone needs to hear. If you feel you have to maintain an elaborate lifestyle to impress a specific group of people, you need new friends. So what if you don't own the best of everything. Learn how to live on less and you'll acquire something a lot of people don't have — a bigger bank account. 7. \"You can be young without money, but you can't be old without it.\"— Tennessee Williams \nThis quote reminds us that the time to plan for retirement is when we're young and have energy to work. Saving when we're younger might mean fewer vacations, cheaper housing, and discount shopping. But it also ensures enough income to live comfortably in our later years when we can't work as much. If you haven't already, explore retirement options. Enroll in your employer's 401(k) plan or open an individual retirement account. 8. \"Save one-third, live on one-third, and give away one-third.\"— Angelina Jolie \nI think it's cool when rich people give savings advice — and it's even cooler when they follow their own advice. Some people don't grasp the benefit of living beneath their means. But if you're able to live on just a fraction of what you earn, you'll have an opportunity to save a greater percentage every month, plus have money available to give back to your community or donate to your favorite charity. Of course, it's easier for rich people to live off a third of their income, but even if you have to adjust the percentage to fit your unique circumstances, this quote is a simple reminder to spend less than you earn. 9. \"Get rich slow, or get poor fast.\"— Anonymous \nI once heard someone say, \"I'm always going to be broke, so what's the point in trying to save.\" Coincidentally, this person is also the first to buy the newest electronic gadgets no matter the cost, and his wardrobe takes up three closets. Just from my observation, if he would put as much energy into saving as he does shopping, he wouldn't be broke. Similarly, you have a choice. You can either commit to saving and allow your money to grow slowly over time, or you can spend everything you earn and have nothing meaningful to show for it. 10. \"If saving money is wrong, I don't want to be right.\"— William Shatner \nSaving money is cool, and don't let anyone tell you differently. Some people might try and derail your savings plan by tempting you to spend outside your budget, or they might snicker because you never shop without a coupon or discount code. This money saying is one of the best because no matter how much we earn, we should never stop looking for bargains. \nHave you heard any cool savings sayings? What money-savvy words do you live by?
