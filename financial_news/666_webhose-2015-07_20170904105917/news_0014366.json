The pick-up in 2016 reflects a recovery from recession in Brazil and Russia, albeit a weak one, while the structural slowdown in China is weighing on global growth potential. Meanwhile, the growth forecasts for Major Advanced Economies are 1.8% in 2015, 2.0% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017. 'In the U.S., growth will rebound after the unexpectedly weak first quarter, bolstered by improving fundamentals and strong confidence,' said Gergely Kiss, Director of Sovereigns. 'The eurozone recovery continues, albeit with weak growth potential compared with other major advanced economies.'
