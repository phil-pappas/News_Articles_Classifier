Growth should speed up to 3.8 percent next year, it said, unchanged from earlier forecasts.\nThe IMF pinned much of the blame for the lower growth forecast on the United States. The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter, hurt by unusually heavy snowfalls, a resurgent dollar and disruptions at West Coast ports.\nThe IMF said it expected the U.S. economy to grow 2.5 percent this year - it lowered the U.S. growth forecast last month from 3.1 percent in April. The IMF also said U.S. economic sluggishness had spilled over to Canada and Mexico.\n\"(But) for the most part, it was a series of accidents ... and the rest of the year should not be very much affected,\" Olivier Blanchard, the IMF's chief economist, said in a press conference.\nThe IMF maintained its forecasts for a pickup in growth in the euro zone, despite Greece moving closer to the edge of default and an exit from the currency bloc as it races to find a last-minute third bailout.\n\"The stress tests of the last 10 days (around events in Greece) reassure us and make us think that if things go badly in Greece ... the rest of the world would probably survive quite well,\" Blanchard said.\nIn developing economies, the IMF said growth had been dampened by lower commodity prices, tighter financial conditions tied to economic rebalancing in China and geopolitical factors.\nChinese stock markets have tumbled by more than 30 percent over the last month, prompting regulators to impose heavy-handed intervention to stem the rout.\nThe IMF said the market crash suggests China could face difficulties as it tries to move from an investment-led economic growth model to one focused on domestic consumption.\nThe Fund also repeated its warning that asset price shifts and financial market volatility could disrupt predictions, though it expects geopolitical tensions tied to Russia and the Middle East to calm down next year.
