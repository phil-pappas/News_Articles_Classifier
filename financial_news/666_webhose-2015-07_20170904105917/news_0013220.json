Michele Mossop Share on twitter by John Stensholt Our favourite billionaire Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest held court at the Boao Forum in Sydney on Thursday.\nNot content with solving global slavery, iron ore and almost every other cause, Forrest has turned his attention to Australia's water problems.\nForrest told an agricultural panel that Australia should be a \"water abundant country â€¦ but you can't see it\" based on the experience he's had at his humble Minderoo station in Western Australia.\nTwiggy's Dad had lost the station to drought but Forrest was able to buy it back as \"fortune dictates, I have managed to scrape together a quid or two\" (last count: just under $2 billion).\nHe then tested his theory that there's a heap of groundwater by putting down a weir and blocking it up. Hey presto, water is now everywhere and the flora and vegetation is going crazy. This man can do anything with a quid or two!\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt"], "published": "2015-07-30T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:09:22.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
