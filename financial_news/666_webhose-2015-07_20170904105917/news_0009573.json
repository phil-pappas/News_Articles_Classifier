It is estimated at $8,000 to $12,000. by Jane O'Sullivan Overseas buyers are already showing strong interest in the sale of Todd Barlin's Oceanic art collection with Theodore Bruce on 17 August.\nThe 311 lots represent only part of Barlin's substantial collection, which draws from Papua New Guinea, West Papua, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. It was a collection that began in the late 1980s, when as a 24-year-old he travelled to New Guinea. Barlin later opened the Oceanic Arts Australia gallery in Paddington in Sydney, and spent several years in the 1990s as Sotheby's Australia's tribal art expert.\nBarlin told Saleroom the art caught his eye on that trip to PNG \"because it's so different from Western art. It's so energetic, colourful. But I think it was actually more the people that excited me because they were so open, so warm, so kind. So it was a combination of both appreciating the art but also the people.\"\nHe is now selling his collection due to illness and he plans to donate some of the proceeds to Australian Indigenous Education Fund. Earlier this year he donated $20,000 to the fund. \"I like to think that a collector can turn the beauty of their collection into an act of love to help others,\" he says.\nA fine, hardwood hair comb from the Fly River area in New Guinea, dating from the early 20th Century, has an estimate of $6,000 to $8,000. Theodore Bruce specialist Jim Elmslie says the declining Australian dollar has contributed to the overseas interest in the sale, but says it's also a time when the global market for Oceanic and tribal art is \"very buoyant\". He points to recent sales of tribal art in London and in Paris, where Sotheby's June sale made $15.4 million.\nBut it's been a different story in Australia. Chris Boylan worked with Barlin for almost a decade before leaving the gallery in 2004 to start his own venture dealing Oceanic art. He says there are a number of dedicated local collectors, but his main clients are overseas. He believes there was a period of about 30 years when Oceanic art disappeared from view, with Aboriginal art taking centre stage at the Australian state and public institutions. \"There's almost a whole generation of Australians who haven't been exposed to Oceanic art,\" he says.\nBoylan says this is slowly changing. Martin Browne, who deals works from Vanuatu alongside running his contemporary art gallery in Sydney, agrees the local audience is starting to expand. He cites the educational efforts of the Oceanic Art Society as well as fresh attention by the museums, \"particularly by the National Gallery of Australia under its terrific curator Crispin Howarth\". Boylan adds Natalie Wilson at the Art Gallery of New South Wales as another key force behind the revival.\nThe Barlin sale takes place shortly after the opening of the National Gallery of Australia's major exhibition of work from Papua New Guinea, Myth + Magic. Whatever publicity boost this may deliver, it's unlikely to rival the sales in Paris. Most works carry estimates under $1000 and are offered without reserve.\n But Elmslie says Barlin had an eye for pieces that were made for use and ceremony, rather than sale, which makes them desirable both as cultural objects and as traditionally crafted works of art.\nHighlights include a group of over 15 war shields from Papua New Guinea and West Papua, which Barlin says carry clan designs unique to each tribe. They carry estimates ranging between $600 and $3000. There is also a New Guinea hair comb with an estimate of $6000 to $8000, and a finely carved Tatanua mask from the early 20th century estimated between $8000 and $12,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T13:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T16:32:35.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
