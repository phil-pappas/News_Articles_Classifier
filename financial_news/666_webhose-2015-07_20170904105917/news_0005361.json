And while many in the market were hoping for a deal, there was a degree of caution about holding large bets in the euro going into the weekend.\n\"If there is a deal struck at the weekend, the upside for the euro is limited given other things going on,\" UBS currency strategist Geoffrey Yu said. \"But if something bad happens, we would see the euro give up some of its gains.\"\nTraders said the upside for the euro was rather limited given the European Central Bank has embarked on a trillion-euro asset buying programme, a policy that is likely to keep the currency on the back foot.\nAlso helping risk sentiment were signs that Chinese equities may have stabilised after a plunge. Shanghai shares rallied for the second straight day on Friday, helped by emergency steps from the government to arrest the dive.\nThe yen retreated, allowing the greenback to rise above 122 yen from a seven-week low of 120.41 set mid-week.\n\"True, the yen is on the defensive. But it still has a long way to go before it reaches the 124 handle, where it was before, reflecting the still-cautious mood in the market,\" Barclays chief Japan FX strategist in Tokyo, Shinichiro Kadota, said.\n\"The China situation is fundamentally larger in scale than Greece. We just might see Greece come to a sort of resolution this weekend. But on the other hand Chinese stocks are up only after drastic government measures, so it is not yet a full 'risk on' by all means.\"\nIn addition to China and Greece, a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on the U.S. economic outlook - due at 1630 GMT - will be a major focal point of the day.\nTraders said any resolution to Greece's debt crisis might give the Fed added confidence to start lifting rates this year.
