Even if the Fed takes until later this year, or even early next, to raise interest rates, it will be doing so while many of its peers are still looking in the opposite direction.\nThe biggest loser among major currency pairs was the Australian dollar, down almost half a percent to $0.7302 and a reflection of the growing bearishness around a number of economies deeply dependent on demand for the commodities they produce.\n\"We expect broad dollar strength against the overall commodity currency complex in developed markets as well as in emerging markets,\" analysts from Barclays said in a note focusing on the outlook for commodities prices and currencies.\n\"Macroeconomic risks, particularly out of China could limit upside demand surprises, supply surprises appear largely to have been on the upside across most commodity markets.\"\nThe Fed's policy statement is due at 1800 GMT, and trading ahead of that could be swayed by Wednesday being the last trading day for settlement before the month's end, traders said.\nThe Aussie on Tuesday set a six-year low of $0.7257.\nThe kiwi rose to as high as $0.6739, its two-week high, following Reserve Bank Governor Wheeler's comments. It last traded at $0.6687, down less than 0.1 percent.
