Josh Robenstone Share on twitter by Ben Potter Former Victorian premier and federal Labor MP John Brumby has a message for treasurer Joe Hockey: \"You think you got heat over tax reform? I got death threats\".\nYes, death threats. Brumby was explaining to a PwC tax seminar on Wednesday that tax reform has always been hard fought.\nHe recounted that as a foot soldier in former federal treasurer Paul Keating's tax reform crusade in the 1980s, he got death threats over the capital gains tax.\nPeople actually rang him up at home and threatened him.\nIt was the only time in his political career that this happened - even though after losing his federal seat he spent the rest of his career in the Victorian branch of the Labor Party with its vicious factional wars.\nIt's a reminder of how bitter those 1980s tax reform battles were.\nThe Liberals never supported capital gains tax, or fringe benefits tax, and every restaurant owner in the country had a noose and gallows waiting for Labor MPs over the FBT.\nHe didn't even mention the pension assets test, which was savagely opposed by the now defunct Melbourne Herald .\n In the 1990s, the Howard government couldn't get federal Labor, or a single Labor state, on side with the GST - even though the states were going to get the dough. Federal Labor had a GST policy of \"rollback\".\nBut when Labor won government in Victoria in 1999 and Brumby became treasurer, \"we implemented it,\" Brumby said.\nThere hasn't been major tax reform since, and there probably won't be if Joe Hockey can't find some of the courage of his predecessors on both sides of politics.\nHockey is paving the road with fine intentions - talking about the risks of over-reliance on income and capital taxes in a region where both are more lightly taxed than in Australia and competition for jobs and capital is intense - but giving himself an escape hatch at every turn.\nHe wants GST reform, but not if the states are not unanimously behind him .\nForget it Joe, it ain't going to happen.\nYou have to fight for your reforms against often bitter opposition, as John Howard, Peter Costello, Paul Keating, Bob Hawke - and even John Hewson - showed.\nSure, the Senate's fringes might not have been as crazy as they are today, or the populace as \"entitled\", but every generation of leaders has crosses to bear.\nHockey just has to shoulder his, and get on with the job.\nBrumby did have some advice for Hockey on a smarter way to tackle the challenge: Get all the protagonists in a room - business, Treasury, states, unions and civil society - away from the media's hot glare, and have a sensible chat and see if there is a bargain to go forward.\nHave that sensitive discussion, find out what the parameters are for a \"grand bargain\" - and then take it to the wider community.\nKeeping it out of the media could be a challenge. But Hockey could hardly do worse than he is right now on tax reform.\nAs economics professor John Freebairn pointed out at the same seminar, boosting productivity is the only card Hockey has to play now to lift the economy out of its post-boom torpor and stay clear of the vanishing revenue vortex that is consuming some Eurozone states.\nAnd tax reform is the ace in Hockey's hand - if only he has the guts and the skill to play it.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/OBenPotter"], "published": "2015-07-16T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:57:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
