Jim Rice by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell A multi-billion dollar question hangs over the government's ASIC Registry sale, with potential buyers in the dark as to how much of the unit's revenue will transfer to the new owner and how much will remain in the government's coffers as tax.\nAs financial services firms, technology companies and infrastructure tyrekickers register interest with the government's adviser Greenhill by 4pm Monday, the groups are calling for more information about what exactly they will be asked to bid for.\nAll bidders know is that they will continue to collect certain tax revenue on behalf of the Commonwealth. As the government's own sale flyer stated, the Registry's fees and charges are predominantly set by regulation and collected as taxes.\nBack of the envelope calculations suggest ASIC Registry collects about $700 million a year. And with an estimated $150 million cost base, it would appear to be operating in super profit territory.\nAFR Graphic What, then, would a normal profit be and how much should be stay with the government as tax?\nEach bidder will have their own answer. Some would like ASIC Registry to retain much of the profit, given their ability to pay more for the unit at auction. Smaller players would like to see proceeds to the government maximised and the sale price minimised.\nThe revenue/tax breakdown is a key piece of information bidders want to see unveiled in the auction's next round; expressions of interest. It will determine ASIC Registry's likely value and the equity required in any one bidding group.\nElsewhere, a big week looms in property with second round bids for the $1 billion-plus GIC portfolio due Thursday. Offshore heavyweights make up all of the final contenders, including Canada's Ivanhoe Cambridge, which has partnered with Macquarie-backed LOGOS Property Group, Warburg Pincus which is bidding with The Redwood Group, Singapore's Ascendas and ARA Asset Management and Blackstone.\n Meanwhile Investa Property Group's auction enters its third week of negotiations. China Investment Corporation is tipped to sign documents for the nearly $2.5 billion office towers portfolio early in the week, while LaSalle Investment Management and Mirvac vy for the management of the broader Investa Property Group. Sources said Mirvac's bid for the platform exceeded $200 million and its local expertise has propelled it into a strong position. LaSalle's figure is understood to be closer to $160 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T00:04:39.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
