But the issues they're worried about may not be what you think. That's the big takeaway from a new Merrill Edge survey , which states that the chief reasons for financial anxiety in retirement may not be guaranteeing adequate income; instead, the root of the uncertainty might primarily be shaving down personal debt and curbing household spending. The positive upside is that 70% of Americans surveyed (1,300 overall) say that \"paying off debt\" and \"spending less\" are the twin paths that lead to an \"ideal retirement.\" It also shows a divergence in attitudes about money and retirement between Americans still working and Americans now in retirement, Merrill edge reports. \"The survey shows a significant difference in the way retirees planned for and perceive their golden years compared to those who are not yet retired and planning for this key life milestone,\" notes Aron Levine, director of preferred banking at Merrill Edge. \"As the financial landscape of retirement becomes more complex with rising healthcare costs and uncertainty around Social Security , survey respondents predict they will be stressed in life after work and recognize they will likely need to rely on their own savings and investments in their golden years.\" It's that complexity of financial issues in retirement that vexes current retirees and has them worried about debt and spending issues . 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T17:26:57.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
