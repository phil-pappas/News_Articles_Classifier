Reuters And this one was no different. Not surprising there was something in it for everyone. For those thinking a September hike is still on the cards the statement made sense, while it did as well for those that favour the first strike to be in December .\nBut for all the talk about looming rate hikes by the Fed, the real question for investors is just how high can it raise them?\nNot very high is the answer: 2 per cent tops.\nIt's hard to see interest rate cycles of the future having the highs and lows, or extremes, they have had in the past.\n That can cause some angst in financial markets as they like it when rates are either going up, or going down, and in large moves. That in turn gives them more scope to make money betting on moves in either direction.\nBut if the future is a low-growth one then it follows that moves in monetary policy won't be as wild.\nIf there were any key takeaways from the latest statement it was the line about \"solid job gains and declining unemployment\".\nA look at the previous statement and the Fed at the time saw \"the pace of job gains picked up while the unemployment rate remained steady\".\nOne other word was added to the Fed's statement: \"some\". The Fed now says it will raise interest rates \"when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 per cent objective over the medium term\".\nThat implies the Fed doesn't need to see that much more improvement in the labour market before it presses the green button.\nThe growth numbers Next Friday economists expect the latest report to show that 218,000 jobs were created and the unemployment rate is tipped to be unchanged at 5.3 per cent. One sticking point perhaps is the low rate of inflation that at just 0.1 per cent is way below the Fed's comfort stage of around 2 per cent. However, the Fed's preferred measure of prices, core inflation excluding volatile food and energy, rose 0.2 per cent in June and 1.8 per cent over the past year.\nFor those that think September is the month they also believe that inflation will rise toward 2 per cent as labour markets continue to tighten. The fall in the oil price over the past year, that has also helped to drive inflation down, will also drop off, while on Barclay's numbers inflation in the US has already begun to firm, rising at a 2.25 per cent annual rate pace so far in 2015.\nIronically the latest growth numbers, that really do show how the US economy is growing, will be released on Thursday night. While the Fed looks to the employment and inflation numbers it might just throw a spanner in the works if this latest set of numbers disappoints.\nRemembering that much of the growth data has been mixed, this time round domestic product in the three months to June should show the US economy grew at 2.5 per cent, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Those economists who favour a September tightening think the growth rate is closer to 3 per cent.\nStill, it's some improvement from the cold snap in the first quarter that showed the economy contracted by 0.2 per cent. Consumer spending, which makes up about 70 per cent of the economy, is forecast to rise 2.7 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:09:37.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
