They now believe that GDP rose by 0.6pc in the period at an annualised rate, higher than the 0.2pc fall pencilled in before. \nFederal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen (Photo: REUTERS/Mike Theiler) \nThe data came as the Federal Reserve mulls raising its key policy rate towards the end of the year. \nA statement released on Wednesday indicated that the strength of economic data would determine whether policymakers opted to increase that rate in September or December. \nJeremy Cook, of currency firm World First, said: \"Failing a disaster in the next few job market reports, you can pencil in that September rate rise now.\" \nFurther revisions to growth data for the years from 2011 to 2014 left the US's performance looking markedly worse, particularly in 2013. \nJames Knightley, of ING, said: \"This may lead some at the Fed to conclude that the US may have marginally more spare capacity than previously thought, which would reduce the need for an imminent rate rise.\" \n\"However, given the fairly strong rhetoric from officials and the focus on the labour data we doubt that it would block a September hike\", he said.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T16:57:43.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
