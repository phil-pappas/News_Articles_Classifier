Pakistan is such a country where the army decides things and, when the army comes into action, then it becomes difficult for the civilian government to stop them,” Shashi Tharoor said.\n“Dialogue is important, but the subject has to be clear. Terrorism is our first priority. If Pakistan is not serious, then what is the benefit of holding talks? There has been no useful cooperation so far,” said Shashi Tharoor told reporters here.\nHe was in the city to address a seminar on ‘Soft Power of India’, organised by FICCI FLO.\nSpeaking at the event, the former Union minister welcomed the Modi government’s initiative to promote Yoga at the international level, but said that “running after a world record” was unwarranted.\nHe also said that the BJP -led government should take a hard stand on such statements by the party’s leader which reflect narrow-mindedness.\n“Some people want to pretend India is a Hindu country, but can India be acknowledged without the poetry of Ghalib, qawwali or cricket?” he asked.\nOn the Lalit Modi controversy and Congress’s demand for the resignation of Union Minister Sushma Swaraj and Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, he said it was extremely unusual that there was no action against the duo.\nUnder UPA rule, leaders were asked to resign over allegations, he said. Tharoor said that the legal process should continue and the issue should not be forgotten.\n 13, 2015 9:42 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:18:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
