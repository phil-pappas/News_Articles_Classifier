Failure to reach a deal would increase the likelihood of Greece leaving the single currency.\nThe Euro STOXX 50 index of euro zone blue-chip shares rose 0.2 percent after falling 2.2 percent on Monday. Germany's DAX index rose 0.3 percent while Italy's FTSE MIB was up 1.4 percent.\n\"The rest of Europe is ring fenced from what's going on in Greece. We would see further volatility with a Grexit, but not as severe as we saw in the past,\" said James Butterfill, global equity strategist at Coutts.\nYields on German debt, which fell on Monday as investors sought the low-risk asset, dropped further. Ten-year yields fell 4.8 basis points to 0.73 percent.\nHowever, yields on government bonds from Italy, Spain and Portugal, the countries seen as most vulnerable to contagion from Greece, also fell.\nItalian 10-year yields, which rose on Monday, were down 3.3 bps at 2.34 percent.\nGerman Bund futures opened up sharply after the ECB on Monday raised the discount it charges on collateral that Greek banks must present in exchange for funds. Sources said the move was largely symbolic as the amount Greek banks can borrow is capped.\n\"It is difficult to say whether this soft reaction is because the market is not too concerned about Grexit now or whether the headlines over the course of the day have led the market to believe that a deal will be forthcoming eventually,\" said RBC strategist Peter Schaffrik.\nThe euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.1005 but held well above Monday's low of $1.0967. The dollar rose 0.4 percent against a basket of currencies.\nMany asset managers believe a Greek exit from the euro can still be avoided while others say the ECB would step in to limit contagion.\n\"It is a drift lower for the euro with things likely to get interesting if it drops below $1.0970,\" said Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets. \"The markets are reasonably relaxed at this stage because they believe the ECB will step in to take action to contain any contagion, should Greece step out of the union.\"\nCHINA FALLING\nEarlier, Asian shares drooped after further losses in China despite the authorities there unveiling a series of measures at the weekend intended to halt a slide of almost 30 percent since mid-June.\nChina's CSI 300 index of the biggest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen closed down 1.8 percent, having fallen more than 5 percent earlier in the day.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.5 percent, though Japan's Nikkei rose 1.3 percent after a sharp fall on Monday.\nOil prices rose. Brent crude, which fell more than 6 percent on Monday, rose 53 cents a barrel to $57.07, though analysts said the outlook remained weak.\n\"Macroeconomic headwinds are rising - be it in the form of the collapse in the Chinese stock market, Greece's potential exit from the euro zone or a stronger dollar. So downside risk to Brent flat price persists,\" Energy Aspects said on Tuesday.\nGold, which has failed to attract much of a safe-haven bid in the latest flare-up over Greece, dipped to $1,168.15 and ounce.
