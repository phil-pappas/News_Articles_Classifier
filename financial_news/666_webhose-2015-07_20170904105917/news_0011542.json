Investments by FPIs in mutual funds fall under the corporate bond limit of USD 51 billion.\n\n\"We are, however, reviewing the regulation to ensure greater clarity in this area and that there is no room for any ambiguity.\"\n\nAccording to the market experts, the issue is mainly about the regulations being silent on whether an foreign investor can use the foreign subsidiary of a domestic mutual fund for investments in the debt instruments.\n\nForeign portfolio investors throng to the domestic debt market due to higher rates being offered by the Indian papers which is 7-8 per cent, while the pricing on similar papers offered in the US and the other developed markets is less than 2 per cent.\n\nFPI inflows into the domestic mutual fund industry touched USD 6.4 billion as on June 15. This was USD 16.2 billion in fiscal 2015, according to a Kotak Equities report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T16:50:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
