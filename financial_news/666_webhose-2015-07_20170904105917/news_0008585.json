A K+S spokesman declined to comment.\nLawmakers in Hesse, the state where K+S is based, last week voiced their support for K+S staying independent and keeping its headquarters in the city of Kassel. The Canadian company has said its offer isn’t predicated on closing mines, curtailing production, selling the German company’s salt business or cutting jobs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T20:32:38.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
