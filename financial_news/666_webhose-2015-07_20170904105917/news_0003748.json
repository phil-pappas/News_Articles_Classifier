President Obama's Iran nuclear deal . Ferguson, MO , and Baltimore, MD protests and damage. The Supreme Court's gay marriage ruling . The Boy Scouts of America's decision to allow gay adults to be Boy Scout leaders . \nWhat do all these things have in common? Two things: 1.) You found out about them almost the instant they happened. And 2.) if the media companies were successful, you became either elated our outraged by them. \nAs an ex-newspaper publisher who worked for some of the world's largest media chains and outlets ( ABC TV , McClatchy , etc.), even I am amazed at the rapid evolution of media in the last 15 years. In that short time span, the public demand for media has gone from in-depth analysis to instant gratification. \nBut the cost of media content of frankly questionable value is staggering. And most of you are willingly paying the price. \nPAST: Events would occur, and newsrooms in both newspaper and TV offices would dispatch reporters to gather facts. These reporters would return after their fact gathering, write/prepare their summary in consumer-digestible fashion, run it past an executive editor, then it would publish or air. \nTODAY: Events occur, a \"reporter\" finds out about it most likely from another reporter, then publishes it within minutes, sometimes seconds, on the Internet. \nWith this draconian shift in content delivery caused by rapidly-changing technology, media outlets are struggling to find a business model that will enable them to continue to produce reliable news without losing money. Most outlets are paying an unbelievable price and still failing. But the biggest price is being paid by each of us, and by our employers. \nConsider this: The average employee today checks his/her email 36 times per hour Each email interruption takes about 16 minutes to recover from and regain focus on whatever task was interrupted. In 2007, workers age 20-29 reported wasting an average of 2.1 hours per day , most of which was on media consumption. Workers 40-49 averaged 1.4 hours wasted time per day. In 2013, 61% of all workers in the United States report spending at least 1 hour per week surfing non-work-related websites. That figure is likely dramatically higher. \nBy anyone's definition, this is tremendous waste. Conservatively, counting unplanned interruptions, recovery from such interruptions and wasteful media consumption, American workers are likely wasting nearly 50% of their work time on things that don't benefit the employer. Billions of dollars wasted. \nIf there is anything even more wasteful, however, it's in the fact that likely this media consumption is benefiting no one in particular, especially not the consumer. If we added the amount of time we waste at work per week (say conservatively 5 hours), along with another 4 hours per day at home, that adds up to 33 hours per week spent checking Facebook, Instagram, the latest \"Breaking News Bulletin\" from a media outlet anxious only for your attention. \nIf you have a masters degree and wanted a Ph.D., the average time to achieve that Ph.D., including class and study time, is 3,600 hours. At 33 hours per week, you could have your Ph.D. in a little over 2 years! \nSo the next time you decide to \"chill\" with your favorite media producer, ask yourself whether this is in your best interest, or your employer's best interest. As someone who now consults regularly with small businesses to identify, and eliminate, waste, your humble author can promise you that he will be asking that question!
