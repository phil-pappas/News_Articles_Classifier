Share on twitter by Sue Mitchell Private equiteer Mike Hill, known to strike a hard bargain as a partner at Ironbridge Capital, has no qualms paying $37 million for a loss-making New-York-based digital marketplace with less than $4 million in sales.\nShareholders of INT, a former IT services company controlled by Mr Hill and former Goldman Sachs equity capital markets boss Mike Everett, have overwhelmingly approved the acquisition of AHALife , which sells upmarket goods such as hippotamus-head stapler removers, nude backgammon sets and skull-shaped bottle openers on behalf of more than 2500 designers.\nINT has issued about $37 million worth of shares and options to AHALife shareholders, including founder and chief executive Shauna Mei, and shareholders have approved a fully underwritten $19.9 million capital raising to fund growth through customer acquisition strategies.\nAfter the backdoor listing, AHALife will have a market value of between $65 million and $70 million, representing 20 times 2014 revenue. The multiple looks steep compared with global marketplaces such as Etsy, which is worth $US1.48 billion ($1.98 billion), or 7.5 times 2014 revenue, or Japan's Rakuten, which has a market cap of $US24 billion, or 4.2 times annual revenue and is a shareholder in AHALife.\nExamples of AHALife's product from the prospectus. However, Mr Hill says the valuation reflects the strong growth potential of AHALife, which boasts a team of high-profile backers and advisers including wellness guru Deepak Chopra, former Saks Fifth Avenue chief executive Steve Sadove, former LVMH chairman Renaud Dutreil, and venture capitalist Jon Teo.\n\"It's all about growth and customer acquisition,\" Mr Hill, INT's chairman, said. \"It takes a lot of time and effort to build up the brand, bring in brands that want to trade from all over the world, then build the platform.\n\"Shauna has created a marketplace at the affordable luxury end of the market ... and she's avoided all the things you should avoid and don't want, like returns and holding stock in a warehouse,\" he said.\nDrop-ship model AHALife connects designers and artisans in 45 countries with about 330,000 registered customers around the world, clipping the ticket by 50 per cent and operating a drop-ship model to avoid holding inventory.\nThe company, founded five years ago by Ms Mei, an MIT engineer and former Goldman Sachs analyst, has a team of high-profile curators, including Wendy Deng, Lauren Bush and New York Fashion Week founder Fern Mallis, who help select the brands sold on the site.\nAHALife reported losses of $US5.7 million in 2014 on sales of $US2.6 million, after burning through $US350,000 a month. But Mr Hill said the annual sales run-rate was closer to $7 million, based on fourth-quarter sales, and he expected AHALife to break even when sales reached $20 million.\nAHALife is one of almost a dozen US-based technology stocks seeking to list in Australia through backdoor listings or initial public offers, taking advantage of strong investor appetite for early-stage-growth companies and easier listing requirements.\nOnline recruitment platform 1-Page listed on the ASX in 2014, online interior design business Whole New Home plans a reverse listing through Magnolia Resources later in 2015, and New York-based media company VFiles is also preparing an Australian IPO.\n\"I first heard about the ASX through a friend from 1-Page ... My first reaction was why would anyone list on the other side of the world?\" Ms Mei said.\nAfter being introduced to Mr Hill and Mr Everett through contacts at Goldman Sachs, Ms Mei realised that an ASX listing could help the company achieve its growth ambitions, after raising $US23 million from angel investors and venture capital investors over the past few years.\n'Really nice bridge' \"On NASDAQ our company could get lost but this could be a really nice bridge,\" she said. \"If this had come up even a year ago it would have been too early. We're right at the stage now where sales are growing, we have a very efficient model with no inventory and good margins and we feel that we are at that stage where in the near future we will be able to bring value to shareholders.\"\nEddie Grieve, ASX senior manager listings and issuer services, said it was prohibitive to list a company worth less than $US500 million on NASDAQ.\n\"The US markets just aren't open to companies of that size ... Our requirements cater for companies quite small and companies at an early stage of development,\" Mr Grieve said.\n\"Often they are companies that have strong founders and entrepreneurs who have established a business but after a couple of rounds of funding they get diluted and ultimately lose control,\" he said.\nMs Mei and AHALife's existing shareholders will emerge with 60 per cent of the company after the 45Â¢-a-share capital raising, which is underwritten by Blue Ocean Equities and closes on Wednesday.\nThe ASX has no concerns about disclosure or corporate governance, saying the US-based companies are incorporated in Australia and subject to the same continuous disclosure requirements as Australian-based companies.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/suemitchellafr", "http://www.ahalife.com/"], "published": "2015-07-07T11:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:11:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
