Asia-Pacific represented 25 per cent of the banks in the survey.\nDespite the spending, the level of global preparedness for meeting new rules was wanting. About 40 per cent of respondents indicated they were not \"well prepared\".\nAs a stark warning to smaller banks coming up against the international effort to normalise financial oversight, 71 per cent said smaller institutions would \"fail to keep pace with these new market drivers\".\nStricter, further-reaching rules may seem like a one-way street for banks that is set to limit the scope of business and curtail their share of the global financial industry.\nAfter all, 75 per cent of respondents said they foresaw most trading activity in the industry moving outside the formal banking industry to hedge funds and asset management firms.\nSome 62 per cent said they would reduce product offerings over the next two years and nearly half said they would home in on their core competencies, indicating that they would not expand businesses into new areas.\nBut one key takeaway from the Accenture report was that banks struggling to keep abreast of the flood of new rules had lost sight of potential value the process was set to unlock.\n\"Their plans still appear focused on meeting regulatory demands alone, rather than accounting for the more strategic implications of structural reform,\" the report said.\nThe competitive advantages for early movers are vast.\nFor example, Accenture says banks should think local, not global, based on rules specific to each jurisdiction.\nThat runs counter to the global banking model before the 2008 financial crisis, where banks attempted to apply a one-size-fits-all framework across different markets.\nThis article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as Banks come up short in following new rules", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T17:58:32.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
