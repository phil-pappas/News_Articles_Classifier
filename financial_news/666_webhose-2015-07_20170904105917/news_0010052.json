These events were not simply beauty parades but resulted in a small but significant number of deals. \nThe Angel Fair Accra will take place after the Africa Technology Summit (3-4 November) on 5 November. The event is being produced in partnership with the Ghana Angel Investor Network. This is sponsored by the Venture capital Trust Fund which is a Government sponsored entity that acts as a fund of funds. \nThe majority of the Ghanaian angels investing are either CEOs or entrepreneurs with their own businesses. The format of the event is 10 entrepreneurs pitching to 40 angels or if there are more than 20 attendees, it will be held over 2 days. \nThe event is not just focused on Ghana but also start-ups selected out of events including DEMO Africa, Pivot and Seedstar. These events select from the best of available start-ups from Africa's accelerators and incubators. In effect, it's pre-selection and you're getting the best of the best. \nEric Osiakwan will shortly launch Chanzo Capital to attract investment for start-ups:\"The idea is to build on our existing experience of already investing and to look for people who want to invest through me and also to access third party capital\". \nSo what are three interesting start-ups Osiakwan would pick from the emerging Ghanaian start-up scene:\" I'd pick the following... \nFarmerline which improves information access and communication channels for smallholder farmers and agricultural workers. I find them fascinating because they are applying innovative mobile web technology to improve agriculture outcomes. \nSiqueries which helps you analyse and understand your data for improved decision making. They're interesting because they have made Business Intelligence so simple and easy for SMEs to improve their performance. \neCampus is an online learning platform that provides interactive educational materials (past questions, podcast, video lectures, ebooks, games) for free. They're fascinating because their online learning platform is an interactive mobile web app\". \nIn addition to the Accra event, African Business Angel Network is holding a series of Angel Investor Bootcamp events in key markets.
