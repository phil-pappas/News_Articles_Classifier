Photo: Glenn Hunt\nTelstra pulled another customer retention trick from its sleeve this week with the launch of Telstra TV, which will sweeten its media offer by giving customers the opportunity to easily stream the super-fashionable new video services Netflix, Stan and Presto.\nIt's the latest in a long list of bells and whistles Telstra is offering fixed and mobile customers that leverage the company's networks.\nTelstra doesn't deny that the new media offering might cannibalise customers that already access its half-owned Foxtel, but the plan is that those prepared to pay the price of a pay TV subscription and get all that sport will not switch, and that the 70 per cent of Australians that don't get pay TV might be lured by the cheaper streaming services, or at least the new service might make existing customers more sticky.\nAnd for companies that dominate market share – like Telstra, which has 51 per cent of retail mobile subscribers – retention is a pretty good outcome.\nThere are plenty of smaller competitors looking to pick up the customer crumbs across fixed and mobile.\nSo here is a quick quiz: who is the fourth largest independent mobile service provider in Australia after Telstra, Optus and Vodafone?\nAmazing that so many won't know the answer – which is amaysim Australia.\nIt is to the mobile phone world what Tigerair is to the airline industry. It's the ultimate in no-frills mobile – you buy your own phone/tablet online and data/voice packages at discounted prices and without contracts.\nAmaysim is a low-cost virtual operator that uses the Optus 3G and 4G network.\nKeen watchers of the stockmarket might be aware of the emergence and growth of amaysim, which did a public listing a few weeks ago in the middle of the perfect equities storm as the Greek bailout was in jeopardy and the Chinese stockmarket was in freefall.\nThis is not a free advertisement for the no-frills junior of the sector, which is chaired by former Metcash boss Andrew Reitzer. There are clearly risks to investing in relative newcomers to the industry.\nBut it is interesting that this provider has managed to snare more than 700,000 subscribers and estimates it will boost this number to more than 1 million in three years.\nAnd it will do so against the backdrop of some fierce price competition among the three market leaders, engaged in war for customers.\nThese full network operators have been spending up to boost the service of their networks and improve the value of their data packages.\nAfter four years under private equity ownership, amaysim is expected to report earnings before interest and tax of $12.9 million in 2015, which according to estimates from Macquarie (which was a co-sponsor of the float with Goldman Sachs) should increase to more than $28 million next year.\nRevenues are anticipated to grow from $213 million to $354 million by 2018, based on reaching the number of subscribers outlined above.\nThe appeal of amaysim and others that occupy that space is that the low-operating-cost model can translate into keeping prices at a level that appeals to customers that just want cheap calls and data and don't need too much more.\nAnd for many it will be a second service.\nWhile the rate of growth will presumably ease off as the company matures, it is clearly moving towards increasing its market share from the current 2 per cent.\nAmaysim is one of several players, albeit the fastest growing, in what is called the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) sector. The MVNO market has grown from having 4.5 per cent of the mobile market in 2010 to double that in 2014.\nHuman cost of performance reviews It's encouraging to see the start of a snowball effect among large companies in Australia that are now recognising the damaging human cost of the traditional staff performance review.\nPress releases from corporates announcing a rethink on performance reviews have been popping up like mushrooms over the past week since one of the world's largest companies, Accenture, kicked off the latest wave of review reviewing.\nDeloitte in Australia jumped on board a few days back and one could almost hear the howls of delight from its 1500 employees.\nEven Fairfax Media boss Greg Hywood announced this week he would relieve the staff of the annual drudgery of the performance review, opting instead for more regular and informal communication between managers and those reporting to them.\nNational Australia Bank chief executive Andrew Thorburn summed it up nicely this week, saying that \"in big companies you can build up complexities and processes which like Chinese whispers end up nothing like you really need\".\nIt seems some chief executives have become alert to the fact that the yearly ranking of staff does more harm than any good it produces.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:15:39.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
