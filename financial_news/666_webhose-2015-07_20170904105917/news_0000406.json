Photo: Simon O'Dwyer\nMr Gurner said the new building's proposed design would echo Spanish mansion architecture.\nThe deal will guarantee the survival of the club and see it continue in facilities on the ground floor where it will also run a Spanish bar and restaurant, he said.\nClub president Margarita Ros said falling membership had precipitated the decision.\n\"Unfortunately in recent years the club's operations had become unsustainable due to falling membership numbers so we were faced with the prospect of either closing our doors – which would have a devastating impact on the Spanish and wider community – or thinking outside the box to work in partnership with a developer,\" she said.\nThe club founded the annual Johnston Street Festival which shuts down the street for a day.\nOther migrant social clubs in Melbourne are also struggling.\nThe historic Celtic Club, Australia's oldest Irish club, on the corner of Queen and La Trobe streets has a chequered history of attempting to resolve similar financial troubles.\nIt initially inked a development deal with Buildcorp for its heritage-listed building but failed to get members' approval and instead moved to quietly sell the site for a speculated $25 million before that too fell over, leaving the club in limbo.\nMr Gurner's development group is responsible for several projects near the Spanish club, including apartments in the historic Foy and Gibson factory at 107 Cambridge Street, more at 28 Stanley Street and the Oxley, Little Ox and Bellini developments.\nAll three towers in Gurner's Fortitude Valley development in Brisbane have sold. The first two towers with 650 apartments are under construction.\nThe group is expecting to settle on another two sites in Brisbane for 500 apartments and will launch an upmarket development in South Melbourne within the next two months, Mr Gurner said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T05:42:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
