AFP by Jonathan Shapiro Exchange traded funds have rightly been labelled one of the greatest innovations in the funds management industry. In Australia they're finally beginning to catch on, in a system that was never set up to aid their growth.\nAt $18 billion, tripling in three years, the pace of growth is impressive. But considering the $600 billion of self-managed superannuation fund money looking for simple investments, the market seems smaller than it should be. And compared to other parts of the world, it is again a mystery as to why ETF funds aren't larger.\nCanada, with an economy one-fifth bigger than Australia's, has more than 350 ETFs totalling $US65 billion ($85.37 billion). The value of ETFs traded each month on the Toronto Stock Exchange averages $US120 billion, compared with $US56 billion traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. ETFs account for less than 1 per cent of trading activity in Australia, compared with 10 per cent in the US.\nThere's a good explanation as to why ETFs aren't dominating in Australia like they do elsewhere.\nUnlike stockmarket floats, managed funds or other financial products, there tend to be no financial middlemen, such as brokers, in the ETF market. With fewer incentives to sell products to clients, there is also less of a reason to cover ETFs in the same way brokers track stocks with detailed research and trade recommendations.\nThat's beginning to change. More ETF providers offer extensive information to research houses such as Lonsec, Zenith and Morningstar. They are meeting a small but rising demand for information among their users, mainly financial planners, to understand and compare ETFs better.\nGrowing ecosystem Betashares managing director Alex Vynokur, an issuer of ETFs, says he's encouraged by this growing ecosystem around ETFs but says there's still not enough independent research available to individual investors.\n That one in every two dollars invested in an ETF is from a self-managed super fund suggests that a large part of the retail market isn't receiving direct research.\nLast week Stockspot, the low-cost, technology-driven financial planning tool, released a report on ETFs, which founder Chris Brycki said was downloaded extensively. That proved to him that there was demand out there to understand the product better.\nThe report shows how investors are using ETFs â€“ suggesting most of the growth is coming from investors seeking low-cost exposure to international stocks. Of the 17 new funds listed over the year, 13 were international share funds, which meant this sector became the largest component of the Australian ETF universe.\nThe bulk of the report graded ETFs based on five qualities: fees, slippage (or the cost of getting in and out of an ETF), liquidity, the size of the ETF, and counter-party risk, or the exposure to the issuer of the ETF and the risk that it carries.\nThe big end of town is also dragging its feet into ETF land. A handful of forward-looking stockbrokers have attempted to seize first-mover advantage and offer detailed research to their clients. They could not comment publicly on their work but stockbrokers argued that ETFs were not detrimental to the traditional broking business. Investors' assumption that because ETFs are largely passive investments little research is required is also a wrong one. Future growth of the industry will require a marketing push and the provision of quality research.\nNeed information Looking under the bonnet of these securities to understand the levers of returns and the underlying exposure will prove valuable for investors. Also the rise of \"strategic\" or \"smart\" beta ETFs that use a system to offer a return that is different to the index shows that these securities are drifting away from their purely passive heritage. As they do so, prospective investors will need information to understand the factors that will drive their ETF. Investors will also require research to compare ETFs against the obvious alternatives, such as managed funds or listed investment companies.\nMorningstar's Alex Prineas also makes the point that based on research some sectors of the market are better suited to passive ETF investments than others. Small cap fund managers, for example, have shown they beat their index consistently by avoiding bad stocks, which means they generally earn their fees.\nOn the other hand, investing in a property trust or the real estate investment trust sector might be better enacted through a low-cost ETF. As Prineas explains, there are only 20 listed property stocks in the ASX 200 index and with most active funds holding broadly the same stocks relative to the index, there's little value in paying active fund fees to get exposure to the sector.\nAs ETFs inevitably become a core part of investors' portfolios, there will be greater demand to understand, trade and invest in ETFs. It's a fair bet the next generation won't be chatting over the barbecue about their Westpac or Telstra shares, but their Global 100 or China Large Caps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T12:27:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
