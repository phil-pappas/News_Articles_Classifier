The South West Advertiser, a free weekly publication, will also be discontinued. The cuts are the latest in a dramatic overhaul of Fairfax's Australian Community Media business. ACM director John Angilley said all staff will have an opportunity to consult with management about the changes. Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance organiser Katelin McInerney said the union hated seeing local newsrooms suffer. \"We believe that the best way forward for the Fairfax business is to invest in quality local journalism, not cut resources that tell community stories,\" she said. MEAA members will meet next week to \"decide on their response to this announcement\".
