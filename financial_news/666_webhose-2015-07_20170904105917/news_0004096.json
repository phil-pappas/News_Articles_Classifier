Central to the talks has been the nation’s next five-year plan, where a key challenge will be how to deliver on promises to ease state control over the economy.\nWith a 2013 pledge to give a decisive role to markets seen by some investors as tarnished by regulators’ handling of a stock surge and subsequent plunge, Xi’s blueprint could refocus attention on changes to the social and economic landscape for years to come. Among central topics will be the role and structure of state-owned enterprises , oversight of energy prices, and what to do with the current 7 percent growth target.\n“Here lies the credibility of the leadership,” said Zhang Wenkui, a senior researcher at the Development Research Center, a unit of the State Council, or China’s cabinet. The five-year plan “is supposed to make the Chinese Dream happen.”\nXi, who will mark three years as general secretary this autumn, has championed a vision of becoming a “moderately well-off society” by 2020, with gross domestic product and per-capita income levels double those of 2010.\nLagging Reforms While progress has been made in shifting the Chinese economy’s reliance toward the consumer -- and away from exports and heavily polluting industries such as steel -- moves to introduce greater private sector competition and reduce politically driven credit allocation have lagged behind.\n“The Xi leadership needs to move from an era of promises to one of active implementation,” said Kerry Brown, director of the China Studies Centre at the University of Sydney, who previously worked at the British embassy in Beijing. “We are now almost three years into this new era and the honeymoon is long over.”\nA draft of the 2016-2020 plan is complete and the government is seeking comments from local officials and experts, China Business News reported this week. Xi has been at the center of the planning process, holding meetings with party bosses of at least 18 provinces in the past three months, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.\nUrbanization Push Challenges facing the Communist leadership include limiting population growth in some of China’s top-tier cities, such as Beijing, and encouraging rural migrants to focus on smaller locations. Deepening the nation’s social-security system, reforming rural landholdings and giving families of internal migrants access to public services including education and health are other key areas.\nBringing down remaining barriers between China and the international economy, encouraging the upgrading of manufacturing, reforming energy pricing and supporting smaller enterprises are among the points to watch, said Han Meng, a senior researcher at the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.\n“The GDP target can be lower and growth rate slower, around 6.8 percent is likely,” Han also said. That would match the International Monetary Fund’s projection for this year, a pace that would be the weakest since 1990.\nOne option would be to abandon the annual growth target, a move that could allow policy makers to take more risks, according to Levin Zhu, former head of China International Capital Corp.\n“If they can let go the GDP target, we probably can have a more rational, systematic reform” of state-owned enterprises, Zhu said on a panel at a conference in Singapore earlier this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T01:21:18.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
