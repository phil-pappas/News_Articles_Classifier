Reuters Share on twitter by James Chessell Siarkos Dimitris does not hesitate when asked which way he will vote in Sunday's critical referendum on the terms of European bailout deal.\n\"I am voting No. I want us to be an independent country,\" the 44-year-old says. \"I believe the people should decide the future of this country alone, not with others guiding us. I am not afraid of us going out of Europe.\"\nDimitris lost his job in a car importing business in 2010 and has been unable to find work since. He is part of the crowd milling around on a hot Thursday afternoon outside the Greek parliament building in Syntagma Square, which has become a venue for almost-nightly protests about the economic crisis gripping the nation.\nDimitris is not alone in backing the \"Oxi\" campaign. A series of opinion polls published this week suggest the gap between yes and no is so narrow that the result is too close to call.\nPeople are reflected on a building as they take part in a pro-EU demonstration in Iraklio on the island of Crete, Greece. It is five years since Greece accepted its first multibillion-euro bailout package from the 18 other members of the common currency – eurozone – yet the unemployment rate remains above 25 per cent, while public sector wages have been cut by about a third. The bailout came with strings attached in the form of tough reforms to pensions, taxes and public institutions, known as austerity measures, which have proved to be exceedingly unpopular. Whether the Greek recession is the fault of creditors for imposing too much austerity too quickly, or Athens for failing to make genuine economic reform, is a matter of considerable debate. What is clear is that many ordinary Greeks in Syntagma Square have had enough.\n\"I don't want my country to be taxed again and again for the good of some German businessman,\" says 22-year-old Marcus Chouseinis, who earns about €400 ($585) per month working in a coffee shop. \"There will be risks because if you leave the eurozone you leave a big alliance. But if we leave I'm sure the government will go with [US President Barack] Obama or the Russian government with a new alliance.\"\n'Very, very tough' Nearby, a Communist Party rally is under way. Magda Tsakiltsidi, 23, a student who works part-time in her mother's bakery, is taking part. She says the past five years have been \"very, very tough. It is hard to find work. I am looking abroad for opportunities.\"\n Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras stunned the world last weekend when he effectively ended months of fractious negotiations between Athens and its creditors by calling a referendum to decide the economic reforms attached to the latest bailout deal. On a technical level the snap poll is meaningless; the bailout expired on Tuesday at the same time Greece became the first developed nation to default on a payment to the International Monetary Fund. Nor does the complicated 72-word question make mention of Greece's membership of the eurozone.\nBut in reality, the vote is incredibly significant.\nGreece could wave goodbye to the euro, and even the European Union altogether, if voters choose no. A strong showing for the yes camp means Tsipras' ruling left-wing Syriza party – which is backing a no vote – will have to call an election. Not only will the result set the tone for future attempts to solve Greece's debt woes, but it could put the European Project and its goals of stability, unity and prosperity at risk.\n\"It is going to be a very close fight,\" says Miltos Kyrkos, a member of the European Parliament with centrist party To Potami (\"The River\"). Kyrkos initially supported Tsipras when it looked as if a compromise deal could be stuck with Greece's three bailout monitors, the IMF, the European Central Bank and the European Commission. Indeed, both sides were not that far apart in early June before falling out spectacularly over a few key measures such as sales-tax hikes and cuts to Greece's generous pension system. Tsipras has accused the creditors of \"blackmail\", while IMF head Christine Lagarde complained the discussions require \"adults in the room\" .\nBut Kyrkos is now scathing about the PM's decision to call the referendum, arguing Syriza misjudged the resolve of the creditors.\nReferendum 'almost criminal' \"Even if a yes comes out, a new deal would be worse than the one we had. It is almost criminal, this decision,\" says the trained chemical engineer.\n\"For Greece to drift out of the eurozone [with a no vote] would be a disaster. We import 80 per cent of what we consume, we produce almost nothing. The private sector would collapse almost completely.\"\nPro-Europeans such as Kyrkos hope that, faced with a hard choice, Greeks will stick with the euro. The yes camp is fractured and lacks a presence in Athens where \"Oxi\" posters are ubiquitous. But it takes heart from a narrowing in the poll numbers during the week after capital controls were imposed on Greek lenders. With most banks closed and daily withdrawals from ATMs limited to €60, Greeks have been forced to line up for cash every day. Greek news reports have been showing footage of a crowd of pensioners pushing and shoving outside one of the branches that was reopened to allow people without ATM cards to make withdrawals. These scenes will spook some voters. During European parliamentary elections three years ago, Greeks backed anti-austerity parties in a first round of polling but then switched to more EU-friendly MPs in the second when it appeared a \"Grexit\" was possible.\nOutside a shuttered Alpha bank in central Athens, Enri, who did not want to give his full name, complained it was getting to the point where it was impossible to withdraw €60 because some machine were running out of €20 notes. \"It is actually turning into €50 limit,\" he says. \"I would have voted yes anyway, but this kind of trouble makes me know I am doing the right thing.\"\nThe impact of the capital controls go beyond the queues. Away from the bustling politics of Syntagma Square, the streets of the capital are quiet. It feels like a Sunday or public holiday.\n\"Yes it is calm,\" says George Tzogopoulos, a fellow at the Hellenic Foundation for European & Foreign Policy. \"There is not so much traffic on the streets, people want to save money and they prefer to stay home and see what will happen.\"\nTheir patience will be tested in the coming weeks. Syriza claims the banks will reopen after a no vote. But most observers, including Tzogopoulos, believe this is not possible. Greek lenders have survived up to this point because an ECB emergency fund has kept them liquid. The steady stream of withdrawals in the lead-up to the referendum announcement would turn into a full-scale run if the banks were opened the day after a no vote. And the ECB will be unwilling to restart its emergency lifeline unless there is some preliminary agreement about a new financial rescue package.\nSuffering continues At the same time many poor Greeks continue to suffer. While banks have been closed, special clinics have opened. Paris-based humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières, says the Greek health budget has been cut by almost 40 per cent and state funds for medication have halved since the global financial crisis. In October, MSF sent a team to Athens to help mostly unemployed and elderly at soup kitchens with medical consultations and hospital referrals.\nTsipras and many economists argue the widespread poverty in Greece is the fault of eurozone powers led by Germany. European leaders were wrong to allow an under-prepared Greece to join the currency union in the first place more than 14 years ago. And by imposing harsh austerity measures – rather than stimulus – total economic output has shrunk by 25 per cent since 2010. This has made it even more difficult for Athens to manage its debt mountain which now stands at 180 per cent of GDP. Yet it is also impossible to ignore Greece willingly signing up for membership and misleading the other 18 members of the eurozone about the health of its economy until the GFC made these financial problems impossible to conceal.\n\"Given the current situation in Greece, it is difficult not to feel for the people and the country,\" says Perpetual's head of equities, Paul Skamvougeras, whose parents both moved to Australia from Greece. \"Having said that, this is a situation of their own making. Whether the referendum vote is yes or no, there will be a long painful period of adjustment required.\"\nThe dire state of Greece's finances mean that, regardless of the result, both sides will have to return to the negotiating table. The IMF warned on Thursday Greece needs more than €60 billion in economic aid over the next three years, arguing the country should be granted \"comprehensive\" debt relief. Tsipras has previously argued debt relief – which could include write-offs or more relaxed terms – should form part of any bailout deal. Greece's creditors were only prepared to put it up for discussion once Athens agreed to the austerity measures. Resolving this tension will be a key part of future talks.\nThe make-up of the negotiating teams will depend largely on Sunday's result. Dimitris Pefanis, a journalist with Greek news website in.gr , says one scenario could even be a yes vote that results in an another election which leads to a solid turnout for Syriza.\n\"I think we will see Syriza at the negotiating table in some way,\" he says. With no obvious strong opposition leader ready to take the place of Tsipras, Pefanis believes the Greek team could include more technocrats than politicians.\nOne thing is certain. The next twists and turns in the Greek debt crisis will be impossible to predict with any accuracy. \"It's not like before January when governments were mainstream parties and we more or less knew what they would do,\" says Tzogopoulos. \"Now we have a leftist government with unclear ideas and unclear objectives, and that is why I'm afraid I cannot predict. This government had a fresh mandate after January and it failed to renegotiate.\"", "external_links": ["http://in.gr/", "https://twitter.com/jameschessell"], "published": "2015-07-03T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T19:09:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
