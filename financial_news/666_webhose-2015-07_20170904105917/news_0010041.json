Lafley with company veteran David Taylor in a widely expected appointment that could be announced as soon as Thursday, the Wall Street journal reported. \nThe move by P&G, the world's largest household products maker, is pending a board meeting scheduled for Tuesday, the WSJ said, citing a person familiar with the matter. \nThe decision coincides with a massive overhaul of the company, which is struggling with sluggish sales due to \"choppy\" growth in developed markets, tough competition and a strengthening U.S. dollar. \nThe company has been streamlining its business, and earlier this month announced plans to sell off more than 40 brands to perfume maker Coty Inc (COTY.N) for $12.5 billion, as it looks to narrow its focus on fewer, faster-growing brands such as Tide and Gillette. \nTaylor has been the group president of the company's global health & grooming business since 2013. In January his role was expanded to include P&G's ailing beauty business. \nLafley, who returned to take over as CEO of the consumer goods giant in 2013 after having led the company from 2000-2009, is expected to remain as chairman, the Journal reported. \nTaylor, who joined the company in 1980, has worked in various capacities in his 35-year tenure with the company serving in managerial roles across markets including China and Western Europe. \nP&G declined to comment. \nThe company's shares closed down 0.4 percent at $79.97 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. \n(Reporting by Subrat Patnaik, Siddharth Cavale and Natalie Grover in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Andrew Hay)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T02:32:48.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
