Supplied by Tony Davis Making a two-door out of a limousine is not always an elegant business – and doesn't necessarily make sense.\nYou can end up with a two-tonne, five-metre-plus vehicle with minimal rear seating, often with awkward proportions.\nBenz has certainly been guilty on that score.\nThis time around, the company has decided it needs to do something very different – or not bother. There are simply too many other options around, including its own sporty CLS range.\nTo these eyes at least, it has been worth the extra effort and expense. The company has produced the most attractive Benz luxury coupe yet, one that looks and feels taut and athletic.\nIt is vastly different from the standard wheelbase S sedan on which it is based, and appears considerably smaller, despite being only a smidgen so (there's only 89 millimetres difference in overall length).\nIt's still a two-plus-two, seating-wise – if the front passengers are anything above average height. There are many of the usual coupe compromises, including big doors and difficult rear access.\nBut, let's face it, most of the time it's probably going to be driven to the head office and back home with one occupant, so rear access may not be a big consideration.\n Leans into corners The styling isn't the only selling feature.\nThis car doesn't just ride flat through corners like any other good car with adaptive suspension. It leans into them, like an athlete or skier, or pretty well any animal running at speed.\nThis is a trick that Lotus showed off in the 1980s to great fanfare, though the British maker never managed to bring it to production. So it is that, 30 years later, Benz can claim the first application of such a system on a four-wheeled production car (I say \"four-wheeled\" in case pedants point out the obscure three-wheeled Dutch Carver, which also leaned into corners).\nA motorcycle may provide another analogy for Benz' leaning coupe, but you are not going to rub your knees on the bitumen: Benz says the angle at the most extreme is only 2.5 per cent.\nIt's still noticeable and, when at the limit, even a small shifting of the weight can make a marked difference to grip and controllability. The main purpose here though, Benz says, is to aid comfort by reducing lateral acceleration on passengers.\nThe system is a further development of the science fiction-like Magic Body Control, which uses a stereo camera to survey the road ahead and pre-emptively adjust the suspension to best cope with the circumstances.\nOn the S63 AMG, this camera – plus a lateral acceleration sensor – determines when to make the car lean (as well as when to adjust the damper rates for potholes). The leaning function is active between 30 and 180 km/h.\nExperiencing this isn't going to come cheap, a fact exacerbated by the decision to sell only the premium AMG version on this market (at this stage).\nNew look, new-old name The price starts at $409,000. With the new look is a new-old name. It's a return to using S-Class nomenclature, after years of Benz calling its biggest two-door the \"CL Coupe\".\nIn keeping with the AMG badge, there is a heavily worked Benz-based engine, signed off by the technician responsible for hand assembling it.\nThe 5461cc – let's call it 5.5 litre – twin turbo V8 puts out maximum figures of 430 kW and 900 Nm. It is connected to a seven-speed sport-oriented auto transmission with manual override.\nThe sprint to 100 km/h takes 4.3 seconds. In left-hand drive markets only, there is a 4Matic all-wheel drive version that can get there in 3.9 seconds, thanks solely to its better traction (the engine is the same).\nThe car makers are still engaged in the perennial arms race, and each new entrant needs to boast more firepower. Therefore the power, the speed and the grip of even the rear-drive S Coupe are something to behold.\nThat said, there were times I would have been happy with a little less hot-rod in this car. A Grand Tourer doesn't necessarily need to be quite so extreme, particularly in a country like this, where exceeding the low 100s on public roads can be rare.\nIt's not the sort of thing you are likely to take to a racetrack.\nAt low speeds particularly, the AMG can be a little rough and rorty.\nInterior offers 'the works' The interior is as striking as the exterior: noticeably different to the sedan, and with all the leather-lined plushness and spectacular lighting you'd expect for the price tag. There are heated massage seats and, generally, the works.\nThe Telematics and Burmester sound system are sensationally good, as are all the usual Benz safety and security systems, almost all of which are standard equipment in the so-called Edition 1 version we drove.\nBenz offers an Edition 1 pack (at $13,500 on this car) with new models for the first year. Here it includes night vision, various convenience and cosmetic aspects, upgraded leather and diamonds in its eyes. Or, to be more literal, 47 Swarovski crystals in each headlight.\nThe heads-up display, alas, turned out to be a $2300 option but works so well it would be a shame to not tick the box. Ironically, though, when it's fitted you tend to rarely look down at the conventional instrument panel, which is where the night vision display is found.\nIt is fun to watch people light up in red on the screen when there is a possibility they might cross your path, but you tend to only see this happen when you are looking down. Ideally the warning should be projected as part of the heads-up display.\nFlaws? In an otherwise near-perfectly executed vehicle, the fuel flap cover protruded at the top and I kept checking if it was shut properly.\nThe flap turned out to be a flimsy plastic moulding, which is a less pleasing side of the near-universal drive to save weight.\nPerhaps this one had distorted since fitting, maybe it had been repaired or could be adjusted, maybe I'm fishing for a non-subjective failing in such a formidable machine.\nBut, hey, when you take your order, it's worth checking.\nFACT BOX Model: Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG Coupe\nPrice (excluding on road costs): $409,000 (as tested: $425,600)\nEngine: 5.5-litre twin turbo V8 (petrol)\nPower/torque: 430 kW/900 Nm\nFuel economy (combined cycle): 10.1 L/100 km\nC02: 237 grams per kilometre", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:14:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
