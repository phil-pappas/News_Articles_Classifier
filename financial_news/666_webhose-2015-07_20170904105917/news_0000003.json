European governments have resisted the idea as they negotiate with Athens on further bailout funds.\n\"For Greece to succeed and for any program to fly, a significant debt restructuring should take place,\" Lagarde said.\nIn wide-ranging comments, Lagarde said Ukraine appeared to be making progress in talks with private creditors to restructure its debts.\nShe also said China's policy efforts to fight a plunge in its stock market were unlikely to affect the IMF's decision on whether to include the yuan currency in its special drawing rights basket of currencies.\n\"Is that going to impact our assessment of the drawing rights basket? I don't think so,\" she said. \"We will continue to do the work, and I don't think we'll be unduly derailed by some market variations that we've seen recently.\" (Reporting by Jason Lange and Michael Flaherty ; Editing by Susan Heavey and Dan Grebler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T18:12:54.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
