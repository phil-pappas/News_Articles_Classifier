In terms of shareholder returns, he committed to a distribution of at least 40 per cent of underlying earnings in 2015-16.\nAnalysts at UBS and Deutsche Bank slightly downgraded forward earnings projections but both maintained a buy recommendation on the stock. Their price targets of $2.45 (Deutsche Bank) and $2.30 (UBS) represent a significant premium to the group's recent trading range.\nIt is worth noting South32 hasn't traded above $2.45 since listing on the ASX in May, following the demerger from BHP. Since mid-June the company has traded consistently at less than $2.\nDeutsche Bank said South32 represented \"compelling value\" at current levels, with the broker's positive take on the stock underpinned by its clean balance sheet, positive free cash flow at spot prices and the potential for acquisitions.\n Deutsche also regards South32 as well positioned for the current environment, given its heavy exposure to aluminium/alumina, at 62 per cent of earnings before interest and tax based on UBS estimates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T11:07:27.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
