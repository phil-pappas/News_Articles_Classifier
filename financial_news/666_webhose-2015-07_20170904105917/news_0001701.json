That's the question credit card holders face when it comes time to make a purchase or pay a bill. The ability to earn rewards and defer payment until a later date can make credit cards mighty attractive, but it's important to stop and think before you swipe. \nAlthough credit cards can be beneficial in certain situations, they're not always so great in others, especially when extra fees are involved or you could get a lower interest rate using another form of payment. \nTo help us determine whether using a credit card is a smart form of payment for several different types of bills and purchases, we consulted a variety of personal finance pros. Of course, we urge you to keep in mind that even when using a credit card is deemed beneficial by our experts, it's never wise to charge more than you can actually afford. If you can't pay off your balance in full each month, you can quickly sink into debt.

Many people don't realize that they'll be charged a processing fee of around 2% when they pay their taxes with a credit card. There is also a flat fee of around $3 when you pay your tax bill with a debit card. \nThe fees aren't charged by the IRS, but rather by third-party payment processing companies that the government has contracted to collect credit and debit card payments from taxpayers. The current credit card fees range from 1.87% to 2.35%, depending on which payment processing company you choose to submit your payment through (fees differ slightly when you decide to e-file your taxes). You can find a list of payment processors with information on the fees they currently charge and the types of cards they accept on the IRS website . \nWhile you might not care much about the fee if your tax bill is small, you could be singing a different tune if you're stuck with a large bill. \n\"If you have a $4,000 tax bill, you could end up paying $80 or more upfront to pay with your credit card,\" says Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst for CreditCards.com. \nYour best bet is to pay your tax bill by check or direct deposit rather than plastic. If you're unable to pay off your tax bill in full, consider working out a payment plan with the IRS rather than racking up interest charges on your card. \n\"If you are not financially able to pay your taxes, you may make monthly installments under an installment agreement ,\" says tax attorney David Hryck, a partner at global law firm Reed Smith. \"You can apply for an installment agreement online, over the phone or via various IRS forms.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T16:43:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
