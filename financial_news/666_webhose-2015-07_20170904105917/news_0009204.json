Reuters by Brian Toohey It's not easy to know who or what is left or right wing any more. A nominally communist government makes a huge financial commitment to propping up share prices in a country where Mao Zedong had banned stock exchanges. Does this new love for share owners make China's leaders left, right or simply foolish for refusing to accept that it's OK for financial markets to go down as well as up?\nBailing out those who lose money is not how capitalism is supposed to work. But the US Federal Reserve, in a move some criticise as \"socialising\" the losses, injected vast sums to stop appallingly mismanaged Wall Street banks going broke in the 2009 global financial crisis.\nIn Europe, reckless banks that made dud loans to feckless Greeks later took a partial haircut. But official agencies offset some of the pressure on the banks by extending more credit to Greece, partly to repay these banks. Although a final resolution remains unclear, the agencies have been trying to reduce their exposure by toughening a belt-tightening program that has already seen the Greek economy shrink by a quarter since 2009.\nOn July 7, the presenter of the ABC's 7.30 program, Leigh Sales described the Greek government's call for a third of its debt to be forgiven as \"a pretty steep ask for the other eurozone nations\". Does this make Sales a heartless right-wing supporter of the creditors, or merely someone offering an opinion that could have benefited from a reference to how Germany's creditors forgave half its debt in 1953?\nWere more time available on 7.30 , economists described as left or right could have appeared in support of debt write-offs. In their view, a common currency prevents economies such as Greece from adjusting to a lack of competitiveness by devaluing instead of piling up unrepayable debt. Others tagged as left or right add to the ideological confusion by wanting the Greeks to repay every last euro.\nLittle illumination The events in China and Greece are not alone in raising complex issues where dubbing polices and protagonists as left- or right-wing provides little illumination. Two local examples illustrate the point. On July 7, the Productivity Commission released a research paper showing that low-paid workers gain little from compulsory contributions to superannuation. Although compulsion reduces these employees' take-home pay, supposedly left-wing unions fervently agree with the fund management industry on the desirability of cutting their members' pre-retirement standard of living.\nOn the same day, Malcolm Turnbull acknowledged in a speech to the Sydney Institute on national security: \"This debate is not an easy left-right divide.\" Turnbull called the 2003 invasion of Iraq a \"tragic error\". Some commentators, who still support the then PM John Howard, treated Turnbull as if he were taking a left-wing position, rather than giving a realistic assessment of the disastrous consequences of an invasion that violated international law and the constraints on the use of force set out in Article I of the ANZUS Treaty.\n Turnbull said the Institute of Public Affairs (often labelled right-wing) has been one of the \"most consistent and cogent critics of our government's legislation on many national security topics\". He said: \"Denouncing those who question the effectiveness of new national security measures as 'friends of terrorists' is as stupid as describing those who advocate them as 'proto-fascists'.\" It is a lesson lost on Coalition members who accuse Labor of \"rolling out the red carpet\" for terrorists.\nTurnbull also differed from [Prime Minister Tony] Abbott and the Foreign Minister Julie Bishop over the threat posed to Australia by the Da'esh terrorist group (also called Islamic State). He said: \"Da'esh is not Hitler's Germany, Tojo's Japan or Stalin's Russia.\" This does not make him left wing, just someone who gives more weight to historic record about how totalitarian ideologies – Soviet communism and fascism – threatened our democratic way of life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T14:51:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
