Ordered in 2011, the first rig was delivered just last month, about a year behind schedule, a delay that analysts say has squeezed Daewoo Ship’s cash position.\n“Delay in delivery means that Daewoo Ship will have to pay for material, labor and other expenses out of its own pocket,” said Park Moo Hyun, an analyst at Hana Daetoo Securities Co. in Seoul. “Cash flow will improve when the rigs are delivered and it gets paid from the customer.”\nShares of Daewoo Ship plunged a record 30 percent Wednesday after Yonhap Infomax reported creditors might consider restructuring the shipyard’s debt amid a projected second-quarter loss of 2 trillion won ($1.74 billion) to 3 trillion won. Shares declined another 6.5 percent Thursday to close at 8,180 won, their lowest level since January 2003.\nNo Work-Out Daewoo Ship shares have fallen 56 percent this year, making it the worst performing stock on the Kospi 200 Index.\nIts bonds fared better Thursday. Yields on the company’s 2018 bonds surged 8.3 percentage points Wednesday but then fell 5.4 percentage points the next day to 7.1 percent, the biggest decline since the debt was issued in March, according to Korea Exchange prices.\nKorea Development Bank, Daewoo Ship’s main creditor and biggest shareholder, said in a statement Wednesday that it isn’t considering a debt restructuring for now.\n“At present, the company is operating normally and there is no problem with its liquidity,” KDB said.\nCreditor Talks Daewoo Ship said Wednesday it’s discussing with creditors how to improve its financial position. The company had 122.9 billion won in cash and cash equivalents at the end of March, according to its first-quarter 2015 earnings statement, compared to 259.1 billion won a year earlier.\nIn an e-mailed response to Bloomberg, Daewoo Ship said it expects better cash flow next year once some of the offshore projects are delivered.\n“Cash flow will also improve as many of the shipbuilding contracts the company won last year start contributing to earnings in 2016,” the company said.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Sokje Lee said in a research note that Daewoo Ship may have erred in its deal with Songa, but the crisis will ease once the rigs are delivered.\n“We believe these were price-aggressive contracts lacking proper cost estimates,” he wrote July 16. Still, the company’s “fast rising debt should be a temporary issue with concentrated delivery of offshore structures.”\nSome 60 percent to 80 percent of the contract price for those offshore projects are paid on delivery, Lee said.\nStrong Orders The first rig was delivered to Cyprus-based Songa last month and two are expected to be handed over in the second half of this year. The fourth should be completed early in 2016, according to Daewoo Ship. Daewoo Ship has a few other offshore projects -- smaller than the $2.2 billion Songa order -- that also are affecting cash flow.\nAside from the Songa deal, Daewoo Ship has a healthy order book and is a leader in ship design, Lee said.\n“Confidence in the commercial ship unit, even though it could take time, will be critical” to reassure investors and creditors, he wrote.\nDaewoo Ship Chief Executive Officer Jung Sung Leep said last month that earnings won’t be good this year, and that the company will sell units that aren’t involved in the shipbuilding business.\nDebt Ratio Daewoo Ship posted a loss of 138.7 billion won in the first quarter, excluding minority shareholdings, compared with a 75.9 billion won profit a year ago, due to costs from the delays in building Songa’s rigs.\nIf the second-quarter loss reaches about 3 trillion won, Daewoo Ship’s debt ratio would exceed 500 percent. A high debt ratio would make it difficult for Daewoo Ship to raise funds on its own and could put the company at a disadvantage when bidding for orders, Park at Hana Daetoo said.\nKorea Investors Service , a local affiliate of Moody’s Investors Service, and NICE Investors Service both cut their ratings on Daewoo Ship to “A-” and placed the company on negative credit watch. Korea Ratings Corp., a local affiliate of Fitch Ratings, placed its “A” rating on negative review Wednesday.", "external_links": ["https://www.kisrating.com/#\\"], "published": "2015-07-17T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T00:43:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
