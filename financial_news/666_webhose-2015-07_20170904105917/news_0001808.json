Increasing number of government initiatives for automotive and driver safety and security is expected to favor market growth over the forecast period. Automotive sensors detect various vehicle parameters such as heat pressure etc. resulting in occupant safety. Further increasing number of personal commercial and passenger vehicles is anticipated to drive the automotive sensors market.\n \n \nRead Complete Report with TOC @ \n \n \nThe U.S. government has mandated installation of Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) in all vehicles; these systems are capable of determining under-inflated tires. To ensure safety and to reduce medical costs prevention of crashes has become a prime concern among the public which is estimated to further fuel the automotive sensors market. Automotive sensor systems that offer enhanced safety include autonomous braking forward collision avoidance systems adaptive cruise control adaptive headlights lane departure warning blind spot detection parking assistance backup camera reverse sensors and side view assist among other driver assistance systems.\n \n \nFurther key findings from the study suggest: \n \nPhysical property sensors are expected to contribute significantly to market demand over the next seven years. Physical property sensors are used in monitoring moisture temperature pressure etc. Proximity and positioning sensors are increasingly used for accident prevention parking assistance and stability control. Proximity sensors with information displays alert the vehicle driver on vehicles within a given distance. Proximity and positioning sensors are anticipated to contribute considerably to market growth over the next seven years. Chemical and process variable sensors are expected to grow at a significant rate over the forecast period.\n \n \nAutomotive sensors are essentially used for drivetrain emission control engine and passenger safety and security. Engine and drivetrain sensors are used for infuel/air mixture level adjustments air flow monitoring etc. Further they are used in HVAC and magnetic fluid level monitoring. Engine and drivetrain sensors are anticipated to be the key application segment for the automotive sensors market over the next six years. Increasing adoption of strict emission control standards worldwide is anticipated to contribute to emission sensors demand. Some advanced sensors also offer blind spot monitoring automatic braking driver health monitoring closing vehicle detection lane shift monitoring and other facilities.\n \n \nIncreasing consumer awareness is expected to drive market growth in Asia Pacific countries such as India and China. Additionally increasing number of government regulations may drive the market in North America and Europe over the forecast period. Research and development initiatives in Japan may fuel regional market demand.\n \n \nKey contributors to the automotive sensors market are Bosch Ltd. Denso Corporation Murata Manufacturing Co. Ltd. General Electric Sensing Delphi Automotive PLC Freescale Semiconductor Ltd. Agilent Technologies Johnsons Controls Northrop Grumman Analog Devices Inc. Infineon Technologies AG Honeywell international Rockwell Collins and Tyco International etc. Delphi sensors provide chassis systems monitoring. GE Sensors provides lightweight sensors for Formula One racing vehicles. In March 2015 Bosch Ltd. launched SMA130 a small triaxial sensor for application in motor vehicles. The company also manufactures sensors for dynamics control. Murata manufactures sensors for ESC EPB ARC ABS ROV HSA and other purposes.\n \n \nAbout Grand View Research \n \n \nGrand View Research Inc. is a U.S. based market research and consulting company registered in the State of California and headquartered in San Francisco.
