Investors are speculating rates will rise in May, according to forward contracts based on the sterling overnight index average, or Sonia. Less than three weeks ago, they were betting on August 2016. U.K. government bonds declined.\n“The pound is performing well, post the data,” said Neil Jones, head of hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in London. “Some market expectations were that the data could come in lower. That’s the key.”\nThe pound strengthened 0.7 percent to 70.76 pence per euro as of 12:31 p.m. London time, after touching 71.61 pence on Monday, the weakest level since July 13. It climbed 0.2 percent to $1.5596.\nThe U.K. currency has been whipsawed in recent weeks as traders weighed the outlook for a rate increase. It touched its strongest level in 7 1/2 years against the euro on July 17 after BOE Governor Mark Carney said the end of record-low rates was in sight, only to drop the following week as June retail sales unexpectedly declined.\nThe central bank, which today said it appointed Brevan Howard Asset Management economist Gertjan Vlieghe to its Monetary Policy Committee, may raise rates as early as March, according to Mizuho’s Jones.\nBest Performance Read this next: \\r Merlin Plunges as Rollercoaster Crash Causes Profit Slump \\r Drax Earnings Rise 18 Percent as Biomass Offsets Carbon Costs \\r Next Raises Full-Year Outlook as Sales Surpass Expectations \\r U.K. May Debate Legalizing Cannabis as 150,000 Sign Petition \\r Investor confidence that the U.K. will be among the first developed nations to increase borrowing costs has bolstered sterling.

It’s seen strengthening to 69 pence per euro.\nThe growth data “just adds a lot more confidence” about a rise in interest rates around the end of the year,’’ said Simon Derrick, chief markets strategist at Bank of New York Mellon Corp. in London. With a “fairly straight-forward economic story working at its favor, I would expect sterling, along with the dollar, to continue to be favored,” he said.\nThe yield on 10-year gilts added one basis points, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.95 percent.
