It intends to keep the unit, which has 40,000 customers and has offices in London and Birmingham. \nThe bank is listed on the stock markets in Cyprus and Athens, and is looking to move its secondary listing from Athens and to a more liquid market. Given its British operations, a London listing is one option. \nFormer Royal Bank of Scotland executive John Hourican has been Bank of Cyprus’ chief executive for the two years since it was bailed out, and hopes to return it to profit by exiting the struggling parts of the business. \nIt recorded an underlying profit of €31m in 2014, before restructuring costs and the losses incurred on asset sales. That compared with a €359m loss in 2013. \nHowever, Mr Hourican is set to leave the role later this summer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T17:03:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
