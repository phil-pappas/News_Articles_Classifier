My staff are very enthusiastic about this innovation fund and are poised to make it work. \n'We hope that this will mark the beginning of a mutually beneficial relationship. The output of this investment has benefits for society at large'. \nThe partnership also includes an arrangement under which MTN will facilitate a number of internship placements for third-year engineering students for supervised training during the long vacation. \nThe Foundation will support the programme by arranging with relevant partner organizations for placement. \nMTN Foundation The MTN Foundation was established by the MTN Group Board as the vehicle to effectively administer MTN's Corporate Social Responsibility. \nThe MTN Ghana Foundation is funded by a percentage of profit after tax (PAT) from MTN Ghana . \nBy Cephas Larbi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T12:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:01:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
