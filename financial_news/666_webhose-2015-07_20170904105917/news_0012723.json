Expert \nCALGARY – Deeper cuts among oilsands companies are causing more pain in Alberta, as major producers announced reduced spending and more layoffs during second quarter earnings calls Thursday. \nCenovus Energy Inc., which cut 800 jobs earlier this year, announced that it had identified as many as 400 more positions that are “no longer required because of a decrease in work due to the continued low oil price environment,” according to a release. \nOn the company’s earnings call, president and CEO Brian Ferguson said, “It is always difficult when we have to let staff members go,” adding that the company did not come to its decision lightly. \nHowever, the continued fall in oil prices has forced Cenovus executives to focus on reducing its costs and Ferguson said Thursday’s additional job cuts will save the company $100 million annually. \nIt wasn’t the only oilsands producer to announce staff cuts Thursday. Royal Dutch Shell’s Canadian arm confirmed it has laid off 400 people this year, in addition to the roughly 300 jobs the company cut in the oilsands in January. \n“They are reductions that have happened already,” Shell Canada spokesperson Cameron Yost said. He confirmed that all 700 job cuts were in the company’s heavy oil division and split between field positions in Fort McMurray and office jobs in Calgary. \nShell Canada has realized $450 million in annual cost savings so far this year, Yost said, adding that staff reductions account for a small part of that number.

The West Texas Intermediate benchmark price rose slightly midday Thursday to US$48.89 per barrel – still under half of the commodity’s price at the same time last year. \nCenovus’ second quarter results show the company has been able to cut $280 million in costs so far this year, not including the $100-million cuts announced Thursday, and Ferguson said those initial savings are already 40 per cent higher than the company’s initial targets. \nStill, the company reduced its dividend by 40 per cent to $0.16 per share Thursday, as it posted $126 million in net earnings in the second quarter, which is an 80 per cent drop from the same period last year. \nThe pain from collapsed oil prices, however, was not shared equally across oilsands producers. \nSuncor Energy Inc., which released its second quarter results after markets closed Wednesday, stunned the market with a massive earnings beat and increased its dividend by one cent to $0.29 per share. \n“Despite a very challenging macroeconomic environment, we delivered on our commitments in these (capital discipline and operational) areas,” Suncor’s president and chief executive officer Steve Williams said on his company’s earnings call. Canadian Press The Suncor Refinery in Edmonton. \nThe company has been trying to drive down its costs by between $600 and $800 million between 2015 and 2016. “We are well on our year to accomplishing that in this year alone,” Williams said. \nEquity and credit analysts were delighted with the company’s performance. “Suncor bucks the trend, announcing modest increases in shareholder returns as it benefits from its integrated operations, posting strong refining results while improved oilsands a lower Canadian dollar partially offset substantially lower benchmark oil prices,” Moody’s senior vice-president Terry Marshall said in an email. \nStill, Suncor did acknowledge that lower oil prices are having an effect and cut its capital budget for the second time this year, this time by $400 million, to a spending target between $5.8 billion and $6.4 billion. \nLast week, Wood Mackenzie released a report that showed spending cuts in the oilsands helped reduce global energy-sector capital spending plans by US$200 billion this year. “The upstream industry is winding back its investment in big pre-FID developments as fast as it can,” the report’s authors wrote. \nFinancial Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T05:14:23.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
