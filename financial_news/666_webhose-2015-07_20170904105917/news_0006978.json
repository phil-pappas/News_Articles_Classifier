A second cargo, of 26,000 tonnes, was exported in July for Mitsui. Both carried non genetically modified soy.\nBarras dos Coqueiros, also known as the Maritime Terminal Inacio Barbosa, consists of a concrete pier installed over two kilometers into the sea, protected by a breakwater.\n\"We started discussing the project with Multigrain some two years ago to export non genetically modified soybeans from western Bahia,\" Fabiano Lorenzi, commercial director of VLI, told Reuters.\nHe said VLI is the terminal operator while Multigrain holds exclusivity in the origination of soybeans exported.\nVLI's stakeholders are miner Vale (37.6 percent), Brookfield (26.6 percent), Japan's Mitsui (20 percent) and FI-FGTS (15.9 percent). Mitsui has since 2011 controlled Multigrain, which did not immediately respond to request for comment.\nThe terminal had previously moved cargo like urea and cement and received support vessels for oil rigs operating in the region. Multigrain invested 15 million reais ($4.5 million) to adapt the terminal for soy export.\nThe terminal aims to export 150,000 tonnes of soybeans this year, and increase that amount \"a little\" in coming years, Lorenzi said.\nBuyers are normally willing to pay slightly more for conventional soybeans, but the soy must be kept separate from the GMO variety.\nNearly all the soy in Brazil, the world's No. 2 soybean producer, is GMO. Just 6.5 percent of the record 2014/15 crop was conventional, according to consultancy Celeres.\n($1 = 3.3 reais) (Writing by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Angus MacSwan )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T18:46:39.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
