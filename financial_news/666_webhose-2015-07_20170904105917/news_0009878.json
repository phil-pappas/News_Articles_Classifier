Jessica Shapiro Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro Slater & Gordon will end an agreement with a large insurance broker the Swinton Group, the ASX listed law firm said in a stock exchange announcement on Monday.\nThe Professional Services Division, which Slater & Gordon acquired earlier this year from Quindell , had been providing 'first notification of loss services' to customers of Swinton in addition to legal and complimentary services to not-at-fault customers.\nSwinton was a major client of Quindell's PSD unit and signed a multi-year contract with Quindell in December , on the same day the company disclosed that founder Rob Terry had sold all his shares.\nThe agreement, penned at a time when Quindell's share price was plunging was for Swinton to exclusively handle motor claims processes, legal services and related services for its 1.2 million policyholders.\nThe Slater & Gordon announcement is light on detail and the company says its impact will not be material but given the \"current circumstances\" to chose to disclose the agreement termination, which comes into effect in October 2015.\nHowever in April 2014 Quindell told shareholders, the Swinton contract was \" material to Quindell's revenues and one of the largest signed to date\" . Swinton is described in Slater & Gordon's investor presentation as one of four insurance clients of PSD's motor services line of business.\nSlater & Gordon is currently subject to a probe by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission which is seeking answers on its accounting. Meanwhile the UK's Financial Conduct Authority is investigating Quindell, which sold its Professional Services Division to Slater & Gordon for $1.3 billion in April this year.\nThe revelations of regulatory probes, in addition to the admission of accounting errors relating to both cash receipts and payments triggered a 50 per cent fall in its share price, wiping nearly $1 billion of share market value off the once high flying company.\n Bets upped on further share price falls Monday's announcement has not unsettled investors in the stock that has been battered amid question marks over the company's accounting and concerns about the value of its $1.3 billion acquisition of Quindell's Professional Services Division, a creation of roll-ups masterminded by controversial UK businessman Rob Terry.\nSlater & Gordon shares traded slightly lower at $3.58, down from $3.60 at Friday's close. Shares fell more than 7 per cent on Friday reversing much of that week's gains.\nShort sellers meanwhile have upped their bets on further share price falls. Short interest in the company has continued to rise with 35 million shares borrowed, up from 28 million at June 30th when its news of its accounting errors sent the stock tumbling. The rise in short interest means that more than 11 per cent of the free-float has been borrowed.\nInvestors are eagerly awaiting the revised financial accounts of Quindell which were due to be published before June 30 for further insights into the acquired collection of businesses and evidence of related party transactions.\nFurthermore investors who attended Slater & Gordon's recent investor day said they were under the impression the video presentation to investors of its new acquisition mentioned and showed its customer Swinton.", "external_links": ["http://www.quindell.com/press-releases/rns/contract-updates/", "http://www.quindell.com/press-releases/rns/significant-contract-extension-swinton/", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/slater--gordon-shares-plunge-on-quindell-probe-reports-20150625-ghxd02.html", "https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-07-27T09:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T10:09:52.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
