Share on twitter by Jamie Freed A planned $2.7 billion airport at Badgerys Creek in western Sydney could require $1 billion of government subsidies or extra levies on airlines in the first decade to make it a financially viable proposition for Sydney Airport, according to a new analysis by Deutsche Bank.\nSydney Airport, which has a first right of refusal over the development of the new airport, finished formal consultations with the federal government about the airport's scope on June 30, and is waiting to receive an official development proposal.\nThe government has indicated it might have one by the end of this year, which would require the airport operator to decide next year whether to exercise its right to develop the project. The government has flagged it has no plans to provide subsidies for the airport and it will likely turn to superannuation and infrastructure funds which own stakes in other major Australian airports as potential developers if Sydney Airport does not exercise its first right of refusal.\nDeutsche analyst Cameron McDonald has conducted a detailed 48-page analysis of the development, on the assumption a $2.7 billion single-runway airport serving 5 million passengers a year opens in 2026. He concluded that to reach an acceptable internal rate of return (IRR) of 9.3 per cent, there would be a $1 billion earnings shortfall over the first decade of operations.\nHe said the shortfall could either be covered by a government grant or subsidy, or by charging an initial extra $2.50 levy per passenger at both the existing Kingsford-Smith and the new Badgerys Creek airport, which would fall to 30c per passenger by 2035.\n\"We believe that the government is unlikely to guarantee a top-up payment (given budgetary constraints) and therefore a levy imposed on all air traffic at either Sydney airport is the more likely course of action,\" he said. \"However, we note that this will put the cost of operation up at both airports and our initial discussions with airlines have resulted in a reluctance to have such a cost imposed.\"\nAirlines already believe Sydney Airport charges too much per passenger, but given the light-handed regulation model in Australia, they have little bargaining power because it would be difficult to drop flights from the airport due to the high demand from passengers.\nSydney Airport receives three-quarters of its aeronautical revenues from fees levied on international passengers, which are nearly four times as high as those levied on domestic passengers. Based on the current fees calculated by Deutsche, a $2.50 levy would result in a 37 per cent rise in domestic passenger fees and a 10 per cent rise in international passenger fees.\n Mr McDonald admits there are also some risks that might make his assumptions too optimistic.\n\"We have assumed that airport will start catering to both international and domestic passengers right from operation commencement,\" he said.\n\"In realistic terms, the possibility of the second airport handling only domestic passengers for the first few years of operation remains high. Additionally, the initial starting point of 5 million passengers in the first year of operation is also a risk. There has been a history of traffic volume overestimation in the infrastructure space.\"\nIn his analysis of other cities with multiple airports, such as London, New York and Tokyo, Mr McDonald found the secondary airport tends to gain prominence with low-cost carriers and freight carriers with a focus on expanding regionally by offering a competitive cost base.\nBut he said the demographics of the western Sydney region presented particular risks for the new airport, with average incomes below $50,000 a year, when only 15 per cent of air passengers in Sydney had incomes below $52,000 a year.\n\"The underlying economics of the western Sydney region do not indicate to us that the region will be a strong user of air travel services,\" Mr McDonald said.\nHe pointed to Geelong, where the average 2013 taxable income was $62,900 and yet Avalon Airport only had 633,000 seats compared with 41.8 million seats at Melbourne Airport at Tullamarine.\n\"Specific commitment from airlines in advance to operate at the second airport [in Sydney] will be difficult given the cost and uncertainty of demand,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Jamie_Freed"], "published": "2015-07-08T08:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T04:08:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
