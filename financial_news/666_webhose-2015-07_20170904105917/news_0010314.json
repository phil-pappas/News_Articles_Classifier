Cuomo said lengthy approval processes had been expedited by the vice president's office. \nThe new airport will move 600 feet (183 meters) closer to the Grand Central Parkway, creating more space for flight operations and will eventually be linked up to the rail network. \nCuomo called the current airport \"un-New York.\" \n\"It's slow, dated and a terrible entranceway to New York,\" he said. \nBiden added: \"This is the greatest city in the world... It requires a 21st century infrastructure.\" \nLaGuardia first opened in 1939 and was originally constructed by the city of New York at a cost of $40 million. Last year, nearly 27 million passengers passed through the airport. \nThat number is expected to grow to 34 million passengers by 2030, Biden said. \nCuomo said his administration would also design a master plan for New York's busiest hub, John F. Kennedy International Airport, that would be done in the next 12 months. \nJFK last year processed 53 million passengers. New York, home to 8.4 million people, is America's biggest city, the country's financial and entertainment capitals. \nIn 2013, the city received 54.3 million international and domestic visitors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T23:29:09.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
