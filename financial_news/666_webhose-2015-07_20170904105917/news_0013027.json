Government officials say they can’t make the payment because the legislature didn’t appropriate the funds last month for the current fiscal year.\n“The big question mark for bond holders isn’t if they will get their money back, because it’s likely that they will not,” said J.R. Rieger, global head of fixed income at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “It’s whether they can actually sell bonds and get where they’re currently priced. The depth of the market does not appear to be there.”\nYear to the date, the index is down 10.8 percent while an index tracking investment-grade municipals called the S&P National AMT-Free Municipal Bond index is up 0.55 percent, he said. The market value of the bonds in the Puerto Rico index has dropped by $6.9 billion this year, he said.\nGovernor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said in June that Puerto Rico cannot repay its obligations and was seeking to delay debt payments for a number of years. Prices of the securities have tumbled as officials prepare to release a debt-restructuring plan by Sept. 1.\nGiven the “uncertainty of Puerto Rico’s future, there’s a likelihood that these bonds can go lower,” Rieger said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:53:19.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
