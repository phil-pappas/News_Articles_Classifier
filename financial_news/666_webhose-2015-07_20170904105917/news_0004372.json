Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Philip Baker They might not be so fashionable these days, but there was a time when income securities were snapped up as though they were the next must-have dot-com share float.\nIt was the late 1990s, and although the tech boom was hogging all the headlines there was enough hype for Suncorp, Macquarie and National Australia Bank to issue about $2.5 billion of this new type of security.\nIn what might sound a familiar theme to many investors – with term deposit rates hovering at about 3 per cent – these provided a boom then as bank bill and term deposit rates fell significantly from double digits.\nNeedless to say, that drop caused a fair bit of angst for those relying on the interest they earned from their cash.\nTraditional fixed-interest investors were struggling to find alternatives and these securities seemed to provide the answer.\nThey were cheap borrowing for the issuers too but there seems to be some debate about them now, with some wondering if the market is fully informed on how these securities are trading.\nThere was a time when it was assumed that these securities were never going to be bought back.\nOut there forever They were perpetual and deemed to be left out there forever. The only way an investor could get their money back was to trade them on the secondary market.\nBut that was before the Basel III rules came into play and now that it seems they will have no equity value, or capital relief in the future, the game has changed.\nSome investors are wondering what the issuers will do.\nTo date there hasn't been any announcements, although in 2014 Suncorp did offer to buy back its security at $80.\nThe offer was taken up by some but institutional investors weren't so keen on the idea.\nOn Tuesday the Macquarie income security was fetching about $71.75, giving a yield of about 6 per cent, the National Bank issue was changing hands at $73, with a yield of almost 5.4 per cent, while the Suncorp deal was changing hands at $76, with a yield of about 4.4 per cent.\nIn contrast, the Westpac issue was trading at about $95.\nClearer understanding The Westpac securities have a redemption date of 2022 and investors have a clearer understanding of what will happen to them in the next few years.\nPerhaps the same can't be said for the other securities, which is perhaps why they are trading at such a discount.\nIt would certainly be an unpleasant experience for any investor to sell the Macquarie income security at its current level, only to discover it will be bought back at par, $100, in a few years.\nAt the heart of the problem is that under the new Basel III capital rules, the Macquarie, NAB and Suncorp issues don't meet the new criteria, principally because they don't have the \"non-viability trigger\" that is needed now to get the capital relief.\nThis means they can't be converted into shares or written down to zero if the banks' capital ratios fall below the required levels.\nIn 2012 the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority agreed on a phase-out process, whereby each bank is permitted to reduce its capital measurement of ineligible securities by 10 per cent a year. By January 1, 2022, the weighting of these securities falls to zero.\nFor example, Macquarie has $400 million on issue and in its recent regulatory disclosure statement showed that they attribute $280 million, or 70 per cent, towards their capital ratio calculation for this security.\nBefore the implementation of the phase-out rules no continuous disclosure was required.\nSo far Macquarie, NAB and Suncorp have not informed the market of what their intention is when these securities are given a capital value of zero under APRA's new rules.\nIt's a fair bet, but not certain, they will be repurchased at par in 2022, if not before, because it is not economically viable to have capital securities on issue for which no capital is attributable.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-07-14T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:08:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
