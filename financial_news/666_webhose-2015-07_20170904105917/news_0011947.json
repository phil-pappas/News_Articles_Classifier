These names may seem unfamiliar to you, but they are among a throng of “challenger” banks battling it out to attract savers’ deposits. \nRates are at historic lows and falling. The average easy-access cash Isa rate was just 1.01pc in May, according to Bank of England data. Big, established savings providers notably the big banking brands seem less likely to compete than ever. \nThree of the top five easy-access savings accounts on the market for instance, are all offered by smaller brands. \nKent Reliance pays 1.45pc, while Virgin Money, a bank owned by the Virgin Group and founded by Sir Richard Branson in 1995, pays 1.41pc. \nTesco Bank, a retail bank formed in 1997, and which has been wholly owned by Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) since 2008, pays 1.35pc, while Saga (LSE: SAGA.L - news ) , the over-50s lifestyle group, pays the fifth best rate, at 1.35pc. \nBirmingham Midshires, which specialises in savings, pays the top rate at 1.5pc.

It currently pays the best rate for a one-year fixed-rate Isa, at 1.65pc, and is the market leader in the easy-access Isa category, paying 1.6pc to customers who also hold or open a “Flex” current account. \nSavings with all of the smaller deposit-takers mentioned here are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, up to £85,000 per person or £170,000 for joint accounts.
