There may be an incentive for policyholders to buy shares in the insurer's market listing later this year. Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jessica Gardner Medibank Private's stunning axing of hospital operator Calvary Health Care is a classic negotiating tactic, which will do little to control the insurer's ballooning medical claim costs and may even backfire.\nThe market-leading insurer, which the federal government sold in a $5.7 billion float last November that was the biggest listing since Telstra, said on Wednesday night that contract negotiations with Calvary had broken down.\nThe relationship between private hospitals and insurers is fraught. One would not exist without the other, but they have divergent goals.\nAbout every two years insurers and hospitals embark on negotiations over what the insurer should pay for care, such as a night in a rehabilitation bed or a hip replacement.\nThe main negotiating point is price â€“ hospitals say their costs are going up and so ask for big increases, but insurers want to rein in what they are paying out in claims.\nOften these negotiations go on behind closed doors, but sometimes they burst into the public arena.\nIn 2013 Medibank and the country's largest private provider Ramsay Health Care had a massive stoush over negotiations.\nIn the end they agreed on a compromise because Ramsay's 69 hospitals would suffer without Medibank's almost 30 per cent share of the $19 billion private health sector. And vice versa, Ramsay's 27 per cent share of the country's private hospitals is too dominant and lucrative for Medibank to walk away from.\n Mediation with Calvary Calvary Health Care is a much smaller player, with about 5 per cent of the country's private hospital beds. On the surface this may seem to give Medibank an advantage, but actually overall, scale is pretty meaningless. Regional footprints are what is important, because mostly patients go to their local hospitals.\nFor example, Calvary has two of the three main private hospitals in Canberra (excluding a day surgery and a specialist imaging provider). If Medibank chooses to cut the Catholic supplier out, its members will be forced to use the one remaining option. Calvary is also a dominant supplier in Adelaide.\nThe two parties are heading to mediation on July 21, before their contract runs out on August 31. If they still cannot agree, Medibank members who are treated in Calvary hospitals will face out of pocket costs.\nJust as Ramsay did in 2013, it is likely that Calvary would run a campaign to urge its patients and their doctors to switch health insurers.\nWith rising premiums and intense competition driven by comparison websites like iSelect, Medibank would be extremely brave to give its members another reason to question or reconsider their coverage. The insurer said 21,000 of its members visited a Calvary hospital in the past 12 months.\nTough tactics Outside of price, what Medibank really wants is for hospital providers to sign up to tough new quality criteria that aim to control the volume of patients who come through operating theatres. It does not want to pay for re-admissions when the hospital is at fault, and it wants a greater focus on preventative care.\nAlthough hospitals are asking for price rises, the reality is that Medibank's ballooning hospital claims (which have increased by 6.7 per cent per annum over the past five years) are mostly driven by the growing volume of patients through the door. Volume is a function of more operating theatres, and higher rates of chronic diseases among a growing and ageing population.\nSo Medibank's announcement on Wednesday is just as much a negotiating tactic with Calvary as it is a message for the rest of the private hospital sector.\nBut it is also a message to nervous shareholders.\nThe stock came within a whisker of falling below its retail listing price this week, closing at $2.01 on Tuesday.\nInstitutional fund managers who bought shares at $2.15 a pop are already under water, while mum and dad investors who bought in at $2 are still in the money ... just.\nMedibank is under pressure to come good on the story it has sold to investors that it would flex its muscle over hospitals. But it is a delicate dance and Medibank must watch its step.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JessicaGardner1/", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jessigardner", "http://www.myhospitals.gov.au/browse-hospitals/act"], "published": "2015-07-02T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:07:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
