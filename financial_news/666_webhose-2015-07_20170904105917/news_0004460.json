This puts JP Morgan on track to achieve its target of $2bn of annual cost savings by 2017. \nAlmost every part of JP Morgan's business suffered a slump in revenues in the second quarter. Mortgage banking income plunged by just over one-fifth, while the wider consumer and business banking division suffered an 8pc decline in revenues. The bank blamed the poor performance on compressed spreads and squeezed interest income. \nBut the trading arm of JP Morgan's investment bank was also badly hit, as lower volumes and volatile market conditions sent revenues down by 10pc year-on-year. \nThe dismal outcome dashed hopes that a recent rebound in fixed income trading in the first quarter might be sustained. \nHowever, the overall investment banking division performed relatively well, reporitng a 4pc increase in sales, as high demand for advisory work on deals and an increase in debt issuasnce by businesses offset poor trading elsewhere. \nSales at the asset management division rose 6pc, but costs jumped by 17pc and credit losses grew, driving profits down by 21pc to $451m. \nAnalysts praised the results as a sign that the bank’s cost-cutting drive is paying off. \n“Despite weak net interest income and fixed income, and weaker than expected currency and commodities results, we expect the shares to react favourably given strong corporate and investment banking results, continued efficiency progress, and healthy capital build,” said Nomura’s Steven Chubak. \nJP Morgan's shares rose 1.55pc on the results to $68.09.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T22:07:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
