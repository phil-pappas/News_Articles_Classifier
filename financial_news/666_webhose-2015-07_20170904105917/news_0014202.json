We have not heard anything specific but we don't acknowledge that currency policy is being discussed.\"\nThe yen has lost over a third of its value versus the dollar since late 2012, when Prime Minister Shinto Abe swept to power pushing aggressive monetary stimulus to reflate the economy.\nWeaker exchange rates make a country's exports cheaper and give exporters a competitive advantage.\nEconomy Minister Akira Amari said currency concerns should not be addressed in the free trade talks as he is attending the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) talks being held in Hawaii this week.
