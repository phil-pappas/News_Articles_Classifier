He indicated that the resignation is due to the Greek Prime Minister’s understanding that he will make negotiations with creditors unproductive. \nMinister No More! http://t.co/Oa6MlhTPjG \n— Yanis Varoufakis (@yanisvaroufakis) July 6, 2015 \nVaroufakis writes: “Soon after the announcement of the referendum results, I was made aware of a certain preference by some Eurogroup participants, and assorted ‘partners’, for my… ‘absence’ from its meetings; an idea that the Prime Minister judged to be potentially helpful to him in reaching an agreement.” \nDespite this, the Greek Finance Minister did not acknowledged in his writing today that he indeed did as much as he can to antagonize the IMF, his European partners and Angela Merkel in particular. Only over the weekend he referred to their demands for an austerity plan as “terrorism.” Varoufakis did made it a point to add today, “I shall wear the creditors’ loathing with pride.” Market Reactions \nThe resignation announcement may add more fuel to the uncertainty around European FX pairs and reactions from players in the market start to come out. \nDennis De Jong, UFX Managing Director, commented: “While Varoufakis’ resignation was abrupt, it was not surprising, given his continuous absence from meetings with Euro officials. We expect to see the EUR/USD continue to go up slightly, after correcting a 100 pip gap, following today’s referendum voting announcement. We should see the pair settle on 1.12 for the coming days, until a final announcement is made by Greek and Euro-Zone officials.” Got a news tip?
