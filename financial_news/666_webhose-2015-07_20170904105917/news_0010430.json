Her life is the focus of the two-part Australian Story on the ABC. Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jonathan Barrett Viewers of the ABC 's Australian Story on Monday night were reminded that the Hancock family's mining empire did not originate with Lang Hancock's fabled discovery of iron-red cliffs in the Pilbara in 1952.\nRather, it started with asbestos.\nHancock discovered what would become the Wittenoom blue asbestos mine in the 1930s. The primitive project included having workers detonate the rocks and chisel out asbestos. Hand-packed sacks were 0taken to the Pilbara port of Point Samson and shipped to Fremantle.\nHancock sold the Wittenoom mine to Colonial Sugar Refining Company, later known as CSR, in 1943, and stayed on as mine manager for several years.\nPrecious medals: Gina Rinehart celebrates with synchronised swimmers. Hancock Prospecting The explorer apparently never accepted the building material's deadly attributes – he was known for a party trick of spreading asbestos on his Weet-Bix to prove the point .\nLawsuits still regularly target CSR, James Hardie and Hancock Prospecting, although most claims are handled by the companies' insurers and not made public.\nWittenoom is still killing people, even though most of the first-generation miners have died, either from asbestos-related diseases or old age. The families of those miners are still suffering the effects from exposure.\nThe effects of Wittenoom come in and out of public consciousness. Ben Hills' book Blue Murder , published in 1989, moved the members of Midnight Oil to write the hit song Blue Sky Mine to raise awareness of the fate suffered by workers at the blue asbestos mine.\n Legacy denied Wittenoom is a legacy that Hancock Prospecting doesn't acknowledge on its website, but the 1952 \"discovery flight\" receives ample attention.\nThe major flaw in the oft-Quote: d tenet that Rinehart is fulfilling her father's dream of not just discovering a resource but mining it, is that Hancock was an owner-operator of a mine – it was a humanitarian disaster.\nThe Perth-based Asbestos Diseases Society of Australia is one of the key groups to identify and support those suffering from asbestos-related diseases. However, its long-time president and former Wittenoom miner Robert Vojakovic has said \"Rinehart should realise that all her riches came out of Wittenoom\".\nAs Vojakovic noted, a few bucks from Australia's richest person to help the association care for those who worked at Wittenoom wouldn't go astray.\nThat doesn't imply Rinehart isn't generous.\nWhile undoubtedly much of her giving is private, she is known to support women from poor backgrounds in Cambodia through a scholarship program , has given generously to sporting groups and in 2014 she came to the financial rescue of the Sculpture by the Sea exhibition in Cottesloe.\nBut it's almost as if she wishes the Hancock mining legacy started with her father's discovery of the Pilbara ore deposits when flying that light plane in 1952 – and not Wittenoom.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/barrett_ink", "http://www.smh.com.au/national/the-making-of-a-magnate-20120622-20tkb.html", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/111791755610985370077"], "published": "2015-07-07T10:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:11:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
