Former Rabobank trader banned from working in the City over Libor fraud By Tim Wallace | Telegraph – 20 minutes ago Print \nEx-trader Lee Stewart banned from working in UK financial services after admitting fraud in the US \nA Libor-manipulating trader from Dutch institution Rabobank has been banned from working in the UK’s financial services industry by the Financial Conduct Authority. \nLee Stewart, 52, worked as a trader from 1993 to 2009, and was accused of attempting to manipulate the interest rate benchmark Libor from 2007 to 2009. \nThe US Department of Justice accused him of attempted wire fraud and bank fraud, and Mr Stewart pleaded guilty in March. He is due to be sentenced in June 2017. \n“Mr Stewart was an experienced trader at Rabobank who, through his guilty plea, has admitted to participating in a criminal conspiracy to manipulate Libor over a prolonged period of time. His behaviour was inexcusable and very serious,” said the FCA’s acting director of enforcement Georgina Phillippou. \n“This ban further reinforces our expectation that individuals and firms take responsibility for ensuring market integrity and reminds them of the consequences if they fall short of our standards.” \nMr Stewart is the second trader from the bank to be banned by the FCA his former colleague Paul Robson also faced action in March of this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T18:27:53.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
