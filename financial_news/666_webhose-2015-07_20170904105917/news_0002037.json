Oil prices coming down is also a plus for Jamaica, as it is an importer of oil.\" \nIn the secondary markets, spreads were inching tighter on Thursday as investors found some relief in the Greek parliament's approval of the new bailout plan. \n\"All the potential hurdles (in regards to Greece) have been leapt and now we are watching rates and oil,\" said one New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) York-based trader of LatAm sovereign debt. \nPIPELINE \nAmerica Movil (A2/A-/A) and Telesites (expected NR/BBB-/BBB-) have wrapped up investor meetings via Citigroup, Inbursa, BBVA and Santander. The meetings were intended to discuss the new Operadora de Sites Mexicanos business and gauge interest for 144A/Reg S deals in Mexican pesos and/or USD. \nBanco Santander Chile (Aa3/A/A+) has wrapped up meetings via Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) and Santander to discuss opportunities in the domestic Chilean markets. \nJamaica (Caa2/B/B-) has wrapped up investor meetings via Citigroup. The meetings were described as a non-deal roadshow, but markets have been expecting the sovereign to raise funding to retire a PetroCaribe loan owed to Venezuela.
