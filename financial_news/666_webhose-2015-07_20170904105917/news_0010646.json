It scrapped its dividend in March after suffering a 2014 loss and warned of difficult times ahead. \nBalfour is counting the cost of the wafer-thin margins it agreed to in its hunt for business during the recession. It has previously issued five profit warnings within two years and cancelled a 200 million pound share buyback. \n\"The issues we are working through are as I set out in March and legacy challenges remain,\" Quinn said. \"However, we are making encouraging progress on the group's transformation.\" \nBalfour also said it was making good progress against its cost cutting programme and as a result its net cash was set to exceed 200 million pounds at the half year end in June, substantially better than last year. \n(Reporting by Kate Holton; editing by Paul Sandle and Keith Weir)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T10:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T11:20:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
