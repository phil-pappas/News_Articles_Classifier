In these cases, we help clients stay ahead of the game by recognizing vulnerabilities and developing strategies to mitigate impact.\" \nKetchum has assisted clients with sports issues management situations ranging from the potential cancelation of sporting events to team tragedies to college athletics and athlete spokesperson scandals to sponsorships of major sporting events like the Olympic Games, Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup. \n\"As a result of the continued growth of the sports business industry, these kinds of issues have only increased in recent years,\" said Shawn McBride, EVP of sports for Ketchum Sports & Entertainment . \"Given the myriad reputational risks that go hand-in-hand with the outstanding exposure that brands receive when aligning with a property, event, team or athlete, it's important to have a plan ready to manage any potential issues or threats â€“ and a partner that understands the dynamics of this industry.\" \nAbout Ketchum Ketchum is a leading global communications firm with operations in more than 70 countries across six continents.
