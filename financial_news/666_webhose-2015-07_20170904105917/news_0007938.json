RBC (Other OTC: RBCI - news ) retained its 'outperform' recommendation and said ARM's dollar revenue and profits were in line with expectation, though forex rates impacted the company's sterling-reported numbers, with an actual USD/GBP rate of 1.56 compared to consensus expectations of 1.51. \nSales of $357m were up 3% quarter-on-quarter and 15% year-on-year, and bang in line with consensus. Adjusted earnings before interest and tax of £121m, with a 52.9% margin, compared to a £123m consensus. Adjusted earnings per share of 7.28p due to slightly higher tax rate at 16.4% was short of consensus 7.46p. \nRoyalties and licensing rates were both are in-line as ARM continued to outgrow the industry materially, with 54 processor licenses signed - the highest ever in a quarter. \nRBC said that with customers continuing the switchover to higher royalty rate v8 processor architecture in mobile and market share gains continuing outside mobile, ARM \"should by definition continue to outperform the industry\". \nThe Canadian bank said ARM's valuation \"looks attractive\" as a forward p/e ratio of 27.5 times is cheap versus its historical range of between 30 and 40 times. \nCredit Suisse, which has the same 'outperform' rating on the shares and a target price of 1,300p, said this was a \"solid\" set of numbers, with the \"content growth and share gains story on track\". \nExtrapolating across the full year, the Swiss bank said it believed that consensus estimates for top-line and EPS may remain largely unchanged.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T16:52:54.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
