Ongoing projects in the windpower and power transmission areas will be completed and then put on the block, both sources said.\n\"The scenario nowadays is very uncertain,\" the first source said.\nThe decision underscores the challenging outlook for a sector that was hampered by erratic policy decisions over the past three years. Investors in power generation, transmission and distribution as well as alternative segments have suffered with losses stemming from years of stagnation, rising borrowing costs, high state intervention and two years of drought.\nJ&F, which concentrates the Batistas' investments in pulp, agribusiness, cosmetics, home cleaning products and finance, declined to comment. J&F also controls JBS SA, the world's largest meatpacker.\nAccording to the first source, recent government steps to reduce available financing from state development bank BNDES triggered doubts at J&F over its participation in the sector.\nThe second source noted that an ongoing corruption probe involving some state firms and the nation's largest engineering firms is reducing the availability of suppliers and partners for big infrastructure deals.\nJ&F's transmission projects are expected to be finalized between year-end and 2016. Once the projects are completed, the holding company will structure the best possible exit from the investments, the first source added.\n($1 = 3.4210 Brazilian reais) (Reporting by Luciano Costa; Writing by Guillermo Parra-Bernal; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Bernard Orr)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T22:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T21:36:53.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
