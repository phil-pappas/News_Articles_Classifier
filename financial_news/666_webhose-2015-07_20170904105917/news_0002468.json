In September 2013, the bank was ordered by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to refund more than $300 million to customers. The company neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.\nAndrew Gray, a spokesman for JPMorgan, and the offices of Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who often take the lead in multistate settlements, declined to comment.\nRobo-Signing JPMorgan’s units allegedly sold uncollectible accounts to third-party debt buyers and got judgments without following proper procedures, a practice known as robo-signing, the person familiar with the matter said.\nFrom 2009 to 2013, the bank recovered about $4.5 billion from defaulted accounts through collection lawsuits and from selling defaulted accounts to debt buyers, the person said.\nAs part of the deal with the CFPB and the states, New York-based JPMorgan agreed to stop collections actions on approximately 528,000 consumers against whom it won judgments between January 2009 and June 30, 2014, the person said.\nIn 2011, the consumer protection bureau penalized American Express Co. for falsely telling consumers that paying old debt would improve their credit scores. The company paid $112.5 million in fines and restitution. The federal agency has also taken action against Bank of America Corp. and Synchrony Bank over credit-card marketing practices.\nAbout 77 million American consumers have debt ranging from $25 to $125,000 that are subject to collection, according to the consumer protection bureau. Most don’t know of the issues until they receive calls from debt collectors or review their credit reports, the agency said in a report this year.\nThe JPMorgan accord was reported earlier by Reuters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T16:31:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
