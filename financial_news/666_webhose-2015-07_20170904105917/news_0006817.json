And there are some high-dividend producers among them. \nIn the top 11, the lowest yielding stock has a dividend yield of 3.1% -- and it just goes up from there. So, if you're looking for big stocks with high dividend yield , look no further. \nThe NASDAQ 100 has historically been \"overweight\" the technology sector as compared to the S&P 500. The highest yielding NASDAQ 100 stocks are no exception. Eight out of the top 11 highest yielding NASDAQ 100 stocks are in the technology sector. \nThe highest yielding NASDAQ 100 stocks are examined in reverse order with the lowest yielding (of the high yield stocks) first. \n11. QUALCOMM -- 3.1% \nMust Read: Goldman Sachs' 4 Favorite Bank Stocks Ahead of Earnings \nQUALCOMM ( QCOM ) develops, markets, and patents integrated circuits used in smart phones and wireless devices. \nThe majority of the company's revenue comes from patent licenses for smart phones. The company makes between 3.25% and 5% of the sales price for both Apple ( AAPL ) and Samsung ( SSNLF ) smart phones. \nQULACOMM currently has a dividend yield of 3.1%. In addition to its high yield, QULACOMM also has a long history of paying rising dividends. The company has paid increasing dividends each year since 2003, making the company a member of the exclusive Dividend Achievers Index . \nThe company has managed its impressive dividend streak by staying ahead of the technology curve in smart phones. QUALCOMM spent over $5 billion on research and development in each of its last two fiscal years. \nContinued global smart phone growth will fuel earnings-per-share growth for shareholders of QUALCOMM. The company is expecting rapid earnings-per-share growth of 15% a year. \nDespite its high expected growth rate, QUALCOMM trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 14.7. The company's shares look cheap right now due to two recent headwinds. First, Samsung's sales are slipping. This effects QUALCOMM's revenue due to licensing deals with Samsung. \nSecond, QUALCOMM has experienced difficulties enforcing its patent claims in China. The Chinese government fined the company $975 million in an anti-monopoly case. \nDespite these setbacks, QUALCOMM shares appear to be undervalued at this time. Activist fund Jana Partners has goaded QUALCOMM's management to return 20% of the company's market cap to shareholders in the form of share repurchases over the next two years. 1 of 11", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T18:53:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
