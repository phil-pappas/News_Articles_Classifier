Over the past three and five years the fund has returned 63pc and 87pc respectively, while the average UK growth fund has gained 48pc and 63pc. \nIn this interview Mr Savvides talks about his latest buys and sells. \n= As a value investor you buy unfashionable shares. How do you find them? = \nWe back businesses that are making changes to address a particular problem. Often the easiest way to spot these shares is when a new management team arrives and with their fresh pair of eyes are able to come up with a winning new strategy. \nThere are three things I want to see: improving profit margins, cashflow and return on investment. When businesses get these three things right the shares tend to recover. There is always the risk of buying something which is cheap for all the wrong reasons. To avoid them we avoid firms that are carrying too much debt. \n= Could you name a couple of successful examples of your approach? = \nOne of our best performers over the past five years has been 3i , the private equity firm, which had been an unloved stock for a while. But since Simon Borrows took over as chief executive in May 2012 its fortunes have changed. Costs have been cut and dividends raised. \nTaylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) , the housebuilder, has also bounced back strongly. In 2010, when I bought the shares, they were trading on a price to book value of 0.4, something that even five years on I cannot believe was so cheap. The improvement in the economy and favourable political policies have helped the housebuilders. \n= Which shares have you been buying more recently? = \nAfter a good run for stock markets it is harder to find bargains, but I would say there are five areas of the stock market where contrarian investors can still find value. \nThe first is the oil sector. I have been buying both Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) and BP . Shell’s management team is making strides to cut costs and with a starting yield of 6.5pc we are happy to wait and see how this plays out. BP was first purchased two years ago and I have been impressed that management has improved the cashflow. \nAnother big opportunity is banks. The sector remains deeply mistrusted but is getting its house in order by shrinking its total lending and focusing on areas that will generate higher returns. This has been driven by greater regulatory pressure, but will result in higher dividends. I have bought Lloyds , Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) and HSBC . \nThe other three areas of value are supermarkets, defence businesses and the miners. Morrisons is my favourite of the supermarkets. It is two years ahead of its rivals and is losing fewer customers to the discounters than Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) and Sainsbury’s. \n= Where are you not finding value? = \nWe have sold shares that have turned their fortunes around and recovered. When this is achieved our job of providing capital is done. Smith & Nephew (LSE: SN.L - news ) , Britain’s biggest orthopaedics company, and Micro Focus, the software company, are two examples. \nHousebuilders are also no longer a buy. Taylor Wimpey now has a price to book ratio of 1.8 and with an interest rate rise on the cards it has lost its great investment status. As land prices rise it makes sense to leave the sector instead of trying to profit further. \n= Do you invest your own money in the fund? = \nI put all my pension money into the fund on my first day in 2008 and have been drip-feeding money in monthly since. My wife’s pension is also in the fund, which adds a bit of pressure. \n= What would you have done if you hadn’t become a fund manager? = \nIt sounds like I am just saying this but I genuinely wanted to be an investor since I was 12 my friends will back me up on that. I bought my first share, Rhino Group (today Game, the retailer), when I was 16 on work experience, and it was very unsuccessful. \n= Our View = \nFunds that describe themselves as “UK growth” focus on companies that reinvest profits in their business rather than paying them out to shareholders and are viewed as a good core holding in a portfolio, with experts suggesting that they make up about 20pc of an Isa. \nThe JO Hambro UK Dynamic fund is viewed as one of the better choices of the 200-odd UK growth funds available. \nBut Tom Becket, who buys funds for Psigma, the wealth manager, said he preferred Axa UK Growth and GLG UK Select . \n“The performance of the JO Hambro fund has been strong but at this point, when valuations appear stretched and certain areas of growth look particularly expensive, I prefer funds that back defensive shares,” Mr Becket said. \nDarius McDermott, managing director of FundCalibre, a fund rating website, said he favoured Schroder Recovery and GLG Undervalued Assets as alternatives. \n“Both also have a ‘value’ investment style, so they invest in companies that the manager thinks are valued by the market at less than their true worth and will at some point recover,” he said. \nThe Investec UK Special Situations fund, managed by Alastair Mundy, is another popular choice, but it is worth noting that the fund currently has a cautious stance, holding 12pc of its assets in cash. \nFidelity Special Values , an investment trust managed by Alex Wright, another contrarian investor, is also worth considering. \n= How to buy the fund as cheaply as possible = \nThe fund has a total cost (the “OCF” or “TER”) of 0.74pc a year, broadly the same as on similar funds. Be sure to buy the right “share class”, which is “Y”. The investment shop through which you buy the fund will also levy a charge some as a percentage of the amount invested, some as a flat annual fee.
