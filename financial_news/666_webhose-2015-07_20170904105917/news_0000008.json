Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCAU, -2.58% which owns 90% of the storied Italian carmaker, is offering 11% of its holdings to the public and will thereafter distribute its remaining holdings to FCA shareholders. The deal is expected to price in early 2016.\nBut just as Ferraris aren't simply cars, Ferrari's IPO isn't simple either. And it starts with the first sentence in the deal summary: \"Ferrari is among the world's leading luxury brands...\"\nSilly me, I thought Ferrari made cars. Oops. My bad. Errore mio .\nYes, of course they make cars — about 7,000 every year. Along with their “run-of-the-mill” sports and GT cars, they make limited-edition vehicles. And \"very” limited editions. Plus, probably Double Secret Probation editions. And that carefully tended exclusivity has led quite organically over 68 years to Ferrari as it stands today: primo cars and a primo brand.\nIs this about cars or merchandising ... or both?\nReading through the prospectus is quite impressive — it's crystal clear that Ferrari understands its own brand values and how to maintain them. For example, the prospectus confirms the longstanding rumor that Ferrari intentionally under-produces its cars so that dealers need to maintain waiting lists — even during economic downturns.\nBut wait a minute. Hasn't Sergio Marchionne, CEO of FCA and Chairman of Ferrari, stated publicly he wants to increase sales volumes of Ferrari cars? Yes, he has. There it is on page 39 of the prospectus: \"Our strategic business plan reflects a continuation of the low-volume strategy, while gradually increasing shipments to approximately 9,000 units per year by 2019.\"\nThat's an annual growth rate of only 4.4% from the 7,255 vehicles sold in 2014. So, Ferraris aren't going to suddenly be as common as Fords. Phew. But investors looking for revenue and profit growth might be concerned: if the cash flow isn't going to come from more car sales, from where will it come?\nMerchandising of Ferrari's brand now accounts for less than 5% of total revenue. Should shareholders brace for more Ferrari-branded Puma sneakers or LEGO toys? More theme parks? And if Ferrari goes all demenziale with the licensing, will that hurt the core car brand?\nAre there any comps?\nLet's look at some other companies. What about Rolex? Like Ferrari, privately held Rolex sells limited amounts of new product while tending to an after-market of its older products. It also participates on a corporate level as a sponsor of various sporting activities, including Formula 1 auto racing. (And less happily, Rolexes, like Ferraris, get counterfeited.) But Rolex doesn't have Ferrari's brand equity, and probably can't sell anything else, except perhaps watch bands, with the Rolex brand.\nBaccarat (owned by private equity firm Starwood Capital) also makes new fine crystal while there exists a vibrant after-market for its earlier works. Starwood is also attempting to cash in on the brand through the creation of a line of Baccarat-branded upscale hotels. But the jury is out on the effectiveness of that strategy.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:02:48.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
