The last country to do so was Zimbabwe in 2001.\nIn ruins ...

Due to parliamentary procedures, unable to extend program beyond today,” Slovakia’s Finance Minister Peter Kazimir wrote on Twitter.\nLast deadline for #Greece program extension was weekend. Due to parliamentary procedures, unable to extend program beyond today #eurozone\n— Peter Kažimír (@KazimirPeter) June 30, 2015 Finnish Finance Minister Alex Stubb said an extension was “not possible”, adding requests for a new rescue program with the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the EU’s bailout vehicle, “is always dealt with through normal procedures.”\nEurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem told CNN : “The political circumstance and the political stance ... doesn’t seem to have changed — we are still of course awaiting the referendum.”\nHowever Malta’s Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said that Greece had offered to suspend its planned referendum on its bailout terms if negotiations with the EU are reopened, the Times of Malta reported.\nPublic to decide ...

Deborah Lutterbeck reports.\nEuropean Commission chief: Greece should tell the truth\nEurozone ministers previously rejected Greece’s request for an extension to its bailout following the Greek government’s announcement of a referendum on Sunday on reform demands by Athens’ creditors.\nOn Monday, the European Commission’s normally cautious chief Jean-Claude Juncker said Mr Tsipras was lying to his people over the financial crisis and the European Union felt betrayed by his “egotism” that ended the political talks over the troubled nation’s financial future.\nMr Juncker, never really known for making blunt or undiplomatic statements, said he felt “betrayed” and sad by Greece’s “egotism, tactical games, populist games” during the failed debt talks, interpreted as meaningless by its leader.

I very much like the Greeks, and I’d say to them ‘You should not commit suicide because you are afraid of death. You should say ‘yes.”’\nStunning rebuke ... European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he felt “betrayed” and sad by Greece’s “egotism, tactical games, populist games” during the failed debt talks.

Rally ... demonstrators gather at a rally organised by supporters of the 'Yes' vote for the upcoming referendum in front of the Greek Parliament.

Should the vote go the other way, the Tsipras government would have to step down.\nThe poster designed by Mr Tsipras’ leftist Syriza party was posted on its website: “Vote ‘No’ for democracy and dignity”, with ‘No’ (Oxi in Greek) written large against a background of the Greek flag.\nThe markets have already reacted to the uncertainty with up to 4 per cent drops on national EU markets but analysts say things will only get worse after the referendum with a no vote as bad as a yes vote.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/eurozone?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/eurozone-refuses-greek-bailout-extension/story-fnu2pycd-1227422261573?sv=c84639768642a15c03a2a439069ecf8&title=Why+the+next+20+days+will+make+or+break+Greece", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Why+the+next+20+days+will+make+or+break+Greece&c=THE+next+three+weeks+are+critical+for+Greece%2C+after+it+failed+to+meet+the+deadline+to+repay+its+%242.2+billion+debt.+Here%26%238217%3Bs+all+you+need+to+know+about+the+crisis.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/eurozone-refuses-greek-bailout-extension/story-fnu2pycd-1227422261573?sv=c84639768642a15c03a2a439069ecf8", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/eurozone-refuses-greek-bailout-extension/story-fnu2pycd-1227422261573?sv=c84639768642a15c03a2a439069ecf8&h=Why+the+next+20+days+will+make+or+break+Greece", "https://twitter.com/KazimirPeter/status/615946139532193792", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/eurozone-refuses-greek-bailout-extension/story-fnu2pycd-1227422261573?sv=c84639768642a15c03a2a439069ecf8", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/eurozone-refuses-greek-bailout-extension/story-fnu2pycd-1227422261573?sv=c84639768642a15c03a2a439069ecf8&title=Why+the+next+20+days+will+make+or+break+Greece", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/eurozone-refuses-greek-bailout-extension/story-fnu2pycd-1227422261573?sv=c84639768642a15c03a2a439069ecf8"], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T05:21:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
