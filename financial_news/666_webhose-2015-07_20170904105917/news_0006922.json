Louie Douvis by Claire Stewart Five quick questions with Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick.\nWorst thing a man has said?\n\"This gender equality is dogs' balls.\"\n\"Why should men be pushed down just for women to come up? That's not equal. It's like a war against men.\"\nBest thing?\nOne of the male champions having heard from Rosie Batty and Kristy McKellar about their experiences of living with violence said: \"Let us ensure that our response is proportionate to the courage these women have shown by telling us their stories.\" And the head of the Saudi Stock Exchange. I was in Korea presenting to the exchange heads and he said: \"I want to be a leader in gender equality in my exchange. I want to show the rest of the world.\" My jaw just dropped. It was fantastic, broke down a lot of the stereotypes.\nWould you have done something differently?\nI would have got on to engaging men earlier in my term, seeing the importance of that earlier. Probably I wouldn't have doubted myself so much in the beginning. Which seems funny now, but I would have put those doubts off to the side earlier.\nFavourite feminist/influencer?\n Hillary Clinton. As Secretary of State, she helped us understand globally that women's empowerment is absolutely integral to creating peace in the world. Clinton didn't have to give up her femininity to step up and be a powerful person in that role. I meet so many impressive women, but some of them have been able to hang on to what I call that sacred feminine energy to create influence and power.\nA day that sticks in your memory?\nWhen my mother died in 2003. I realised just how much my mother had taught me about dying, as well as about living. When she decided to stop treatment for her leukaemia, she wanted me and my sisters to arrange farewell parties for her, so she could say goodbye and reconnect with everyone, and reconnect my father with everyone; where she had relief and comfort for what the next stage for my father would be. That day was an important day also because I realised I would never have access to the wisdom she had, but in another way, I realise that her wisdom resides in me and I often feel myself thinking: \"Now what would Mum do? What would Mum have said?\"\nNominate yourself or someone else for 100 Women of Influence .\nLike Boss on Facebook . Follow Boss on Twitter .
