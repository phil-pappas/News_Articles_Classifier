Late on Wednesday the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation said on its website that another 400 workers had been dismissed earlier in the day at Sino Zim Cotton Holdings in Harare. \nPreviously, employers had to follow laborious procedures and pay hefty severance packages before they could fire or retrench workers. \nYears of economic crisis \n\"The dismissals are more of victimisation purges than genuine restructuring exercises and have turned the workplace into a nightmare,\" the ZCTU said. \nZimbabwe's unemployment rate is already said to be more than 80%, after years of economic crisis that has seen many companies shut down or operate below capacity. \nLabour Minister Priscah Mupfumira told parliament on Wednesday that the government had \"noted with concern\" the Supreme Court ruling. \n\"As it is, it gives the employers almost a master/servant relationship whereby the worker can be summarily given notice,\" she said. \nShe said the Attorney General was reviewing the judgement. \"We want a win-win situation,\" she added. \nThe Supreme Court ruling has received mixed reactions from ordinary Zimbabweans. Some feel it will liberalise the business environment, and make it more appealing to investors. Others have condemned it. \n\"This [judgement] is bad for everyone, including Zanu-PF. It will be bad for keeping their working class masses pacified,\" wrote Taff Gidi on Twitter. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:25:58.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
