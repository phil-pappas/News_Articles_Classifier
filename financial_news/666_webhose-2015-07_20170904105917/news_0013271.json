Photo: Glenn Hunt\nCredit unions, building societies and mutual banks want regulators to let them raise equity that pays franked dividends and counts as loss-absorbing capital to give them a funding source to satisfy yield-hungry investors to stay competitive with the majors.\nMutual lender Bank Mecu last week called on the Senate inquiry into the mutual sector to consider the option.\nIt would be ideal if we could pay dividends to investors and have it recognised as CET1 by the prudential regulator.\nDamien Walsh, Bank Mecu Chief executive Damien Walsh said it would be akin to equity that a listed bank could raise, paying a dividend that the lender has already paid tax on, and be counted as common equity tier-one capital – considered the safest form by regulators because the bank can choose to retain all of it in the event of a crisis – but investors would not have voting rights. Mutual lenders would also not be able to issues as much profit as dividends as listed banks.\n\"Our customers are our shareholders and we are building a large level of franking credits now, but we can't deploy them,\" he said. \"It would be ideal if we could pay dividends to investors and have it recognised as CET1 by the prudential regulator. Our primary source of capital now is our retained earnings and that is a slow build. This would enable us to grow the business at quicker pace.\" Mr Walsh said it would also lower their risk because they would have more diverse sources of capital.\nAdvertisement Their funding disadvantage has meant mutual lenders have been unable to make the big investments in technology that listed banks have been making in recent years to keep up with customer demands and keep ahead of the many digital challengers to banking.\nMr Walsh pointed to the recently completed non-voting equity issue by Murray Goulburn, a farmer owned co-operative, at a $1 per share to its existing supplier owners as a good example of what he wants to be able to do. (Separately, Murray Goulburn has also since listed non-voting shares on the Australian Securities Exchange).\nHow the GFC changed the game The Customer Owned Banking Association represents about 100 mutual lenders. It also asked the Murray financial system inquiry to recommend the change.\nChief executive Mark Degotardi said mutual lenders did have the ability to raise this form of capital prior to the financial crisis but updates to global banking rules had removed the option.\n\"Listed [authorised deposit taking institutions] regularly issue regulatory capital and it is important that customer-owned ADIs also have the capacity to do so,\" he said. He said there are three tiers of regulatory capital under the so-called Basel III framework introduced after the global financial crisis – CET1, AT1 and T2 – with varying capacity to absorb losses.\n\"Prior to the GFC, customer-owned ADIs were able to issue all forms of regulatory capital. However, APRA's implementation of the post-GFC Basel III reforms has resulted in customer-owned banking institutions no longer being able to issue instruments that qualify as the strongest form of regulatory capital – CET1.\"\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has made changes to allow his members to issue the other forms of regulatory capital, but he did not see any reason why it shouldn't go further, Mr Degotardi said.\n\"Other jurisdictions, such as the UK, have successfully accommodated the mutual model into the Basel III capital framework,\" he said. \"APRA needs to be more positive about accommodating the customer-owned model. A failure to adequately accommodate our model has implications for consumer choice and banking competition.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/cyber-banking-badly-hurting-credit-unions-20141028-11dbw8"], "published": "2015-07-05T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T23:39:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
