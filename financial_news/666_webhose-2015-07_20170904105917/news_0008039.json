It joins a group of other centers across the globe that manage the company’s e-commerce operations. This new center adds capabilities that ensure the company’s official websites will be monitored 24/7 and that any issues can be quickly addressed. \nThe building will house 500 associates and technologists and an interactive 40-foot Prysm video wall, which can track website traffic and orders from the company’s 245 million weekly customers. \nThe office is located at 680 W. California and is the fifth building in the Bay Area for Walmart Global eCommerce. The division’s first Bay Area location, in San Bruno, also serves as a network operation center. \nPhoto: Inside Walmart’s new network operation center in Sunnyvale (Courtesy of Walmart) Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T22:23:46.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
