It plans to use proceeds from the IPO to repay debt.\nKKR acquired First Data in 2007 in a leveraged buyout valued at $29.8 billion, financing the transaction with more than $20 billion of loans and bonds. The Atlanta-based company struggled under its debt load for several years under a succession of chief executive officers.\nIn 2013, KKR recruited Frank Bisignano, 55, from JPMorgan Chase & Co. as CEO and raised an additional $3.5 billion in equity, with the private equity firm kicking in $1.2 billion. That raised KKR’s equity investment to $3.9 billion, its biggest ever in a single company.\nBisignano has led a revival in large part by adding capabilities through acquisitions such as Clover Network Inc., a cloud-based payment software developer; Perka Inc., a digital rewards-program designer; Gyft Inc., a mobile gift-card company; and Transaction Wireless Inc., a digital gift-card distribution platform it bought last week.\nFirst Data runs a debit-card network and processes bank-card transactions for banks and merchants. In 2014, it processed more than 2,300 transactions per second, according to the filing. The company also helps small businesses detect fraud, and provides data analytics and other services to merchants.\nLast year, First Data posted $11.2 billion in revenue, an increase of 3.2 percent from 2013, according to the filing. The company hasn’t turned an annual profit since its buyout in 2007.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T23:53:27.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
