The real liability is if the Odebrecht executives currently in prison . . . including the company’s president Marcelo Odebrecht, choose to co-operate with authorities,” said Joao Augusto de Castro Neves of Eurasia Group in a note. \n“Notably, Alexandrino Alencar, Odebrecht’s head of institutional relations, is one of those imprisoned, and was the person that accompanied the former president on the trips in question.” \nMr Lula da Silva has denied any wrongdoing.
