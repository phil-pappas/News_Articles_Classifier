Higher-rate taxpayers will pay 32.5 per cent, up from 25 per cent currently. Additional rate taxpayers who earn more than £150,000 a year face a charge of 38.1 per cent on the dividend income, up from 30.56 per cent today. \nThe Budget document said: \"While these rates remain below the main rates of income tax, those who receive significant dividend income - for example due to very large shareholdings or as a result of receiving significant dividends through a closed company - will pay more.\" \nThe dividends paid by companies to shareholders average around 3.5 per cent. So someone who holds more than £140,000 worth of shares is likely to pay increased taxes. \nCalculations published by the Treasury showed the changes will raise £6.76 billion over the next five years. \ndan.hyde@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T22:23:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
