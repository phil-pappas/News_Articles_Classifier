By Ed Monk | Telegraph – 20 minutes ago 120.40 +0.90 \nA key change to allow more foreign ownership in the country could help it transition from 'frontier' status \nVietnam is on the hard road from being a ’frontier’ market to an ‘emerging’ one. \nAs an indication of the risk investors still attach to it, Vietnam sits in the MSCI Frontiers Market Index alongside Bangladesh, Ghana, Ukraine and Jamaica. \nAlong with the ups and downs of a juvenile stock market it has crashed twice since launch in 2000 and a relatively small number of domestic investors you can throw in a Communist government that has been happy to meddle directly in companies where it sees fit. \nYet Vietnam has long excited professional investors with its potential and there are signs it may now be at a key point in its development. \nSpecifically, a change to the law on foreign ownership is about to open the country up to overseas investors. \nThe main VN Index in Vietnam has suffered many iups and downs. Source: Tradingeconomics.com \nA cap had limited foreigners to owning no more than 49pc of a listed company but the restriction has now been removed for many firms, although it still applies in some sectors, such as banking. \nNext (Other OTC: NXGPF - news ) up is an appeal to index compilers MSCI (NYSE: MSCI - news ) to upgrade to its status from \"frontier\" to \"emerging\", a change that would make it eligible for an even greater pool of investors. \n• More fund news and ideas: bookmark telegraph.co.uk/investing \nUp to now, funds wanting exposure to Vietnam have bought domestic investment trusts in the country. UK Funds have struggled to buy shares in Vietnamese companies directly. \nThe Pacific Horizon Investment Trust is managed by Bailie Gifford and invests across Asia, excluding Japan. It has a small 1.1pc exposure to Vietnam through shares in the Dragon Capital (Other OTC: DRGV - news ) investment trust, but the company wants to expand this. \nManager Ewan Markson-Brown said: “We have applied to be able to own shares directly so that we’re ready for the limits being lifted. As stock pickers we want to able to find our own opportunities, rather than track the market.” \nMr Markson-Brown said there were signs development in Vietnam is about to accelerate. Levels of education and skills are relatively high and the Politburo is interfering less with the economy. \nOther soft indicators, such as the proportion of the population with a smartphone, also point to an economy ready to leap forward, he said. \n• Get ahead with the latest investment ideas and tips sent directly to you \n“I’ve lost count of the number of Chinese companies who have told me they are looking to locate manufacturing in Vietnam. Exports there could grow sharply,” Mr Markson-Brown said. \"It's hard to put a figure on it but I'd say it is about 15 or 20 years behind China in its development and it could overtake countries like Thailand and Indonesia over the long term.\" \nThe VN Index is up 13.3pc in a year but 19.5pc so far in 2015 and is currently priced at 14 times earnings. Mr Markson-Brown added, however, that this may undervalue shares. The country has been feeling a credit drought and company earnings are set to rise once bank lending increases, he said. \nFor ordinary investors, Vietnam is likely to be only a very small part of a portfolio. Exposure is likely to be through funds that invest across the Asia region. \nLaith Khalaf from Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) likes First State Asian Pacific Leaders and Aberdeen Asia Pacific for investing in the region. The funds cost 0.92pc and 1.18pc respectively on an ongoing basis. \nThe DB X-Trackers FTSE Vietnam ETF costs 0.85pc and tracks a FTSE index of Vietnamese companies. However, tracking the VN Index closely has been difficult, in part due to the foreign ownership rules", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T11:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T11:55:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
