Gallup’s Economic Confidence Index clocked in at -12 last week, which mirrors the weekly averages since the beginning of July. While the weekly averages remain stable, the three-day rolling averages have indicated the level of confidence in the economy has recently fluctuated. ADVERTISEMENT In early July, for example, the index clocked in at -9, dropped to -12 and reached -17 around the time Greece struck a deal to remain in the eurozone.\nGallup said the debt crisis rattled Americans, but confidence “rebounded as quickly as it fell after Greece and its creditors worked out a new deal. As a result, the index last week looks stable, even though it went on a short-term roller-coaster ride.” Gallup's Economic Confidence Index is the average of two things: how people view the economy and whether they feel the economy is improving or getting worse. Last week, a quarter of the public said the economic conditions were “excellent” or “good” and 30 percent described them as “poor.” Thirty-nine percent said the economy is improving and 57 percent said it’s getting worse. The poll surveyed 3,551 adults between July 13 and 19 with a 2 percentage point margin of error.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:33:05.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
