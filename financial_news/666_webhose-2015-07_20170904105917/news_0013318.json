Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Australia will be without a single finance minister for the next week and a half, leaving small business minister Bruce Billson in charge should Greece be thrown out of the European Union or the Chinese economy worsen.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey, who returned from Hong Kong on Tuesday, is on holiday until the end of next week, while Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is on a long-planned family holiday overseas.\nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann is in Europe with a business delegation trying to build trade links and is due home at the end of next week.\nConsequently, Mr Billson will be acting Treasurer for the next week and a half.\nTwo days ago, while in China, Mr Hockey assured that Australia was \"well placed\" for Greek exit .\n\"Treasury has been engaging with the Reserve Bank, Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and Australian Securities and Investments Commission and we are monitoring the situation closely,\" he said.\nAnd RBA governor Glenn Stevens said from London overnight that Australia's exposure to Greece was \"miniscule\" .\nMr Hockey, who has a young family, received a touch up for going to Fiji this time last year , the same week as the new Senate sat and his budget was in diabolical trouble.\n Labor's treasurer spokesman Chris Bowen said it was \"clearly not appropriate for a junior minister to be acting Treasurer and acting Finance Minister for the best part of two weeks.\n\"This is poor management by the Government and the Prime Minister's office,\" Mr Bowen said.\n\"It wasn't too long ago that the Abbott Government was screaming the house down claiming Australia was in danger of a Greek debt crisis, now, as soon as Greece defaults on it's debt repayments and the consequential global uncertainty that flows from this, it's feet up from the Abbott government.\"\nA spokeswoman for Mr Billson took umbrage at Mr Bowen describing him as junior.\n\"This is typical of Labor. While Labor sees the small business portfolio as a junior position the Coalition sees it as a valued senior post. That is why on coming to government we elevated the small business\nportfolio into a standalone Cabinet position,\" she said.\n\"It is why we have delivered the largest Jobs and Small Business package in the nation's history because we understand the importance of the sector. Labor has always said they have never been a party for small business and a statement like this backs that up.\n\"Under Labor there was a revolving door of small business ministers with six in six years. Cleary with\nstatements like this Bowen and Labor don't understand the importance of small business to the economy or value the portfolio.\"\nTreasury is also keeping a close eye on wild swings in the Chinese stock markets after a government crackdown on lending standards triggered a fall.\nOvernight Tuesday, Greece missed a deadline to repay the International Monetary Fund $1.5 billion Euro, the biggest missed payment in IMF history.\n\"We have informed our executive board that Greece is now in arrears and can only receive IMF financing once the arrears are cleared,\" said IMF spokesman Gerry Rice.\nIf Greece were expelled from the Eurozone, it would be an unprecedented event which could severely test the stability of global financial markets and potentially trigger a fresh downturn in economic growth.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-01T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T11:06:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
