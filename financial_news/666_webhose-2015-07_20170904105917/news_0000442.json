The announcement, after 17 hours of gruelling talks at an emergency summit, ended a six-month crisis that has kept traders on edge. \nOn Wall Street the Dow jumped 1.22 percent, the S&P 500 added 1.11 percent and Nasdaq gained 1.48 percent. \nAnd European equities advanced. France's CAC 40 climbed 1.94 percent and Germany's DAX 30 put on 1.49 percent, while Milan rose 1.00 percent and Madrid gained 1.70 percent. \nWith the crisis out of the way for now, investors turned their focus back to the Fed's plans for raising interest rates, pushing the dollar up against the yen and the euro. \n\"As long as this deal holds, a potential roadblock to Fed policy normalisation has been removed with the liftoff from later this year still on track,\" Mark Smith, a senior economist in Auckland at ANZ Bank New Zealand, wrote in a client note, according to Bloomberg News. \nWith Fed chief Janet Yellen previously saying she expects a rise by the end of this year and a US recovery picking up, dealers are piling back into the dollar. The unit rose to 123.50 yen in Tokyo Tuesday from 123.45 yen in New York. The euro also eased to $1.0986 from $1.1004. \nThe single European currency was, however, up at 135.90 yen against 135.84 yen in US trade. \n- Oil hit by Iran deal - \nMarkets will be watching a slew of US data this week for a better handle on what the Fed will do, including figures on industrial output, housing starts, inflation and consumer sentiment. \nIn China, hundreds of firms resume trading Tuesday, adding to the more than 400 that returned Monday, after they were suspended over the past few weeks to prevent a market meltdown. At the height of the crisis half the market's shares were put in a trading halt. \nAuthorities intervened after the Shanghai index plunged 30 percent in three weeks, wiping trillions of dollars from market capitalisations, spreading contagion in regional markets and raising fears over the potential impact to the real economy. \nMarket watchers are awaiting the release of growth data Wednesday to see if the world's number two economy has picked up after suffering a continuous slowdown for more than a year. \nOil prices slipped Western powers as crude-rich Iran agreed a deal to curb Tehran's nuclear programme that is expected to see the lifting of sanctions on the country that have curtailed its key exports. \nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate for August delivery fell $1.22 to $50.98 and Brent eased $1.16 to $56.69. \nGold fetched $1,155.07 compared with $1,156.64 late Monday. \nIn other markets: \n-- Wellington rose 0.77 percent, or 44.18 points, to 5,750.88. \nXero (Other OTC: XROLF - news ) was up 0.82 percent at NZ$17.20 and Spark gained 2.34 percent to close at NZ$2.84. \n-- Taipei ended slightly higher, adding 7.84 points to 9,041.76. \nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co was unchanged at Tw$138.5 while Hon Hai Precision closed 1.56 percent lower at Tw$94.7.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T10:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T11:35:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
