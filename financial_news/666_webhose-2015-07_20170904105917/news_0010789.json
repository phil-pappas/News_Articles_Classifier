Aviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) was the highest riser just before close on Wednesday, after the Budget saw the chancellor reduce the tax advantages of buy-to-let by capping mortgage interest cost relief at the basic rate, which some analysts argued may be positive for retail investment companies. No news on further pension reforms and a proposal to look into incentivising saving also boded well for the insurance, savings and investment company. \nSector peer Old Mutual (Other OTC: ODMTY - news ) was also among the top ten highest risers. \nDespite the ongoing slump for commodities prices, traders and investors took advantage of lower prices of the likes of Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) and Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) in anticipation of a bounce-back. \nGoing the other way were housebuilding companies and banks, as several proeprty-focused budget measures spooked the market. \nThe Chancellor's clampdown on tax relief on mortgage interest for buy-to-let landlords was said to be negative for sentiment for those companies that are exposed to BTL lending, although it was not expected to affect them directly. \nTightened rules on \"non-dom\" tax status was also weighing on the property sector as it would drive wealthy foreigners out of the property market, in London especially. \nBarratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) , Taylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) and Persimmon (Other OTC: PSMMF - news ) all suffered sizeable losses during the afternoon. \nBanks were expected to benefit from the Chancellor's decision to amend the bank levy, which he did, cutting it from its current 0.21% to 0.1% in 2021, however he introduced another new bank-specific tax. A new an 8% surcharge on bank's profits will be introduced from the start of 2016. \nLloyds and Standard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) were both among the leading fallers. \nFTSE 100 - Risers Aviva (AV.) 497.10p +3.50% BAE Systems (LSE: BA.L - news ) (BA.) 460.90p +3.46% Glencore (GLEN) 237.90p +3.17% Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) 'B' (RDSB) 1,812.50p +2.90% Hikma Pharmaceuticals (LSE: HIK.L - news ) (HIK) 2,010.00p +2.87% Royal Dutch Shell 'A' (RDSA) 1,801.50p +2.77% Old Mutual (OML) 204.50p +2.76% Wolseley (WOS) 4,020.00p +2.39% Unilever (ULVR) 2,777.00p +2.32% Imperial Tobacco Group (IMT) 3,163.00p +2.23% FTSE 100 - Fallers Barratt Developments (BDEV) 594.50p -5.71% Taylor Wimpey (TW.) 176.20p -5.01% Persimmon (PSN) 1,876.00p -4.67% Marks & Spencer Group (MKS) 521.50p -2.52% Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY) 82.33p -1.99% Morrison (Wm) Supermarkets (MRW) 167.40p -1.47% Standard Chartered (STAN) 984.10p -1.46% ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) (ARM) 1,017.00p -1.36% Kingfisher (KGF) 341.10p -1.22% Aberdeen Asset Management (Other OTC: ABDNF - news ) (ADN) 385.30p -1.21%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T02:59:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
