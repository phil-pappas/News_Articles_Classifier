They’ve also been hit as a bet they made on deep-sea oil rigs beginning in 2010 has been undercut by the sharp fall in crude oil prices over the past year. \nSamsung Heavy shares rose 1.1 percent Wednesday to 14,200 won before the earnings release. \nTo contact the reporter on this story: Michael S.
