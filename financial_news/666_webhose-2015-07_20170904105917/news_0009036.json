They are similar to petrochemicals with advantages that these are pollution free biodegradable and low on toxic levels. They are used in the production of lubricants biodiesel and bioplastics.\nTechnavio's analysts forecast the global oleochemicals market to grow at a CAGR of 5.95% by value during 2015-2019.\nGet More Details on this Report and a Full Table of Contents at \nThe report analyst commented \"The end-user industries are varied when it comes to the use of oleochemicals for the production of various products. There has been a gradual shift in the end-user industries using oleochemicals and there is a likelihood of various new end-user segments switching to oleochemicals to offer products with new functionalities in terms of raw materials and the processes employed to manufacture them. The advancements in technology as well as chemistry will provide opportunities for alternative products/processes leading to a number of new products being developed in the forecast period. This will create intense rivalry in the whole value chain of oleochemicals as vendors will offer varied product portfolios.\"\nAccording to the report the usage of oleochemicals to produce fatty acid provides a viable option for using bio-based products for the personal care industry giving a push to the global oleochemicals market. The increase in the output of the feedstock industries will result in an increase in the output of oleochemicals manufactured globally which in turn will give rise to personal care and allied industries.\nFurther the report states that the major challenge is the lack of a continuous supply of feedstock for the production of oleochemical products.\nThe key players in the Global Oleochemicals Market are Cargill Emery Oleochemicals Evyap Godrej Industries Myriant P&G Chemicals and PTT Global Chemical while other prominent vendors include Amyris Codexis Gevo and Wilmar International\nThe study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.\nAbout Fast Market Research\nFast Market Research is a leading distributor of market research and business information.
