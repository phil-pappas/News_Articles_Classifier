The jump was far stronger than expectations for a 0.6 point rise. \nAny number above 50 would imply that the sector was rising, and with a PMI closer to 60, the survey suggests that construction output grew fiercely. \nTim Moore, senior economist at Markit, which compiled the report, said: \"Construction companies experienced a growth rebound and surge in business confidence at the end of the second quarter.\" \nHome building remained the strongest element of the construction industry in June, with improving demand and full order books helping to buoy the sector across the board. \nAlan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said: \"Having spoken to people at the coalface, I gather that there is a bit of an election effect going on here.\" \nHe said: \"We suspect that there was an effort to minimise disruption from construction ahead of the election in order to minimise the feel-bad factor. Various projects were likely to have been held back to do this. So what we may be seeing here is a post-election catch-up.\" \nThe construction sector's health meant that employers in the industry were able to hire staff at the fastest rate since last year. \n\"The extent of the recent rise in construction optimism is partly down to relief that pre-election uncertainty has now passed, but it also suggests that firms are infused with confidence that underlying demand will continue to recover,\" Mr Moore said. \nThe Markit data comes two days after an adjustment in the way construction data is calculated prompted the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to upgrade its growth estimates for the UK economy in the first quarter. \nStefan Friedhoff, of Lloyds Bank, said: \"The upward revision in the ONS data last month was widely welcomed as more accurately reflecting a fairly buoyant sector, something underlined by this [Markit] survey. \n\"There is confidence in the market, particularly given the business environment has become more stable over the past two months.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T13:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T02:09:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
