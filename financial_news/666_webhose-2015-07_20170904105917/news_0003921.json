Prior to Monday, the volume for July had averaged at fewer than 30,000 lots.\nThe Chinese have snubbed gold in favour of equities for the most part of this year, fuelling a rally in stock prices before a meltdown earlier this month and subsequent recovery.\n\"People are worried about the fact that if China starts to falter, the general public there will also start to sell their gold and that would be a big problem for the gold market more widely,\" the U.S. trader said.\nChina is the world's largest consumer and producer of gold, with an output of 438.20 tonnes in 2013, according to GFMS Thomson Reuters data.\n\"Asian gold divestment would have an impact on people trading in the Western world ... at some point it would not surprise me to see gold down below $1,000,\" the trader added.\nMonday marked the sixth straight day of decline for gold, which took a hit last week after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the U.S. central bank is on course to raise interest rates this year if the U.S. economy expands as expected.\nBut the speed and magnitude of Monday's fall shocked some traders, many of whom had been used to gold's lethargic trading this year, despite the Greek debt crisis and China's stock rout.\nA Singapore-based trader said stop-loss orders had added to the slump after the Chinese market opened.\nHoldings at SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, dropped more than 11 tonnes to 696.25 tonnes on Friday.\nThat outflow was the largest in a single day since 2014, said Victor Thianpiriya, an analyst at ANZ Bank.\n\"Clearly the market momentum is down. We've had a price forecast of $1,100 in the short term, but it looks like the market is certainly trading very much on the weak side and could test levels below $1,100 and stay there for some time,\" Thianpiriya said.\n(Editing by Ed Davies , Veronica Brown and Dale Hudson )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T18:39:14.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
