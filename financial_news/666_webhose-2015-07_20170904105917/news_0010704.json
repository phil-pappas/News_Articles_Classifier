That number is likely conservative because The Financial Times gathered data from LinkedIn , and not all Twitter employees have LinkedIn accounts, but it certainly shows that there is some chaos at Twitter. Despite the departures, Twitter's total headcount has increased 18% over the last year, according to The Financial Times .

Twitter's disappointing first-quarter results eventually led to Dick Costolo stepping down as CEO and Jack Dorsey coming in as interim CEO while the company continues to look for a permanent CEO.Since April, shares of Twitter have dropped more than 34% amid concerns about slowing user growth. \nOn top of Costolo, Gabriel Stricker, Twitter's head of communications, left about two weeks ago; Chloe Sladden, vice president of media, left the company in August; Vivian Schiller, who was the head of news and journalism partnerships at Twitter, left in October, after just 10 months; and April Underwood, director of product, left in February. Other notable employees who have left in the last year or so include Jim Payne, who was the chief executive of mobile ad serving company MoPub when it was acquired by Twitter; Rishi Garg, head of corporate development; early Twitter employee Jessica Verrilli; Cynthia Gaylor, who led corporate development; and Chief Operating Officer Ali Rowghani. \nAfter Garg left Twitter in June, SunTrust analyst Bob Peck noted in a research note that the succession of departures \"underscores a 'brain drain' risk for the company\" and that Twitter should work fast to get a new CEO on board to stem the losses before they get any worse. \"While some key talent may leave the company while it is in flux, it may also be difficult to hire new key talent without a permanent CEO being in place,\" he wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T17:33:13.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
