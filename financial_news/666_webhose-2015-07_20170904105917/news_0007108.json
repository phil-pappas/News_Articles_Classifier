More Web of sanctions not easy to unravel \nTurkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu told reporters that the bomb was a “terror attack, most likely a suicide bomb”. Witnesses interviewed on Turkey ’s CNN Turk television channel said the blast was the work of a suicide bomber. \nTurkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, speaking in Turkish Cyprus, condemned the attack: “I condemn the perpetrators of this atrocity. Terror has no religion, no race, no nationality, no nation and no country — we have always stood strong in the international struggle against terror.” \nNo group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but suspicion has fallen on the Islamic   Levant (Isis) which has fought Syrian Kurdish forces for control of Kobani. \nIf Isis is shown to be responsible, it will be its first terrorist attack on Turkish soil and will increase pressure on Ankara to take more direct action against the group. \n“Ankara cannot afford to let down its guard regarding IS [Isis] otherwise this could spiral into a Turkish conflict,” warned Nigar Goksel, senior Turkey analyst at International Crisis Group. She pointed out that there is the risk of the conflict in Syria between the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) and Isis is being mirrored by a parallel conflict inside Turkey between the Kurdish separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and Isis supporting Islamist Kurds. \n“The government has to get the peace process [with the Kurds] back on track, otherwise it won’t be able to deal with the spillover from the crisis in Syria,” she said. \nTurkish police arrested 21 suspected members of the group 10 days ago, seizing firearms and homemade explosives, and last week banned three internet sites carrying Isis propaganda. \nHowever, these moves have widely been derided as too little and too late. Opposition Turkish politicians say several thousand Turks are fighting with Isis in Syria and allege the group has established a large support network in Turkey. \nThe explosion came shortly after midday outside the Suruc Amara cultural centre in the predominantly Kurdish town of Suruc. A garden in front of the centre was being used for the press conference and breakfast by the Sosyalist Gençlik Dernekleri Federasyon youth group, whose members also planned to establish a library and clear rubble from public parks in Kobani. \nPictures posted on social media showed about 50 group members and media representatives seated around tables eating breakfast just before the explosion. \nTurkey has been criticised for failing to offer adequate help to thousands of refugees who tried to escape fighting between Isis and Kurdish forces in the battle for Kobani and its aftermath last month. \nAnkara is also facing allegations it has failed to tighten security along its 911km border with Syria and has allowed Isis fighters to cross into Syria at will in order to prevent the expansion of a Kurdish enclave in north Syria. Turkish officials deny the allegations. Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T20:02:24.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
