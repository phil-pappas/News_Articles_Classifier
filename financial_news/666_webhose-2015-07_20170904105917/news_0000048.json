Bank of America reached a similar, slightly larger settlement with regulators in 2014 and JPMorgan Chase was fined in 2013. \nUnder its agreement with the CFPB, Citi will issue refunds to 8.8 million affected consumers who paid for these types of add-on products, and will pay two separate $35 million fines to the CFPB and to the federal bank regulator the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. \nThe settlement comes on the five-year anniversary of the creation of the CFPB, which came into existence through the passage of the Dodd-Frank law that overhauled the financial industry following the 2008 financial crisis. \n\"We continue to uncover illegal credit card add-on practices that are costing unknowing consumers millions of dollars,\" CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a statement. \n\"This is the tenth action we've taken against companies in this space for deceiving consumers.\" Advertisement \nSome of the illegal activity by Citi goes back to as early as 2000, the CFPB said, and ended in 2013, and covers a range of products sold by Citi and third-party affiliates. \nIn one allegation, Citi telemarketers were said to have sold consumers identity theft protection services with a 30-day \"free\" trial, when no such free trial existed; or signed up consumers for an add-on service when it was ambiguous whether the consumer actually said they wanted it. \nIn another situation, Citi sold credit monitoring services when Citi wasn't performing such services. \nCiti also allegedly misrepresented its customers by charging a $14.95 \"expedited\" payment fee to customers who made over-the-phone payments and did not tell consumers about no-fee options. \nCredit card add-on services were a lucrative source of revenue for banks for several years, sold to consumers as ways to protect their credit scores or identities or protect them if they lost their jobs. \nBanks' marketing of such services largely ended after increased regulatory scrutiny.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T10:27:32.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
