He is expected to provide extra detail on a new law, delivering on a promise to always deliver budget surpluses in “normal times”. \nSource: HSBC, OBR \nIf the Treasury defines “normal times” in a way that will require even deeper spending cuts than planned, the new rules could threaten economic growth, the EY Item Club has warned. \nMartin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: “The Chancellor’s new fiscal rule could entail an even tighter fiscal squeeze and even greater departmental cuts may be on the cards if he seeks to achieve his surplus target within the next two years.” \nIf the Chancellor defines “normal times” as when spare capacity in the economy is eliminated, then he may look to enforce the rule from 2017/18, when official forecasts published in March predicted this would occur. \n“With the Bank of England in a limited position to respond with looser monetary policy, the result could be weaker growth,” Mr Beck said. The Bank’s interest rates have remained “flat on the floor” at 0.5pc for more than six years, he added, leaving only further QE as a viable option to counteract harsher austerity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T03:17:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
