The court will rule ahead of that meeting on a second injunction requested by Elliott to stop a Samsung ally from voting treasury shares bought from the target.\nToday’s ruling by the Seoul Central District Court paves the way for the July 17 shareholder meeting, making it more likely the merger will proceed. It’s a relief to the nation’s largest conglomerate and the Lee family that controls it as they prepare for a once-in-a-generation leadership transition from hospitalized Samsung patriarch Lee Kun Hee.\n“I see the merger proceeding as planned, as it will be tough for Elliott to find issues with the merger within Korean rules,” said Lee Jin Woo, money manager at KTB Asset Management Co., which oversees $10 billion. “The court decision was just as expected.”\nSamsung C&T Corp. shares rose as much as 3.6 percent following the ruling, and traded up 2 percent to 67,500 won in Seoul trading as of 11:18 a.m. Cheil Industries rose 3.1 percent while the benchmark Kospi gained 0.8 percent.\nFamily Grip Cheil’s acquisition of Samsung C&T would tighten the grip of 47-year-old Lee Jae Yong, the founder’s grandson, as he positions himself to take control of the conglomerate, a collection of 67 companies generating about $270 billion in annual revenue.\nIn the proposed deal, the de facto holding company Cheil would acquire Samsung C&T, solidifying Lee family control over crown jewel, Samsung Electronics Co. C&T also owns about $10.7 billion of group company shares, making it a vital asset to Lee and his siblings who control Cheil.\nSinger took a stake in Samsung C&T and has argued that the $8.7 billion all-stock takeover offer from Cheil “significantly undervalues” the target’s worth. Cheil’s all-stock offer is valued at about 6.2 percent below C&T’s latest closing price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nStill, today’s verdict doesn’t guarantee a victory for either party at the shareholder meeting. The deal needs the approval of at least two-thirds of votes with lobbying other investors to join their campaigns.\nElliott has also sought an injunction to stop KCC Corp., an ally of the Lee family , from voting Samsung C&T treasury shares it bought on June 11 in favor of the deal. The court said today it would make a decision before the shareholder meeting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T05:47:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
