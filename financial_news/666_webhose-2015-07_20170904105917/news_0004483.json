Bloomberg Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Treasurer Joe Hockey will pressure the state governments to rethink their opposition to increasing the GST, saying the taxation capacities of each level of government should match their spending requirements.\nIn a speech outlining the principles for the Coalition's tax reform plans, Mr Hockey on Wednesday will call on states to use a summit next week with Prime Minister Tony Abbott to take responsibility for their budgets and wholly fund such services as public hospitals and public schools.\n\"Surely it is not beyond the capacity of us as a country to have a sensible, mature debate about long-term tax reform more generally,\" he will tell a PwC tax reform forum.\nSo far, the NSW Liberal government has been open-minded about the GST while South Australian Labor Premier Jay Weatherill says it should be extended to financial services . But otherwise, Mr Hockey's push will probably encounter resistance at the state level.\nHe also wants lower income and company taxes, lower capital gains taxes, more incentives for start-ups and innovation, tax incentives to decrease welfare dependency, and a reluctance to tax or legislate digital disrupters.\n\"It simply won't work if governments try to tax or legislate them out of existence,\" he will say.\nMr Hockey will say that many of the submissions to the tax white paper process have called for increasing the rate or base of the GST, or both, and for the states to abolish remaining inefficient duties and taxes.\n\"As best as possible, the revenue-raising capacity of each tier of government should be aligned to responsibilities of funding and service delivery,\" his speech notes say.\n \"Our current federal system clearly fails this objective. Because of the high concentration of revenue-raising capacity at the federal level, vertical fiscal imbalance is higher in Australia than in other federations.\n\"Not only do the states and territories raise considerably less revenue than they spend, around a third of their tax is from inefficient taxes: stamp duties on real and intangible property, insurance duties and so forth.\"\nFederal Labor and the states oppose a GST increase and Mr Hockey will stress that the federal government will only move on the GST if there is unanimous support.\n\"When it comes to the GST, let me be very clear: no change will be considered without the unanimous agreement of state and territory governments and bipartisan support in the federal Parliament,\" he will say.\nMr Hockey will point out that states such as NSW, Queensland and Western Australia have failed to dump some of the inefficient taxes that were meant to go when the GST was introduced in 2000.\nMr Hockey will say next week's leaders' summit would be \"a real opportunity for a constructive discussion about reforming our federation\".\n\"This must include the states taking responsibility for their own budgets in order to ensure they can afford their ever-increasing expenditure,\" he will say.\nWhen Parliament last sat in late July, leaks from the Federation green paper, prepared by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, spoke of giving the states policy and funding autonomy in areas such as public schools and public hospitals.\nOne of five options presented on public hospital funding reform proposes shifting the entire funding and operational responsibility to the states. This would leave the states looking for an extra $18 billion a year if unable to find efficiencies to offset the losses.\nThe Victorian Labor government called it a ploy to try to force the states to increase the GST.\nThe tax white paper was designed to present policy options for the Abbott government to take to the next election. Already, however, it has ruled out changes to superannuation taxes, negative gearing and the GST without unanimous support.\nMr Hockey will say any changes must encourage investment, economic growth and wealth creation.\nProfits should be encouraged and the importance of capital investment in building wealth recognised. Workforce participation must be encouraged and, as part if this, bracket creep addressed.\n\"We must address bracket creep because it is better to leave money in the pocket of the taxpayer and resist the temptation for the government, using taxpayers' money, to provide financial support to individuals and families,\" he will say.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-14T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:11:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
