Construction means thousands of jobs. Some 3000 during construction and 8000 ongoing jobs,\" Ms Palaszczuk said on Monday after cabinet signed off on the bid.\nThe Echo bid was the stand-out because of the better use of public space and because the consortium was ready to start straight away. \"We are very excited about this proposal and what it means for Brisbane – making it a premium tourist destination.\"\nMs Palaszczuk said she liked the Echo proposal because of the large public spaces by the river, which would rival the South Bank Parklands on the other side of Brisbane River.\nEcho is developing the project with Hong-Kong based business partners Chow Tai Fook and Far East Consortium . Collectively it is known as the Destination Brisbane consortium.\nThe trio beat a combined bid from Crown and China's state-backed property developer Greenland Group.\n Properly financed Ms Palaszczuk said Echo won the bid because it was able to show it was properly financed and ready to proceed, although she declined to elaborate on the financial risks of each bid.\n\"The consortium was able to demonstrate they were ready to proceed,\" Ms Palaszczuk said. \"We needed that financial security but also to minimise any risk. I can't go into discussions about the cabinet process, but what I can say is cabinet endorsed the probity checks in relation to this proponent.\"\nState Development Minister Anthony Lyneham said the Echo proposal won them over because it had more open space – room for about 26,000 people – and a greater variety of accommodation, with four, five and six-star hotels.\nThe trio plans to build a new casino, retail and entertainment complex on the banks of Brisbane River, next to Echo's dated Treasury Casino, opening in 2022.\nConstruction of the project is due to begin by late 2016.\nEcho, the owner of Sydney's The Star casino, headed by chief executive Matt Bekier, will move its headquarters to Brisbane from Sydney.\nMr Bekier said the development was an \"exciting\" opportunity for Queensland and the consortium would share more details about it on Tuesday.\n\"We're delighted the Government shares our vision to develop Queen's Wharf Brisbane into the best integrated resort in Australia, and one for which Brisbane will be globally recognised,\" he siad.\n\"It will be an asset for this state that will compete with anything around the world – a development of which the people of Brisbane will be immensely proud.\"\nEcho's win comes two years after Crown, chaired by Mr Packer, won a long-running battle to establish a second casino in Sydney in the Barangaroo development on Darling Harbour.\nPiled on pressure The opening of the Crown Sydney resort, due in late 2019, will mean Echo will lose its exclusive casino licence in the NSW capital and has piled pressure on the company to find new expansion options.\nEcho is throwing in 50 per cent of the capital to develop the resort, with its joint venture partners splitting the balance with 25 per cent each. Echo will focus on running the resort, while its international partners will undertake the residential piece of the project.\nDeutsche estimates Echo will pay up to $750 million for the development and possibly receive extra compensation for its existing Brisbane casino licence, while Credit Suisse has estimated the development cost of the entire site could hit $2 billion, meaning Echo could need to spend more than $1 billion from 2017.\nThe Queen's Wharf decision is a massive boost for the Palaszczuk Labor government, after a luke-warm budget earlier in July.\nThe integrated resort and casino will be the biggest infrastructure project announced in Queensland during Labor's first term, creating thousands of jobs in the already hot Brisbane construction market.\nAlthough the process was started by the former Newman Liberal National Party government in late 2013, the Palaszczuk government will be hoping to glow in the buzz the project is going to create.\nLabor was opposed to the construction of the $650 million 1 William Street tower, next to the state Parliament, saying it was a waste of taxpayers' money.\nNeeded But the building, which has been dubbed the \"Tower of Power\" in Brisbane, is needed to house thousands of public servants who will vacate a string of government buildings, including the Executive Building, to make way for the Queen's Wharf project.\nOne William Street was also partially built by the time the Palaszczuk government came into office, leaving it too late to pull out of the deal.\nDeputy Premier Jackie Trad announced in June the Labor government had trimmed $1 million, so far, off the fit-out at 1 William Street, which will become the government's new executive building.\nEcho has long been the front-runner to win the Queen's Wharf project because it already holds Brisbane's existing casino licence at Treasury casino.\nEcho's proposal allowed the new Queen's Wharf project to extend from the top of Queen Street mall, along George Street, to state Parliament.\nMr Newman was keen for Echo's rival, Crown, to bid for the Queen's Wharf project, suggesting the idea to billionaire James Packer when Packer was holding a meeting with the then premier in 2014.\nHe had been unhappy with Echo's running of the Brisbane and Gold Coast casino and wanted to inject some competitive tension into the new casino licence.\nRead next: Odds favoured Echo in battle for Brisbane", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/queens_wharf_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-07-20T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T23:05:42.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
