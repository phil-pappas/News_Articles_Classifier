Source: News Corp Australia\nCr Lance Bagster, who organised two petitions calling for the lookout to be restored to its former glory, denied any such move would lead to bad behaviour.\n“None of the options will make the lookout a haven for hoons or bad behaviour, mass orgies or boozy parties,” Cr Bagster said.\nIf anything, Cr Bagster said the area had become worse since it was closed to cars and looked like a “war zone”.\nHowever, fellow Burnside Ward councillor Graham Bills said the area had vastly improved since it was closed to traffic.\nCr Bills was the officer-in-charge of Norwood Police Station before he retired in 1999.\nHe said patrols would respond to “five or six” incidents per night at the lookout before it was closed and declared a dry zone.\nHe said reopening it could attract people with “immoral purposes and illegal activity”.\n“We don’t need to act on this at the moment,” Cr Bills said.\n“It can go on the backburner — it has been there already for 14 years.”\nThe Kensington Rd lookout in Wattle Park. Source: Supplied\nAnother councillor, Grant Piggott, said he had seen a mattress at the lookout, but this was refuted by Cr Bagster.\nRather than going ahead with the major upgrade, councillors voted for the axing of the trees.\nThis will cost $14,088, plus $6300 extra in maintenance in the first year.\nThe top carpark will not be reopened to traffic.\nPublic consultation on a further revamp will go ahead once decisions have been made on renaming the lookout as the 100 Years of Anzac Lookout , erecting a memorial at the site and the Development Assessment Commission deciding whether or not to approve plans by quarry company Boral to open a road connecting Kensington Rd near the lookout with McBeath Drive in Skye .", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227461/329513-983be5dc-34f8-11e5-a865-966b1ff02c53.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227461/325933-1ecda270-3580-11e5-b520-2768cb446c97.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-29T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T18:54:55.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
