Photo: Supplied\nOne agent has likened today's property market to Melbourne's fabled gold-rush era after competing buyers, who flew in from China and south-east Asia, scorched a recently set CBD land rate record, paying $82,278 a square metre for a Swanston Street property.\nFive groups from China, Malaysia and Indonesia arrived specifically to tour the property on the corner of Swanston and Little Lonsdale streets opposite the State Library, before it sold for $26 million to a Malaysian investor.\n\"It's the strongest market we've seen. It is probably the strongest since the gold-rush era,\" Savills Australia's Clinton Baxter said.\nAt least $3.84 billion has flowed into Australian commercial property from China alone this year, according to Colliers International.\nAs the flood of money pours into all sectors, it has ignited select city land prices, particularly for development sites and prime retail buildings.\n\"Many local investors were extremely keen to purchase this property, but they simply couldn't match the fire-power of cashed-up private investors from Asia,\" said Mr Baxter, who brokered the deal with colleague Nick Eden.\nThe prominent shop front is leased to an EzyMart and other retail spaces are occupied by fast-food restaurants and a video gaming centre. All up they return rental income of $1,013,000 a year.\nThe building's prime position on the west side of the high-traffic thoroughfare – Swanston is one of Melbourne's busiest pedestrian streets – and its proximity to the thriving northern university precinct helped achieve a yield of just 3.9 per cent.\nIts sale follows another record-breaking deal last month for an eight-level building, also in Swanston Street, that sold to a Chinese investor for $81,500 a square metre.\nThe heritage-designated 1930s building at 123 Swanston Street – home of Melbourne's Hare Krishnas and their popular Crossways and Gopal vegetarian restaurants – sold for $15.8 million, about $5.8 million or almost 60 per cent more than expected.\nBy comparison, development sites in the city sell for about $20,000 a square metre.\nBoth sites were sold by branches of the same family based in suburban Templestowe and Donvale.\nThe three-level former Brooks building at 319-325 Swanston Street had been rebuilt behind the historic facade about 18 months ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T13:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T14:29:09.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
