Comments \nAlmost £330m worth of compensation was paid to customers of failed financial services firms in 2014/15. \nThe Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) is a free service that protects consumers when authorised financial services firms go bust. It can pay compensation to consumers if a financial services firm is unable, or likely to be unable, to pay claims against it. \nThe FSCS received more than 53,000 new claims in 2014/15, broadly the same number as in the previous year, and paid £327m of compensation to 24,000 people. The bill was up from £243m in 2013/14. \nThe increase is attributed to the rise in complaints about self-invested personal pensions (Sipps). \nThe average compensation payment for claims against independent financial advisers relating to Sipps increased by nearly 50pc to £16,375. That compared with last year’s average payment of £11,104. \nThe FSCS said it expects Sipp-related claims to continue to rise in 2015/16. \nA substantial growth in the numbers of new general insurance claims, which rose from 14,328 to 21,900 last year, also contributed to the larger compensation bill. \nThe FSCS can pay compensation to cover deposits in failed banks, building societies and credit unions, as well as insurance and life and pension claims where a policy was mis-sold or a firm is insolvent. \nIt can also cover protection for investments if investors suffer losses due to bad investment advice, poor investment management, fraud, or where a firm cannot return investments or money owed to customers. \nIt does not pay compensation for a financial service product that has not performed as hoped, or for shares in a company that have become worthless following its collapse. \nTell us your story by emailing money@telegraph.co.uk \nShould you complain to the FSCS?
