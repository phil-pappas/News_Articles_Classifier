Trustco got the 30-year lease in 200. \nAccording to a document obtained by The Namibian, Trustco got the farm on the pretext of running a game ranch, recreational facilities and a livestock farming venture. \nVan Rooyen, who initially promised to answer questions, later declined to do so, saying he was too busy. \nHe also promised to send court documents pertaining to the matter to The Namibian yesterday but he did not. \nAbout a decade ago, Trustco bought Lafrenz farm for N$10 million. Today, the company stands to make more than N$800 million from selling off plots on the 350ha farm. \nAnother beneficiary of Windhoek town lands is Tonny Rossouw, who is leasing two portions of Commonage Farm 1 that measure a combined 5 900 hectares and pays N$15 267,82 per month for both. \nRossouw signed one of the leases for the 3 400ha portion on 1 January 2005 and will still use the farm for the next 19 years. \nAccording to documents, he is using the farm for recreational facilities and livestock farming, while paying N$7 914,04 per month. \nAlthough the other lease for the second portion that measures 2 500ha was signed on the same date, it is renewed every year. For this portion, Rossouw pays N$7 300 per month. \nThe other portion of the farm being leased by Rossouw was sold to Eros Valley Consortium run by businesspeople Sidney Martin, Russell Paschke, Frank Fredericks, Lazarus Jacobs, Desmond Amunyela, Stephen Roy Paschke, Thurstan Salt and Jacobus de la Rey du Toi. It is not clear how big this portion is and how much the consortium paid the municipality. \nCommonage 2, which is 6 000ha, is being leased by the Moltkeblick Game Farm for N$37 000 per month. The lease agreement was signed in 2000 and will run until 2024. \nThe farm borders the Finkenstein Estate owned by former Windhoek mayor Björn Graf Finck von Finckenstein. The estate has 222 own title plots that are selling for millions of dollars. Just recently, a five-bedroom house on a 9 500 square metre plot was sold for N$11 million. \nAlthough it is not clear who owns Moltkeblick, documents obtained by The Namibian show that prominent businessman Gerd Burmeister represented the game farm in an agreement with the Finkenstein Estate when they negotiated a passage through the ranch. \nA farmer named MO Vermeulen has been occupying Commonage 2 since October 1994. The farm, which measures 3 500ha, is used for livestock farming. Vermeulen pays N$7 200 per month. \nPiet Eysselein has been leasing Commonage Farm 5 since June 2000. The 820ha farm serves as a livestock farming area. Eysselein pays N$6 300 per month in rent. \nThe Namibian understands that most of the leases were signed when the former mayor, Von Finkenstein, who later chaired the municipality's management committee, was in charge. \nVon Finkenstein declined to comment yesterday when The Namibian asked him about the questionable leases. \nWindhoek municipality spokesperson Joshua Amukugo yesterday said instructions have been given at a council meeting demanding a full report on council farms and their status. \n\"It will apparently be submitted by next week. We do not want excuses any more. Councillors want to see this report,\" he asserted. \nAmukugo said they have requested statistics about the total number of farms owned by the municipality; how many are being leased and how much is being paid. \nHe said the prices of the current farm lease agreements are \"laughable\". \n\"They are not serious prices. Imagine one rents a house for N$12 000 while another is renting a farm for N$9 000,\" he said. \nMunicipal councillors and executives are trying to distance themselves from the lease agreements. Even though they are doing that, most fear that they have not been honest with the President with regards to available land. \n\"This is troubling. I'm sure President Hage Geingob will not be happy about this,\" said a council source. \nSome executives claimed that they have been in the dark over the lease agreements.
