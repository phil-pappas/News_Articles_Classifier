The company's efforts so far have had minimal success, they said. The social network's shares dropped 7.1 per cent in extended trading, after climbing as much as 12 per cent immediately after the earnings release.\nAs Dorsey works to update Twitter's offerings to attract a broader range of users, its sales team has been making deals -- such as one with Google -- to help advertisers use the site more effectively. While Noto said the company is adding marketing clients, it doesn't expect to see \"sustained, meaningful\" growth in monthly users for a considerable period. Users of the traditional application rose by just 2 million from the prior period -- a gain of less than 1 per cent.\n\"Investors demand a re-acceleration of user growth,\" said Paul Sweeney, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \"We did not see that this quarter to any notable degree.\"\nBefore the report, shares of San Francisco-based Twitter rose 5.3 per cent to $US36.54 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 1.9 per cent this year.\nCEO search\nFormer Twitter boss Dick Costolo was replaced this month on an interim basis by co-founder Dorsey, who also runs Square Inc., a mobile-payments company. Twitter is conducting a search for a permanent CEO, and has ruled out Dorsey as long as he stays full time at Square. On Tuesday, Twitter said there was no update on the search for a new leader.\nIn the second quarter, revenue rose 61 per cent to $US502.4 million ($684 million), the social-media company said Tuesday in a statement. That exceeded analysts' average projection for $US481.9 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nTwitter's net loss narrowed to $US136.7 million, or 21 US cents a share. Profit excluding certain items was 7 US cents, compared with the 4 US cents analysts estimated.\nBigger rivals\nOn a conference call, executives quashed any initial optimism generated by the report by confronting Twitter's underlying problem: It's much smaller than the competition. The company today reported 316 million monthly users, while Facebook's social network has 1.4 billion. Twitter recently started counting feature-phone users in emerging markets as part of its tally. Without that extra boost, Twitter's user count was 304 million.\nNoto said the quarter didn't see much organic user growth, and that the company is working to introduce a marketing campaign to explain the value of using Twitter to the masses. One problem, though, is that Twitter doesn't have a head of marketing. Noto said a search is wrapping up, with some good candidates being reviewed.\nIn the time since Twitter went public in November 2013, growth has stagnated while rival social applications, including WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, drew hundreds of millions more people. As concerns about growth mounted among investors, the company increased its focus on attracting people who don't have accounts.\nLive events\nOne current plan, internally named Project Lightning, is meant to create channels for whatever is happening live, including videos running simultaneously with what's showing on television. The goal is to bring in visitors who might want to experience a live event or watch news unfold in real time. It could also open up new opportunities for advertisers.\nStill, in the past year Twitter has made many promises about new tools that haven't yet contributed to its quarterly results. Investors are concerned that Dorsey won't provide meaningful change at a company in need of a shakeup.\nTwitter said third-quarter sales will be $US545 million to $US560 million, in line with analysts' average projection of $US556.6 million. For the full year, the company forecast revenue of $US2.2 billion to $US2.27 billion, compared with a previous company estimate of $US2.17 billion to $US2.27 billion.\nThe social-media company has faced some turnover internally amid the CEO transition. Today, two product executives announced their departures. Todd Jackson, who helped Twitter debut its Highlights product, is leaving for Dropbox, while Christian Oestlien, who helped drive growth, is going to Google's YouTube.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T07:21:57.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
