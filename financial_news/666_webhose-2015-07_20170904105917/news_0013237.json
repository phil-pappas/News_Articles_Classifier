Lawmakers this year created a program —at a cost of nearly $3 million over the next two years — that will help pay off mental health professionals' student loans if they practice in an underserved area. The loan forgiveness program seeks to alleviate the state's shortage of mental health professionals — including social workers, psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists — by luring them to parts of the state that have significant need for health care but may not be attractive to graduates of expensive professional schools.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T15:00:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
