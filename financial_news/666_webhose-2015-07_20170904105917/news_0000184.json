GLENN HUNT by Carrie LaFrenz and John Stensholt A knockabout former truckie and avid golfer who once made and then lost a $200 million fortune is well on his way to becoming Australia's new childcare baron.\nChris Scott, 68, is behind the meteoric rise of the listed G8 Education, which now controls 450 childcare centres that look after more than 35,000 children every day.\nG8 has grown quickly in the five years Scott and his chairman, Jenny Hutson, have been at the helm via an aggressive acquisition strategy Scott first rolled out at his former apartment letting business, S8.\nNow G8 is poised for its biggest acquisition, having made a hostile $162 million all scrip bid for rival Affinity Education. Should the deal be successful, G8 will add another 161 centres and 12,000 places – making it close to two-thirds as big as failed operator ABC Learning Centres was in terms of Australian-based centres before its 2008 collapse.\nOriginal focus G8's aggressive roll-up originally focused on buying small, independent operators but has recently extended to buying competitors with larger portfolios.\nBut roll-ups have come under fire recently, with law firm aggregator Slater & Gordon, education firm Vocation and G8 itself suffering share price falls this year – though G8's shares have trebled since Scott took charge in 2007 and its market capitalisation is still more than $1 billion.\nScott, an avid golfer with a handicap of five who splits his time between Singapore and the Gold Coast, might be a more natural fit in the world of trading than childcare, but he defends his strategy\n \"The accounts show it's sustainable,\" he tells AFR Weekend , pointing out that G8 made a $60 million profit from $488 million revenue in 2014.\n\"Having a corporate-run business that is not sustainable, parents would not use our services. Our customers are mums and dads, and we must look after them and the needs of their children. You have to work at it, it doesn't happen automatically. We have economies of scale to invest and make our centres better.\"\nOpinion divided Scott is a divisive person among fund managers and bankers. Those that know him call him \"determined\" and \"ambitious\" while others have painted him as a person with a chequered past.\n\"Chris as a businessman is an extremely shrewd operator that knows how to get the most out of the people who work for him [and] … has a trait of wanting to get things done,\" says one source who has known Scott for more than a decade. \"There is no doubt Chris has upset people over his corporate career, which has made for a good news story.\"\nOphir Asset Management portfolio manger Andrew Mitchell has been a long-time supporter. \"We call him a money maker,\" Mitchell says. \"His personality divides the sharemarket. But we like him. He's unique and doesn't sugar-coat anything. You don't see him in sharp suits and immaculately dressed, he's not that sort of CEO.\"\nMitchell also defended Scott's purchasing of assets at higher multiples, despite G8 having a rule it would not pay more than 4 times earnings. \"While they have paid higher multiples [recently], they have removed competitors from the market and still are generating a 15 to 20 per cent return on capital at a time of record-low interest rates.\"\nBone of contention But a rival fund manager is a non-believer. \"Where are synergies coming from? That's cutting costs and sacking staff? That's not a good outcome for taking care of kids.\"\nAnother bone of contention is how much skin Scott has in the game with G8. He says he owns 1 million shares.\nOne source says the small stake is a \"big worry\" and questions why Affinity shareholders should take a scrip offer from G8 when its MD has such as a small stake.\nScott is adamant he holds no more shares. In March last year, AFR Weekend revealed a private company called Geosine, once owned by Scott and his son, controlled just over 20 million shares or 7.4 per cent of G8.\nGeosine is understood to still hold a 3.88 per cent stake and its owner, Kimberley Yin, shares the same Gold Coast address as Scott, according to ASIC documents. Six weeks after the March article, it transferred $26.9 million shares to an unknown party. Scott claims Lin was legal counsel for Cherie Hearts, a Singapore childcare business G8 bought in 2011. \"It's her family holding. She has nothing to do with G8 and she lives in Singapore,\" he says.\nScott's wife, Juwarseh Scott, owns about 6.9 million shares. \"Those are her shares to look after the children and the family with,\" Scott says. \"My wife can sell those shares if she wants, I have nothing to do that.\"\nImpressive comeback Whether he controls a little or a lot of G8, its performance over the past five years appears to be an impressive comeback for Scott, who grew up in inner-city Melbourne. His father was a floor sander and his mother a clerk. He left school at 15 to labour in factory jobs and then became a truck driver.\n\"We had no money, I just couldn't go on [with school],\" Scott says. \"I liked driving trucks and I got to see Australia. There was freedom when you left the depot. I was pretty rebellious; I don't like being told what to do. That's why I knew I needed to work for myself.\"\nScott began studying law by correspondence and gained a break by taking an exam which landed him a spot at Melbourne's LaTrobe University where he studied economics, earning honours.\nSick of Melbourne's cold weather and after a year in Sydney, he chased a Chinese girl he met at university to Penang. The pair married and Scott's strong connection to south-east Asia began.\nScott moved to Singapore in 1978, starting a road transport business hauling refrigerated freight between Thailand and Singapore, and cargo to and from Malaysia. He later started two successful seafreight handling and marketing firms before selling and moving his family to the Gold Coast.\nFortuitous timing It was fortuitous timing. The Queensland tourism market was booming and Scott began acquiring property management businesses. That morphed into S8 – the \"S\" standing for Singapore and the 8 representing prosperity to the Chinese – which listed on the ASX in 2001 before merging with then high-flying investment bank MFS in a $700 million deal in 2007.\nScott debuted on the BRW Rich List that year with a $280 million worth, but lost just about all of it when MFS collapsed spectacularly the following year.\nHe and Hutson tried to salvage some of the wreckage from MFS in its dying days, but it was too late. The pair managed to extract 20 well-performing childcare centres and despite not knowing about childcare, they saw an opportunity in the wake of ABC.\nScott later moved back to Singapore only to re-emerge two years later, again combining with Hutson, and moved into what was then known as Early Learning Services. It merged with their company Payce Childcare and they later renamed the firm G8 Education.\nSuccess has followed, though critics remain. Scott says he never considered the life he has led would have been possible as a young man driving trucks.\n\"When you get to my age, you don't think like that. My life is consumed with 10,500 staff and 35,000 kids and mums and dads. There isn't much time for anything else ... except a little golf.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:08:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
