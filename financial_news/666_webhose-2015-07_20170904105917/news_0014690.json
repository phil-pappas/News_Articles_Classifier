But over a year later, the military has still not purchased a single compliant sneaker. \nThe Department of Defense says testing is underway and one version of New Balance's proposed shoe has already passed. \nSaucony, a sneaker company also developing an American made shoe, says the military needs a better testing regimen. An industry trade group says the delays are harming domestic shoemakers. \nAnd U.S. Rep.
