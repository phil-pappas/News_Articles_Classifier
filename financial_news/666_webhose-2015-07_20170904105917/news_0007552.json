Bloomberg Share on twitter by Angela Macdonald-Smith BHP Billiton has pre-qualified to bid in Mexico's first auction of offshore exploration drilling permits, but the signs are that the mining major may save its firepower for the prized deepwater blocks that are only expected to come up for tender in early 2016.\nWoodside Petroleum has also been named as a bidder in a consortium approved to take part in this week's offer of 14 shallow-water exploration permits in the south-east Gulf of Mexico, which marks a historic opening up of the Mexican oil and gas sector after 77 years under state control.\nWoodside's group includes Mexican oil services company Diavaz Offshore and private Latin American explorer and producer Pluspetrol, according to Mexico's national petroleum authority, Comisi√≥n Nacional de Hidrocarburos.\nIn all, 3.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent of known reserves are on offer in Mexico's first round of auctions, plus 14.6 billion barrels of prospective resources, including offshore, onshore and unconventional fields, according to the government.\nFurther auction rounds are due to take place over the rest of the decade, heralding a new wave of access to oil and gas resources that companies can tap ahead of the next upward cycle in oil prices, consultancy Wood Mackenzie said.\nBids for the 14 shallow water permits in the so-called Round 1.1 are due by Wednesday, with contracts to be awarded almost immediately..\nNext on offer are nine development fields, holding 356 million barrels of oil-equivalent (boe) of reserves also in shallow water, with bids due September 30. To follow are extra-heavy oil and onshore unconventional opportunities, then finally the deep-water licences.\nBHP is among 18 companies that individually pre-qualified to bid for the shallow-water licences, as are majors such as Chevron and ExxonMobil. A further 16, including Woodside, are involved in seven consortiums sanctioned to participate.\n BHP's head of petroleum Tim Cutt has pointed to the need for the group to expand conventional oil and gas opportunities, but he has signalled the focus in Mexico is on resources further offshore in deeper water, where resource plays BHP has developed in US waters extend across the maritime border.\n\"The one that we are most excited about is in the deepwater, and the extension of the Palaeogene play into the Perdido play,\" Mr Cutt said last September when BHP announced an alliance with Mexico's state-owned Pemex, which has held a monopoly over local oil and gas development until now.\nNeither BHP nor Woodside would comment on Tuesday, but Deutsche Bank energy analyst Paul Young said the deep-water region was the \"most promising and anticipated acreage\" of the permits on offer. Some 11 blocks will be offered next year in the deep water, with estimated resources of 1.59 billion boe.\nFiscal terms for bidders have been improved to attract foreign players and help offset the slump in crude prices over the past year.\nBut, according to the Financial Times , a requirement for bidders to provide open-ended guarantees in the case of an accidental oil spill has deterred some. It reported that Noble Energy, Glencore, Colombia's Ecopetrol and Thailand's PTT all pulled out of the first round, as has Pemex.\nMexico is seen as a long-term play for BHP, with Credit Suisse estimating that success in waters offshore of Mexico would be unlikely to yield new oil production before 2025.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/angelamacd"], "published": "2015-07-14T15:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:03:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
