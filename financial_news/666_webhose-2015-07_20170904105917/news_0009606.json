Getty Images by Jeremy Chunn With investing, group think can sink you. If that sounds like a reason to always be contrarian, it's not. If you join the herd that is pushing up prices, you'll benefit from the rise. But if you hang around too long and the party ends in a hurry, you'll emerge from the broom closet to find broken furniture and capital loss.\nThe media fuels all of this by picking up a theme and running with it. Today it's the \"reach for yield\", most definitely. Big themes of the past made sense at the time but the fundamentals changed course or the bubble popped. Smart Investor looks at what's gone before (the BRIC economies, Asian tigers and internet stocks) and how we should think about some of the big themes of today (yield, internet stocks and infrastructure).\nTHEN… BRIC friction Who can forget BRIC, an acronym assembled in 2001 to unite the fortunes of Brazil, Russia, India and China. The four nations are home to about 42 per cent of the world's population, and between the late 1990s and 2005 annual combined GDP growth beat the US, the G7 and the broader emerging markets group.\nSince then, growth rates in the four economies have slowed and their paths have diverged. The logic of holding an investment that accords instant diversification across nations growing well above world average made sense then, but the past five years have been awful: investors holding iShares MSCI BRIC ETF have suffered, whereas funds invested in the most developed economy of all, the US, have gained 88 per cent in Australian dollars (see chart).\nDotcom dot gone The dotcom boom went ka-boom inside the portfolios of US investors, with the Nasdaq index ripping from 2500 to 5000 and back to 2500 within two years – and another 50 per cent was lost in the two years that followed.\n In Australia, a technology index born into existence at the very top of the bubble fell like a skateboarder from the lip of a halfpipe, only to stagger gradually upwards for the next 12 years, where it is still 75 per cent below its peak (see chart). It's not all doom and gloom if you believe in the long-term potential of Ctrl-Alt-Delete – anyone who bought the Nasdaq in March 2009 has nearly tripled that money. The technology powerhouse was always going to be the US, not Australia … obviously.\nAsian tigers turn to butter Rapid industrialisation in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan saw those economies clock GDP scores well above the developed world in the 1970s and '80s, and Australian fund managers were able to match this growth opportunity with local investors' expectations. The Asian financial crisis of 1997, however, was like a proper tiger attack, with the investment markets of the four mauled to hell: between June 1997 and September 1998 Hong Kong was halved, South Korea lost 58 per cent and Taiwan was down 24 per cent. Lightning strikes.\nAND NOW… Yield of dreams Does \"reach for yield\" have you reaching for a bucket? It might get worse. Any investment is assessed on its prospect for capital growth and the income it generates. Generally, growth or income will see it qualify or be disqualified. It's rare to see a good score for both.\n\"You've got to get a decent yield to start with, but in recent times the yields have been getting lower and lower,\" AMP Capital head of investment strategy and chief economist Shane Oliver says. \"That's partly justified by lower and lower cash rates.\"\nThere comes a point where yields are pushed too low. It happened in the lead-up to the GFC, where corporate bond yields approached the narrow spreads of government bonds. At near 6 per cent (franking credits included) Australian equities still pay a decent yield, Dr Oliver says, where property trusts have been pushed down to about 4.5 per cent, government bonds near 3 per cent and below 3 per cent for rental yield on housing.\nIt's hopeless chasing yield that is unsustainable, a classic example being companies with high dividend payout ratios and the worst case where distributions are paid using debt. Equally sinister is the \"value trap\", where high yields (the distribution divided by the share price) merely reflect a stock in decline. \"Many of the resources companies are paying quite high yields but if you were to assume the iron ore price stays at current levels, you might find those yields are not sustainable because the earnings would come down quite sharply,\" Dr Oliver says.\nIn this market, where low growth is expected, products are being invented that aim to squeeze yield out of anything.\nBetaShares YMAX fund uses the covered call strategy to eke a few extra microns of income from the top 20 Australian stocks. With a covered call you lose your stocks if the share price jumps above expectations. When that happens, the manager has to replace the shares at the higher market rate. It doesn't happen often, but it happens. A strong rally at the start of this year saw BetaShares' YMAX fund suffer a major setback (see chart).\nIn the world of direct shares, the primary example of investor demand for yield pushing up asset prices has been the Australian banks. Growth and income were delivered in a magical parcel, the demand for one pushing the price of the other. Between 2011 and early this year, $100 invested in the big four more than doubled if income was reinvested.\nEverything changed in March. Since then the banks have lost more than 10 per cent in value, although BetaShares chief economist David Bassanese says yields offered by local banks still make them attractive. \"We're seeing a re-rating of stocks [prices have risen] because their dividends have been quite attractive relative to interest rates,\" he says.\nThe longer interest rates stay low, the longer yield will be a primary selection variable – and the longer investors will need to investigate quality of assets. When growth returns, overvalued assets will be dumped like rotten boyfriends.\nFintech goggles Does the advance of financial technology offer enormous potential for growth or are we looking at another party balloon? Shareholders in New Zealand company Xero made 330 per cent in 2013 and lost 50 per cent in 2014; MYOB's share price has lost 10 per cent since its float in May; 1-Page is up 780 per cent in one year. It's a fast-moving sector for sure, with no guarantees of success but brilliant results for a few. If it takes a degree in maths and computing to understand the \"back end\", what hope does your average investor have of selecting success stories?\n\"Most people don't understand the overriding technological themes that are driving these things,\" DJ Carmichael senior research analyst Michael Eidne says. \"That's part of the problem.\"\nThe move to cloud computing has cut costs and allowed software to spread around the globe, but some of the value in technology companies is less easy to identify. \"The theme to me is how do you drive productivity and improve the current business process,\" Eidne says. \"Just because it's a new idea doesn't mean it's disruptive.\" Social networks with narrow targets and small audiences may likely turn out to be \"flash in the pan\", he says.\nIn technology, a manager's record counts for a lot. Eidne says 1-Page is a good example: the ASX-listed, Silicon Valley-based company has a global reach and has disrupted the recruitment process (see chart). Newzulu might achieve the effect in crowd-sourced news gathering. \"Those are sorts of examples I look at, and definitely on a global scale because the Australian market is too small.\"\nBusiness-to-business models that can appeal globally and where management has form will make it through Eidne's filter. Online consumer fashions such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are harder to assess. Companies that are sustainable in the long run \"might not be that sexy\" but have a better chance of one day paying dividends and achieving a good return.\nIf you want to cut the risk, buy companies when they start generating revenue and stay away from \"concepts\" where a couple of inventors are just gagging to float.\nOr you can just buy the Nasdaq, \"except the valuations are pretty heavy there … you've heard of the unicorns, yeah?\"\nInfrastructure gridlock Collecting rent for the use of vital pipes and roads sounds like a magnificently sensible income strategy – unless the assets are overvalued.\n\"The value of the shares can fluctuate pretty wildly based on what happens to interest rates,\" Morningstar senior analyst Adrian Atkins says. Valuations are at \"pretty high levels\", he says, and if interest rates stay low that's fine. If rates rise, however, interest expense for debt-heavy infrastructure companies will rise and yield will look less attractive relative to other investments.\nInfrastructure is not a trivial sector. For regulated utilities, where the return on equity rate is set by government every five years, a lift in interest rates will be good news when ROE is reset higher. The next reset, however, will likely see ROE set lower than the last setting five years ago.\nAtkins names as AusNet, Spark Infrastructure and DUET as companies that face resets in the coming six months. \"At the moment we see regulators pushing down hard on those returns,\" he says. \"If things reverse, these guys will be protected going forward.\"\nIf distributions are paid on lower earnings, capital expenditure may have to be paid with debt.\nFor airports, toll roads and pipeline operators, a rise in rates could see more sellers in the market. On the positive side, such companies have a sustainable competitive advantage, he says, examples being Sydney Airport, Transurban and APA Pipelines.\n\"The simplest advice is: look for the companies with a sustainable competitive advantage, which are the unregulated ones. Although regulated ones might have monopolies, the regulator is the one who decides how much money they make.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:50:58.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
