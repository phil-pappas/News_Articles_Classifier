Reuters by James Chessell When Alex Tsipras took the stage at a large rally at Syntagma Square in central Athens on the eve of Greece's historic referendum, the Greek Prime Minister was greeted with a huge roar from the 35,000-strong crowd supporting a no vote.\nFramed by the imposing Greek parliament building, Tsipras gave a short but defiant speech in his last public appearance before campaigning shut down ahead of the critical poll.\n\"Today we are not protesting: today we are celebrating democracy, today we are celebrating the victory of democracy, whatever the result is,\" he declared.\n\"We're not simply deciding to stay in Europe, we're deciding to live with dignity in Europe… to be an equal among equals in Europe.\"\nThe crowd waved their \"Oxi!\" (No!) flags in appreciation. Warmed up by a series of star-studded performances – which included songs of political opposition dating back to 1967-1974 when a military junta ruled Greece – many of them stayed on late into the night that was more concert than political event.\n\"I'm voting no because I am sick of what the EU has done to us,\" Angelica Kavagia, one of thousands of students at the demonstrations, told The Australian Financial Review. \"Of course I'm anxious about what might happen but it's risk we should take.\"\nAt the same time, a less boisterous but more affluent crowd of around 20,000 yes supporters gathered just one kilometre away at the white marble Panathenaic Stadium on the opposite side of Athens' National Garden. Brandishing Greek flags and \"Nai\" (Yes) placards, they sung Beethoven's Ode to Joy – the anthem of the European Union.\n\"For the country, it will be terrible, a disaster if we leave the euro,\" said 44-year-old Alex Angelidis.\n Rocky future But the truth it is whichever way the Greeks vote, the country faces a rocky future. And for Europe there is also no quick fix. If the no vote wins, Greece will in effect reject Europe, but Europe will need to take desperate action to hold its project together.\nIf the yes vote wins, Greece will accept the tough European medicine, but Greece will go to another divisive election that could just as easily upset the European dream – not forgetting Greece is at the outer border of the region and faces risk from terrorists, anarchy and refugees in its impoverished neighbours across the Mediterranean in North Africa and the Middle East.\nThe two rallies referendum-eve polls perfectly illustrated one certainty facing Greeks as they cast their votes: their country will not only have overcome monumental economic problems but deep social divisions regardless of the result.\n\"We are a divided country,\" says Ioannis-Sergios Mandalidis, newsroom director at the Greek media company behind the To Vima and Ta Nea newspapers and the in.gr website. \"The referendum won't fix that\".\nAway from the partisan crowds of central Athens, many Greeks exude a sense of weary fatalism.\n\"The problem with Greece is that we do not experience logical or normal things,\" says George Tzogopoulos, a fellow at the Hellenic Foundation for European & Foreign Policy. \"In both the yes or no vote only the prime minister knows what he will do.\"\nEconomic low point The referendum on whether to accept the terms of a bailout from Greece's eurozone creditors came at an economic low point for the country since it joined the common currency in 2001. Capital controls were imposed on banks last week after it became clear Greece would become the first developed nation to default on a payment ot the International Monetary Fund in the Washington-based institution's 69-year history.\nWith most banks closed and ATM withdrawals limited to €60 per day, Greece's economy is slowing grinding to a halt. For a country where the unemployment rate is 25 per cent and the economy has shrunk by more than 20 per cent in the past five years, this financial strain is particularly hard to bear. Yet the politics of the Greek debt crisis has proved equally dispiriting for many of 10 million eligible voters.\nTsipras had attempted to make Sunday a referendum on the tough economic reforms known as austerity measures such as pension cuts and sales tax hikes that Greece's creditors attached to some €240 billion in bailout aid given to Greece in 2010 and 2014. His leftwing Syriza party swept to power in January promising to put an end to many of the austerity reforms. By voting no, he argued Greeks would be in a stronger position to negotiate with its eurozone creditors and achieve its real goal: some form of debt relief that would reduce national borrowings that stand at an unsustainable 180 per cent of GDP. (Countries such as Germany refused to discuss debt relief until Greece agreed to the reforms).\nYet Tsipras' attempts to frame the vote as a referendum on austerity were undermined by his own actions. Greeks were asked to vote on the terms of a bailout package that expired at the same time the country defaulted on the €1.6 billion IMF payment. He further muddied the waters by continuing to put counter proposals to the eurozone powers after the vote was called even though the referendum ended negotiations between both sides.\nMark Mazower, a professor of history at Columbia University, recently argued in The New York Times that the one \"unambiguous benefit\" of holding the snap ballot for Tsipras has been to unite Syriza, whose hard left faction was increasingly uneasy about concessions Athens was prepared to make on pension reforms and higher taxes.\n\"Overnight, he has cemented his political base and strengthened his hand internally,\" wrote Mazower. \"Syriza is back in the position it likes best: standing for opposition to the global status quo\".\nSeries of warnings As a result, the referendum became a decision about whether Greece should stick with the euro or return to the drachma. A series of warnings from European leaders about Greece's membership of the eurozone should the country vote no have helped frame the debate this way, and opinion polls suggest about three-quarters of voters would prefer their country remained part of the currency union.\nMany observers including Mazower and Tzogopoulos believe the widespread popularity of the euro is the reason Tsipras refused to equate a \"no\" vote with a potential \"Grexit\". Despite the prime minister's insistence that he wants to remain part of Europe, they argue he is prepared to say goodbye to the euro.\n\"I think there is plan going on where the government will introduce a parallel currency – IOUs in the beginning and then drachmas – and slowly, slowly we drift outside the eurozone,\" says Miltos Kyrkos, a member of the European Parliament with centrist party To Potami (\"The River\").\nTsipras' critics argue he must surely know that the leaders of Greece's creditors have their own voters who in the case of countries such as Spain and Portugal have worked their way through austerity programs while others such as Germany have grown tired of what the describe as \"paying for the Greek way of life\". German finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble's tough stance during negotiations may make him wildly unpopular in Greece – a popular no campaign poster tells Greeks the 72-year-old has been \"sucking your blood\" for five years – yet back home he enjoys a personal approval rating of 70 per cent.\nThat the 18 members of the eurozone are unwilling to cut Greece a special deal makes Tsipras' claim that he can cut a better deal hard to accept.\nTwo outcomes These factors mean Tsipras presented voters with two outcomes each with their own set of complications. A no vote will not only make it harder to stay in the euro but test the patience of the European Central Bank, which has been keeping Greek banks afloat through an emergency liquidity fund. It is also worth noting the no vote is split between the hard left represented by Syriza and rightwing anti-EU movements such as the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party.\nA yes result should force Tsipras government call fresh elections.\nA close referendum means Syriza would probably win a significant proportion of the vote in any general election. Some Greeks have suggested a group of technocrats could handle negotiations such as happened in Italy when it became impossible to form a government, but it is hard to see any meaningful progress being made unless the other members of eurozone believe they are dealing with people they can trust to deliver any agreement.\nAs a result there is not expected to be any relief for Greeks. The long queues at ATMs are expected, businesses will find it harder to pay suppliers and pressure will build on the health and transport service. An already-divided nation will face its biggest test since the military dictatorship ended in 1974.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:52:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
