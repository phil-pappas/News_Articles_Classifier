Greece might even be perceived as taking the initiative to revive talks with creditors,\" Paul Christopher, chief international strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St. Louis.\nOther analysts downplayed the pop in the euro, as the long-term ability of Greece to stay solvent and keep its membership in the euro zone remains in doubt.\n\"The market has been short euro. It's not surprising to go through these periodic bouts of (short-covering) squeeze,\" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at BNP Paribas in New York.\nThe euro was last up 0.6 percent against the dollar and yen at $1.1000 and 136.19 yen, respectively.\nThe greenback pared losses briefly versus the yen after the government said first-time filings for unemployment benefits fell to 255,000 last week, the lowest since November 1973. This supported the view of an improving jobs market that may allow the Fed to raise interest rates as early as September.\nThe dollar resumed its earlier weakness as U.S. Treasury yields fell to two-week lows on growing losses on Wall Street and deflation worries from falling commodity prices. It was down 0.1 percent at 123.79 yen but held above a global session low of 123.68 yen.\nThe dollar index was last down 0.5 percent at 97.094.\nThe yen was briefly on the defensive after the International Monetary Fund warned Japan to avoid over-reliance on a weak currency to reflate its economy.\nThe IMF also cautioned a further rise in the dollar could hurt other countries.\nAmong other major currencies, the New Zealand dollar was the biggest mover after the country's central bank disappointed those who had bet on a larger cut in interest rates and toned down its call for more falls for the kiwi.\nThe kiwi was last up 0.6 percent at $0.6617, above a six-year low of $0.6498 set on July 14.
