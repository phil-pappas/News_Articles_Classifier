Housing starts surged in June and building permits soared to a near eight-year high. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen this week affirmed the U.S. central bank was keen to start raising interest rates later this year.\nThe Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent last month after increasing 0.4 percent in May. Last month's increase pushed the year-on-year CPI rate into positive territory for the first time since December.\nThe energy-driven disinflationary trend appears to have run its course. A report on Wednesday showed producer prices rose in June for a second straight month.\nIn a separate report, the Commerce Department said groundbreaking for new homes increased 9.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.17 million units in June. Permits for future home construction increased 7.4 percent to a 1.34 million-unit rate, the highest level since July 2007.\nEconomists anticipate that the housing market will mitigate the drag on the economy from a struggling manufacturing sector.\nFirming price pressures, together with a tightening labor market and strengthening housing could give the Fed confidence that inflation will gradually rise toward its 2 percent target.\nThe Fed has kept its short-term interest rate near zero for more than six years. Most economists believe the Fed will pull the trigger on rates in September.\nThe dollar rose to a session high against a basket of currencies on the data, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.\nGASOLINE, EGGS, RENTS BOOST PRICES\nIn the 12 months through June, the CPI edged up 0.1 percent after being unchanged in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI rising 0.3 percent from May and gaining 0.1 percent from a year ago.\nThe so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, increased 0.2 percent last month after rising 0.1 percent in May. Underlying inflation pressures have been tamed by a strong dollar.\nIn the 12 months through June, the core CPI rose 1.8 percent after May's 1.7 percent increase. An inflation measure tracked by the Fed is running well below its 2 percent target.\nLast month, gasoline prices increased 3.4 percent after jumping 10.4 percent in May. Food prices rose 0.3 percent, the largest increase since September 2014, as an outbreak of bird flu in some parts of the country causes a shortage of eggs. Egg prices surged 18.3 percent, the biggest gain since August 1973.\nElsewhere, the index for rent increased 0.4 percent, the largest rise since August 2013. With the residential vacancy rate near a 22-year low as a firming labor market boosts household formation, shelter costs are likely to continue rising.\nThere were also increases in the cost of recreation, new motor vehicles, tobacco, airline fares and personal care. These offset declines in the prices for apparel, medical care, used cars and trucks and household furnishings.\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T16:18:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
