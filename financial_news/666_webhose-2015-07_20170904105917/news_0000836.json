Whitehaven says demand growth for high quality thermal coal in Asia should stop further falls on the dismal current price of $US60 a tonne, but says metallurgical coal prices will take a hit in the current quarter. Photo: Louise Kennerley\nWhitehaven Coal says growing demand for high quality thermal coal in Asia should stop further falls on the dismal current price of $US60 a tonne, but says metallurgical coal prices will take a hit in the current quarter.\nLow quality thermal coal is in oversupply, but Whitehaven said on Thursday that in the higher quality space in which it plays, \"product availability is tighter and prices are showing resistance to further price falls\".\n\"Expected demand growth for these high quality coals in Asia should provide support for the price around current levels,\" Whitehaven said on Thursday, after unveiling record production and sales for the full year.\nChinese imports of both types of coal during the June half took a hit after the Asian giant introduced strict quality rules.\nAdvertisement Whitehaven does not ship to China, but the lower demand there has caused some metallurgical coal players to redirect their product, depressing already dire prices.\nWhitehaven pulled in an average of $US75.90 a tonne for metallurgical coal in the June quarter. But it is tipping that its received price will fall to between $US70 and $US75 a tonne in the current quarter.\nThe June quarter was also dire for thermal coal, as Whitehaven's sales averaged $US60.72 a tonne, about $US1.15 higher than the spot price average.\nThermal coal accounts for 84 per cent of the miner's sales and metallurgical coal the other 16 per cent. But metallurgical coal market dynamics are of big interest to Whitehaven - in the long term, the commodity is likely to be in the range of 30 per cent to 40 per cent of total coal sales.\nThe ASX-listed coal miner - Australia's largest independent player in the space - posted record production for the year to June, of 14.6 million tonnes, up 41 per cent on the previous year.\nIts new Maules Creek mine came online in January, accounting for a big part of the increase. Sales were lower than production, coming in at 13.9 million tonnes, 29 per cent higher than the previous year.\nWhitehaven's equity share of coal production for the full year was 11.3mt, while its equity slice of sales was 10.9mt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T05:05:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
