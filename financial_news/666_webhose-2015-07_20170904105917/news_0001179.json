At the same time, GE’s progress won’t be obvious to anyone looking only at their second-quarter per-share earnings or revenue numbers, both of which are expected to be down from a year ago.\nThe main reason for the erosion is GE’s decision to exit the financial services business . The company announced in April a two-year plan to further shrink GE Capital, building on a strategy Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt put in place following the unit’s massive losses in the financial markets meltdown in 2008.\nBut downsizing GE Capital is not without cost. It prompted GE to take a $14.1 billion charge against its first-quarter earnings, and the company said it expects to take another $4.3 billion charge against its second-quarter results.\nMeanwhile, GE also said it will return $90 billion to shareholders by 2018 through a combination of dividend hikes, share buybacks and share swaps. The April 10 announcement sent GE’s stock price to a 12-month high of $28.68.\nIt’s been pretty much downhill ever since, however, reflecting two major unfinished items of business hanging over the company’s reindustrialization program.\nThe first is GE’s $17 billion purchase of France-based Alstom SA’s ALO, +0.09% energy business. What would be GE’s biggest acquisition ever remains in limbo more than a year after the two companies shook hands on the deal. In February European Union anti-trust regulators raised concerns it would give GE too much clout in the European gas-turbine market. Their concerns include demands that GE make certain concessions to secure approval. A decision on whether GE has adequately met those demands is expected perhaps as early as this week.\nThe second unfinished item is the $3.3 billion sale of GE’s home appliances business to Sweden’s Electrolux AB ELUXY, +1.12% . On July 1 the Justice Department slapped GE with an antitrust lawsuit, arguing the deal would give Electrolux too large a slice of the U.S. appliances market, especially kitchen stoves and ovens.\nGE and Electrolux have vowed to fight the lawsuit. But even if they win, their plan to wrap up the deal this year could be tough.\nEarnings: Analysts polled by FactSet expect GE to report a second-quarter operating profit of 28 cents a share, down from 31 cents a share in the previous quarter and 39 cents a share a year ago. Bear in mind those numbers exclude the cost of exiting GE Capital. Including those and other one-time costs, GE had a net loss of $1.35 a share in the first quarter of 2015 and a net profit of 35 cents a share in the second quarter of 2014.\nRevenue: Analysts see GE posting second-quarter sales of $28.7 billion, down from $29.4 billion in the previous quarter and down nearly 21% from $36.2 billion a year ago.\nShare price: GE’s GE, +0.72% share price closed Wednesday exactly where it was a year ago, lagging a 5.9% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.42% over the same period. GE’s share performance measured from the start of 2015 looks much better, however, up 5.5% compared with a 1.3% gain for the industrials index.\nGE’s per-share earnings have topped analysts’ expectations the past three quarters, but sales came in below expectations for each of those quarters. Investors have taken the disappointments in stride, however, and post-earnings price swings have been muted.\nOther issues : Like all U.S.-based multi-national companies, GE’s second-quarter results will reflect the impact of a stronger dollar on overseas sales.\nAt the same time, GE’s energy business could be hurt by slumping oil and gas prices, the result of production gains, especially in North America, outpacing demand. This challenge already surfaced in GE’s first quarter report, which showed revenue from its oil and gas segment fell 8% to $3.96 billion from a year earlier, the steepest revenue drop in any of its business segments apart from GE Capital, where revenue – as expected -- fell a whopping 39%.\nSo how is GE’s restructuring playing on Wall Street? According to FactSet 63% of brokers surveyed continue to rate the stock a buy, up from 60% a year ago. And they have, on average, a $30.38 price target on GE shares, about 14% above where they are currently trading. So the majority view among analysts continues to support CEO Immelt’s strategic repositioning of the Dow’s oldest component.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T07:47:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
