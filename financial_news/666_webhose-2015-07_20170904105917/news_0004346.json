So while banks are still paying roughly the same interest rate to depositors, they are able to charge more for loans. \nThe gap between what banks pay for money and what they lend it out at is their profit margin, also known as the net interest margin (NIM). \nMust Read: 10 Stocks Billionaire John Paulson Loves \nAs banks prepare to report second-quarter earnings this week, investors will be watching closely to see what this all means for the bottom line. Goldman Sachs ( GS - Get Report ) , for one, thinks it could make a difference in the results banks report. \n\"After falling for 18 of the last 20 quarters, NIMS could start to stabilize, which could offset the negatives,\" Richard Ramsden, a banking analyst for Goldman Sachs, wrote in a report last week. \nNarrow lending margins have been a dark spot on bank earnings for years. Smaller banks have been particularly hurt because lending is their primary business. Still, larger banks, which have other activities such as investment banking to bolster earnings, have been under pressure, as well. \nOverall, the average net interest margin for banks has fallen to about 3.1% at the end of 2014 from about 3.4% in mid-2006, according to research by the St. Louis Fed. \nBank of America's ( BAC - Get Report ) margin dropped to 2.25 from 2.8, and Wells Fargo's ( WFC - Get Report ) from to 3.11 from 4.83. JPMorgan Chase's ( JPM - Get Report ) fell to 2.18 in 2014 from 2.39 in 2007. \nAlthough the Fed has yet to raise the federal-funds rate, interest rates have in fact been climbing, albeit slowly. The 10-year Treasury bond has risen about 0.2 of a percentage point since the first quarter. \nThe 10-year Treasury has historically served as an indicator of other loan rates, especially the 30-year fixed mortgage rate. That is because of the lifecycle of the typical mortgage. Although most mortgage terms are 30 years, their average lifespan is typically around seven years as many people either move or refinance before the end of their mortgage term. Because of that, when mortgages are packaged into mortgage-backed securities, the benchmark interest rate used is typically the 10-year Treasury. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T22:49:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
