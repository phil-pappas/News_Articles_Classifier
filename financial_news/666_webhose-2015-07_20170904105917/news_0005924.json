While variable rates are a good option for some students because the rates are lower than fixed ones, they tend to rise during the term of the loan. \n“Unlike federal student loans, the interest rate is not the same for every borrower,” he said. “Students applying with a creditworthy cosigner may receive a lower interest rate.” Both Libor and the prime rate are benchmark market rates used by banks and other financial institutions.

The unknown factor with variable rates is that the three-month Libor rate could increase due to market condition, Hopkins said. The current three-month Libor rate is 0.29%. \nBenefits of Fixed Rate Loans \nThe fixed rates from Discover range from 5.99% APR to 11.49% APR, also depending on the credit score of the borrower. \n“A fixed interest rate is set at the time of application and does not change during the life of the loan,” Hopkins said. \nSince a fixed rate loan’s interest rates can never change, fixed rate loans give borrowers “a sense of stability because you know how much you'll pay each month,” Hopkins said. The only time your monthly payment can increase is if the individual choses a period of deferment or forbearance after graduation. \nStudents should research the APR to compare loan options accurately. The APR represents the annualized cost of credit and includes finance charges such as interest, fees and other charges and whether payments are deferred during school. \n“As a result, the APR may be higher or lower than the interest rate,” he said. \nAdvantages of Variable Rates \nWhile some borrowers are lured in by variable interest rates because they tend to start lower than fixed interest rates, many of them could increase over the life of the loan, Hopkins said. It can be hard to predict where interest rates will be for freshman or sophomores after they graduate. \nStudents along with their parents should consider how a variable rate will impact their budget. Most student loans have a repayment rate of 15 years and could be a good option for individuals who are confident they can pay off their loan in a shorter period, said Valeria Esparza, a manager for Wells Fargo’s education financial services program based in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minn. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T09:32:28.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
