The government later accepted even harsher terms in a deal at an all-night eurozone summit on July 12-13. \nIn a series of shock revelations, former economics professor Varoufakis told investors he had been secretly planning for a parallel system of liquidity that could allow a Greek exit from the euro \"at a drop of hat\". \nBut Varoufakis said that in order to build the system, he was forced to work in secret as the access to the private data needed was handled by the tax agency which \"is controlled fully and directly by the troika\". \n\"It was not under control of my ministry... it was controlled by Brussels. The general secretariat is appointed, effectively, through a process that is troika-controlled and the whole mechanism within,\" he said. \nThe revelations involving Varoufakis overshadowed the start of work in Athens between the Greek government and its international creditors on launching a third bailout programme for Greece by mid-August. \n\"I don't think the Commission will engage into looking into any conspiracy plans,\" Andreeva said when asked further about the Varoufakis accusations. \n\"It is important not to look into the past, but the future,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T16:22:50.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
