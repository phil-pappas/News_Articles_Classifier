PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Mon, Jul 27, 2015 GETTY British consumers are more positive over finances \nBut “empty nesters” aged over 45 are feeling significantly more positive about their finances than the younger generations, the Lloyds Bank Spending Power Report found. \nSeven in 10 people (70 per cent) aged 45-plus whose offspring have flown the nest described their financial situation as good, compared with 61 per cent of parents aged 25 and over with younger children and 58 per cent of young singles aged between 18 and 24 years old with no children. \nAcross all age groups, the report found that people’s financial confidence took a further step forward in June, with the index reaching an all-time high of 164 points, up from a previous record of 160 points reached the previous month. \nThe report has been running since the start of 2011. \nIn general, the upward trend was driven by an increase in people’s confidence in their personal financial situation and their household financial situation, as well as an increase in the proportion of people who said they now had some disposable income. \nMore people are also expecting to have more money to put away in savings and have more discretionary income in six months’ time. Empty nesters are feeling more positive about their personal finances than younger generations, who have greater concerns about the employment market and saving for the future Claire Garrod, head of personal current accounts at Lloyds Bank \nOne in three (33 per cent) empty nesters said they had money left over at the end of each month to put into savings, making them the most likely group to do so. \nClaire Garrod, head of personal current accounts at Lloyds Bank, said: “Spending power confidence continues to increase, with people spending less on essential bills in June, and having more discretionary income. \n“However, the degrees of confidence are very different for different consumers. Empty nesters are feeling more positive about their personal finances than younger generations, who have greater concerns about the employment market and saving for the future.” \nLast week, a report from PwC predicted that in 10 years’ time, a contrast will have grown between older home owners who own their home outright without a mortgage, and the younger “generation rent”, who are aged under 40 and are not on the property ladder at all. \nThe news comes ahead of official figures released this week, which are expected to show a pick-up in economic growth. \nA number of economists expect gross domestic product to have grown by 0.7 per cent in the second quarter after falling back to 0.4 per cent in the first quarter. \nInvestec economist Chris Hare said the services sector was likely to do “most of the legwork”. \nGrowth in domestic demand – with household finances boosted by inflation at zero and accelerating wage growth – should buy demand for services. \nIf the figures are stronger than expected, it could increase speculation about the timing of a Bank of England interest rate hike being earlier than previously thought.
