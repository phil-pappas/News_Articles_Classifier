The FTSE 100 was down 12.33 points or 0.18% at 6655.01, while FTSE 250 was down 26.55 or 0.15% with mining, metal and oil stocks leading a predictable market decline. While the slide in mining stocks was not as deep as the previous session, a recovery failed to materialise with the metals market continuing to send mixed signals. \nPast the midway point in trading on the London Metal Exchange, three-month contracts of primary aluminium (down 0.3%), lead (down 0.3%) and nickel (down 2.1%) were all trading lower. \nCopper came into sharp focus as Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) analysts lowered their price forecasts for the industrial metal in 2015, 2016 and 2017 to $5,670, $4,725 and $4,500 per metric tonne, from $5,724, $5825 and $7,000 previously. The LME copper contract was trading down 0.4% or $19 at $5350.25 per metric tonne. \nDespite Goldman Sachs analysts' downbeat forecast on copper, blue chip Antofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGF - news ) was broadly flat. However, rival blue chips BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) (down 1.02%) and Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) (down 0.10%) stayed in negative territory, while Glencore (down 3.49%) found itself among the five biggest FTSE 100 fallers. \nFresnillo (down 0.24%) and Kaz Minerals (LSE: KAZ.L - news ) (down 6.82%) were among other notable names to take a hit. Among the oil and gas stocks feeling the heat were Tullow Oil (LSE: TLW.L - news ) (down 3.74%) and Cairn Energy (LSE: CNE.L - news ) (down 3.76%). \nElsewhere, telecommunications stocks were also in the red with TalkTalk (down 7.17%), Telecom Plus (LSE: TEP.L - news ) (down 1.68%), BT Group (LSE: BT-A.L - news ) (down 1.25%) and COLT Telecom (down 0.21%) trading lower. \nOn a positive note, technology stocks recovered from the previous session's sell-off in wake of Apple (Swiss: AAPL.SW - news ) 's poor results. ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) , which led the decline, recovered on Wednesday trading 4.64% to 45p higher at 1015p. \nStory of the session belonged to media and publishing stocks with Pearson (Xetra: 858266 - news ) up 1.99% or 24p at 1233p on news of the sale of the Financial Times Group to Japan's Nikkei for Â£844m or $1.29bn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T17:43:32.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
