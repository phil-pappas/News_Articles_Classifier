San Juan County in Utah has an “Opportunity Index” — based on educational, economic and involvement in civic life — of 35.6% out of 100% but a giving ratio of 8.8% (anything above 7.9% is considered a high giving ratio). Hamilton County, N.Y., however, has a higher opportunity index of 56.6% and a giving ratio of just 3% (anything below 4.3% is considered low).\nBrowse the interactive map here\nWhile some counties with a higher number of people who attend religious services in the south and counties in Utah often give more, that doesn’t explain all charitable giving. A smaller percentage of people in Lamoille County, Vt., for instance, identify as less religious than in its five neighboring counties, yet residents there gave nearly 4.5% of their incomes to charity, higher than all other New England counties. “Everybody knows everybody,” Dawn Archbold, executive director of the charity United Way of Lamoille County, told the Chronicle. “I think that really helps.”\nRead: And the least charitable state in America is…\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://opportunityindex.org/#4.00/40.00/-97.00/", "https://philanthropy.com/interactives/how-america-gives-opportunity-index", "https://philanthropy.com/interactives/how-america-gives-opportunity-index#interactive"], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T17:13:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
