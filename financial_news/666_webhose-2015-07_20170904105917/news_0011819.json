PUBLISHED: 16:57, Tue, Jul 7, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:44, Tue, Jul 7, 2015 GETTY George Osborne is to deliver the first Tory Budget in 18 years \nAround £12billion of Government spending cuts are on the cards, as Mr Osborne attempts to tackle the UK's budget deficit. It means the Government needs to save about £1 in every £100 that it spends, but leading economists fear if these cuts are applied too fast it could jeopardise Britain's economic recovery. The Chancellor is also expected to deliver upon Conservative election manifesto promises, which include cash help provided for first-time buyers and a freeze on rail fares and TV licence fees. This is what is expected to be annouced: Pensions tax relief cut Highest earners are tipped to have tax relief on pension savings cut to £10,000 from £40,000 a year on a sliding scale.The change would cost someone earning £210,000 or more £13,500 in lost tax relief, according to investors Hargreaves Lansdown.Some critics fear the Chancellor could also restrict salary sacrifice pension schemes or cut tax relief available to employers on National Insurance contributions. Child tax credits slashed The Chancellor is set to take child tax credits back to the levels seen in 2003/4 to save around £5billion. If the plan is given the go ahead it would mean the benefit would be cut for 3.7million low-income families by around £1,400 a year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). Inheritance tax changes The Tories are set to announce an additional 'family home' inheritance tax free threshold of up £175,000. On top of the current inheritance tax threshold of £325,000 per person, which can be doubled among spouses, it will mean that an estate of up to £1million can be passed on without a charge upon death. Critics have said such a change would complicate the system and urged the Chancellor to increase the inheritance tax free threshold to include all assets.

It has already been confirmed that the BBC is to start paying for over-75s' free TV licences rather than the Government, providing the Department of Work and Pensions with extra savings. But Whitehall departments including the NHS and schools could also see budgets cut and be forced into dramatic policy changes to create extra cash for the Treasury. Tax hikes Mr Osborne has promised not to hike income tax, VAT or national insurance, but other taxes could be in line for big increases. Following a global fall in oil prices, the Chancellor may decide that now is the time to increase fuel duty. Capital Gains Tax could also increase and tax breaks could be removed for buy-to-let landlords . Manifesto promises The Conservative's promised to raise the income tax personal allowance to £12,500, meaning no tax is paid on earnings below that amount.A promised increase to the 40 per cent tax threshold from £42,385 to £50,000 may also be announced. Extension to Sunday Trading hours The Chancellor is expected to confirm and provide details on a policy to allow local councils to decide on extensions to Sunday trading hours. Under the current system, retailers can only trade for up to six hours on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T07:13:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
