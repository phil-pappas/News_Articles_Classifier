Some 20 professions in these areas are affected, with the vast majority of employees being women. The situation could be improved by converting part-time jobs to full-time \"if the childcare infrastructure is expanded,\" the study recommended. More than five million people work in the bottle-necked professions, with one million of them working part-time, 670,000 in the health sector alone, the study said. The Nuremberg-based Institute for Employment Research (IAB) has predicted that, without immigration, the working population of Germany will drop from 45 million today to 37.5 million by 2030 and 29 million by 2050.
