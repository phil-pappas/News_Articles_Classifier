Profit excluding certain items was $1.78 a share, missing the $1.97 average estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\nCapital One’s “sizeable EPS miss in Q2 is likely to drive consensus lower and damp investor enthusiasm over coming weeks,” Matthew Burnell and Jason Harbes, analysts at Wells Fargo Securities LLC, said in a note to investors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T17:41:29.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
