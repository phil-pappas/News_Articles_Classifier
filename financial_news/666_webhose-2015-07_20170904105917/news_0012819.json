If you add up everything you own and subtract everything you owe, what's left is what you're worth. Assets minus liabilities equals owner's equity. Every accountant knows that.\nBut financial advisers might struggle with the concept. Especially if they took the securities and managed investments unit that concludes the diploma of financial planning offered by Kaplan Professional.\nI know because I flunked.\nThe unit includes the usual multiple choice exam Kaplan students know so well and yet another long-winded assignment where a statement of advice must be written for a client case study. The diploma involves five units.\nIn the assignment the client's name is James, who walks into my imaginary office one day with a portfolio of 10 Australian companies worth about $220,000, a super balance of $150,000 and his own apartment, worth $535,000.\nNo mortgage. The dude's freehold. He's living the dream, earning $160,000 a year with no kids. Tappitty-tap on the calculator shows he has $42,000 in free cash flow.\nJames cuts to the chase. He doesn't want any insurance, and he's not after any advice on his superannuation. Nope, no need for any input about a will or anything like that. He just wants to know what I make of his share portfolio.\nStraight away the alarm goes off. James is way out of balance and the direct shares he has picked would almost certainly already be in his super fund. The job is to explain to him that he should diversify. Definitely offshore, for a start.\n And so the work begins He'll pay for good advice, and so the work begins.\nOK, this is easy. James's asset allocation looks like this: 7 per cent cash; 1 per cent international fixed income; 58 per cent property; 29 per cent Australian equities; 5 per cent international equities.\nThat includes his super, because he owns it. And that includes his house, because he owns it. Both are listed as \"assets and investments\" in the assignment.\nI labour away a whole weekend and submit a recommendation, which sees James diversified largely in line with his risk profile. Submit online, hit the sack.\nDing! Wrong! Fail!\n\"See marker's comments,\" the email says on Monday morning. So I open the 65-page Word document and trawl through to find the comments in red, where the real strategy is revealed.\n\"… you should not be providing any advice nor taking into account anything to do with James's existing super in this SOA. James has not asked for super advice.\"\nTotally disagree on that one. Then, something even stranger.\n\"You should provide a property strategy…\"\nHuh? James needs more property? I don't get it. And if the real job here is to balance his share portfolio so it marries up with the sector weightings, why not just liquidate the lot and put him in an exchange-traded fund over the S&P/ASX200? (Or maybe I'd better keep that subversive mayhem to myself.)\nWhatever the case, I have four more weeks to submit. OK, damn it, I'll play the game. I look at James's affairs again and, against my core beliefs, change my recommendation. I sell down his Australian share portfolio and reweight the remainder to better match the index, and suggest $152,000 be invested in two international growth managers and one international fixed income manager. Submit, hit the sack.\nDing! Wrong! Fail!\n\"See marker's comments,\" the email says. Once again, I have neglected to invest this guy into Australian property.\nNot competent \"Unfortunately at this stage, this assignment cannot be found competent. You have no exposure at all to property…\"\nTwo fails means I must take the whole subject again, and pay a $300 fee because \"we offer re-enrolment at a discounted price\". No, that's not good enough. My advice takes into account all of James's balance sheet, as it should. I press the issue and get a response.\n\"The residential property is not an investment asset – it is a lifestyle asset,\" my marker says, within an email from Kaplan that concludes: \"If you would like to dispute the requirement to re-enrol, please send an email … and your request can be escalated.\"\nYou bet I will. Here goes.\n\"Dear Kaplan … blah blah blah … I know how to weight a share portfolio to reflect index weightings, and I think that is what the assessor is expecting me to do to pass me, but I'm not sure why a client would expect an adviser to charge for that service when they can buy an index [an ETF over the Australian share market benchmark] for a low fee …\n\"Also, the client in the assignment owns property freehold, so I would not recommend he invest in anymore … To exclude any assets from a plan will only result in the client's entire portfolio of assets being out of balance …\n\"I am asking that my assignment be reassessed. I will not enrol again in the unit.\"\nResult substantiated Four days later, a reply.\n\"Dear Jeremy … blah blah blah … Your re-mark assessor has substantiated the Not Yet Competent result awarded for your resubmission … blah blah blah … Their overall observation is: \"some of the points are valid but generally there has not been enough additional information provided overall to be deemed competent … blah blah blah … To complete the DFP4 subject, a re-enrolment is required.\n\"Kind regards…\"\nOK, enough is enough. I only took on the diploma to flesh out my skills in writing about financial advice for the Financial Review's monthly Asset section, pitched at financial planning professionals.\nYes, I thought about flipping career to become an adviser along the way, as the case studies in the Kaplan assignments for the previous units lit my imagination. What a great job, to keep people financially healthy as they struggle over all of life's hurdles: budgeting, kids, saving, divorce, retirement income, death. Like being a dentist, but without the germs. And how great would it be to run your own practice, and see if you can break the mould. Who's to say a financial planner can't wear Converse and an old motorcycle jacket? I could hang some contemporary art and all those stiffs in their blue suits would look like a bunch of pelicans in comparison.\nBut the last hurdle tested my faith in advice. For a start, assets are assets. All advice should consider all of a client's balance sheet. Is the problem with advice that the advisers are funnelled into thinking otherwise? If it happens in the classroom, before they are even employed, what hope is there?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:59:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
