Disneyland Paris is making little Hans and Lotte pay a lot more to get in — and that’s just unfair, according to complaints filed with EU regulators.\nThe French theme park has come under price-rigging scrutiny, after being hit by accusations that British and German visitors must pay more than locals.\n“In some cases, for the same premium package, French consumers will pay €1,346 [$1,490] while British visitors are charged €1,870 and Germans €2,447,” the Financial Times said in a report Tuesday.\nGiven this, the European Commission told France to investigate whether Disneyland Paris is “unfairly rigging” prices, according to the FT.\nRegulators are scrutinizing complaints against Disneyland Paris, tied to potentially “unjustified” different pricing based on nationality or residence, European Commission spokeswoman Lucia Caudet told MarketWatch.\nThe theme park, originally called Euro Disney Resort, is owned by Euro Disney S.C.A. EDL, -0.73% a company that Walt Disney Co. DIS, +0.69% has a minority stake in.\nCharging different prices in different EU member states is not illegal, but the union’s Single Market laws ban businesses from blocking access to offers in other countries — by redirecting buyers to a country-specific website, for instance.\n“Other major amusement parks with a significant number of visitors from different EU Member States do not apply price differences based on consumers’ place of residence,” Caudet said in an email sent Wednesday.\n“Too often, consumers seeking to buy services or goods in another member state are prevented from getting the best price,” she said.\nWhat economists call price discrimination “sounds bad, since discriminating against people is generally illegal,” but it’s actually common, though it can be tricky for businesses to execute, notes a recent Harvard Business Review piece .\nThe piece adds that “most of us encounter forms of price discrimination frequently that don’t bother us. For example, who begrudges the discounts afforded to senior citizens and students?”\nRecent probes by European regulators have targeted Russian energy giant Gazprom’s pricing , as well as the U.K.’s Sky TV and U.S. movie studios . The EU’s Competition Commission has ramped up activity since its new chief, Margrethe Vestager, took up her position late last year.\nRead: Meet Denmark’s ‘Iron Lady’ who could cost Google $6 billion .\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/02/02/us-eurodisney-shareholders-specialreport-idUSKBN0L60UU20150202", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-33634657", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/27e42c8e-351d-11e5-b05b-b01debd57852.html?siteedition=uk#ixzz3hD5a1Ln7"], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T17:52:26.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
