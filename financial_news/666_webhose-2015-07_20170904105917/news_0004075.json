Louise Kennerley by Duncan Hughes Owner-occupiers should be negotiating a better variable rate with lenders desperate to hold on to their business because of tougher conditions on property investors, say mortgage brokers.\nBut home buyers are also facing rising long-term fixed rates, delays in processing new borrowing applications and more rigorous terms for additional loans as banks' profits are squeezed by tougher lending rules.\nSome analysts are convinced banks will start to raise lending rates and advise home buyers to lock in at record low rates.\nOthers claim intense lending competition and a weak economy could lead to more rate cuts. They say banks are more likely to sustain profits by maintaining low-term deposit rates and high fees for small business.\n\"There is very little doubt that rates for existing borrowers will rise,\" says Steve Mickenbecker, group executive of financial services at Canstar, a company that monitors financial products.\n\"That means there is a strong argument for mortgage borrowers to lock in,\" Mickenbecker says.\nBest-guess estimates of potential bank increases are a rise of between 25 basis points and 30 basis points over the next six to 12 months, say some analysts.\nA home buyer with a 25-year $500,000 mortgage on a rate of 4.4 per cent would pay an extra $86 a month if rates rose 30 basis points.\n For a home buyer with the same package on a $1 million loan, the monthly increase would be $171.\nThe best three-year fixed rates of 3.99 per cent are offered by Newcastle Permanent, FreedomLend and Greater Building Society.\nAustralian Mortgage Options offers the best five-year rate at 4.28 per cent. These compare with an average standard variable rate of 4.9 per cent.\nSince the beginning of the year, 58 of the five-year, fixed-rate loans monitored by Canstar have raised their rates.\nThe average five-year fixed term is 4.8 per cent, the minimum is 4.28 per cent and highest 5.89 per cent.\nHistorically, low interest rates for term deposits have remained largely unchanged.\nTim Brown, chairman of the Mortgage and Finance Association, says \"it's a great time\" to negotiate variable home loan rates because banks will fight to hold on to customers.\nMartin North, principal of Digital Finance Analytics, which advises banks on market trends, says: \"Fixing now is not the right answer.\"\nHe believes rates will continue to fall as the Reserve Bank of Australia tries to stimulate a flat economy.\nMortgage brokers such as Chris Foster-Ramsay, managing director of Capital Home Loans, say bank changes for investment borrowers have been \"biting even harder\" in the past two weeks.\nThe recent decision by Westpac, Bank of Melbourne, St George and Bank SA to reduce their investment lending ratio from 95 per cent to 80 per cent has caused prospective borrowers to seek alternatives.\nDelays in loan applications for owner-occupiers and investors are being caused by the volume of new work and brokers being unfamiliar with alternative banks' systems and policies, which means credit-assessment teams have to rework applications, often requiring additional documentation, brokers say.\n\"This is pushing out service delivery times for the other majors, which means loan applications are taking longer to be assessed,\" says Foster-Ramsay.\nThis hits investor loans and existing borrowers wanting to switch lenders for a cheaper rate, he says.\nFrom Saturday, ANZ is introducing a 7.25 per cent \"floor for serviceability\" for investor loans, which is the minimum rate at which the bank will assess a home loan.\nServiceability is the lenders' assessment of the borrowers' capacity to afford the loan and takes into account possibly higher future interest rates. It is usually assessed by a review of income and fixed commitments over the life of the loan and potential rental income.\nAnother problem facing existing off-the-plan apartment borrowers, who may have signed up a year ago, could emerge in national capitals where apartment prices are flat, or falling, such as Darwin or Perth.\nA potential difficulty might arise if the buyer has to stump up more cash for a deposit to complete the deal if the price has fallen since they signed on the dotted line.\nFor example, a bank might lend up to 90 per cent of the total value. So on a $1 million apartment, the bank would lend $900,000 and the buyer would contribute a $100,000 deposit.\nIf the property price on a $1 million apartment fell 20 per cent, the bank would only be prepared to lend $720,000 on a valuation of $800,000. The buyer would have to cover the gap.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:10:33.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
