The $7.6 billion deal turns a spotlight on Chey Tae-won, the chairman of the SK conglomerate, who is currently serving a four-year prison sentence. Here are 5 things you need to know about SK Group. \n#1: What is SK Group? \nOne of South Korea’s four largest family-owned conglomerates, known as chaebol, SK Group doesn’t stand for South Korea. It’s an abbreviation of Sunkyong, a textiles company that is a forerunner of today’s group. The chaebol trace their roots back to just after the Korean War, when the government promoted certain companies to take the lead in industries it thought could thrive internationally and help drive the nation out of poverty. \n#2: Why Haven’t I Heard Of It? \nSouth Korea’s other three main conglomerates–Samsung Group, Hyundai Group and LG Group–are household names. The SK Group isn’t well known by consumers outside the country because its businesses are concentrated in energy, chemicals and semiconductors. Within South Korea, it is recognized for its gas stations and for running the country’s largest telecommunications operator, SK Telecom. SK Hynix, another affiliate, is the world’s No. 2 memory-chip maker behind Samsung Electronics, so there’s a good chance your laptop is using its chips. \n#3: So How Big Is It? \nSK Group is the country’s third-largest chaebol, a sprawling empire of about 80 companies, grouped roughly into three realms: energy and chemicals, semiconductors and technology, and marketing and services. More than half of sales last year came from the energy and chemicals division. Last year, it racked up a collective $156.6 billion in revenue, more than General Electric Co. and roughly half of Exxon Mobil Corp. \n#4: Who Is Chey Tae-won? \nMr. Chey is the nephew of the founder and former chairman of SK Group. He is one of the best-connected men in South Korea and ranked by Forbes as the country’s sixth-richest person, with a net worth of $4.3 billion. Mr. Chey studied for a doctorate in economics at the University of Chicago, though he didn’t graduate. In 1988, he married the daughter of Roh Tae-woo, who was then president of South Korea. \n#5: Why Is Mr. Chey So Controversial? \nSK Group’s current chairman has one of the longest criminal records among South Korea’s conglomerate families, being convicted three times–in 1993 in the U.S, and by South Korean courts in 2003 and 2013. All the cases involved financial misdeeds. Mr. Chey was pardoned by South Korea’s president in the second case, though he couldn’t escape a prison sentence in 2013. He lost an appeal last year and will serve out his four-year sentence at a correctional institute in a northern suburb of Seoul, unless he wins a second presidential pardon next month, as some predict.
