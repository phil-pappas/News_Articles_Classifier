Demand plays the predominant role in driving price action in those locales, he found.\nThese three major equity markets, Chadha explains, have been rallying for very different reasons:\nAt one end of the spectrum, the equity market recovery in the US has been almost entirely driven by shrinking supply through buybacks. Since the market bottom in Mar 2009, net buybacks have amounted to $1.8 trillion or 13% of market cap, while on the demand side inflows have cumulatively been near zero. In Europe by contrast, the rally reflects a resumption of inflows over the last 2.5 years, while supply has been rising with new equity issuance and negligible buybacks. In Japan, much like in Europe, inflows have been the primary driver, amounting to $100bn or 60% of AUM since the start of Abenomics in late 2012.\nGoing forward, Chadha anticipates that the pace of inflows into equities seen since 2013 will continue or accelerate as part of a rotation away from fixed income as interest rates tick higher.\nThough rising rates have the potential to eat into debt-fuelled buybacks, he sees record-high share repurchases in the United States continuing to increase, with much room to grow amongst the financials.", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iDQ37x4uhHSo/v1/460x260.png\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i7pijCIfY5Pk/v1/460x260.png\\"], "published": "2015-07-21T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T16:04:04.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
