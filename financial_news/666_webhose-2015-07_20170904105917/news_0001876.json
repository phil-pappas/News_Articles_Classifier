RBS is expected to appeal the decision. \nIt comes at a critical time for RBS. Chancellor George Osborne announced last month that he plans to start selling off the UK government’s stake later this year. \nThe bank also hopes to return to profit in 2016 for the first time since its £46bn bailout in 2008. It announced a £3.5bn annual loss for last year. \nRBS has already taken a £400m hit for PPI compensation, £430m for US fines related to foreign exchange rigging , and another £444m of conduct and litigation charges in the fourth quarter of last year. \nRBS declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T21:06:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
