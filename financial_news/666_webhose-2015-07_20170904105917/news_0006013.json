Some expressed their anger on social media, where the Twitter (Swiss: TWTR.SW - news ) hashtag #ThisIsACoup trended. \nGreece's public servants are also to stage a 24-hour strike on Wednesday, the first big stoppage since Tsipras took power. \nHaralambos Rouliskos, a 60-year-old economist, described the deal as \"misery, humiliation and slavery\". \nThe eurozone creditors \"are trying to blackmail us,\" said Katerina Katsaba, a 52-year-old working for a pharmaceutical company. \nFaced with a eurozone deeply distrustful of Athens after five months of tense meetings, the 40-year-old Tsipras had to agree to demands that critics say rob Greece of financial independence. \n\"This agreement may pass with (opposition party) votes, but it will never pass the people,\" the head of a hardline Syriza faction, Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, said. \nIf Greece passes it, Europe's next step would be to push the deal through several national parliaments, many in countries that are loath to afford Athens more help. \nGermany's Bundestag is likely to vote on Friday, provided the Greek parliament rushes through the four new market-oriented laws by Wednesday. \nDespite strong opposition, Tsipras also yielded to a plan to park assets for privatisation worth up to 50 billion euros in a special fund. \nSome 25 billion euros of the money in that fund will then be used to recapitalise Greece's cash-starved banks. \nThere is also a pledge to reverse laws brought in by the Syriza government that run counter to Greece's earlier bailout arrangements in 2010 and 2012. \n- 'No golden key' - \nThe deal contains little mention of relieving a Greek debt mountain worth 180 percent of GDP -- a step recommended by the International Monetary Fund -- beyond a vague mention that it should be considered later. \nThe eurozone must now unite to tackle the immediate problem of finding funds to keep Greece afloat as Athens faces several huge debt payments to the ECB and other creditors and the bailout could take weeks if not months to finalise. \nEurozone finance ministers were meeting Tuesday to consider bridge funding for Greece, but officials said there was no easy solution. \nThe ECB meanwhile has kept Greek banks afloat -- barely -- with emergency liquidity, but has refused to provide extra funds. \nBanks will stay closed in Greece until Wednesday, the country's finance ministry said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T15:22:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
