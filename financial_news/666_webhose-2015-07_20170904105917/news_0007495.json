Photo: Louie Douvis\nThere's a big unspoken question on the agenda for Wednesday's alleged tax summit of the state and federal governments: how long can the looming fiscal crunch be kicked down the road, for how many more elections can it be ignored?\nNSW Premier Mike Baird has broken ranks by daring to be honest about a key aspect of it : our current health funding is not sustainable. Either we reduce our health care expectations, be prepared to pay more one way or another, or a state or two will go broke.\nIn the process, Baird highlighted the big fib his federal counterparts keep trotting out about being the party of tax cuts, promising \"lower\" taxes, along with fairer and simpler.\nThe feds can only deliver tax cuts if the states make up for them with tax and fee increases.\nAdvertisement It's a con – or, at best, a cunning plan to offload the political pain onto the provinces.\nHonesty has become a novelty item in our politics. It worked well for Baird at the last state election, proof that people are prepared to trust the policies of a politician they trust.\nNow he's wisely linking the honesty to the most saleable aspect of state responsibilities, health.\nCost crisis not new There's nothing new about the crisis inherent in the cost of hospitals. Yes, there are efficiencies that can and should be made, especially the ones that deliver better patient outcomes, but our demographic future is not going to be avoided.\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics' website has an interactive population projection pyramid that is as fascinating as it is frightening when you grasp what the bulging lines mean.\nIn the national version, it is indeed a pyramid, with the wobbles of the baby boomers and their echo evident.\nBut select the state alternative and you don't necessarily find pyramids. South Australia is closer to tram lines. Tasmania is a nulla nulla with its bulge near the top and rising with the years. The fiscal cliff is in those lines.\nThere is nothing new about the ramifications.\nFor anyone who was listening, the alarm was sounded back when Kevin Rudd was offering to take over funding hospitals .\nIt was acknowledged in that process that just the hospitals would soon enough soak up all of the GST. (That a congenitally contrary state or two refused to hand over the hospitals when they had the chance will remain one of the greater testimonies to stupidity and regional self-importance.)\nMike Baird is saying that point has passed, that the current system \"can no longer fund health services to our current standard\". And he's from NSW, the healthiest state fiscally, at least at this stage of a housing bubble.\nFrightening: The ABS' data shows the population challenge facing Australia\nGST increase Baird's suggested answer is to increase the GST rate from 10 to 15 per cent. It's not the only answer – there's a very good argument for broadening it, doing what John Howard wanted to do in the first place, especially as we increasingly spend more on services and less on the things that GST applies to. If we're serious, it is possible to compensate the especially disadvantaged for the changes.\nWhatever the permutation, this is the direction in which the first Abbott/Hockey budget intended to push the states. By slashing the state's expected health and education funding down the track, the idea is to force them to demand and pursue their own fund raising. At its purest, the danger of the right's \"competitive federalism\" dogma is that it effectively dooms the poorer states.\nThe other obvious major change, long pushed here, is to replace stamp duty with a broad, no-exemptions land tax. It's all in the tax reform bible, better known as the Henry review.\nChanges ruled out But last week the Victorian Labor Premier ruled out touching GST and the Liberal West Australian Premier ruled out touching such a land tax. (OMG, not the sacred \"family home\"!)\nSuch attitudes, along with the Liberal Prime Minister pre-emptively ruling out any number of reforms, define the intellectual capacity of their proponents. (No, Virginia, there actually isn't a Santa Claus and Australia does need to increase its share of direct taxation revenue, among other things.) To be slightly kinder, it defines their willingness to put party politics ahead of the nation's best interests.\nSo, if a bigger and/or wider GST is to be part of the answer, how can it be sold to a public already sold numerous furphies about it?\nAs previously suggested , the spin doctors could earn their keep by renaming it the HST – the Health Services Tax - and explicitly linking the revenue raised to health spending.\nAs Quote: : \"Electors are more willing to pay tax if they understand where the money goes, effectively knowing what their tax dollar is buying instead of watching it disappear down government's dubious maw to go the way of party politics, Cabcharge vouchers and suspected welfare cheats.\"\nOh, I think that was me.\nTo update, I'd replace the Cabcharge line with \"helicopter charters and European limos\". That seems to amount to progress in our governments.\nMore economic news and analysis Follow us on Twitter @BusinessDay", "external_links": ["http://twittter.com/businessday"], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T21:07:14.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
