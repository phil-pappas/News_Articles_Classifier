Article 2:24, which defined \"coffee roaster\", is the article that led to the Ministry's taking this measure. The Amharic version refers to those who buy coffee from \"domestic wholesalers\", while the English version of the same articles goes further to give details including \"auction centers, Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX), and domestic consumption coffee wholesalers\". \nThe directive issued for the enforcement of the proclamation has been in effect since 2008, but it was only in January 2015 that the Ministry started checking for compliance, Tatek Girma, coffee marketing team coordinator at MoT, told Fortune. The Ministry, based on the Amharic version, insists that the roasters can buy only coffee destined for domestic consumption, even if they are going to export the roasted or ground coffee, he stated. That the English version mentioned the ECX, only shows that an amendment is required, he added. \nHowever, the decision has put the companies out of the roasted coffee export business as they cannot use domestic consumption coffee for their process by the restriction not to do so on the same proclamation, according to Minilik Hamtu director of Ethiopian Coffee Roasters Association. The article defines domestic coffee as coffee that has deteriorated in quality and is not fit for export. \nA manager of one of the suspended companies said that they cannot use coffee designated for domestic consumption for their export market, as it will be a violation of the proclamation as well. \nThe Ministry called the four roasters to tell them in person to stop using export standard coffee, and the roasters were in agreement with what the Ministry said, Tatek explained. \nThe government was so focused on boosting coffee exports that the violation of the proclamation was missed for the past year, Tatek claimed; it was also only a year ago that the directorate was created, he added. \nIn 2013, Ethiopia exported 6.6 million kilograms of roasted coffee to countries such as Turkey, Germany and South Africa but that amount has been reduced to 8,314 Kg in the current fiscal year. Though the quantity of exported coffee is very small, it could contribute to a whole lot of revenue if encouraged, argued Minilik, as roasted coffee is sold for 10 dollars per kilogram, as compared to three dollars for the raw beans. \nTatek said that the export contribution of these companies was minimal, hence the decision to suspend them until the proclamation is clear on the subject. Currently the Ministry is trying to assess the economic benefit of the business as well as other legal implications. According to Getahun, the assessment is expected to be completed in October, 2015, and forwarded to the Ministry's higher officials.
