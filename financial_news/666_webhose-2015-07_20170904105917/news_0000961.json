That was flatly denied by Department of Health Commissioner Mary E. O'Dowd, who says the state's oversight of the hospital has been intense and that a series of fines against the hospital have set a precedent for future enforcement actions. The state recently levied fines against the hospital for failing to file audited financial statements for both 2012 and 2013. The total of both the original fines and additional penalties for slow responses has reached $92,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T13:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T15:12:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
