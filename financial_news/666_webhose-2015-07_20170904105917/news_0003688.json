Retirees have already withdrawn £1.8bn from pension pots since the new rules took effect in April. \n“There’s a huge danger, in that we now have a lot of people needing to make investment decisions who have never made them before,” said Pradeep Oliver, head of professional negligence at NeglectAssist, a law firm. \n“Interest rates are low, and that opens the door to people selling exotic, riskier investments.” \nEstimates of unregulated schemes sold to retail investors range from £2bn to £14bn. The Financial Ombudsman said it experienced a significant rise in complaints about unregulated investment schemes in 2014-15. \nThe Financial Services Compensation Scheme said this week it paid out almost £20m in the past year over risky and illiquid investments within self-invested personal pensions, and expected claims to keep rising. \nTobias Haynes of law firm Regulatory Legal says his company represents thousands of investors in schemes that have suspended redemptions or lost some or all of investors’ money. These date mainly from a spate of selling that began in about 2005 and went on until at least 2013. \nMany of the products paid high commissions to advisers or to “introducers” operating outside the UK regulatory framework. \n“Many of the people we represent were advised to invest at least 75 per cent of their pension savings. Most of them had no clue as to how risky these investments are,” Mr Haynes said. \nAsset classes sold in this way included traded life policies, the life assurance policies of US pensioners, which are sold on and pay out when the policyholders die. Overseas property and land were also popular; all were billed as uncorrelated investments that could generate high yields. \nDeath bonds trap \nDavid Trinkwon, who ran a telecoms consultancy, has spent large chunks of the past two years absorbed in another industry entirely — traded life policies, also known as “death bonds”. Mr Trinkwon invested a six-figure sum in the Guernsey-based EEA Life Settlements fund before the product suspended redemptions to investors and began a series of writedowns to net asset value. The lion’s share of investors’ money remains trapped. \nContinue reading \nSome, such as MPL Traded Life Policies , collapsed when investors tried to withdraw their money, while others, such as the Harlequin Hotels & Resorts property scheme and Axiom Legal Financing fund, are now subject to fraud claims. \nThe funds often suspend redemptions to investors and then carry out writedowns to net asset value, leading to long delays before investors realise they have been sold an unsuitable product. “We still get calls about these schemes every week,” Mr Oliver said. \nPeople who were sold the funds through a regulated adviser can seek redress through the ombudsman or FSCS, while some investors have opted for civil litigation, but all of these are subject to time limitations and can also be delayed by wrangling over how funds are wound down. \nIn 2013, the UK government banned commissions to advisers, while the City regulator has also imposed limits on the sales of unregulated schemes to most investors. This has helped stem the tide somewhat. \nHowever, unregulated “introducers” continue to market exotic investments in exchange for commissions, Mr Haynes said. “That can be even more dangerous, since there is no redress for investors.” \nWhile most financial advisers operate in good faith, a minority of unscrupulous advisers will carry out unregulated business through a separate company, and British expatriates have also been targeted by advisers based in popular overseas destinations such as Spain, he added.
