Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow It had begun so well. But Wednesday stopped being any fun at all a little after 3pm when a friend called to tell us Neil Lawrence had died.\nWe called someone else to check it was wrong. It wasn't.\nThen we left the office and had a cry in the park.\nNeil was a legend many times over – a legend in advertising (most recently, he reinvigorated Qantas with the beautiful Feels Like Home campaign), a legend in politics (he created Kevin07, he sustained Jay Weatherill ) and a legend across the table from you at lunch (particularly at Walsh Bay restaurant Hickson's where they, quite rightly, adored him).\nOf course he wasn't perfect. But we forgive him for his role in creating the Rudd monster. He always forgave us for going on in this column, ad nauseam ﻿ , about his derrière tattoo – the result of a bet with Weatherill and his friend and pollster Tony Mitchelmore that he was gentleman enough to honour .\nHe was a key supporter of \" Recognise \", the movement to change the Australian constitution to give recognition to the first Australians. The last time we caught up, he was worried about how it was all going.\nHe died on a surfing holiday in the Maldives, ending an extraordinary life.\nGod, he'll be missed.\nRelated ", "external_links": ["http://www.recognise.org.au/", "http://www.hicksons.com/", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16RhgfA662k"], "published": "2015-07-16T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T00:58:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
