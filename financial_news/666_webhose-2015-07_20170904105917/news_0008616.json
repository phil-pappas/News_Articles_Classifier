Thirty-eight percent said now is a “good time” to find a quality job, which is down 3 percentage points from June. Gallup’s latest recorded level is the lowest since last December, but higher than any figure recorded between 2008 and 2014. The current rating matches the level Gallup recorded when it began asking questions about people’s optimism regarding jobs in August 2001. ADVERTISEMENT While Gallup has never found a majority those 14 years that have said it’s a good time to find a job, the level peaked at 48 percent in January 2007. Due to the recession, the level of optimism plummeted to 8 percent by November 2009. People’s perceptions of the job market, Gallup explained, is usually grounded in their political ideologies. People who identify as or lean Democratic, or 46 percent, are much more upbeat about the jobs market than those who lean or identify as Republican, or 29 percent. Gallup said men are much more upbeat than women and employed adults are much more upbeat than those who are unemployed. People under 30 have a mostly positive view of the job market while those who are 65 and older are the least positive. The poll surveyed 1,009 adults between July 8 and 12 with a 4 percentage point margin of error.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:33:19.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
