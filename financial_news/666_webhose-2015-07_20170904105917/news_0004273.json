That compares with $1.0946 late Wednesday in New York. Against the yen, the common currency EURJPY, -0.42% fell to ¥135.16 before slightly trimming its losses to ¥135.28 midday. That was lower than ¥135.53 in New York.\nThe bloc’s single currency gained momentum in early morning Asia trade, following news that Greece’s parliament passed austerity measures , including steep spending cuts and tax increases, needed to secure a fresh bailout.\nBut the gains proved short-lived in “a sign that the market focus has already shifted to diverging monetary policy between the U.S. and the eurozone,” said IG Securities market analyst Junichi Ishikawa.\nIllustrating this contrast, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen signaled Wednesday that recent turbulence in Greece, China and elsewhere overseas isn’t threatening the U.S. economy enough to divert the central bank from plans to raise short-term interest rates later this year. Many investors expect the Fed’s first rate increase at its policy meeting in September.\nViolent clashes erupt in Athens (1:51) Clashes erupted outside the parliament building in Athens on Wednesday at an anti-austerity rally, as riot police deployed pepper spray and tear gas against protesters.\nYellen was speaking at the testimony that marks the first of two days of semiannual hearings before lawmakers. She will speak before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.\nAs the European Central Bank, which is now conducting massive bond purchase program called quantitative easing, is widely expected to stand pat on its monetary policy later today, U.S. data such as unemployment insurance weekly claims and the Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey will be in focus, said Ishikawa.\nRead: Greece’s shadow looms as ECB’s Draghi gears up for policy meeting\n“The market theme is shifting to monetary policy,” said Yasuaki Amatatsu, senior analyst of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.\nIn addition, Amatatsu said once Greek worries or other political and financial instability fades, the eurozone stocks are bought and bond yields there go down. That helps lay the groundwork for investors to resume so-called ECB trade, a combination of long eurozone stock, long eurozone bond and short euro positions.\n“Today’s move shows risk-on is expected to increase further on Greece. And the euro is being sold against that backdrop,” he said.\nAmong other currency pairs, the dollar USDJPY, +0.22% was at ¥123.76, almost unchanged from ¥123.79 in New York.\nThe WSJ Dollar Index BUXX, +0.36% a measure of the dollar against a basket of major currencies, was up 0.12% at 88.16.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T14:56:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
