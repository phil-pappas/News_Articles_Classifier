Across Australia, it fell by between 14 per cent and 22 per cent in Sydney and a staggering 59 per cent decline in Canberra as the federal government reassessed its office portfolio.\nCorporates downsizing their workforce were responsible for most of the vacancy. Premium and A-grade space made up 74 per cent of the available sublease space, whereas vacant B-grade space was triggered by relocating tenants.\nCBRE agent director of office services Andrew Tracey said the improving conditions reflected increasing occupier demand and improving business confidence levels.\nBut the improvement was dependent on particular sectors, Mr Tracey said.\n\"Sublease availability in the finance and insurance sectors has dropped by almost 50 per cent and they were previously the largest provider of space. That position is now held by the IT sector with 18,00 square metres available,\" he said.\nSome building owners are upgrading and refurbishing space to help attract new tenants. A string of deals covering 15,400 square metres of space at 120 Collins Street has followed a refurbishment program.\nNew tenants have signed up to the city's tallest office building, including Schwartz-family owned boutique investment bank Qualitas, online betting group CrownBet, Property Partners, Centuria Capital, Moelis & Company and the Royal Bank of Canada.\nAnd in the suburbs, Prattcorp's PCL has achieved nearly 100 per cent occupancy at 818 Whitehorse Road, Box Hill after extensive redevelopment.\nColliers International agents Damien Adkins and Michael Darvell, with Gordon Kelly from Kelly & Kelly Property negotiated new leases for 5200 square metres of the 6000-square-metre building, which is about 30 years old.\nMr Adkins said a new facade and bigger floor plates were created during a 12-month redevelopment plan.\n\"Everything in the building is now brand new, including the lifts, ceilings and air-conditioning,\" he said.\nNew tenants in the building include Telstra, Australian Aged Care, Flexera Software, Regus, Australian Unity and Hillross.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T22:09:52.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
