This makes it all the more notable that Mr Javid has rebuked the country’s biggest business group, the CBI, over its approach to the European Union, membership of which it supports uncritically. \nMr Javid is right about Europe. Britain will only win real change in its membership if other leaders believe that such change is the only way to avert our departure. He is also correct in his implicit challenge to the CBI’s claim to be the principal voice of British business. \nThat claim is dubious, to say the least. Contrary to the impression often given by the equally pro-European BBC, the CBI is simply one of many groups that speak for British companies and those who own and run them. Nor is it the most authoritative or credible. In the debate about Britain’s place in Europe, it must be noted that the CBI strongly backed British membership of the euro, a policy that would have done untold harm to British business. Among its other mistakes has been support for a “green” energy fad that has saddled taxpayers with subsidies and distorts markets to the detriment of consumers. \nThe CBI’s shortcomings are not limited to misjudgments on specific policies, however. Its entire outlook is highly questionable. An organisation that might have been expected to celebrate the appointment of a deregulating Thatcherite like Mr Javid instead seems to miss his Liberal Democrat predecessor Vince Cable. Where other business groups like the Institute of Directors unashamedly champion capitalism red in tooth and claw, the creative destruction of the marketplace and a small state, the CBI often appears to prefer a cosy corporatism where a few big businessess work closely with British and European officials to promote policies and regulations that minimise disruption and preserve the status quo. That may serve the interests of a select group of companies, but it is no way to spread the wealth-creating benefits of competition across the UK economy as whole. \nThe CBI has this week appointed a new director-general. Carolyn Fairbairn, like most of her predecessors, has never run or founded a private company, though she was a senior management consultant. We wish her well in her new job. She has much to do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T08:37:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
