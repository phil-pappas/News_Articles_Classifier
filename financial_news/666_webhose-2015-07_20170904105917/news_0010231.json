Microsoft also slumped after reporting its biggest-ever quarterly loss.\nIn currencies, the dollar nudged up 0.1 percent to 124.04 yen after rebounding overnight from a low of 123.27 thanks to a rise in U.S. home sales to a 8-1/2 year peak. The euro was little changed at $1.0926 after coming off an overnight peak of $1.0966.\nWeaker commodity prices also supported a mild rebound in the dollar. Brent crude prices lost 1.6 percent on Wednesday after data showed U.S. crude inventories rose last week, while spot gold slid to a five-year low on the dollar's bounce.\n\"Sentiment towards commodities as a whole has been plummeting as the Fed lift-off timeline narrows and the drive to the dollar returns after six weeks of macro turmoil,\" Evan Lucas, market strategist at IG in Melbourne, wrote.\nThe Greek debt crisis has gone on the back burner for the time being after Athens reached an agreement with its European creditors earlier this month, allowing market focus to shift back towards divergences in monetary policies between countries.\nThe drop in commodity prices has not been kind to commodity currencies such as the Canadian dollar, which retreated overnight to a six-year low of C$1.3053 against the U.S. dollar.\nThe Canadian dollar and other commodity currencies could weaken even more if the U.S. Federal Reserve begins hiking interest rates as early as September.\nThe New Zealand dollar, which also probed multi-year lows recently against the U.S. currency, fared a little better after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand delivered a smaller interest rate cut than some in the market expected and softened its rhetoric on the kiwi following its recent, dramatic fall.\nThe kiwi went as high as $0.6654 to put some distance between a six-year trough of $0.6498 hit last week.
