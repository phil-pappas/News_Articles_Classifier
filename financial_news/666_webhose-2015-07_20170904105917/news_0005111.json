Mr Osborne published a document pointing out that the Ministry of Defence alone owns about 1% of all UK land. \nThe Government sold assets worth £1.7bn in the last parliament - but Whitehall still owns land and property worth £300bn. \nThe departments are being asked to save up to 40% of their resource budgets by 2019/20. \nAnnouncing the Spending Review, which will be set out on 25 November, Mr Osborne warned Britain was still borrowing £1 for every £10 we spend and that national debt was still at its highest level for 50 years. \nThe planned £20bn savings follow the £12bn in welfare cuts and £5bn from tackling tax avoidance announced in the Budget earlier this month. \nMr Osborne said: \"This Spending Review is the next step in our plan to eliminate the deficit, run a surplus and ensure Britain lives within its means. \n\"We'll invest in our priorities like the NHS and national security. Elsewhere in government, departments will have to find significant savings through efficiencies and by devolving power, so people have a greater say over the issues that affect them and their communities. We'll deliver more with less.\" \nThe Chancellor confirmed NHS spending would be protected and confirmed the Budget commitment to increase funding by £10bn in real terms but 2020/21.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T16:34:57.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
