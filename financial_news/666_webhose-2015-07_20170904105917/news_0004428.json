By Roland Head | Fool.co.uk – 8 minutes ago 64.30 +3.3000 \nThree popular private investor stocks, Victoria Oil & Gas (LSE: VOG), Mothercare (LSE: MTC) and Angle (LSE: AGL), each issued trading updates this morning. \nAll three firms have seen their share prices move sharply since markets opened, so I've been taking a closer look at each company's news. \nMothercare \nShares in Mothercare fell by 7% this morning after the firm reported a 5.2% decline in group sales. \nAlthough UK like-for-like sales were up by 1.3% and online sales rose by 24%, total UK sales fell by 0.9%. \nUK store space fell by 5.3% as loss-making stores were eliminated, but Mothercare chief executive Mark Newton-Jones said that careful stock management and reduced discounting is helping to improve profit margins. \nHowever, the firm's international expansion appears to have hit a speed bump. Despite a 7.9% increase in international retail space over the last 15 weeks, sales fell by 4.8% during the same period. \nThis is probably the major factor behind today's drop. If Mothercare's total sales are falling, then the firm's wafer-thin profit margins and its forecast P/E of 28 look increasingly unappealing. \nMothercare remains a sell, for me. \nVictoria Oil & Gas \nThings seem to be improving at serial underperformer Victoria Oil & Gas. \nThe firm debuted a new format quarterly update today, highlighting a 178% rise in gas sales from its Logbaba field during the second quarter. Average gas production has risen from 4.5 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscf/d) during the first calendar quarter of the year to 12.6 mmscf/d during the second quarter. \nI was also encouraged to see that cash received for gas sales rose by 92% to $9.8m during the last quarter. \nToday's update mentioned Victoria's reassuring $14.2m cash balance, but did not refer to net debt, which was $6.6m at the end of November. \nUnfortunately, there was no information on average gas sale prices, either. I suspect these have fallen over the last year. \nThe problem I have is that Victoria is very slow at publishing its accounts -- last year's results were published five months after the year ended. This makes it difficult to get an accurate picture of the firm's finances. \nAlthough Victoria is expected to report a profit this year and trades on a 2016 P/E of 5.5, I would wait for evidence of positive cash flow before buying. \nAngle \nShares in small-cap medical tech company Angle fell to a low of 86p after markets opened this morning, before recovering to around 90p. \nThe firm, which is developing tests for cancer, published its preliminary results today. The highlights seemed positive, confirming that the firm will begin selling ovarian cancer test kits for research use this year. \nIn the meantime, the figures suggest that Angle should have enough cash to keep things moving for at least another year. In the year to 30 April, Angle reported cash outgoings of £3.8m, less than half the £8.4m cash balance reported at the end of last year. \nSo is Angle a buy? The company says that the ovarian cancer diagnostics market could be worth £300m per year, while the overall cancer diagnostic market could be worth £8bn per year. \nThese are big numbers, but Angle's product has yet to prove its commercial appeal for even one type of cancer. The firm remains a speculative buy at best, in my view. \nInvesting in small caps and turnaround stocks can be a risky business. \nProper diversification of your portfolio is a must, if you want to avoid the risk of devastating losses. \nIf you're looking for new buys, the Fool's top stock pickers have recently identified a UK small cap they believe could be undervalued by as much as 40% . \nFor full details of this company, including its name, download \" 1 Top Small-Cap Stock From The Motley Fool \" immediately. \nThis must-read report is FREE and without obligation . \nTo receive your copy, click here now . \nRoland Head has no position in any shares mentioned.
