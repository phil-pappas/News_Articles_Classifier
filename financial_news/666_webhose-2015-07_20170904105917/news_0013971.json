Jessica Sier This is a personal problem and can be dealt with only on an individual basis. There are many ways to cope, and because calling a therapist over lunch as your decision-fatigue reaches breaking point is embarrassing, here are two interesting smartphone apps that take different approaches when the urge to kill is rising:\nHeadspace Headspace is a secular course in meditation and mindfulness. It's gorgeous and not in the slightest bit wanky.\nIt's a series of mindfulness exercises voiced by founder Andy Puddicombe, a former Buddhist monk with a great sense of humour. For the untrained, stressed or murderous, simply \"putting your thoughts aside\" is not that bloody easy.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating...

I've always found the smug, dreamy tones of those who have \"like, got enlightenment\" absurdly irritating but Puddicombe sounds cheerful and real and does a wonderful job of keeping your mind on track.\nAfterwards you feel humble, grounded and sharp. The more you practice, the more you can lapse into this state of curious focus, which is useful when your days are constant streams of concentrated thinking.\nAnd let's be real, if you're reading the AFR, they might be.\nHeadspace is free to download for iPhone and Android, but there are extra costs of downloading more meditations as you progress.\nAcupressure: Heal Yourself Acupressure is like science, man. Despite the well-meaning attempts of many workplaces to provide standing desks and ergonomic chairs (yeah, but who can actually work theirs?), tension coils in our shoulders, necks and backs.\nMany workers have simply learned to work through an acute headache or have a beer at lunch to unwind. Acupressure: Heal Yourself is a large compendium of pressure points all over your body that miraculously vanquish headaches or unravel tension.\nMany people know of the Union Valley point, located in the webbing between the thumb and index finger. If you press this firmly for one minute, your headache seeps away. Also great for hangovers.\nAcupressure: Heal Yourself has hundreds of stretches and pressure points for relieving nausea, digestive disorders and addictions, with plenty of images to show you exactly where to press. It's available for Apple, Windows and Android smartphones and costs about $2.50.", "external_links": ["https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/acupressure-heal-yourself/id429680650?mt=8", "https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/headspace-meditation-techniques/id493145008?mt=8"], "published": "2015-07-31T11:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T10:10:24.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
