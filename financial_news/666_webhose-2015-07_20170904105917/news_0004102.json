As of 15:30, the FTSE 100 was trading just 0.06% lower at 6,663.02. \nThe City was abuzz with talk about possible buyers for Pearson 's FT Group division, which publishes the Financial Times , which was eventually confirmed by Japan's Nikkei Group for £1.29bn in mid afternoon. Shares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in the increasingly education-focused group were up 2.4% an hour before the close. \nBouncing back from its falls on Wednesday, microchip designer ARM led the risers. With its own quarterly results and those of its main customer Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) both missing expectations, Thursday's reflections were more sanguine, helped by positive broker recommendations from the likes of RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) and Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS - news ) being followed by a reiteration of its 'conviction list buy' from Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) , which said the multiple de-rating was \"unwarranted given strong full year trajectory\", thought it trimmed its target price to 1,500p from 1,550p. \nAlthough some analysts believed it is overpriced, Unilever (NYSE: UL - news ) laughed in the face of continuing consumer weakness around the globe, impressing investors with strong sales growth. \nDIY retail chain Kingfisher , owner of B&Q and Screwfix in the UK as well as Castorama and Brico Depot in France, gave its shares a new lick of paint by nailing a solid rise in second-quarter sales. \nLimiting the index's gains, were two financial sector powerhouses. Aberdeen Asset Management (Other OTC: ABDNF - news ) led the sector's retreat after revealing third-quarter net outflows had accelerated. \nFellow money manager Ashtead slumped after double downgrade by Bank of America Merrill Lynch . \nOther fallers included energy company SSE , which posted first-quarter results that showed increased production in all of its divisions apart from coal. However, the company said it expects lower profits from its energy supply business this year but higher profit from its management and generation business. \nSupermarket group Sainsbury's fell more than 3% on the day it launched an offering of £250m perpetual subordinated convertible bonds. The Office for National Statistics also released national retail sales numbers that included news that UK food sales fell 0.3% in June. \nDrug company Shire (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) was down 1.2% as investors mulled its missed second quarter growth forecasts but newly hiked full year earnings guidance. \nJohnson Matthey (LSE: JMAT.L - news ) was another faller after revealing first quarter profits had dipped. \nFTSE 100 - Risers ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) (ARM) 1,001.00p +3.20% Pearson (PSON) 1,236.00p +2.23% Unilever (ULVR) 2,913.00p +1.89% Kingfisher (KGF) 373.90p +1.88% Severn Trent (Other OTC: STRNY - news ) (SVT) 2,168.00p +1.88% United Utilities Group (UU.) 891.00p +1.83% CRH (CRH (NYSE: CRH - news ) ) 1,907.00p +1.65% Sports Direct International (LSE: SPD.L - news ) (SPD) 788.00p +1.55% Meggitt (MGGT) 466.00p +1.48% Fresnillo (FRES) 644.00p +1.42% FTSE 100 - Fallers Aberdeen Asset Management (ADN) 370.80p -7.18% SSE (SSE (LSE: SSE.L - news ) ) 1,515.00p -4.54% Sainsbury (J) (SBRY) 263.40p -3.37% Ashtead Group (LSE: AHT.L - news ) (AHT) 985.00p -2.18% Glencore (GLEN) 224.70p -1.45% Shire Plc (SHP) 5,400.00p -1.19% Standard Chartered (Other OTC: SCBFF - news ) (STAN) 984.50p -1.13% Johnson Matthey (JMAT) 2,869.00p -1.07% BP (BP.) 402.35p -1.05% Marks & Spencer Group (MKS) 529.50p -1.03%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T20:16:26.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
