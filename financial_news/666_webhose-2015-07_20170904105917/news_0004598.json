It encouraged banks to offer loans to China Securities Finance Corp., an agency that helps to supply credit for stock purchases.\nOne of the side-effects of the stock market’s collapse from a June 12 peak was to diminish the value of shares pledged as collateral for loans from banks and brokerages. As of Wednesday, that pool of stock was valued at 1.9 trillion yuan ($306 billion) and comprised shares in 1,170 companies, according to Wind Information data.\n“The bottom line for the government is to prevent contagion to the banking system, which can lead to systemic risks,” said Zheng Chunming, a Shanghai-based banking and brokerage analyst at Capital Securities Corp. “Some stocks have tumbled more than 60 percent, any further drop will start to hurt banks’ financial health no matter how low the leverage is.”\nThe Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.8 percent as of 10:29 a.m. local time.", "external_links": ["http://www.cbrc.gov.cn/chinese/home/docView/BD501427F9C642A7B77C34BFBE10627C.html\\"], "published": "2015-07-09T10:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T05:41:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
