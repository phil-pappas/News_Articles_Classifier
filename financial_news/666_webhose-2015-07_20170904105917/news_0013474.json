While the Nasdaq Composite rose 5.3% for the first six months of the year, the Nasdaq Biotech Index rose a whopping 21.6% as of June 30. In comparison the S&P 500 Index barely eked out a positive return for the first two quarters. Even within the red-hot biotech sector, there are superior performers. Here they are. TheStreet paired each of these tickers with TheStreet Ratings to let you know if you should buy, sell, or hold these best performing stocks. ( Because of TheStreet Ratings parameters, not all stocks on this list have a rating. ) \nTheStreet Ratings , TheStreet 's proprietary ratings tool, projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and dividends. Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year.
