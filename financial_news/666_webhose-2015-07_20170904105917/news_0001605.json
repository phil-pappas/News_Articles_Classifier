Dean Sewell by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Macquarie Capital is introducing Global Traffic Network to institutional investors ahead of a potential $400 million-plus initial public offering.\nGTN met with Canadian fund managers last week and will be in Hong Kong and Sydney this week, before travelling to Melbourne and New Zealand next week.\nThe company provides traffic news to radio and television stations in exchange for embedded advertising spots, which it sells to advertisers. It is best known in Australia for its traffic news presenter Vic Lorusso.\nIt's understood GTN has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $30 million-plus, and revenue of about $150 million.\nGTN is expected to raise about $200 million to $300 million for a market value of more than $400 million.\nMacquarie is sole lead manager on the float, with formal marketing to come after reporting season.\nChicago-based private equity firm GTCR owns 90 per cent of GTN, while founding chief executive William L. Yde III is also a significant shareholder.\nYde founded GTN in 1997 as the Australian Traffic Network and later expanded operations into Canada and the United Kingdom.\n About 57 per cent of revenue is derived from Australia, with 27 per cent coming from the UK, 14 per cent from Canada and 2 per cent from Brazil.\nBrazil presents a huge growth opportunity for the company, given it has a population of about 200 million, high traffic levels and fragmented radio station ownership. Sao Paulo, which is home to about 20 million people, is well known for its gridlocked traffic, while Rio de Janeiro is hosting the Summer 2016 Olympic Games.\nThere are only a few companies on the Australian Securities Exchange, including SEEK Limited and Goodman Group, with exposure to Brazil.\nGTCR had originally considered an Australian Traffic Network sale but decided the global company was a better IPO proposition, appointing Macquarie shortly afterwards.\nMoelis & Co had been hired for the ATN sale before the company opted for a float.\nIt's understood private equity firms CHAMP, Pacific Equity Partners and Quadrant, as well as media groups News Corporation and Nine Entertainment Co, had a look at the company.\nElsewhere, well-placed sources said Alliance Aviation Services, whose share price has dropped 54 per cent since December, is in the cross-hairs of private equity.\nThe Brisbane-based charter and fly-in fly-out operator has suffered on the back of the resources slowdown and corresponding fall in FIFO charter flying.\nCHAMP and The Carlyle Group had expressed interest in Alliance before it listed at $1.60 a share in December 2011. The shares are now trading at 46Â¢.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:06:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
