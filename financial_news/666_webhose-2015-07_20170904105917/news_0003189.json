After a very volatile few days last week with two successive closes below the 200-day moving average the index is suddenly again in a strong position. Yesterday’s move through a key confluence of resistance near 2100 (50-day moving average, median line channel, 61.8% retracement of May- July decline) was potentially an important change in behavior and warns a more meaningful move higher is taking shape. The 78.6% retracement of the May –July decline at 2116 is immediate resistance, but a close over 2130 is really needed to trigger an important upside push. Weakness back under 2087 would be a cause for concern.
