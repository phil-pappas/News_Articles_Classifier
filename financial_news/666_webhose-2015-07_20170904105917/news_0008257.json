You lose money. Getty Images Share on twitter by Philip Baker It doesn't seem that long ago that everyone was an expert on China. Was there anyone who couldn't tell you that China had 1.3 billion people and an economy that was just going gangbusters. It just had to be a great place to invest.\nBut China's sharemarket is like no other.\nApart from the $US564 billion ($775 billion) of debt linked to speculation on its shares, global investors should remember that Chinese investors don't have the options market that developed sharemarkets do, shorting selling is a no-no and technically speaking, Platinum Asset Management's Kerr Neilson says, investors are not allowed to day trade.\nEvery now and then investors need to face a few tough weeks to remind them that making money isn't easy.\nNo one enjoys it but learning to live with losing money helps in the long run.\nBut a big concern now for the Chinese sharemarket is the lack of confidence stemming from the government's failure to prop up the market successfully.\nAttempts to stop the selling included suspending IPOs, some direct buying and loosening a few of the rules around margin loans.\nIt looks like it hasn't quite worked.\n And that has raised concerns that this sell-off will lead to something more sinister, or become the so-called X factor.\nIn the wake of the global financial crisis, investors have tried to work out what could come at them from left field and cause mayhem in financial markets.\nElement of surprise By definition there's no way of knowing what it is. It has the element of surprise, so it's tough to predict or get ready for.\nStill, the sell-off in Chinese shares and the collapse in commodity prices over the past month have already drawn some comparisons to the collapse in commodity prices in 1937.\nThen the Dow fell 41 per cent after interest rates had been hiked.\nNeilson told clients in July that the market turbulence would \"not meaningfully\" damage China's growth prospects. His fund had already done its investing based on the economy growing at closer to 4 per cent and 5 per cent, rather than the 7 per cent that was the last official reading.\nA sharp rise in non-performing bank loans would also not surprise him.\nThe Shanghai Composite is still up about 70 per cent from a year ago and for five or six years it went nowhere.\nBut it is down 31 per cent from its recent peak of 5166, to 3546 now.\nThat sort of savage sell-off has happened before.\nIndeed, some investors might take comfort from the collapse in late 2007, when the index topped 6000 points, only for it to fall to less than 2000 just more than a year later.\nTwice as big Then it didn't seem to harm the economy much and although the growth rates were double digit, compared to 7 per cent now, the economy now is almost twice as big.\nIn addition, it's worth noting that if the 135 per cent gain in the Chinese sharemarket didn't add that much to growth over the past 12 months, why would the sell-off have such a negative impact.\nThe other problem, however, is what will the market look like when this sell-off settles down?\nRather than being a way of allowing state-owned enterprises to raise equity, the Chinese sharemarket has been seen as a one-way bet to make money by retail investors.\nHow can you possibly lose if there's always going to be a buyer to bail you out when things go pear-shaped?\nWell, Chinese investors are finding out what can happen when there is no safety net in place. You lose money. And losing money is something all investors experience at some stage.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-07-28T14:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:48:49.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
