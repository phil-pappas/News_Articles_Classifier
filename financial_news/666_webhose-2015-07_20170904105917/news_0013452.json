Certainly too long for us to wait, so we need to import industry know how to Africa to get us started,\" said Rugwabiza. \nRugwabiza also expressed disappointment at the pace of African efforts to integrate noting that, at the current rate, it would require at least a century to create the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA), which is being mooted to improve intra-Africa trade. \n\"The EAC is a good example that a free trade area is actually possible, but also a lesson about the role of strong political will to making things work. The EAC free trade area can inspire efforts towards a Tripartite for ECOWAS, EAC and COMESA and, finally, the Africa-wide FTA,\" he said. \nAlso on the panel was Hannington Namara, the country director of TradeMark East Africa. \nNamara proposed that with regional integration providing new market linkages and increasing connectivity, the debate should now concentrate on how Africans can produce more to exploit the larger markets. \n\"What we have now is a tendency for people to buy from one place and sell in the other without really producing new commodities or adding value to primary commodities,\" Namara said. \nLeadership deficit \nProf. Humphrey Moshi, from the University of Dar es Salaam, lashed out at the tendency to pass so many proclamations aimed at transforming Africa but without actually following them up with actions. \n\"Africa is suffering from a governance deficit, we need leaders to move us from proclamations to actions,\" he said, adding that praising Africa as doing well is dangerous as it makes its leaders 'too comfortable.' \nMoshi said, over the past years, African leaders have failed to prove their capacity to implement so many proclamations aimed at transforming the continent with the latest being the Agenda 2063, which aims at creating a United States of Africa. \nHowever, Moshi said the agenda, like many other attempts in the past, is likely to fail unless leaders can follow up their visions with actions. \nAlthough in agreement with the professor that Africa needed to back visions with actions, Minister Gatete said East African partners on the Northern Corridor integration projects initiative have showed that where leaders are willing and committed, things actually work. \n\"Many of the things we have achieved on the Northern Corridor required only decisions and political will, not money; action was taken on decisions that were made and things happened; now this trend is spreading to the Central Corridor,\" Gatete said.
