Share on twitter by James Thomson After a good couple of days on the sharemarket you could be forgiven for thinking the recent dramas caused by Greece and China are behind us, and the looming US interest rate rise is nothing but a blip on the horizon.\nBut with profit reporting season just around the corner, three company announcements should cause investors to take at least a short moment of reflection and wonder exactly what the earnings outlook is like.\nThe trifecta of bad news came on Wednesday in a sort of micro confession session.\nPrimary Health Care put its profit warning out after the market had closed , revealing its underlying earnings per share growth has been revised to a 5 per cent fall, from previous guidance of growth of 5 to 12 per cent.\nApparently a mild flu season and extreme weather events conspired to weigh on the number of people visiting the doctor, leading to the late confession.\nPutting our ruddy health to one side, could this also be a little signal that household spending remains pretty weak? Health is hardly a discretionary spending category of course, but people do cut back on doctor's visits during tough times . And certainly bad weather is never helpful for consumer spending â€“ the once-in-a-generation storms in New South Wales will surely show up in the numbers of other companies, such as retailers and food and drink makers.\nIs it a warning light for those companies leveraged to the consumer? Maybe only an amber one, but it is food for thought.\nThe next bit of bad news came from BHP Billiton, which wrote down the value of its US shale gas assets by $2.8 billion , cut capital expenditure in this division and warned it may not be cashflow positive. These moves reflected both the impact of the plunge in oil prices, and the tough conditions in the US gas market, where gas prices remain very low.\n The writedowns were no surprise; indeed, some thought the writedowns could have been bigger.\nBut it serves as a reminder that the dynamics in the oil and gas sector have changed markedly since last earnings season. Have all the skeletons been let out of the sector's closets? Do investors have their heads around the winners and losers in the industry?\nFinally there was Perpetual, which revealed that its funds under management had taken a rather ugly dive in the June quarter, falling to $30.2 billion from $34.7 billion in March.\nOf the fall, $1.7 billion was lost to falling markets, while net outflows for the period were $1.6 billion.\nPerpetual chief Geoff Lloyd denied the dive was due to the imminent departure of head of equities, Matt Williams, and instead blamed the drop on the poor performance of markets during the period.\nFair enough. But that makes this episode a timely reminder of how investors of all stripes need to prepare themselves for life in the low return world, where volatility is the new normal.\nReporting season might well ram that message home.", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703940904575395603432726626", "https://twitter.com/mrjthomson"], "published": "2015-07-17T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T05:04:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
