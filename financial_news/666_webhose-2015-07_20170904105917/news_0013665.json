The charges related to inadequate pest control, unsuitable food handling, poor food storage and inadequate skills, among other issues.\nLouisa Dicker, for Monash Council, told Melbourne Magistrates’ Court on July 10 that council officer Troy Schonknecht first visited the restaurant on March 3 for a routine inspection.\nAccording to documents prepared for the court, Mr Schonknecht saw as many as 50 live cockroaches running through the noodle-making and front cooking area, grease, grime, oil and food waste behind cooking equipment and in the cool room and freezer, grease dripping from the stove canopies, encrusted dirt on the stove top, food waste in the microwave and dirty mops and cleaning equipment.\nMr Schonknecht also noted glue traps with peanuts as rodent bait and cockroach faeces in the cool room.\nHe met with the owner soon after to discuss the state of the restaurant, then returned for several further inspections until early July. Cockroaches, drain flies, dirty benches and cooking equipment were noted at many of the visits.\nMagistrate Duncan Reynolds convicted and fined the company $12,000 and ordered it to pay $7000 in costs. He fined the company director, Siu Hin Yip, $5000 without conviction.\nIn a media release Monash Mayor Paul Klisaris said the severity of the fines sent a message to Monash businesses that they must maintain the highest standards.\n“Monash has a well-deserved reputation as a destination for great food and we expect our businesses to respect that reputation by maintaining high standards when it comes to safety and cleanliness,” Cr Klisaris said.\nHe said the business has reviewed its processes and subsequent inspections have found it was complying with the regulations.\nThe owner Siu Hin Yip did not respond to Leader’s requests for comment.\nOriginally published as Restaurant riddled with cockroaches ", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/east/food-inspectors-find-rat-poo-cockroaches-grease-and-grime-at-glen-waverley-restaurant-raramen/story-fngnvlxu-1227462012828", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/is-this-australias-filthiest-restaurant/story-fnkgdftz-1227463046615?sv=ce4a6c372ee374c17441dd0662d98df6", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/is-this-australias-filthiest-restaurant/story-fnkgdftz-1227463046615?sv=ce4a6c372ee374c17441dd0662d98df6&title=Restaurant+riddled+with+cockroaches", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/is-this-australias-filthiest-restaurant/story-fnkgdftz-1227463046615?sv=ce4a6c372ee374c17441dd0662d98df6&title=Restaurant+riddled+with+cockroaches", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/is-this-australias-filthiest-restaurant/story-fnkgdftz-1227463046615?sv=ce4a6c372ee374c17441dd0662d98df6", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Restaurant+riddled+with+cockroaches&c=AUSTRALIANS+love+this+restaurant%26%238217%3Bs+dumplings.+Or+at+least%2C+they+did.+The+discovery+of+rats%2C+cockroaches+flies+and+faeces+could+change+that.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/is-this-australias-filthiest-restaurant/story-fnkgdftz-1227463046615?sv=ce4a6c372ee374c17441dd0662d98df6", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/is-this-australias-filthiest-restaurant/story-fnkgdftz-1227463046615?sv=ce4a6c372ee374c17441dd0662d98df6&h=Restaurant+riddled+with+cockroaches"], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T14:46:04.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
