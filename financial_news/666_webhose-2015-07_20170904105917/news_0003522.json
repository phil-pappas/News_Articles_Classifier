McLaren calls its new 675LT supercar 'pure driving pleasure' Jul. 21, 2015, 4:53 PM 16 Your browser does not support the video tag. McLaren via YouTube McLaren has introduced the lightest, most powerful supercar they've ever produced — and it's 100% street legal. \nThe only bad news? They're already sold out. All 500. \nThe lucky few to pony up the £259,500 (about $405,000) after the car was introduced at the Geneva Motor Show, can expect delivery of their new 666-horsepower, 3.8-liter, twin-turbocharged V8 toy later this month. \n\"The Longtail is a famous name in the history of McLaren, first used on the fastest version of the iconic McLaren F1,\" said Mike Flewitt, CEO of McLaren Automotive, in a press release. \n\"The McLaren F1 GTR ‘Longtail’ was the final highly successful iteration of the F1, and it is an appropriate name for the most exhilarating and driver-focused version of the Super Series. The 675LT is the purest distillation of what McLaren stands for – pure driving pleasure.\" \nMcLaren \nThe beauty of the 675LT is in its power-to-weight ratio. Thanks to extensive use of carbon-fiber body panels, this supercar clocks in at just 2,712 lbs — helping it go from 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in a whiplash-inducing 2.9 seconds. \n\"Of course we wanted to deliver a stunningly beautiful car,\" said Dan Parry-Williams, Head of Vehicle Design and Engineering for McLaren. \n\"But the beauty is the result of the very demanding technical targets we set. You could call the 675LT technical sculpture.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T00:22:40.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
