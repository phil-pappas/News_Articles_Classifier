Prior to 2014-15, the equity MF sector had seen a continuous closure of folios since March 2009 after the global financial crisis in late 2008. Since March 2009, as many as 1.5 crore folios got closed.\nThe investor base reached its peak of 4.11 crore in March 2009 while it stood at 3.77 crore in March 2008.\nBefore 2014-15, there was a complete lull in equity inflows as well as generation of new folios, but in the past one year, equity markets have come back to life and yielded solid returns.\nIndustry experts said the heightened investor interest has led to a sharp increase in retail folios.\n“It is the optimism of investors because of which the folios in equity segment have increased. Besides, increased participation by retail investors in equities has led to an increase in folio numbers,” an expert said.\nMoreover, mutual funds reported net inflows of nearly Rs 33,000 crore in equity funds in the first quarter, helping the industry grow its folio count.\nBesides, addition in equity folios helped increase overall folio base to 4.27 crore in June from 4.17 crore at the end of March.\nFirst Published on July 12, 2015 11:26 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T23:46:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
