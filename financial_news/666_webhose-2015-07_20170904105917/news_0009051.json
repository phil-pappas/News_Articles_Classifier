It was last down 0.2 percent at 123.56 after plumbing a near two-week low of 123.49.\nAside from the Fed, focus remained on sliding commodity prices an their potential impact on currencies.\nThe more obvious impact from lower commodity prices has been felt by currencies of commodity exporters such as Canada, Australia and Norway. But commodity-importer currencies such as the yen were also expected to feel the effect.\n\"A drop in commodities generates images of a cooling global economy, which in turn leads to 'risk off' that could prompt short-covering of the yen,\" said Masafumi Yamamoto, a senior strategist at Monex in Tokyo.\n\"Moreover, cheaper oil lessens import costs and improves Japan's trade balance. If it ends up boasting a sizeable current account surplus, Japan could face criticism that the yen is too weak,\" he said.\nU.S. crude traded near four-month lows on Monday, dogged by concerns over oversupply and potentially weaker demand from major consumers like China.\nMarc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, reckoned the dollar also looked vulnerable against the yen amid wariness towards verbal warnings against further yen depreciation by Japanese officials.\n\"The pullback in U.S. stocks and the decline in bond yields may encourage short-term traders to push the dollar lower. Still, ahead of the FOMC meeting support in 122.90-123.10 yen may limit the selling,\" he wrote.\nThe market will watch the July 28-29 Fed meeting to see if policymakers provide clues for the timing of a rate \"lift-off.\" Steadily rising expectations the U.S. central bank could begin hiking interest rates as early as September have been a key factor behind the dollar's gains over the past month.\nThe Australian dollar struggled near six-year lows versus the dollar, faced with the prospect of its central bank taking the opposite step and easing further.\nThe Aussie, already feeling the heat from lower commodity prices, declined further late last week on weak factory data from China, Australia's main trading partner.\nThe Aussie stood just above Friday's trough of $0.7260, its lowest since May 2009.\nThe New Zealand dollar fared a little better, climbing 0.3 percent to $0.6599 to extend the distance between the six-year low of $0.6498 struck mid-month. The kiwi was helped last week when the Reserve Bank of New Zealand eased its cash rate by less than some had anticipated.
