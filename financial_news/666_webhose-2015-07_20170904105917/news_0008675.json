The video streaming service spent a reported $100 million to create the first season of the political drama, and it looks as though the investment paid off. The company’s stock nearly tripled to $480 million since “House of Cards” released, reported the Associated Press in February. \nWhen Netflix gambled on “House of Cards,” the network broke several golden television rules — most notably by releasing every episode at once to placate “binge watchers.” The risky gambles, however, paid off in spades for the network and lead actor Kevin Spacey, who’s turning 56 on Sunday, July 26. Kevin Spacey’s Net Worth and Career Success \nKevin Spacey’s net worth is estimated at $80 million, according to CelebrityNetWorth. The commercial and critical success surrounding his role in the Netflix original series “House of Cards” has earned him a spot on the list of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors. His fans, however, know that Spacey earned his credibility — if not his fortune — long before streaming video was ever invented. \nBorn in South Orange, N.J., in 1959, Spacey moved frequently as a child before his family finally settled in Los Angeles, reports the New York Times. He was admitted to Juilliard academy but left after his second year to pursue his career. \nHis 1981 theatrical debut of “Shakespeare in the Park” also featured John Goodman. His film debut came in 1986 with a performance in “Heartburn,” but he continued his work in the theater and nabbed a Tony Award in 1990. Although he had already appeared in several major movies, his breakout role as Verbal Kint in “The Usual Suspects” came in 1995, which earned him an Oscar for best supporting actor. \nOther titles on Kevin Spacey’s filmography include “American Beauty,”“L.A. Confidential,”“Moon,”“Horrible Bosses” and more. \nIn addition to “House of Cards” Spacey plays Richard Nixon in “Elvis and Nixon,” which is currently in post-production and due to be released in 2015, according to IMDB. He is currently filming “Nine Lives,” which is slated for release in 2016 and also stars Jennifer Garner and Christopher Walken. The “House of Cards” actor will be a main voice in the animated film “Boss Baby,” which is due out in 2017, as well. \nRead: The Money Behind the 2015 Emmy Award Nominees Kevin Spacey’s ‘House of Cards’ Salary Could Be More Than $15 Million \nIn “House of Cards,” Kevin Spacey brings the character Frank Underwood to life. Diabolical, corrupt and ruthless, Underwood is driven by a relentless pursuit of power. Spacey’s character is probably one of the greatest TV villains of all time — and it’s making him big bucks. \nKevin Spacey earned $500,000 per episode — including his producer fee — for his performance on Season 2 of “House of Cards,” according to TV Guide’s 2014 salary report. With 13 episodes that season, that’s a salary of $6.5 million. \nBut, that was just Season 2. According to one report, Spacey was given a raise in exchange for agreeing to continue his role and was commanding $9 million for the show’s third season. “House of Cards” Season 4 is expected to air in 2016, but details about Spacey’s salary is being kept under wraps. \nEven if Spacey doesn’t get a salary bump for the fourth season, he is still riding high with his $80 million net worth. And according to Forbes’ list of the Highest-Paid TV Actors of 2014, Spacey tied with “Grey’s Anatomy’s” Patrick Dempsey with total earnings reaching $16 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T08:20:51.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
