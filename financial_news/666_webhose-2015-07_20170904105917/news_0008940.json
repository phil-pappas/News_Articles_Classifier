It dropped back to 11.4 percent in June. [ID: nL8N0ZP1IK]\nInflation has remained a key concern since the government slashed energy subsidies in July of last year, raising energy costs by up to 78 percent.\nThe central bank raised its benchmark rates 100 basis points following July 2014's subsidy cuts. Then it unexpectedly cut them by 50 basis points in January, saying plummeting oil prices had eased inflation risks while economic growth was rebounding. Rates have been left unchanged since then.\nAllen Sandeep, director of research at Naeem brokerage in Cairo, predicted a 25-basis-point cut: \"The outlook on inflation is quite tame so I don't see a reason why they should not cut rates.\"\nEgypt's economy grew 3 percent in the third quarter of the 2014/2015 fiscal year, which ended in March. That was slower than the 5.6 percent recorded in the first half of the fiscal year. Egypt's 2015/2016 budget projects growth of 5 percent.\n(Additional reporting by Ahmed Aboulenein and Shadi Bushra, editing by Larry King; Writing by Eric Knecht; Editing by Yara Bayoumy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T17:33:16.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
