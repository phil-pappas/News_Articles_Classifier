The company is owned by Australian miners Rio Tinto Plc (LSE: RIO.L - news ) and BHP Billiton Ltd . \nMore than 100 Native Americans and supporters marched from the White House to the Capitol, where they drummed, sang and performed prayer ceremonies for nearly three hours. \n\"Today is our day. Today is our ceremony. We're not here looking at this Capitol like it's in charge of us,\" said tribe councilman Wendsler Nosie. \nThe caravan has been gathering support at Native American reservations and held a protest in New York on Friday. \nMine supporters tout its expected benefits, including about 3,700 jobs and $60 billion in economic impacts. Nosie called the job estimates inflated. \nProject spokeswoman Jennifer Russo has said the company is committed to involving tribal members and has reached out to address complaints. \nPresident Barack Obama in December approved the exchange of 2,400 acres (970 hectares) deemed sacred to Native Americans and precious to environmentalists. \nThe mine is slated for construction next to the Apache Leap cliffs, a site where Apaches jumped to their death to avoid capture by U.S. troops in the 1870s. \nTribal protesters set up a camp in the area in February. They have refused to leave until the land deal is repealed. \nThe exchange was part of a defense spending bill and supported by Arizona's congressional delegation. \nApache Stronghold plans a second day of protests at the Capitol on Wednesday. \n(Reporting by Lacey Ann Johnson; Editing by Ian Simpson and Peter Cooney)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T22:42:55.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
