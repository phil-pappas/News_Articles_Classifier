Domestic demand was strong last year with consumer spending increasing 2.0% year-on-year. In the first quarter of this year, GDP rose by 1.4% quarter on quarter, with an increase of 6.5% year on year. These are solid figures and confirm that economic recovery is well established. \n\n\nThe Central Statistics Office (CSO) today (30th of July) released the national accounts for last year and estimates for the first quarter of this year. Commenting on the figures, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan T.D. stated: \n\n“Today’s figures are very positive. GDP grew by 1.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter and 6.5 per cent year-on-year. This follows growth of 5.2 per cent last year, the strongest in the EU. \nRobust growth is being recorded across most sectors of the economy, both domestic-facing and exporting. \nExports were strong in the opening quarter, growing by 14.3 per cent year-on-year. The multinational sector is contributing but so too are Irish-owned firms. The competitiveness improvements we’ve seen in recent years are standing to us. \nDomestic demand is also growing strongly, with consumer spending increasing by 3.8 per cent in the first quarter– the sacrifices made are now paying dividends. \nWe have laid the foundations for a solid recovery. The task now is to build upon the gains we have made in recent years. The Government will continue to work to support sustainable growth in order to improve living standards and reduce unemployment further.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T15:09:44.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
