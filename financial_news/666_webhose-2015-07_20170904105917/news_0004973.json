How the Government's behavioural insights team are devising ways to alter your spending habits \nThe Government’s controversial “nudge unit” has been busy telling us to stop smoking, find a job and pay our taxes on time, unveiling its latest experiments in a report this week. \nThey've given sweets to investment bankers to persuade them to give to charity. They are texting teenagers they think are likely to bunk off school. Tests carried out by the “Behavioural Insights Team” between 2013 and 2015 save the public purse £210 million annually, the team says. \nBut not all of their experiments work, with up to 20pc of trials proving a failure, according to the organisation's chief psyschologist, David Halpern. \nOriginally set up as a money-saving experiment by the Cabinet Office, the nudge unit now infiltrates all aspects of our spending, from tax and energy spending to charity giving. It is part-owned by the Government, alongside its 60 employees and the charity Nesta. \nHere we detail the main ways your personal finances have been \"nudged\". \n= 1) Tax = \nHM Revenue & Customs nudges an extra £210 million a year from taxpayers by using behavioural insights in its letters. \nTweaking letters sent to people who owe the most tax - who owe the top 1pc biggest debts - led to a boost in payments by 17pc last year. \nThey were most likely to pay up if they are told their money funds vital public services. \nTelling people with the top 1pc of tax debts that \"not paying tax means we all lose out on vital public services like the NHS, roads, and schools\" led to a 17pc boost in payments. \nIt was far more effective than the message \"paying tax means we all gain from public services.\" \n\"This may be because the amount of tax they owed could make a substantial difference to those services,\" said Micahel Hallsworth, head of tax at Behavioural Insights Team. \nSimilar trials were held in Guatemala last year, a country with one of the lowest tax compliance rates in the world. The unit found that letters framing avoidance as an \"intentional and deliberate choice\" increased compliance by $17.95 per person. \nBy linking tax with \"national pride\" in its letters to locals, compliance increased by $9.49 and emphasising that paying tax is a social norm raised payment by $13.97 per person. \n= 2) Giving to charity = \nA small bag of sweets encourages us to give to charity, the researchers found in another study. \nUsing investment bankers as guinea pigs, the Behavioural Insights Team wanted to pinpoint the best method of persuading them to give a day's pay to charity. \n• How charity cold-callers use 'suckers lists' to target likely donors \nA personal email from their boss boosted giving by 12pc. A visit from a celebrity by 7pc. But when combined with a small packet of sweets, the guilt-tripping email from the chief executive increased bankers' generosity by 17pc. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) , the Behavioural Insights Team is investigating how Britain's 150,000 charities can effectively extract wealth from some of the top earners in the country. \n= 3) Switching energy = \nEnergy prices have tumbled this year - yet households pay up to £50 per year extra because they don't shop around for energy, according to the latest estimates . \nBut printing a sentence on the fold of an envelope can boost energy switching by a fifth. \nThe letters displayed a message saying \"Many people save up to £200 on their energy bills by switching tariff.\" It was added to 8 million householders who would be receiving letters anyway. \nThe prompt increased visits to the energy comparison website, goenergyshopping.co.uk, by 1.6 million, researchers said. \nThe team developed energy-switching \"codes\" which customers scan using their smartphone \nBut the team have a bigger challenge in encouraging the rest of the country to switch. \nMost recently, they have been behind new \"Quick Response codes\" that energy firms are forced to print on customer's bills. This is a scannable barcode that contains all your energy information. \nThe idea is that customers can leave their supplier more easily, as they no longer need to manually input data from their last bill when they buy a new energy tariff. \nBut switching has actually declined since being introduced in March 2014, dropping from 745,000 switches between January and March 2014 to 687,000 in the March to May period. \n= 4) Your pension = \nGroundbreaking reforms to the way we access our pensions have given retirees unfettered access to their pension savings. Under rules introduced in April, over-55s can withdraw their pension pot with 25pc free from tax. \nBut the power for pensioners to \"buy a Lamborghini if they wish\" - in the infamous words of one former minister - has led to fears that many will waste money they may rely on later. \nThis is where nudge comes in. \nNew (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) \"pension passports\" will prompt people to consider if they have enough money to last into old age \nAhead of the new reforms, the Behavioural Insights Unit was tasked with encouraging people to think about when they might die - an unwelcome thought for many, but essential for retirement planning. \n\"Most people struggle to engage with the complexity of pensions,\" researchers said. \n• Theo Paphitis: 'My family's only asset was a UK passport' \nThey helped devise a \"Pension Passport\" to replace the often-baffling paperwork people are sent when they retire, known as a \"wake-up pack\". \nThe jargon-free passport is currently being trialled and will be given to you before you retire, showing how much pension you will get. This can be shown to a financial adviser. \nThe Unit has also been targeting employers to remind them of their new duty to automatically enrol workers in a company scheme. \n- kate.palmer@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T18:43:48.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
