And so this mix of traditional products combined with these innovative ways of both producing energy and distributing it is why we think this is going to be such a promising initiative over the next several years. \nThere was an article, I think a while back, about well, how much electricity has Power Africa actually produced lately? And I would just point out that if you wanted to start a power plant in the United States, it doesn't take a year to get that done. In fact, what's happening is, is that financing, the transactions have been completed, plans are underway, and the work is being done -- now we're going to start seeing thousands, then ten of thousands, then hundreds of thousands, and then ultimately millions of households all across this continent with electrical power that can boost productivity and economic growth all across the continent. \nSo it's really promising. We're really excited about it. \nEND 11:39 A.M. EAT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T18:08:29.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
