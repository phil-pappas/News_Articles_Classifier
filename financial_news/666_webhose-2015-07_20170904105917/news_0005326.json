AP AMP is under pressure from UK activist hedge fund Metage Capital Management to take action to narrow what the investment firm described as an \"unacceptable discount\".\nMetage made its gripes clear in May after more than a year and a half of unsuccessfully attempting to engage with AMP, according to Miles Staude, investment manager and head of Metage.\nMetage called for the fund to undertake capital management including share buybacks or tender offers to shrink the size of the fund.\nUntil now AMP has remained silent on how it planned to narrow the share price/NAV gap. AMP said it would report the results of the investment bank's advice before the end of the year.\n AMP Capital's China Growth Fund was trading at the fourth-largest discount to NAV of all of the listed investment companies on the ASX at the end of June, according to monthly ASX disclosures. Orion Equities, Lion Selection Group and Bentley Capital were the only funds trading at a steeper discount, according to the ASX.\nLICs tend to trade at a discount if the market is unhappy with the performance or structure of a fund or has lost faith in the manager's ability to manage the fund. It is also possible that uncertainty over some emerging markets could result in a natural discount emerging in such funds.\nBumpy ride in China It's been a bumpy ride for investors in China in recent weeks since around half of the value of the Shanghai Composite Index was wiped out when the mainland China stock market plummeted.\nWhen the Shanghai Composite Index bounced after plummeting for three days straight last Thursday, AMP announced that 19 of the 80 stocks in its portfolio were subject to trading halts or suspensions.\nThe AMP Capital fund is the only listed investment company that invests directly in China A shares â€“ it aims to outperform the S&P/CITIC300 Total Return Index after fees. The fund charges a 1.65 per cent management expense ratio and 20 per cent on returns above the benchmark.\nWhile hedge funds like Metage will aim to push AMP to narrow the gap between its share price and NAV, other long term investors will see the discount as a opportunity to won China shares at a discount.\n\"AGF gives me great direct exposure to China A shares at a significant discount to NAV,\" said Simon Bridger, a portfolio manager with Hunter Hall.\nMr Bridger said he has a positive view on the China sharemarket over the long term despite the recent decline and ongoing volatility; he said Hunter Hall owns around 5 per cent of AMP China Growth fund's issued capital.\nMr Bridger isn't the only investor buying into the AMP fund. At the end of June Lim Advisors, the Hong Kong hedge fund founded by recognised value investor, George Long, increased its shareholding in the AMP Fund to 12.6 per cent.\nDespite the long standing 25 per cent-plus discount the fund's shares have traded at, AMP's China Growth Fund has still managed a 137.7 per cent after fees and taxes for the year to the end of June thanks to the outsized returns of the China A Shares market which skyrocketed in November last year.\nRead next: Investors back China rebound with ASX-listed ETFs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T15:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:04:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
