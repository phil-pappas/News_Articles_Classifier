The Nikkei 225 Stock Average slipped 0.8 percent to 20,674.45. The yen traded at 123.88 per dollar after strengthening 0.3 percent Tuesday. Apple shares slumped 6.7 percent in extended U.S. trading after its revenue forecast missed estimates.\nThe yen rose against the greenback as traders pared “some short-term overbuying” of the U.S. currency, said Hiroichi Nishi, a manager at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in Tokyo. “My view that the U.S. economy is gently recovering hasn’t changed, but earnings from companies such as Apple weren’t good, and it’s easier to take profit in exporters such as electronic-parts companies.”\nApple forecast revenue of $49 billion to $51 billion in the quarter through September, below analyst estimates for $51.1 billion. The company said it sold 47.5 million iPhones in the period through June, while analyst had anticipated 48.8 million shipments.\nAny indication of slowing demand for iPhones could spark concern that Apple is going to have a hard time selling more smartphones in the final months of the year, after the September debut of the latest version fueled record profits. That concern could ripple through Japanese suppliers, from Sharp Corp. to Japan Display Inc. and Minebea Co.\nFutures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.4 percent after the underlying measure slipped 0.4 percent Tuesday. Contracts on the Nasdaq 100 Index, which counts Apple as its heaviest-weighted member, lost 1.1 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:20:38.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
