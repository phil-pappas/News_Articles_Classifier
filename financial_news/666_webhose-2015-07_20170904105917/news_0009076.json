Always'.\" \nThe comments come after Fairfax's barrister Sandy Dawson told the Federal Court earlier this month the case \"was an unmitigated disaster for Mr Hockey and a costs order should reflect that\". \nRather than them footing any of the bill, he argued the treasurer should be forced to cover 60 per cent of the publisher's legal costs. \nJustice White, however found that any costs order should reflect the reality that Mr Hockey did succeed on some matters but failed on others. \nMr Hockey was not victorious in his claim against The Canberra Times nor was he successful in the matters which were at the \"real core\" of his claim against The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald, Justice White said. \nHad he just sued the publisher over the poster and the two tweets for which he was ordered damages, rather than the articles as well, the matter may not have gone to trial at all, Justice White said. \nHe also dismissed the politician's claims that Fairfax had been unreasonable in not settling the matter before it went to trial. \nMr Hockey was awarded damages of $120,000 for the poster and $80,000 for two similarly worded tweets published in May last year. \nBut his claim over the content of the articles was dismissed. \nThe articles said Mr Hockey gave access to a select group in return for donations to the Liberal Party via the North Sydney Forum, a fundraising organisation whose activities were not fully disclosed to election funding authorities. \nFairfax supported the judgment. \n\"The costs judgment is a fair reflection of the outcome of the proceedings where Mr Hockey failed on all of the matters which were the real core of his claim,\" a Fairfax Media spokesperson said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Defamation case dents Hockey's coffers AAP \nTreasurer Joe Hockey is expected to face his own legal budget blow-out of hundreds of thousands of dollars after â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T13:45:04.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
