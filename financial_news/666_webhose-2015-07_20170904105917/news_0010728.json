(Nasdaq: APOL), the Phoenix-based company is being investigated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Yesterday, the FTC issued Apollo a “Civil Investigative Demand” regarding potential deceptive advertising, sale or marketing of its services to students, according to an 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The demand requires that the Phoenix-based education company produce documents and information of UOP's business practices from Jan. 1, 2011, to the present. That information relates to marketing, recruiting, enrollment, financial aid, tuition and fees, academic programs, academic advising, student retention, billing and debt collection, complaints, accreditation, training, military recruitment and other compliance matters, according to the SEC document dated July 29. This FTC investigation comes after the Higher Learning Commission removed the “Notice” status from UOP and its sister Western International University. This time two years ago, the HLC reaffirmed the accreditation of UOP through the 2022-23 academic year, but at the time placed it on a two-year Notice status because of concerns regarding governance, student assessment and faculty scholarship research for doctoral progress. The company has been struggling to improve its image and recruitment tactics, going so far as laying off 1,500 people – most of them enrollment counselors – so far this year. This is all part of Apollo CEO Greg Cappelli 's plans to improve Apollo's declining enrollment, revenue and net income . The Phoenix-based company generated $48 million in net income on $681.5 million in net revenue for the three months ended May 31, according to the company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That's down from $66 million in net income on net revenue of $793.6 million during the same period last year. It's a similar story for the nine months ended May 31, where Apollo generated $48 million in net income on $1.98 billion in net revenue, down from $179.5 million in net income on $2.3 billion in net revenue during the first nine months of 2014. Enrollment dipped 14.3 percent to 206,900 as of May 31, down from 241,900 during the same period in 2014. After this morning's FTC announcement, Apollo's stock dropped to around $13.26, closer to its 52-week low of $12.12 than its high of $34.55. Yesterday, its stock closed at $13.38. \nWant Phoenix Education news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
