Ben Rushton by Ewin Hannan Lucille Keen The militant construction union has spent \"north of $2 million\" defending its conduct before the union royal commission and has returned Brian Parker to lead its NSW branch , despite findings against him.\nMr Parker, who was subject to adverse findings in the commission's interim report, stood down from his position in June .\nIt had been anticipated that Mr Parker would stand aside for the rest of the year while the commission continued its investigation into the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union.\nFollowing inquiries by The Australian Financial Review , the union released a statement on Sunday confirming Mr Parker had \"resumed his duties\" as state secretary.\nThe CFMEU has spent \"north of $2 million\" on legal fees for the royal commission. Luis Ascui But Dave Noonan, the national secretary of the union's construction division, refused to explain why Mr Parker was returning to his position.\nThe commission's interim report recommended Mr Parker be referred to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration of possible charges. It said the union should also investigate if he had engaged in gross misbehaviour and be removed from office.\nEmployment Minister Eric Abetz said on Sunday the commission's findings showed Mr Parker was not fit to lead the union.\n\"His return to the role represents a serious failure of leadership by the national bosses of the union, Dave Noonan and Michael O'Connor,\" he said.\n \"CFMEU members are being sadly let down by the union's current leadership, which has done nothing to address the serious problems of corruption and thuggery within their union.\"\nReappearing before the commission last month, Mr Parker replied ''I don't recall'' about 80 times as he was cross-examined about the leaking to the union of Cbus members' information in 2013. He denied his constant memory lapses were designed to avoid perjury charges.\nMr Parker was presented with evidence from sacked Cbus staffers Lisa Zanatta and Maria Butera that contradicted his claims that he sought only basic information from Cbus chief executive David Atkin about the fund members employed at construction company Lis-Con.\nThe commission found that Mr Parker requested Ms Butera and Ms Zanatta to \"act improperly\" by handing over the personal details of Lis-Con employees, so that the union could contact the workers and encourage them to harass the company over unpaid entitlements.\nThe interim report concluded that Ms Zanatta, Ms Butera and Mr Parker each gave false evidence to the commission.\nCFMEU spends $2m on defence The Financial Review has established that the union has spent more than $2 million in members' funds to defend its conduct before the commission.\nFinancial accounts filed by the CFMEU show it spent more than $1.7 million on legal advice for the commission in the 12 months to December last year.\nMr Noonan said the amount spent would have been \"north of $2 million\".\nUnion leaders have accused the Abbott government of setting up the commission to damage unions and to drain their resources.\n\"It's members' money, it's expensive and it's meant to be,\" Mr Noonan said on Sunday.\nMr Noonan refused to disclose how much the union had spent additionally this year on legal advice needed for ongoing hearings of the commission.\nThe commission, which is due to report by the end of the year, is expected to cost taxpayers up to $80 million, with the biggest blowout coming from law firm Minter Ellison.\nThe government originally awarded the $2 million contract to the firm, but the cost increased to $8 million and is now estimated to have hit $17 million. Counsel assisting the commission, Jeremy Stoljarâ€‹, is receiving $3.36 million for his work.\nBut the government has refused to disclose how much royal commissioner Dyson Heydon is being paid for heading the inquiry.\nDespite repeated requests to the federal government to detail Mr Heydon's remuneration, a spokesman for the Attorney General George Brandis said on Friday that \"the government follows a practice of not disclosing actual rates of pay for Royal Commissioners\".\nHowever, the annual $660,000 salary of Terence Cole, who headed the Howard government's royal commission into the building industry, was disclosed by the Coalition in 2002.\nOpposition workplace relations spokesman Brendan O'Connor said on Sunday: \"If it was good enough for the Howard government to release Mr Cole's salary, I can't see any reason why the Abbott government can't follow suit. What has the government got to hide?''", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T04:44:10.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
