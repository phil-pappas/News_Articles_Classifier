Picture: Jonathan Ng Source: News Corp Australia\nOne Big Switch spokesman Joel Gibson said savvy customers are not only signing up to the deal to receive the savings, but they are also using it to bargain for better prices from their current utility provider.\n“We’re just one day into a four-week offer period but already the data suggests that over 1000 people have saved — either by switching or by using the offer to shop around and negotiate,’’ he said.\n“It’s a really aggressive offer from one of the biggest energy retailers in the market and people are responding, finally they are getting some relief.”\nDiscounts of up to 22 per cent off Energy Australia’s market electricity costs and 16 per cent off their gas usage costs could see NSW households end up with hundreds of dollars extra in their pockets a year.\nThe offer is available to both existing Energy Australia customers and new customers.\nCastle Hill couple Scott and Jacqui Willis said they had been receiving exorbitant power bills which prompted them to join the campaign to try and save money.\n“I signed up because our power bills had literally doubled,’’ Mr Willis said.\n“I’m sick of the high prices.”\nOne Big Switch, News Corp and Seven West Media will earn a commission from any accepted offers.\nTo join the campaign visit: onebigswitch.com .\n ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/thousands-of-nsw-residents-slash-their-power-bills/story-e6frfmcr-1227460571609?sv=4565b964ba3294643cbf7fdb8bb7bc3b&title=Thousands+slash+their+power+bills", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/thousands-of-nsw-residents-slash-their-power-bills/story-e6frfmcr-1227460571609?sv=4565b964ba3294643cbf7fdb8bb7bc3b&h=Thousands+slash+their+power+bills", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/thousands-of-nsw-residents-slash-their-power-bills/story-e6frfmcr-1227460571609?sv=4565b964ba3294643cbf7fdb8bb7bc3b&title=Thousands+slash+their+power+bills", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/thousands-of-nsw-residents-slash-their-power-bills/story-e6frfmcr-1227460571609?sv=4565b964ba3294643cbf7fdb8bb7bc3b", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/thousands-of-nsw-residents-slash-their-power-bills/story-e6frfmcr-1227460571609?sv=4565b964ba3294643cbf7fdb8bb7bc3b", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Thousands+slash+their+power+bills&c=THOUSANDS+of+disgruntled+NSW+energy+customers+fed+up+with+soaring+power+prices+have+taken+action+this+week+to+get+themselves+a+better+deal.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/thousands-of-nsw-residents-slash-their-power-bills/story-e6frfmcr-1227460571609?sv=4565b964ba3294643cbf7fdb8bb7bc3b"], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:52:39.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
