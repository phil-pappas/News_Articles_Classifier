The Star will then battle Crown's Sydney, Melbourne and Perth casinos for market share for several years before adding Queen's Wharf to the mix once it opens in 2022.\nWhile The Star has enjoyed strong VIP growth in the last year due to the slump in gaming hub Macau, Mr Bekier admitted Echo's existing casino in Brisbane has none of the VIP market due to its limited offering in the historic Treasury building.\n\"The challenge with Treasury is there is nothing you can do within the footprint of the current heritage site,\" Mr Bekier told Fairfax Media. \"That's why this project was important for us. We believed we could very much transform the earnings potential of this location if we could move to a new site.\"\n The Echo boss said it had tested the appeal of its Queen's Wharf offer with its junket operators, who guarantee a set level of revenue from Asia's wealth gamblers. Chow Tai Fook will also be in line to gain incentives if it successfully brings VIP clients over from Macau.\n\"Chow Tai Fook have a special commission structure to bring in additional volume to Australia which we don't currently see,\" said Mr Bekier.\nAustralia accounts for just 3 per cent of global VIP gambling. Macau dominates the market with a 75 per cent share with Las Vegas at around five per cent.\nWhile Australia's modest base suggests it can grow its VIP stake, it faces a fight from other jurisdictions such as Philippines and Singapore which have lower tax rates and can offer lucrative deals to junket operators.\nPoker machines will be another major battleground for both Echo and Crown. Echo revealed on Tuesday it may add to its 1600 existing gaming machines at Queen's Wharf but had yet to decide on the final gaming mix.\nThe Echo Entertainment-led consortium said on Tuesday it will build 2000 apartments and 1100 new hotel rooms as part of its winning bid, with Echo confident it can fund its half share of the $2 billion-plus price tag through debt facilities and cash flow from its existing business.\nThe rival Crown/Greenland consortium was thought to have more apartments, potentially counting against the bid, although the details of the residential component of its offer were never disclosed.\nMr Bekier admitted the three residential towers – which will tower over the entire Queen's Wharf project – would effectively bankroll the rest of the project.\n\"On the riverfront there is 12 football fields of public space available. That has to be funded. And one way of funding that is through the construction of apartments,\" he said.\nEcho confirmed it will pay 50 per cent of the capital to the development of the resort and act as operator under a long-dated casino management agreement.\nQueensland Minister for State Development Anthony Lynham said they would not be releasing any details of Echo's successful bid – or whether they will receive a one-off upfront payment – until contractual close later this year. Financial close will be complete in about six weeks.\nDeutsche Bank said it expects returns from the project will cover Echo's cost of capital.\n\"We believe this decision [on Queen's Wharf] will protect the company's existing Brisbane earnings base (19 per cent of group earnings) and allow the company to significantly enhance its earnings growth post completion,\" Deutsche analyst Mark Wilson said.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/echo-consortium-to-build-2000-apartments-for-2b-queens-wharf-complex-20150721-giguyx.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/chinas-greenland-group-committed-to-queensland-despite-casino-knockback-20150721-gigtrr.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/brisbane-casino-destination-brisbanes-game-changer-welcomed-20150721-gih7sq.html"], "published": "2015-07-21T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:05:24.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
