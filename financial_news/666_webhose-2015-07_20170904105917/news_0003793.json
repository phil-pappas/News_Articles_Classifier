The main indexes gave up modest opening gains and pushed lower as investors assessed a barrage of earnings reports. \nAhead of the opening bell, a jobless report offered support to the belief that the U.S. economy is on a solid footing. Weekly applications for unemployment benefits plunged to the lowest level since 1973, however economists warned that data in July tend to be volatile. Improving labor market conditions would allow the Federal Reserve to begin raising interest rates this year. \n“The importance of today’s jobless claims is that the government uses this weekly number when calculating their monthly nonfarm payrolls. We expect it to be in the region of 252,000,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. \nHowever, signs of economic strength also have investors considering the timing of the Federal Reserve’s next rate hike. \n“The wider implication is that continued job growth will allow the Fed to start raising interest rates in September. We expect the Fed to implement four quarter-point hikes to get the interest rate to 1%, after which they will probably stop and see how the economy is doing,” Orlando said. \nThe S&P 500 SPX, -0.60% slipped 10 points, or 0.5%, to 2,104.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.68% dropped 100 points, or 0.6%, to 17,751.13. \nMeanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.51% fell 14 points, or 0.3%, to 5,157.74, adding to the losses from previous session. \nThe tech-heavy index slumped on Wednesday as Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.17% its heaviest-weighted stock, slid 4.2% after a disappointing outlook. On Thursday, Apple shares rebounded, rising 1%. \nGeneral Motors Co. GM, +4.41% shares jumped 5% after the car maker posted sharply higher profit that topped expectations. \nUnder Armour Inc. UA, +7.37% shares jumped 8% after the retailer raised its full-year revenue outlook. \nShares of Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, -4.29% fell 4% after the chip maker late Wednesday said it is planning to reduce spending by $1.4 billion and cut 15% of its workforce. \nAmerican Express Co. AXP, -2.77% dropped 3.2% after the credit-card company late Wednesday said its second-quarter earnings fell to $1.47 billion. \nAfter the market closes, online retailer Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.77% is expected to post a loss of 15 cents a share, narrowing from a loss of 27 cents a share in the same period a year ago. \nAnthem Inc. ANTM, -0.12% shares inched 0.4% higher after The Wall Street Journal reported that the health-care company is nearing a deal to buy Cigna Corp. CI, +1.48% for more than $48 billion.
