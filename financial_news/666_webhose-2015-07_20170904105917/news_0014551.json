The sector role in terms of boosting the country's foreign exchange earnings is also high on GTP II. According to the draft of the plan which is floated for the public for discussion, the sector is expected to raise USD four billion in export earning annually at the end of the GTP II, which is expected to boost its share from the overall export basket to 25 percent in 2020 and later to 40 percent in 2025. In the GTP II, the export itself is expected to grow by an unprecedented 29 percent, in which output of light manufacturing firms like Leather and Shoes, Textile and Agro-processing would be playing the greater role. \nAccording to Abay Tsehaye, policy advisor to the Prime Minster with a ministerial portfolio, the second generation of the GTP is all about three pillars: fast, equitable and green economic growth. While discussing with the private sector at Addis Ababa Hilton on Thursday, Abay said that the economic growth cannot be fast without equity; and that it cannot be both fast and equitable without being sustainable which is green growth. According to the GTP, the economy would have to grow on average at 11 percent for the coming five years. But, manufacturing is of a special focus for the policymakers. One indication is the sector having its own vision during the GTP II which is attaining and operating on the sectors production frontier or production possibility frontier. This is a level of production at the utmost efficiency and productivity exhausting all its existing resources and technology. Theoretically, this level of production is what individual firms or economies attain when they could no more improve production without raising the cost of production. Industry, which includes construction and mining sectors besides manufacturing, is also expected to grow at 18 percent over the course of the GTP laying the foundation for structural transformation. Abay told members of the private sector that structural transformation through the manufacturing is unthinkable without developing an 'engineering and fabrication' capacity of the nation. \"Engineering is the capacity to design and fabricate machineries; and that manufacturing could not be sustained,\" he said. \nNevertheless, GTP II also recognized the sharp infrastructural deficit to support the anticipated manufacturing growth in the nation. For that, the plan focused on the development of electricity, road, road and telecom and information technology infrastructures. In that regard, the plan seeks to double the overall road and rail network in country. The overall road network is set to grow from 120,000kms to 220,000kms, while shortening the average time required to access an all-weather road would go down from 1.5 hours to 0.8 hours at the end the GTP II. \nRail is also something that GTP looks to be planning to expand massively. For instance, the plan says that all rail constructions which are already underway in the three corridors would be concluded in the plan period. Furthermore, an additional 2,782kms of countrywide rail network that includes 6 new rail lines connecting five corridors will also be started in the GTP period. Power is also another area where GTP II plans to do it big. In the GTP period, the overall power generating capacity of the nation is expected to grow to 17,347MW, including the target set in GTP I which the performance missed by miles. \nThe plan also details that the total length of electricity transmission lines would grow to 21,720kms at end of plan period from 12,825kms it is at the moment. Furthermore, the IT and telecom is also area the government is planning big. In this regard, cell phone penetration is expected to grow from its current level of 40 million to 103 million, while increasing the overall internet penetration rate to from 3.3 percent at the start of plan period to 10 percent. In terms of broadband network subscription, the current 1.6 million is expected to leap to 3.19 million, while subscription for narrow band internet is anticipated to double from eight to 16 million. \nApart from manufacturing, agriculture especially crop production is expected to rise considerably during the plan period with crop production rising from 207 million metric tons at start of the GTP period to 406 million metric tons. In the period, agriculture is expected to enjoy a modest growth of 8 percent still playing its role in the employment and production. \nThe plan would also seek to reduce the level of absolute poverty in the nation to 16 percent in the plan period bringing it down from 25 percent at the start of the GTP II. If all goes according to plan, GTP II seeks to kick start a structural transformation on basis of manufacturing. It, of course, goes as far as planning to raise life expectancy of Ethiopians from 64.6 years to 69.
