But climate change is likely to stop that trend because adapting to rising heat will require water that may not be available, he said.\n“When you put warming and adaptation (in the mix), water use accelerates and it accelerates rapidly,” he warned. Insufficient water means maize yields may decrease by nearly 14 percent in the United States by 2040, he noted.\nThe steepest losses would come in the warmer southern states, while Canada and some northern states would see increases in their harvests, he said.\nBut efforts to make irrigation more efficient in the United States and elsewhere – such as better rainwater harvesting, slowing water evaporation and adopting techniques like drip irrigation – could help, said Jonas Jagermeyr, a water expert at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.\nAround the world, agriculture accounts for about 70 percent of freshwater used by humans each year.\nMore efficient use could potentially push crop yields up by as much as 20 percent despite changing conditions, helping meet food demand from a rising world population without cutting down more forests for farmland, Jagermeyr said.\nGreater efficiency could also free up water to irrigate more rain-fed farmland in drought-prone places, including parts of China and southern Africa, he said.\nWhile adapting to some climate shifts is possible, policy makers should not rely too heavily on some key tools like drought-resilient seeds, new planting dates and more irrigation, warned David Lobell of Stanford University’s Center on Food Security and the Environment.\nMany innovations intended to deal with future climate change are already being deployed, limiting their impact in protecting harvests as conditions grow more extreme, he said.\n 11, 2015 12:05 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T08:30:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
