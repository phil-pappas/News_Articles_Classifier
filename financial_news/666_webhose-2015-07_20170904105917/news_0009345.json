An important aspect of EMV is its use of dynamic data. Each transaction carries unique stamp which prevents the transaction data from being fraudulently reused, even if the data or the card is stolen. Therefore this saves bank and consumers from losing money through fraud. \n\"Other security features found in the EMV chip card include the Card Verification Value (CVV) which is a set of three numbers printed on the back of the card either alone or as the final three numbers in a long string of digits. The CVV is never stored in the chip or magnetic stripe and assists in authenticating card-not-present payments, such as those performed online. Entering the CVV number manually proves that you are physically in possession of the card inhibiting fraudsters who have obtained your account information. \n\"Also, the signature panel at the back of the visa card has a tamper-proof design. This means that if someone tries to erase the existing signature, the word 'VOID' will appear. The visa dove holograms found at the back of the card also protect consumers from fraud. Many counterfeit cards contain a one-dimensional image printed on a foil sticker. Visa is also performing real time fraud monitoring. This means that every time a consumer uses his or her card, the transaction is checked for unusual activity on the visanet system.\" \nShe further explained that the company would also have an interactive session with the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) to help officers of the Force in investigating cases of ATM card fraud in the country.
