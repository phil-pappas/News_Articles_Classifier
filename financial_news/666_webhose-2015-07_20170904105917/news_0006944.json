This has resulted in profit margins falling. \nHowever, the outlook is now improving, with the order book jumping to £3.5bn at the end of June, from £1.4bn at the same stage last year. \nClyde Lewis, from broker Peel Hunt, said there are signs profit margins are creeping up, and the order book secures about 90pc of the forecast revenue for the current year. \n= House building still strong = \nThe UK housing sector remains strong. The number of home sales increased to 3,180 in the year to the end of June, up from 3,110 in the previous 12 months. The average selling price increased by 7pc to £327,000. \nGailliford’s future is looking relatively bright, with forward sales of homes at £343m, only down slightly from £348m last year. The land bank available to develop property also increased by 13pc during the year. \nThe company’s results are now expected to be at the top end of expectations. \nMr Lewis upgraded his full-year pre-tax profit forecast by £3m, to £121m, giving 23.7p in earnings per share, from revenue of £2.26bn. \n= Shares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) deliver = \nGalliford’s shares are currently trading on 15 times forecast earnings, falling to 13 times next year. That isn’t cheap for a cyclical house-builder. \nWe previously recommended that investors have faith in the economic recovery (Buy, £11.91, January 9, 2014) . That faith has been rewarded with gains of £5.38, or 45pc, per share in less than 18 months. Those gains are good enough for us and we’d take some profits.
