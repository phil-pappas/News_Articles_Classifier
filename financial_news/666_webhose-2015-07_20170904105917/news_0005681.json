We are building Chevy and building Cadillac, so even with market dynamics changing, we are still well positioned and we are going to continue to focus on it because it's an important market,\" Barra told FOX Business. \nEarlier this year, Barra forecasted General Motors' market share will grow 6% to 7% each year, through the end of 2019. \nHowever, Chinese Internet giant Tencent is more comprehensively exposed to the market gyrations in mainland China, causing the company's president, Martin Lau, to be more cautious. \n\"It does concern me a little bit, in terms of how the stock market rout can affect the real economy,\" Lau told FOX Business. \"I think the government is taking all the steps it can.\" \nIAC/InterActive ( IACI ) chairman Barry Diller shrugged off the Shanghai Composite's plunge. \n\"Markets go up and down. Chinese have a lot of production they make so I'm not worried,\" Diller said. \nPriceline.com ( PCLN ) CEO Darren Huston pondered whether the flow of outbound travelers from China -- a major source of revenue -- would be affected, but told FOX Business he is not concerned about a lasting negative impact on the global travel industry. \nMeanwhile, 21st Century Fox ( FOXA ) executive chairman Rupert Murdoch said he is not familiar with the Chinese stock market. \n21st Century Fox is the parent company of the FOX Business Network. \nAs business leaders minimized the impact of the Chinese market along with the ongoing drama in Greece, they participated in a packed day of panel discussions, including a morning presentation by billionaire Elon Musk on driverless cars and space travel. \nAfterward, Musk told FOX Business he is \"feeling very positive about the future\" of SpaceX, following the explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket bound for the International Space Station last week. He did not elaborate on the cause. \nWednesday's events in Sun Valley concluded with evening remarks by Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter about improving ties between the military and private sector. \nJo Ling Kent joined FOX Business Network (FBN) as a reporter in May 2013.
