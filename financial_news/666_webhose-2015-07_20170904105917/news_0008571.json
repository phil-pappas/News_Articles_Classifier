If demand for the stock is high, RBS will put an extra 11.25m shares up for sale, worth £292.5m at the current market price. \nRBS also expects Citizens to announce a $250m share buyback targetted at the stake owned by RBS. \nMorgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) have been hired to lead the sale, while JP Morgan (Other OTC: MGHL - news ) and Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) will find investors to buy the shares. \nCitizens Financial (Other OTC: CIWV - news ) 's shares floated on the market at $21.50 last September, before rising to roughly $25 in March and $26 today, meaning RBS has received a higher price for the stock each time it has sold a stake in the American bank. \nAssuming the sale succeeds it will also free up more capital for RBS to allocate to its UK operations. \nAfter this selloff, RBS will no longer consolidate Citizens into the group financial results, as the stake is shrinking so rapidly. \nRBS is due to report its second quarter results on Thursday, July 30. \nAnalyst Ian Gordon at Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) predicts the bank will report a loss of just £0.1bn as costs continue to decrease, bringing RBS within touching distance of turning a profit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T17:21:18.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
