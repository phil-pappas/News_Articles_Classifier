The funds cannot be accessed for the duration of the term. \nThe one-year bond pays 2.06pc (up from 2pc), the two-year bond pays 2.25pc (up from 2.16pc), the three-year bond pays 2.65pc (up from 2.25pc), the four-year bond pays 2.75pc (up from 2.35pc) and the five-year bond pays 3.05pc (up from 2.5pc). \n• Full details: Charter Savings Bank fixed-rate bonds VERDICT \nCharter Savings Bank has been one of the most proactive of the \"challenger\" banks since its launch earlier this year. \nEach of the five new rates on offer are market leading, apart from the two-year bond, which sits just behind Punjab National Bank (paying 2.3pc) and Vanquis Bank (paying 2.26pc). \nThe one-year bond, paying 2.06pc, edges just above United Trust Bank's recently launched account paying 2.05pc, the first one-year fix to breach the 2pc level in almost a year. \nPutting £15,000 into Charter's one-year bond would accrue interest of £309 , before tax. The two-year bond would earn £338 , the three-year bond would earn £398 , the four-year bond would accrue interest of £413 and the five-year bond would earn interest of £458 . All amounts are before tax. \nAll-in-all, the improvements made by Charter Savings Bank is great news for savers, as competition in the market steadily pushes rates up. \nThe fixed-rate bond sector has seen more competition in recent weeks than other areas of the savings market, with several rate improvements and best buy accounts launched last month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T12:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T12:51:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
