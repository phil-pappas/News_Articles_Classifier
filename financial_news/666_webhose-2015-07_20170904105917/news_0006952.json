Each of the members received a call from a local Clearview branch employee asking them to stop by the branch. When they arrived, they were simply thanked for being a member and given an iPad®, a surprise they never saw coming.\nIt’s all part of an initiative aimed at investing $1,000,000 in Clearview members and the Clearview community. Since January, Clearview has given over 15,000 members gifts and cash, and the celebration continues with a Pittsburgh Pirates ticket giveaway.\nIn April 2015, Clearview held a raffle for Pirates tickets in its branches and has since chosen 40 random members and their guests to attend a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game on July 10th. Clearview management and staff will also be in attendance at the game, to celebrate alongside members and their guests in the Budweiser Bowtie Bar. The group will have access to this prime location in the right field corner of PNC Park during the game, where they can enjoy food, beverages and great views of the ballpark, Allegheny River and downtown Pittsburgh cityscape.\n“We recognize that our members have a choice when it comes to selecting their financial institution, and we appreciate that they have chosen Clearview. This is one small way we can show them our appreciation and thank them for their membership and loyalty,” said Mark Brennan, Clearview CEO and President.\nInformation about the Members Matter Celebration and Thanks a Million Initiative, including photos, videos and more can be found at clearviewmembership.org .\nClearview Federal Credit Union has been in operation since 1953 and serves nearly 89,000 members, with reported assets valued over $965 million as of May 2015.
