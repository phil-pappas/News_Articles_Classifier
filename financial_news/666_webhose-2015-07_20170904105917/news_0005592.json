There are 51 banks operating in the UAE according to central bank data. \nLutfi said 56 institutions were providing data to the bureau mainly financial firms up from 42 in November. \n'We are pretty much covered. The top banks in the UAE are all on board and 99 percent of the active retail lending market and more than 95 percent of the active company lending market is accounted for' he said in an interview. \nIn a country with an estimated average debt load of 95000 per household and recent debt woes at several large companies the government sees the bureau as a safeguard against a repeat of the credit crisis that brought the economy to its knees and battered banks' balance sheets at the end of the last decade. \n\nFULLER PICTURE \n\nThe bureau collates information on credit histories for consumers and companies dating back to October 2012. It aims to give lenders a window on each borrower's total exposure across the financial system and a better picture of whether they are likely to be able to manage their debt. \nFor many years consumers have been able to take out multiple credit cards or loans with several banks without the knowledge of other lenders. \n'Increasing utilization of the credit bureau should help banks to avoid the worst individual risks which lends further support to our positive top down view' said Rahul Shah research analyst at Deutsche Bank. \nIn the three years before 2008 credit growth surged to the mid-30s percent before plummeting once a property market crash debt restructurings at Dubai World and other state-linked companies and mass job losses prompted banks to set aside huge provisions to cover a rise in bad debt. \nLutfi said it was still too early to say how much impact it will have on lending. Bank lending growth slowed to 8 percent year-on-year in May from 8.4 percent in April the latest data shows. \n'Some banks may be a little more exposed [to bad debt] and other less so it will be a question of management' said Lutfi. \nAbu Dhabi Islamic Bank (ADIB) is already increasing the amount of money it sets aside to cover potential bad loans said Tirad Al-Mahmoud the bank's chief executive. \nOther banks said they had not yet started to do the same as they were not able to form a picture of indebtedness in the financial system at this stage. \nTheir visibility should improve later this year with the launch of a new system by the bureau that sends alerts to banks if a customer misses a payment with another institution. \nTraditionally banks have used name lending a process that allows only limited assessment of a company's ability to repay debts. The bureau is expected to usher in more differential pricing for corporate borrowers. \n'Now the good guys can get the terms they deserve and the bad guys can be pushed on to someone else' said Vince Cook CEO of National Bank of Fujairah.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T09:49:07.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
