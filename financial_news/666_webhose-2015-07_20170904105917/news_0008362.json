The company's chief executive and a string of other senior officials also resigned. \nKubo has now also submitted his resignation from the Financial Services Agency's accounting panel, the source told Reuters. The panel has been urging Japanese companies to adopt international accounting standards. \nKubo's resignation comes a day after Japan Post Holdings, which is preparing for a public offering this year, said it was withdrawing the nomination to its board of Fumio Muraoka, Toshiba's former senior executive vice president. \n(Reporting by Tadahiko Wada and Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Rachel Armstrong)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T11:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T12:21:06.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
