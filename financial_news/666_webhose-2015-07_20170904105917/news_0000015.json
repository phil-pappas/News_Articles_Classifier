Sales were robust in Europe and North America but fell in China, usually a strong market for the company. Its first-half sales were 0.5 percent down from the same period in 2014. \nDetroit-based General Motors Corp., the top-selling automaker for more than seven decades until being surpassed by Toyota in 2008, is expected to report its figure Thursday. \nGM retook the sales crown in 2011, when Toyota's production was hurt by the quake and tsunami in northeastern Japan. \nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models, made a big comeback in 2012, and has been the world's top-selling automaker for the past three years. \nIn the first half, Toyota's sales grew in U.S., Mexico and China. \nLast year, Toyota sold 10.23 million vehicles, beating Volkswagen and General Motors. But it has said it's expecting to sell fewer trucks and cars this year, forecasting sales will fall 1 percent year-on-year to 10.15 million vehicles. \nVolkswagen sold 10.14 million vehicles in 2014. VW makes the Beetle and Golf cars, and also has the Porsche, Bugatti and Audi brands under its group. \nGM, which makes the Cadillac and Opel cars, was third at 9.92 million vehicles in global sales last year. \nThe ranking could still change when numbers come in for the entire year. \nNone of the automakers say they are trying to be No. 1 for the sake of being No. 1. But the industry crown is coveted and significant. \n__", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T09:18:34.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
