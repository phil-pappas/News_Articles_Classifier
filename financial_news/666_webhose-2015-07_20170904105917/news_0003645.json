But we don’t love the headache that can occasionally follow it. Yes, the “red wine headache” is a real phenomenon . Many medical experts point to histamine, a natural substance created by the body and found in many foods and drinks (wine included), as a key culprit.\nIn spite of this, winemakers have never created a wine that’s low in histamine until now.\nEnter Sebastian Ramello, a science-minded wine consultant, who partnered with Veglio, an Italian brand, on what’s believed to be the first-ever low-histamine wines. (The first two releases are classic Italian varietals, barbera and dolcetto.) The trick to making wines low in histamine? The team behind the wines says it’s really about finding the right grapes, growing them in certain kinds of soil and then using the proper sanitation techniques and fermentation methods — all are factors that can affect histamine levels.\nIt’s a bit too early to say how the brand is selling — and the wines are available in just a handful of U.S. states so far — but there’s hope that business will boom. The Ramello/Veglio team estimates some 4.5 million Americans are histamine-intolerant.\nWhat we think about them: We’ve not suffered from “red wine headache” syndrome, so we can judge these wines only on their own terms. And while they’re not stellar bottles, they’re table-friendly, modest-priced wines that have a basic appeal. In particular, the dolcetto is a summer-y pleasure in a way that not many red wines are — it’s light-bodied, full of the flavors of ripe red fruit and altogether drinkable. The fact you can serve it to all manner of guests — at least, if you believe the brand’s low-histamine claims — is an added bonus.\nHow to enjoy them: These are wines that don’t demand too much of the palate, so they’re fairly easy to pair with a variety of foods. But brand spokesman Sergio Sgro suggests pizza as the perfect complement.
