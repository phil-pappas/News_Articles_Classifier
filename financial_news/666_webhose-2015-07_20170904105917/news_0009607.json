Bloomberg Share on twitter by Ruth Liew Wealth giant AMP has named Adam Tindall as managing director of its investment management arm, AMP Capital, following the upcoming retirement of Stephen Dunne.\nMr Tindall is the current director and chief investment officer of property at AMP Capital.\n\"Adam is a talented leader who's played an integral role in developing AMP Capital's strategy and has led the delivery of key projects over the last six years,\" AMP's chief executive Craig Meller said.\nMr Tindall will head the investment arm of AMP, which has a market value of $18.8 billion, from October. The fund manager controls over $160 billion in assets across equities, fixed interest, property and infrastructure.\nMr Tindall has nearly three decades of experience in the property sector, having joined AMP in 2009 from Macquarie Capital. Prior to that, he spent 17 years at Lend Lease including taking on the role of chief executive, Asia Pacific for Bovis Lend Lease.\nAMP is the division spearheading AMP's ambitions in Asia, particularly China. The group has a strategic alliance with Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation, and a long relationship with China Life Insurance Company.\nThe business, however, was recently hit by shareholder activist action, after its China Growth fund caught the eye of disgruntled institutional investor, Metage Capital.\nLast month, Metage penned an open letter to the board of AMP Capital Funds Management, the entity responsible for the group's listed China Growth Fund, highlighting the \"unacceptable discount\" the fund trades at compared to the value of its underlying assets, and its expensive management fees.\n Hong Kong-based hedge fund LIM Advisors, which is one of the listed investment company's largest shareholders, also demanded the manager bring forward a review of its underperforming fund.\nAMP's listed China Growth fund, which invests in China A shares listed on China's Shanghai or Shenzhen stock exchanges, was trading at a 25 per cent discount to its net tangible assets on May 4.\nThe fund charges a 1.65 per cent management expense ratio, making it one of the the most expensive ASX-listed listed investment company.\nAMP announced Mr Dunne's appointment in May, after he led the division for more than a decade. He had been with AMP since 1994.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Ruth_LiewAFR"], "published": "2015-07-28T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T05:02:51.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
