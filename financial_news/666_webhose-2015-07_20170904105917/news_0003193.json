Adani declined comment and Tata Power did not respond to requests for comment. \nShares in India's Aban Offshore, which earns a third of its revenue from Iran, jumped more than 16 percent on Tuesday and another 2 percent on Wednesday, while National Aluminium Co gained 2 percent on Wednesday after media reports said it planned a $3 billion smelter complex in Iran. \nMumbai-based Larsen & Toubro set up a task force ahead of the expected lifting of sanctions to scout for opportunities. The group will visit Iran and report back, Chief Financial Officer R. Shankar Raman told Reuters. \nHe said there were still geopolitical risks to getting involved in Iran. \"It's not going to be an easy decision.\" \n(Additional reporting by Yeawon Choi, Joyce Lee, Meeyoung Cho, Hooyeon Kim and Sohee Kim in SEOUL and Rupam Nair in NEW DELHI; Writing by Tony Munroe; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T14:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T14:34:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
