A moving average is a technical analyst measure equity strategists use to forecast market movements and inform their shareholding positions.\nThere seems to be a battle between people losing faith and the Chinese authorities looking to defend certain variables.\nChris Weston, IG But twice this month panicked selling by retail investors, which make up to 90 per cent of shareholding, has threatened a breakthrough of what is being considered a key support level.\nChina's sharemarket is finding support at the 200-day moving average line. Photo: AP\nIG chief market strategist Chris Weston said market bulls like to own stocks and trade positively when the index is above the 200-day moving average line.\n\"As long as the market trades above the 200-day moving average, it's generally a positive sign for long-term investors,\" he said.\nFor the Shanghai Composite Index, the most watched index by Chinese and global investors alike, that threshold sits at 3534.\nOn Wednesday the index sat at 3655 points\nTwice this month the index threatened to close below the 200-day threshold: on July 8 and again on Monday.\nThe former followed several days of emergency measures lobbed by the Chinese authorities to prop up a market that had plunged 30 per cent in three weeks as its equity bubble punctured largely due to margin calls by brokers leading retail investors to liquidate their shares to pay off their debts.\nOn Monday, a sudden 8.5 per cent drop in the index prompted emergency buying on Tuesday, believed to be by government funds, to arrest the worst one-day plunge since early 2007.\nFeeble confidence Nomura's head of China research Wendy Liu said concerns including US interest rate hikes, the widening of the yuan's trading band, concerns over pork prices and weak manufacturing PMI data were all factors attributable to the latest plunge.\n\"Our checks with A-share fund managers suggest that Monday's sell-off was primarily driven by concerns that Beijing may exit its stabilisation fund prematurely while investors' confidence is still feeble,\" she said.\nMr Weston said it may be a complete coincidence that on both occasions the index managed to hold above the level.\nBut he said the savvy retail investors and the small percentage of institutional investors in the market were keen to hold the market above this level.\n\"Generally when you see a big equity plunge like we saw on Monday, the next day the financial co-op are in the market and happy to buy and it's invariably got a 80 to 90 per cent chance of rallying the next day,\" he said.\n\"It's a line in the sand: there seems to be a battle between people losing faith and the Chinese authorities looking to defend certain variables.\"\nMr Weston said almost 40 different measures have been thrown at the sharemarket to prop it up throughout July. These include increasing liquidity, encouraging state-owned pension funds to buy stocks and halting trading in certain stocks.\nBut if the market does manage to close below 3534, it would open the door to further downside, Mr Weston said.\n\"If we close below that level, I wouldn't look to go short on Chinese stocks but it is worth looking at the price action if we do,\" he said.\nBut BetaShares chief economist David Bassanese said it was likely the sharemarket was closer to the end rather than beginning of a slump.\n\"For starters, Chinese sharemarket valuations are nowhere near as over stretched as was the case during the price bubble of 2007,\" he said.\n\"Secondly, the government appears especially keen to support the market with quite draconian measures if need be.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/chinese-stock-market-how-long-can-beijing-control-its-markets-without-a-bubble-20150728-gimmaq"], "published": "2015-07-29T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T14:35:17.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
