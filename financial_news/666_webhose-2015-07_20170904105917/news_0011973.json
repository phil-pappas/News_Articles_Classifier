Base and precious metals were firmly in the red, with gold, silver, copper, nickel, and zinc down between 1 and 6%, hit by the dollar, which strengthened as investors cashed out of equities and the euro and into the relative safe-haven of bonds and the greenback. \nIron ore, meanwhile, fell back into a bear market on Monday, amid low-cost supplies from Australia and Brazil and stalling demand in China. A bear market is defined as a 20% fall from recent highs. \nIn terms of individual stocks, Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) stood out, as the stock hit its lowest level since the company's IPO in 2011. \nArcelorMittal (Other OTC: AMSYF - news ) plunged 6%, Glencore and Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) fell 5%, and Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) , BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) and Antofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGF - news ) slid 3%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T21:13:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
