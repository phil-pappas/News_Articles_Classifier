In a speech last week Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney told the Treasury Select Committee that the decision to increase base rate \"will likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year\". \nAt last this means that savers, who have been stuck with low returns on their savings rates since base rate fell to 0.5pc in March 2009, have some good news. Economist Howard Archer of IHS Global is predicting a rate rise in February but said there is \"a very real possibility\" that an increase could occur before the end of this year. \nHowever when interest rates start to rise do not expect any rapid hikes. Mr Carney said increases will \"proceed slowly and rise to a level in the medium term that is perhaps about half as high as historic averages\". \nSince the Bank of England was founded, interest rates have averaged 4pc so that suggests that the governor expects base to rise to around 2pc. \nIndeed in another speech last week Mr Carney said: \"I do think there are a variety of factors that mean that the new normal, certainly over the next three years, is substantially lower than it was previously. I see no scenario in which they [base rates] would move towards historic levels\". \nSo what's the best strategy for expat savers? The obvious answer is to stick your money in an easy-access variable-rate account. But given that the base rate won't increase rapidly, shorter-term fixed-rate deals still look attractive. \nThe pick of the short-term deals at the moment is the six-month fixed rate from Nationwide International . It is paying 1.35pc on a minimum deposit of £5,000. Fixing for six months is ideal given the governor's latest predictions: hopefully the deal will mature close to the time of an increase in base rate. This rate is particularly attractive given that it beats the best nine-month fixed rates and, indeed, is close to Nationwide International's one-year fixed deal of 1.45pc. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) though the chances are that we will get an increase in base rate within the next six months, that does not mean you should avoid fixed rates which last longer than this. \nAs the governor said, when rates do go up they are not going to rise fast. So this means it's still worth looking at one-year and probably even 18-month deals. \nThe Skipton International rate of 1.75pc fixed until December 2016 was withdrawn late last week, so that option has now gone. But the top one year fixed rate of 1.45pc from Nationwide International on a minimum deposit of £5,000 remains a good deal even if base rate does go up within that time. \nIf you don't want a fixed-rate deal, then the best rate on a no-notice variable-rate account is Nationwide International's Bonus Access account paying 1.25pc on a minimum £25,000. If you've less to invest, Skipton International's Saver Access account pays 1pc on a minimum £10,000. These two are the standout variable-rate accounts at the moment as others pay lower rates of interest often on higher minimum deposits. \nIt is possible to get better variable rates than these, however but only if you are willing to lock your money up in a notice account. The danger with a notice account is that you run the risk of missing out on any tasty fixed-rate deals that go on sale because you need to give notice for withdrawal and so cannot access your cash. And even during the period of notice you give for withdrawing funds, interest rates could move against you. \nSo ideally you want as short a notice period as possible. Skipton International's Saver 50 only asks for 50 days' notice but its rate of 1.25pc is the same as Nationwide pays on its no-notice account. But if you are prepared to give 150 days' notice five months then Skipton International pays 1.75pc. It also has a 100-day notice deal paying 1.5pc. \nThere's no way of knowing what the best option is, but choosing a no-notice easy-access deal will give you the flexibility to grab any good fixed rates that come along in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T12:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T13:06:16.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
