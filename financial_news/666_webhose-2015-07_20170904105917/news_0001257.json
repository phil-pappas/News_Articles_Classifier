They have raised $10 million, and plan to take the business international. Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell Australia's highest profile small cap fund manager David Paradice has led a $10 million funding round for Melbourne-based technology company Marketplacer, as it plans to take its software solution for online marketplaces to an international audience.\nFormerly known as The Exchange Group, Marketplacer's core product is an e-commerce platform for online marketplaces that connects customers to a range opportunities to buy or rent various products. It promises to help wannabe Airbnb's or Uber's begin operating without having to build their own technology.\nMr Paradice led the funding round along with Jayco founder and chief executive Gerry Ryan. The round leaves Marketplacer with a valuation of about $70 million.\nMr Paradice told Fairfax Media he invested in Marketplacer because the company had the \"first mover\" advantage in a highly competitive market.\nFund manager David Paradice led the funding round that leaves Marketplacer valued at about $70m. Nic Walker \"It's high-risk money to be sure, but investment is ultimately about people. The Marketplacer team have been doing this for almost a decade and are already set up across the world,\" he said.\nMarketplace businesses are the Australian technology startup ecosystem's strong suit, based on businesses such as SEEK, Carsales.com, Freelancer and 99designs.\nWhile all of these companies, now worth between $550 million and $ 5billion, had built their own customised software, Marketplacer founder Jason Wyatt said there was a big market for other companies that wanted a specialist company to do the tech work for them. Marketplacer already has several marketplaces in development for clients.\nGlobal opportunity \"The global opportunity for marketplaces is huge,\" Mr Wyatt said. \"Because we've been running our own marketplaces for so long, we've invested the millions and made the mistakes needed to develop a robust software that anyone can use now.\"\nMr Wyatt and his team have been working in marketplace businesses since 2007.\nThe software is currently used for four marketplaces: bike owner and hirer marketplace Bike Exchange; House and Home for decorators and homeware producers; Tinitrader for parents and baby goods; as well as Outdoria, which connects campers to companies and individuals selling new and used camping equipment and caravans.\nThis investment round included selling 50 per cent of Outdoria to Mr Ryan.\nMr Wyatt said the funds would go towards customer acquisition, which requires significant work to identify target customers and can take months.\n\"We focus on highly fragmented industries to find usually fairly frustrated entrepreneurs who know that they want to do in a marketplace but are struggling because building this kind of software is a big job.\"\nThe company will also look to add to its 110 staff strung across Melbourne, Los Angeles, Germany and New Zealand. Mr Wyatt said they were working across the range of countries and companies to be part of the next major technology company success.\n\"We're now looking at a world where the largest news and content marketing business doesn't create any content: Facebook. The world's biggest taxi company doesn't own any vehicles: Uber; while the world's largest hotel business doesn't own a single property: Airbnb,\" Mr Wyatt said.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711", "https://twitter.com/rosepowell"], "published": "2015-07-20T11:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T12:03:38.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
