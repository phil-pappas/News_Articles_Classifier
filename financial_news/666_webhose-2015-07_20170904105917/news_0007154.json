Best Buy was already down 10 percent for the year before the latest decline.\nDenise Chai, an analyst at Bank of America in New York, now expects Best Buy’s same-store sales to fall 1 percent in the second half. That compares with a previous projection for a gain of 1.5 percent. The sales slump, along with the chain’s continued investment in the business, will reduce earnings, she said in a report on Friday.\nBest Buy is in the third year of a turnaround bid under Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly. His efforts to cut costs and divest foreign units have been well received by investors, but they’re still waiting for him to reignite growth. Sales declined in the first quarter and the company said that revenue this quarter may fall by a low-single-digit percentage, weighed down by closing stores overseas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T19:34:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
