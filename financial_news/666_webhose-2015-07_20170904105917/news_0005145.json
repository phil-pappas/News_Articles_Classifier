Both securities feature interest payments linked to gross domestic product and are also referred to as GDP-linked warrants.\nThe main point of disagreement in the talks is whether bondholders should accept losses on the face value of the debt, something that Ukraine insists upon while a creditor group led by Franklin Templeton has said it isn’t necessary to achieve the goals of the restructuring.\nWhile providing scope for compromise, GDP warrants are also likely to be a source of further disagreement, with the level at which they’re triggered up for debate. Argentina is considered to have set it too low, saddling the country with billions of dollars of payments over the past decade, while the Greek securities have yet to bear fruit with the nation’s economy having shrunk all but one year since its bailout.\nSo what are the instruments and how have they been used?\nWHAT IS A GDP WARRANT?\nGDP-linked securities provide for returns tied to a country’s economic performance. The coupon paid to investors is adjusted upwards or downwards by a certain multiplier based on the prior year’s real GDP level or growth rate.\nHOW IT WORKED IN ARGENTINA\nArgentina issued the securities as part of its 2005 and 2010 debt swaps after the country defaulted on $95 billion in 2001.\nThe notes paid out if GDP exceeded about 3 percent per year. Since 2005, investors have received six payments totaling 18 cents on the dollar, or about $10 billion, according to Tim Samples , an assistant professor at the University of Georgia and Stephen Park from the University of Connecticut.\nThe Argentine economy grew an average 5.1 percent a year in the past decade. The warrants can pay a maximum of 48 cents until they mature in 2035.\n“It ended up being a huge liability for the government in terms of huge payments,” Siobhan Morden, the head of fixed-income strategy at Jefferies Group LLC, said. “This is why GDP warrants for Greece were structured quite differently. Greece learned from their example and offered much less generous terms.”\nSome analysts believe that vagary in the warrants’ design leaves room for Argentina to avoid making larger disbursements after the country changed its base year for GDP last year.\nHOW IT WORKED IN GREECE\nGreece issued warrants that pay out when economic growth and GDP exceed a certain threshold. From 2014 to 2020, the baseline growth rate varies from 2.2 percent to 2.9 percent; from 2020 to 2041, the threshold is fixed at 2 percent.\nA cap on annual payments of 1 percent of the nominal value of the security limits the investment upside of the Greek GDP-linked warrants. Starting in 2023, the face value of the warrant progressively declines. Greece has made no payments thus far.\nUKRAINE SCENARIOS\nGDP-linked warrants are a “reasonable option” to move forward with negotiations, but the instrument is unlikely to add material value to bond prices because it would be discounted by the high risk of weak GDP growth, according to Vadim Khramov, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nUkraine’s economy is predicted to contract by 8.5 percent this year, before expanding 1.5 percent next year and 2.7 percent in 2017, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.\nA trigger level of about 3 percent could be a good starting point, according to Giuliano Palumbo, a Milan-based money manager who helps oversee $3 billion in emerging-market debt for Arca SGR, including Ukrainian bonds.", "external_links": ["http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2630772\\"], "published": "2015-07-16T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T00:52:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
