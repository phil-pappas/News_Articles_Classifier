Some feel bankruptcy is an option. Most who are thinking of filing have been conditioned to ignore this legal right because of banks and credit companies who leverage themselves to keeping honest people from filing.\nTiffany Coleman, Esq., is a bankruptcy attorney admitted to the Georgia Bar. She practices out of the metro Atlanta area.\nColeman's firm, Coleman and Walton, have various webinars and a FAQ for potential bankruptcy filers, but they have also created a helpful document that covers most of the same information but with additional detail. It is also a convenient PDF.\nThe guide covers important details like the difference between Chapter 7 and 13 filing, alternatives and what a potential filer will need to have for the attorney.\nThe PDF is optimized for mobile devices. Interested parties can download the report to their phones or tablets and read the information at their leisure.\nOne thing the report provides is comfort. Many who think of filing bankruptcy are nervous and ashamed to do so. The report does help provide peace of mind for the interested parties. The information is also general and can be used for virtually anyone looking for filing bankruptcy.\n“Most bankruptcy laws are federal, but each state has specifics for filing. All who file for bankruptcy have unique situations, and the information is not to be used as a substitute for the services of an attorney,” said Coleman.\nColeman and her partner have a combined 14 years experience in bankruptcy and tax law. They offer a personalized initial consultation with anyone who thinks filing is necessary. Some who have had the initial consultation have chosen not to file, but each circumstance is different.\n“No document is a substitute for qualified legal advice,” said Coleman.\n####\nThe report is available as a free download from Coleman and Walton's website.
