The City regulator is currently scrutinising statements the scandal-hit insurance outsourcer made about its accounts while under the leadership of Mr Terry. \nNevertheless, despite Mr Terry’s chequered career in business, investors were undeterred. Instead, the stock recorded its highest ever monthly increase, soaring 173.9pc in June to finish the month at 7.875p. \nMounting speculation Mr Terry had targeted the company prompted a rally on June 22, with the share price posting a one-day rise of 32pc. However, Imaginatik were quick to distance themselves from such rumours, advising they knew “no reason” for the share price jump. Alas, a day later, Mr Terry’s investment was confirmed. \nAnalysts in the City were quick to point that Imaginatik is “a different kind of beast” to The Innovation Group and Quindell (LSE: QPP.L - news ) , the companies for which Mr Terry is best known. Unlike Quindell, however, Imaginatik has nothing to do with the insurance industry, and as such analysts remain perplexed by the businessman’s interest in the Aim-listed company. * Crisis at Quindell takes a turn for the worse However, the common theme among analysts is Mr Terry, who was described by some as a “marmite character”, has “lots of vision of how the markets might be changing”. However, a vision is not enough, “the ability to execute on it” is key, they said. \nWhile the company has not commented since it attempted to quench market speculation of Mr Terry’s interest in the company, last week they announced another new contract with a US company which they previously been worked with, until March 2015 when a three year technology deal came to end. Matt Cooper, non-executive chairman of Imaginatik, welcomed the deal, saying it “further increased their footprint” in the US market. \nMr Terry now holds 4.2m shares in Imaginatik and a statement from Quob Park Estates confirmed what many analysts had thought, the investment vehicle will “continue to build their holding”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T06:33:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
