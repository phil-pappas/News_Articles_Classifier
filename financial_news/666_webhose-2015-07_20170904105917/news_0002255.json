But the conditions are extremely tough,\" Pictet Wealth Management chief strategist, Christophe Donay, wrote in a note. \nAmong standout gainers, British Airways' owner International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG) rose 1.9 percent after UBS upgraded the stock to \"buy\" from \"neutral\". \nAmong mid caps, specialty chemical maker Alent soared 45 percent to a record high after a bid from U.S. peer Platform Specialty, pushing the FTSE 350 Chemicals Index 2.6 percent higher. \nOn the downside, International Personal Finance (LSE: IPF.L - news ) plummeted nearly 15 percent to a 16-month low on proposed revisions to a credit amendment law in Poland, one of its biggest markets. \nThe FTSE 100 is up by about 2 percent since the start of 2015, although the index is down 6 percent from a record high of 7,122.74 points reached in April.
