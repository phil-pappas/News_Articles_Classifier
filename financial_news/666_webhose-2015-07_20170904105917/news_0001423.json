SEARCH FOR A BETTER RATE Mr Arnold says as rates get lower, people after a high return need to be even more switched on about where they're putting their term deposit. \"If you're not on one of those decent rates you might be getting less than inflation or around the inflation rate,' he says. LOOK FOR PROMOTIONAL RATES There will often be good promotional rates on offer if you're prepared to look around, Canstar commentator Justine Davies says. While lenders have trimmed term deposit rates recently, Mr Arnold says there are still specials out there although it's becoming harder to find a decent rate. \"Be ready to chase those specials wherever they are,\" he advises. DON'T AUTOMATICALLY ROLL OVER The biggest tip for term deposit investors is not to automatically roll your money over, Canstar commentator Justine Davies says. \"Always compare what is available, both elsewhere and also within your own organisation.\" Mr Arnold suggests setting yourself a reminder before the term deposit's maturity date, to allow time to check who has the next best rate. BE PREPARED TO CHANGE TERMS Always be prepared to change the length of your investment term, Ms Davies says. \"Someone who always invests for 12 months, for example, may find that there is a terrific promotional rate on, say, eight month term deposits, so be prepared to change your term.\" BE PREPARED TO CHANGE LENDERS Mr Arnold says you need to look beyond your current provider. \"You can't just park your money somewhere and hope for a good rate. \"You're really going to have to chase specials if you want to get a good return on your money. To do that you might need to be ready to move your money.\" CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES \"There's also that temptation to go and chase some yield somewhere else, whether that's in equities or the property market or elsewhere,\" Mr Arnold says.
