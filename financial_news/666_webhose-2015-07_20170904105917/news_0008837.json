The authorities are making progress on their structural reform agenda,? it said. \nThe troika agreed that it was \"essential\" for Nicosia to increase the pace of change. \n\"Notably, addressing the excessive level of non-performing loans in the banking system remains the number one priority,\" said the troika. \nAround 50 percent of bank domestic loans are considered non-performing. \n\"It is a necessary condition for a sustainable stabilisation of the banking system and will require further steps as a matter of priority,\" it added. \nThe government was urged to expedite the transfer of title deeds and to facilitate the sale of loans as soon as possible. \nThe authorities must also make all \"necessary efforts to effectively implement the new insolvency and foreclosure legal frameworks\". \n\"Firmly moving ahead with structural reforms,including the privatisation process and the public administration reforms, is critical to cement the improvements in public finances and restore sustained economic growth.\" \nIn previous reviews Cyprus has been praised for implementing a harsh bailout adjustment programme which it agreed with lenders. \nNicosia has said it will stick to the bailout agenda no matter how unpopular. \nCypriots have had to endure tough austerity measures which have seen wages slashed in the private and public sectors, while consumer and property taxes have also increased \nIn return for 10 billion euros ($13 billion at the time) in aid from international lenders, Cyprus in March 2013 agreed to wind down its second largest bank, Laiki, and impose losses on depositors in under-capitalised largest lender, Bank of Cyprus (Berlin: BC9N.BE - news ) . \nInternational lenders expect the island to exit recession this year. \nConclusion of the reviews is subject to the approval processes of both the European Union and the IMF, which is expected to be initiated in September/October. \nThis will allow the next disbursement of 500 million euros.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T19:22:39.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
