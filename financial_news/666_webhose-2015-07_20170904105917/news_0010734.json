Options to buy the U.S. currency have tracked economic statistics this month: They slid to a 10-month low last week, exacerbated by a surprise drop in retail sales, before recovering following the fewest initial jobless claims since 1973.\n“The Fed is not on a fixed, premeditated path, but clearly they are biased to move away from emergency policy settings,” said Robert Rennie, the global head of currency and commodity strategy at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney, who predicts rate increases in September and December. The post-meeting statement will be “at worst neutral for the dollar, and at best reasonably bullish, if it is tweaked to signal liftoff is now fast approaching.”\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed at 1,203.83 as of 6:54 a.m in London from Tuesday. It has slid 0.5 percent this week, after climbing to 1,212.78 on Friday, the highest level since March 19.

The world’s biggest currency trader says the risk is that Yellen adopts a more hawkish tone.\n“There’s greater confidence at this point that we’re in the midst of a renewed pickup” in the economy, said Todd Elmer, a Singapore-based strategist at the bank, who expects a first rate rise in September and another in the first quarter of next year. “There is more ammunition for dollar buying following the consolidation we’ve seen over the past several days.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T13:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T10:38:22.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
