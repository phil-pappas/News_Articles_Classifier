It is unclear what it would cost, however. \nPrasa also boasted last week that the train had already travelled safely between Cape Town and Johannesburg from the Cape Town Jazz Festival. \nBut a letter from Transnet, which Rapport has also obtained, shows that the journey did not go entirely smoothly. \nIn an e-mail by a Transnet official sent to some 20 employees of Transnet and Prasa late in March, Prasa is criticised because it pulled a premier-class train on the way back from the jazz festival to Johannesburg with an Afro 4000 without the required authorisation from Transnet. \n\"No notice / YQ [jargon meaning clearance] was issued for such a move [the journey]. Please arrange for the locomotive to be taken off the train,\" the e-mail read. \nOn June 30, Magiel Pretorius, Transnet's chief administrative officer, issued a notice to Transnet and Prasa in which he noted the height problem. \n\"Due to known height restrictions in the Viertienstrome to Kimberley section, the Afro class locomotive is not authorised to run between Viertienstrome and Kimberley at present.\" \nMeanwhile, two of the 13 locomotives delivered in South Africa so far were pulled this week by an old South African-manufactured 6E class locomotive from Cape Town for adjustments, according a Vossloh document. Prasa spokesperson Moffet Mofokeng reiterated again yesterday that his agency would \"once again provide a comprehensive factual account to disprove the allegations that the height of the Afro 4000 exceeds the requirements of the rail industry in the country\". \n\"We invite all the media, including Rapport, to a presentation and a ride on the locomotives on Monday [tomorrow]. We will also prove how Rapport's reporting has been changing from its initial misleading article, which demonstrates that the intent is malicious and sensational.\" \nSource: Rapport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T18:56:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
