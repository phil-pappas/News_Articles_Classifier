A liter of regular gasoline sells for 1.72 dirhams (47 cents), or about $1.78 a gallon.\nEnergy Minister Suhail al-Mazroui says the decision aims to strengthen the country's economy and could help lower fuel consumption by encouraging the use of public transportation.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
