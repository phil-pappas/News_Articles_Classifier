Bloomberg Share on twitter by Joanna Mather Tax experts have questioned Labor's \"Buffett tax\" plan to impose a minimum tax rate of 35¢ in the dollar for anybody earning over $300,000.\nLabor's Anthony Albanese pushed for the idea, named for US billionaire Warren Buffett who called for the rich to pay more tax, saying 75 Australians who earned more than $1 million in 2011-12 paid virtually no income tax.\nBut PwC private clients partner Paul Brassil said most wealthy people paid \"huge amounts of tax\" via their business entities that did not show up in individual returns.\n\"Which is better for the economy – a taxpayer who just pays income tax and spends all their after-tax income, or a taxpayer who pays less personal income tax because of funds spent taking commercial risks to create employment and opportunity for 10 other people?\"\nThe need to adopt a Buffett-rule suggestion is a bit like saying we should adopt a US-style tax system. The US tax rules are the most complex and cumbersome in the world, and it would run counter to the objective of simplicity and efficiency which modern tax systems are looking for.\"\nTax to hit blokes Labor's national conference agreed that a future government should consider imposing a minimum tax rate of 35¢ in the dollar for anybody earning over $300,000.\nThe rule would force 31,500 households to pay an average of $79,053 extra tax a year.\n Most of that would come from the pockets of men aged in their 50s, who have been called out as the biggest tax minimisers in research by The Australia Institute.\nAccording to Matt Grudnoff, an Australia Institute economist, those on $300,000 plus claim a combined total of about $2 billion worth of tax deductions a year.\nForcing all them to pay at least 35¢ in the dollar would raise $2.5 billion. Ninety per cent of that $2.5 billion would come from men.\nGST increase \"better option\" But a better option for collecting more money from the rich would be to increase the GST, said David Lane, the director of wealth management with Pitcher Partners.\n\"A consumption-based tax is paid in significantly higher dollar amounts by higher income earners as they typically have higher spending patterns,\" he said.\nIn 2012-13, the latest figures available, there were 55 millionaires who paid no tax.\nTax office data shows millionaires rely heavily on deductions for negatively geared properties and charitable donations to minimise their taxable income.\nSome also spend a lot on accountants. For example, in 2011-12, 40 tax filers with earnings over $1 million and taxable income of less than $6000 spent an average of $1.4 million on tax advice, according to an analysis by the federal parliamentary library.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-07-26T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:03:29.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
