Apple is valued at about $740 billion. \nThe energy brought to Google by Porat, who joined in May from investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS.N), is likely to drive the stock in the short and medium term, analysts say. \n\"She is known to be tough as nails when it comes to expense management ...\" FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi told Reuters. \"A lot of investors are comforted by the fact that her first quarter as CFO, reporting, she is delivering.\" \nYOUTUBE CLICKS \nGoogle said on Thursday that watch time for YouTube rose 60 percent in the second quarter and the video service had more viewers aged 18-49 on mobile alone than any U.S. cable network. \nOnline video ads could be a $17 billion opportunity in the United States alone by 2017, Jefferies & Co analysts wrote in a note, and YouTube looks best positioned to benefit. \nGoogle and Facebook are trying to woo big companies to market their products via online videos. \nBut YouTube has an edge over Facebook as it has a more mature monetization platform that seems to attract the best content, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said. \nGoogle's advertising revenue rose 11 percent to $16.02 billion in the second quarter. The number of paid clicks increased 18 percent. \n\"This growth has steadily held in the mid-to-high teens since at least Q1:13,\" RBC analyst Mark Mahaney said. \"Such consistency is a rarity, especially for a behemoth business...\" \nGoogle said the gap was closing between mobile and desktop \"cost per click\" (CPC), or the average price of online ads. Mobile ads are usually cheaper than desktop ads because of smaller screen space. \nMobile CPCs are likely to exceed desktop CPCs in the long term, Munster said. \nGoogle's CPCs fell 11 percent in the quarter, pressured by YouTube TrueView ads - lower priced ads for which advertisers pay only when viewers don't skip an ad. \nGoogle's intrinsic value is $443.23 per share, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine calculations based on analysts' earnings estimates over 10 years. \nOf 48 analysts covering the stock, 38 have \"buy\" or higher rating, while 10 have \"hold.\" The median price target is $672, according to Thomson Reuters data. \nGoogle's shares were up 15.7 percent at $696.09 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Facebook's shares were up 4 percent at $94.61, reacting to Google's ad revenue growth. \nUp to Thursday's close, Google shares had risen about 13 percent this year. The stock trades at 19.7 times forward earnings, while Facebook trades at 38.1 times. \n(Additional reporting by Eileen Soreng in Bengaluru; Editing by Kirti Pandey)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T22:32:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
