Dairying has led New Zealand's charge into China. Bloomberg Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Greg Earl New Zealand has beaten Australia to a series of economic \"firsts\" with China due to a whole of government focus and a conflict avoidance strategy, according to a report that suggests the country may face future choices between Australia and China.\nThe report says NZ's decision to sign the first western country trade agreement with China in 2008 fundamentally changed its citizens' perceptions of where their country's future lies.\nWhile it doesn't specifically compare all of NZ China policies with those of Australia, it suggests the country has been more successful in managing the rise of China by dealing with difficult issues quietly and placing economic interests at the centre of government policy-making.\n\"But what underpins and sustains that relationship is much more than the ability to continue to produce commodities and services that can be sold to Chinese customers or the willingness and ability to provide opportunities for Chinese business to become more involved in New Zealand's growth,\" the report says.\n\"New Zealand governments have generally been strong in understanding and espousing the need for a broad-based, politically-founded relationship with China, without which all aspects of New Zealand's aspirations to maintain and grow ties with that country remain fragile.\"\nIn apparent contrast to the public divisions and policy shifts in the Australian community and politics over how to deal with the rise of China, the report argues that NZ has taken a \"consistent, flexible, imaginative, sometimes opportunistic but generally realistic\" approach about building its bilateral relationship.\nAnd in return it says that China gives every indication that it sees value in dealing with New Zealand as a \"serious partner.\"\nThe report was written by New Zealand Contemporary China Research Centre for the Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology in Sydney and released on Tuesday.\n Regional security peripheral It acknowledges that NZ is less central to regional security issues than Australia and has a narrower base of economic interests to consider in trade relations with China which has made it easier to pursue a trade deal and avoid security conflict.\nBut it does raise the prospect that its different approach to China means \"New Zealand may at some stage have to navigate a complex path between its traditional ties with Australia (especially) and the United States and its newer relationship with China.\"\nWhile Trade Minister Andrew Robb persuaded China to sign last year's bilateral trade deal by characterising Australia as a testing ground for Chinese liberalisation, the report argues NZ had already successfully used this strategy in a much wider way in trade and foreign policy with China.\nIt says: \"As a Western country that does not fall easily into Chinese assumptions about Western attitudes and policies, China has found room to explore opportunities in the relationship that are not easily replicated with others.\n\"New Zealand has openly embraced a 'no surprises' relationship, raising 'difficult' topics away from public scrutiny and bringing the relationship with China into the enunciation of what an independent foreign policy means in practice.\"\nThe study plays down concerns NZ has become too trade dependent on China arguing that it is slightly more diversified in export markets now than it has been in the past. With 18 per cent of exports going to China, it is much less dependent than Australia at more than 30 per cent.\nAnd while noting concerns about heavy dependence on dairy industry exports in its product mix to China at 43 per cent of total exports, it argues that soft commodities will be more stable exports in volume terms in the longer term than the hard commodities which Australia mostly exports.\nNew Zealand's five western \"firsts\" with China First bilateral agreement on China joining the WTO First recognition of China as a market economy First to enter trade deal negotiations First to conclude a comprehensive bilateral trade deal First to join Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/100440329083596928444/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Greg__Earl", "http://www.austrade.gov.au/about-austrade/economics-at-austrade/how-dependent-are-australian-exports-on-china", "http://www.victoria.ac.nz/chinaresearchcentre/", "http://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/our-research/australia-china-relations-institute"], "published": "2015-07-14T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:34:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
