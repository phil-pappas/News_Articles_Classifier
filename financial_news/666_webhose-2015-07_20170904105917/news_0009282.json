He expects the Shanghai market to test support at 3,500 points and then at 3,200. \nThe benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 3.44 percent to 3,789.17 points on Wednesday, rebounding from a more than 11 percent plunge over the previous three sessions. But analysts said relief could be short-lived and trading would remain volatile. \n\"The (government) measures are generally on the right path, but it takes time for the market to recognise it,\" Zhang said. \"After the risk is resolved, the market will perform better next year.\" \nThe key will be how the government manages divestment of its newly acquired stock holdings without spooking tens of millions of \"mom and pop\" investors, the main force in China's markets who trade on rumour and speculation. \nFears the government is preparing to exit the market, despite repeated denials including the latest on Monday, was the trigger for the biggest one-day fall since February 2007. \n\"I do think they will reduce intervention, which is what the market is afraid of these days,\" Steve Yang, a strategist at UBS Group (Other OTC: OUBSF - news ) in Shanghai, told Bloomberg News. \n\"The process will be very long. They do not need to rush to sell their positions in the short term.\" \n- 'Everybody is leaving' - \nOther negative factors are out of the control of securities regulators: an expected US interest rate rise affecting global activity and China's own slowing growth -- the economy expanded 7.0 percent in the second quarter, a far cry from double-digit increases of the past. \nBut exactly where the bottom might be, nobody knows. \nGu Luxian, a former bank employee who trades stocks full-time after leaving his job, plans to return to the market after it falls at least another 20 percent. \n\"I?ll wait until the market slumps to 2,800 points to buy stocks again. Everybody is leaving the market, so why stay?\" he told AFP. \nBut Japan's Nomura believes the plunge represents a buying opportunity and urges its clients to selectively pick up stocks. \n\"Market consolidation may continue until the interim results season in mid-August upon more positive micro-level and macro-level data,\" Nomura said in a research report. \n\"We suggest investors take advantage of this likely second bottom to buy stocks with structurally sound fundamentals.\" \nRegardless, volatile trading will reign and could impact the world's second largest economy as a slowdown in financial activity cuts into growth. \n\"The stock market will continue to be very volatile despite the high-profile rescue package,\" ANZ Banking Group said in a research report. \"The stock market volatility does present some downside risks to China?s growth outlook.\" \nUS analyst Tom DeMark, founder of DeMARK Analytics, told Bloomberg News that behaviour in the Chinese stock market mirrored the 1929 Wall Street Crash, which helped trigger America's economic Great Depression. \nHe expects the Chinese market to fall to 3,200 in the next three weeks and says government measures to stem the slide are futile. \n\"You just cannot manipulate the market. Fundamentals dictate markets,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T13:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T13:35:33.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
