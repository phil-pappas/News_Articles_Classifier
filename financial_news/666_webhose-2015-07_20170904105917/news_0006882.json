The stock closed at $25.94 on Monday in New York.\nThe sale marks the second time RBS has reduced its holding in its U.S. consumer bank this year, as part of Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan’s plan to shrink global operations and return to profit after seven straight annual losses.\nThe latest sale will take RBS’s stake in Citizens to about 26.8 percent, meaning that the British lender is no longer required to include the company in quarterly earnings. RBS reports first-half earnings on July 30.\nRBS has granted investment banks handling the sale the option to place an additional 11.25 million shares as part of the stock offering. That would take the Edinburgh-based lender’s stake down to 24.7 percent.\nMorgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are coordinating the sale, while RBS, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, UBS Group AG, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities are joint bookrunners, according to the filing. Barclays Plc, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods and Sandler O’Neill & Partners are co-managers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T15:10:14.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
