news ) plans - \nUnder the new proposals, Greece's leftist government -- which swept to power in January promising to end years of painful austerity demanded under previous bailouts -- would agree to discourage early retirement and seek higher health contributions from pensioners. \nTax on shipping, corporate tax and a luxury tax would be increased and a crackdown would be energetically pursued against tax evasion, according to a 13-page document released by Athens in the early hours of Friday. \nIn it, Greece also pledged to raise sales tax revenue by the equivalent of 1.0 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), sell the state's remaining shares in telecoms giant OTE and commit to privatising the ports of Piraeus and Thessaloniki no later than October. \nBut Athens also warned the primary surplus targets it had already agreed with its debtors -- one percent of GDP this year, followed by 2.0 percent in 2016 and 3.0 percent in 2017 -- would have to be revised because of worsening economic conditions. \nInstead of abolishing a 30 percent tax break on all its islands, as requested by its creditors, the government said for now it will only scrap the measure on the wealthiest islands and those most popular with tourists. \nAnd, whereas the creditors had demanded a 400-million-euro reduction in military spending, Athens is offering to cut 100 million this year and 200 million in 2016. \n- Greeks want the euro - \nGreece faces has an uphill battle to convince most of the eurozone nations to agree to its third bailout in five years. \nGermany, the Netherlands and several Nordic and eastern European states are hostile to another rescue package and want to see Greece stick to reforms it has rejected, on taxes and pensions, before it talks of debt relief. \n\"I have said that a classic 'haircut' is out of the question for me and that hasn't changed between the day before yesterday and today,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters on a visit to Sarajevo on Thursday. \nThe same day, however, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble conceded that IMF chief Christine Lagarde was correct when she said Greece was in need of some debt restructuring. \nBut he was quick to add: \"There cannot be a haircut because it would infringe on the system of the European Union and after all the European Union is a community of common laws.\" \nOn the streets, ordinary Greeks were panicking over the realisation that, by voting to reject austerity in last Sunday's vote, they brought their country to the brink of a messy exit from the euro, a so-called \"Grexit\". \n\"I voted 'No' but I am for Greece staying in the eurozone,\" said Viviane, a worried 46-year-old secretary in an Athens lawyer's office, echoing a view held by many. \n\"I want an agreement and no matter if it contains austerity measures -- that is still better than going back to the drachma,\" sighed Stefanos, an unemployed 32-year-old. \nIt has already received 240 billion euros in loans from the two previous EU-IMF rescues, the last of which expired on June 30. In 2012, creditors also forgave 107 billion euros of its debt. \nBut all that has proved insufficient, with Greece struggling through a depression that has shrunk its output by a quarter and sent unemployment rocketing to 26 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T08:53:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
