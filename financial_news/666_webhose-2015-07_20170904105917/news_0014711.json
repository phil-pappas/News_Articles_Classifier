The Sparta program enables municipalities to pay the cost of equipment over time, providing local government agencies with the benefit of lowering their annual capital outlays as they acquire the critical equipment they need.The Sparta Municipal Lease Program can accommodate a wide variety of asset classes, from cars to motorcycles, from fire equipment to tactical vehicles, from trucks to busses, and virtually any type of essential-use equipment in which cost is more favorably budgeted through multi-year leasing, rather than outright purchase.
