GAAP1 earnings were 1.03 per share, compared to 1.15 per share in the prior year.\n\nSecond quarter sales were 8.6 billion, down 11 percent versus prior year due to negative impacts from currency (5 percent), portfolio changes (2 percent), volume (2 percent) and local price and product mix (2 percent). Segment pre-tax operating earnings of 1,586 million included about 210 million, or 0.17 per share, of negative impact from currency. Operating earnings included 0.09 per share of benefit related to exchange gains and taxes, attributable to prior periods. Performance Chemicals segment operating earnings were 113 million, or 0.10 per share, a 55 percent reduction versus prior year.\n\nDuPont's board of directors approved a third quarter dividend of 38 cents per share, the 444th consecutive quarterly dividend since the company's first dividend in the fourth quarter of 1904. The third quarter dividend of 38 cents per share of common stock is payable on Sept. 11, 2015, to stockholders of record at the close of business on Aug. 14, 2015. Regular quarterly dividends of 1.125 per share on the 4.50 series preferred stock and 0.875 cents per share on the 3.50 series preferred stock also were declared, both payable on Oct. 23, 2015, to stockholders of record as of Oct. 9, 2015.\n\nThe separation of Chemours was completed on July 1, 2015. In the first quarter 2015, DuPont announced its intention to buy back shares using the approximately 4 billion of distribution proceeds received from Chemours. In connection with the completion of the spin, DuPont's board has authorized the company to purchase and retire 2 billion of common stock by Dec. 31, 2015 with the remainder to be purchased and retired by Dec. 31, 2016. The company expects to use an accelerated share repurchase plan in connection with the 2 billion buyback by year end.\n\n\"We continued to improve margins across most of our ongoing businesses through our constant focus on productivity, even as we address industrywide challenges in agriculture and ongoing currency headwinds,\" said Ellen Kullman, DuPont Chair and CEO. \"With the separation of our Performance Chemicals segment now complete, the next generation DuPont is leveraging our innovation platform to drive greater growth and value, with a continued emphasis on cost productivity, actively managing our portfolio, and the disciplined return of capital.\"\n\nSecond Quarter Highlights\n\nDelivered second-quarter operating earnings per share of 1.18 versus 1.17 in prior year. Performance\nChemicals operating earnings were down 0.11 per share from prior year. GAAP earnings per share were\n1.03 versus 1.15 in prior year.\n\nSegment pre-tax operating earnings of 1,586 million included about 210 million, or 0.17 per share, of\nnegative impact from currency. Excluding the impact of currency, operating EPS would have increased\nabout 15 percent versus prior year.\n\nOperating margins improved in 5 of the 6 ongoing operating segments which comprise the next\ngeneration DuPont including Performance Materials, Electronics & Communications, Agriculture,\nNutrition & Health, and Safety & Protection. Margin improvement was primarily driven by increased\nproductivity.\n\nCost reductions from operational redesign contributed 0.10 per share to second-quarter operating\nearnings; on track to deliver approximately 0.40 per share in savings in 2015.\n\nOn a continuing operations basis, DuPont expects full-year 2015 operating earnings to be about 3.10\nper share, excluding 0.80 per share in previously anticipated full year earnings from Performance\nChemicals. Estimated negative currency impact expected to be approximately 0.60 per share. Prior-year\noperating earnings were 3.36 per share on a comparable basis.\n\nOutlook\nConsistent with continuing weakness in global agricultural markets, the company is reducing expectations for the year in its Agriculture segment due to weaker demand in global crop protection markets, reduced expectations for corn area in Latin America, and lower than expected soybean volumes in North America. The company continues to anticipate that the operational redesign will deliver savings of approximately 0.40 per share in 2015. As a result, the company expects operating earnings per share for 2015 to be about 3.10 per share for the full year, excluding 0.80 per share of anticipated full-year earnings from the Performance Chemicals segment. This represents a 0.10 per share reduction from the prior outlook of 4.00 per share, which included the Performance Chemicals segment.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement believes that certain non-GAAP measurements are meaningful to investors because they provide insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the company. Such measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. \n\n\nAbout Dupont \nDuPont (NYSE: DD) has been bringing world-class science and engineering to the global marketplace in the form of innovative products, materials, and services since 1802.
