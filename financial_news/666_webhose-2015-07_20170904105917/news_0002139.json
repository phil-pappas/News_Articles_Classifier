Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires Did China's bubble burst, or has it just corrected after a meteoric rise?\nThe impressive 18 per cent rally since the Shanghai Composite index hit a recent low on Thursday suggests the Chinese government's interventions are working to stem a 30 per cent fall in shares in less than a month.\nChina's second-quarter GDP is due on Wednesday, but experts are sanguine about the real effects to China's growth on its famously \"spiky\" sharemarket.\nBloomberg Intelligence director of Asian research Tim Craighead said rather than a bursting of the sharemarket's bubble , the 30 per cent fall amounted to a \"correction that is in response to a huge speculative fervour that had worked its way into the market\".\nHe said China had a history of a spiky sharemarket .\n\"It is highly retail-oriented and the Chinese speculator – I don't even say investor – has a history of moving in and moving out on speculative hype,\" he said.\nThe latest bout of speculation started in September and October, Mr Craighead said, in anticipation of monetary easing, the Hong Kong-Shanghai stock connect and other reforms that promised a flow of global capital.\nBut he said the speculation took the market to \"unprecedented highs\" in terms of new accounts – some 258 million, one-third opened in the past nine months alone, according to Credit Suisse research – and margin leverage.\n \"At some point, that was coming to an end,\" he said.\nThe market has enjoyed three days of rallies in response to the unprecedented measures the Chinese government has thrown to prop up the market in the past three weeks, including cutting interest rates, increasing liquidity to brokers, stopping new listings and halting trading of some shares.\nBut seasoned China share investor Kerr Neilson, Platinum Asset Management's chief executive, was critical of the Chinese government's \"lack of poise\" , labelling its extraordinary intervention \"disturbing\".\n\"By providing support to parts of the market, the government may have unwittingly encouraged investors to liquidate while there is a propping buyer,\" Mr Neilson wrote in a note to investors.\nWhat does the correction mean to the economy? The relationship between the sharemarket and the economy was limited because of the lack of household wealth tied into the sharemarket, Mr Craighead said.\nThe market, constituting mainly retail investors, had tied up around 11 per cent of their household wealth, relatively small compared with 30 per cent in the US.\nA household equity investment survey also found that close to 9 per cent of households had stock accounts , and only 3.5 per cent used margin financing, according to Barclays research, headed by David Fernandez.\n\"Given that the equity boom-bust has happened in such a short time period, it is likely that the majority of the consumers have not yet dramatically changed their propensity to consume or spending on discretionary goods.\n\"We see the financial sector contribution to GDP growth as closely related to stock market performance, suggesting downside risks if the sell-off persists,\" Mr Fernandez said.\nBarclays found 10 per cent rise in market returns would boost annual GDP growth by 0.2 per cent. Conversely, a further 20 per cent fall in the market from here would result in a 10 per cent annual loss, with a fall of 0.2 percentage points.\nMr Craighead said GDP estimates may come down from reduced contributions from the financial sector.\n\"That doesn't however mean that it has an impact on underlying consumption trends from business or consumer or on the import/export market,\" he said.\nBut Mr Craighead said the biggest concern was China's policy makers pushing back reforms in the wake of what happened to the market.\n\"The biggest issue from our perspective strategically is that Chinese policy makers don't lose sight of reform driving the rebalancing of the economy, because of what's happening on the stock market,\" he said.\nHowever, he said, given the continued downturn, the monetary easing should continue.\nWhat should we be looking out for in Wednesday's GDP figures? Mr Craighead anticipates growth will have slowed to a 6 per cent handle, below the 7 per cent China had been tracking towards.\n\"It's slower than where it has been but we don't see that falling further,\" he said.\nThose figures shouldn't be cause for alarm in an economy shifting away from an export-driven manufacturing economy to a more consumer -based developed one, he said.\n\"We're past the hyper-growth of Chinese economic activity but if they can drive reform in the right way, they can indeed get through the middle-class trap that so many emerging economies have been stuck in, where they can't get through to the next phase of economic activity,\" he said.\nMr Fernandez forecast GDP growth of 6.8 per cent for 2015, with signs emerging for stabilisation in growth.\n\"This baseline forecast continues to expect a stabilising property investment and stronger infrastructure investment in the second half,\" he said.\n\"But we would need to revisit this forecast if more widespread systemic financial risks become evident.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/household.png", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/GDP.JPG", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/china-stocks-wild-ride-not-a-1929-moment-20150710-gi96qg", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/consumption.JPG", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/margin", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/chinese-sharemarket-platinums-kerr-neilson-says-government-lacked-poise-in-crash-20150714-gibk60"], "published": "2015-07-14T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:04:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
