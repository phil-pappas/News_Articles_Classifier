Marix ranked No. 2 on HBJ's 2015 Heavy Hitters Investment Brokerage List . How’s business? At the start of the year, a lot of people wondered how Houston was going to survive the oil slump. Was it going to result in plummeting rents, occupancies, even foreclosures? We’ve always felt that was a hysteria-level reaction. It’s not as robust as last year, but by no means has it fallen off. You closed 38 multifamily investment transactions worth nearly $1.5 billion in gross dollar sales volume in 2014, the most recent year available. Are you on track to hit that again this year? We’ve closed 13 transactions year to date. The values we’ve underwrote, the cap rates and returns have largely been what they have been last year. We’re still hitting our values. Bidder participation is off a little bit, but from a volume standpoint, it’s been a very healthy year so far. Land sales have been very busy. Who’s still buying into Houston’s multifamily market? We have a nice mix of institutional buyers — REITs and pension fund advisors — and private capital. There’s a lot of money from foreign investors from Canada, Mexico and Asia. Houston is a very international and diverse market. How do you keep interest in Houston’s multifamily market up during the oil slump? We’ve just tried to educate the capital on what’s happening in Houston. Much of country sees as as one horse town. I know Houston’s job projections have been revised down from 70,000 new jobs to more like 20,000 to 30,000, but the fact that Houston can still post job gains in a calendar year where there is a decline in oil prices proves that we’ve become more diverse. There was a thought that the effect of low oil would be much greater than expected. But apartment occupancy is still very strong and we’ve had positive net apartment absorption. I’m not trying to pretend that the market is different from a year ago. It is. The pace of growth is slowing, which we all expected, but the fundamental performance is very strong. I’m very impressed with the resilience of the Houston market. \nWant Houston Commercial Real Estate news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
