It lost out to local lender Commercial International Bank (CBI), whose bid was \"very aggressive,\" according to Mahmoud. \nHe said ADIB's overseas expansion could involve acquisitions in the retail space or growing its own corporate business. \nThe bank last year completed the purchase of the retail business of Barclays in the UAE, helping create one of the largest ATM networks in the country. \nBanks in the UAE have enjoyed several quarters of bumper earnings as the economy has flourished. \nBut Mahmoud said \"tailwinds were not as strong as they used to be\" as economic growth had eased. \nBusiness activity growth in the non-oil private sector slowed to a 22-month low in June, partly because of the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, while Dubai residential property prices are forecast to fall 10-20 percent this year. \nReturn on equity across the local banking industry was expected in the region of 15-18 percent, Mahmoud said, adding he hoped ADIB would be at the top end of that range. \nThe bank's return on average shareholders' equity was 18.4 percent in 2014, according to a recent financial presentation. \nBut Mahmoud said there was a \"bit of irrational exuberance\" among banks in pricing of products. \nYears of low interest rates have led banks in the UAE to cut the price of loans and other products in an effort to compete. \n\"The risk we run is destroying shareholder value if we continue this senseless price competition but so be it, that's the market,\" he said. \"My biggest concern is erosion of margins and erosion of returns on capital for the industry as a whole.\" \n(Editing by Mark Potter) ((Tom.Arnold@thomsonreuters.com; +97144536265; Reuters Messaging: tom.arnold.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net)) \nKeywords: ABU DHABI BK M&A/ Â© Copyright Zawya.
