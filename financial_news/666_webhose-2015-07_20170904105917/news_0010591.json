Or maybe you bought the stock in June 2013, when it was added to the S&P 500 index. In that case, your investment is down 4 percent, while the S&P 500 as a whole is up 29 percent.

It has a robust portfolio and every vehicle is solid.\" \nRead More It's not the same old GM: Activist Harry Wilson \nElias' view is not unique. \nAsk most who work in or close to the auto industry about General Motors and the leadership team under Mary Barra and you will generally hear positive comments. Last year, GM set a company record by selling 9.9 million vehicles worldwide. In the process it earned $2.8 billion. \nAnd yet GM shares are stuck in neutral. Even a successful push by activist investors earlier this year that led to GM increasing its dividend and buying back more stock has failed to jump-start the stock. \nRead More Major automaker tries out car-sharing \nOne issue has been the perception among some investors that GM and other traditional automotive stocks, such as Ford , represent the \"old school\" auto industry; companies like Tesla and the supplier Mobileye , meanwhile, are viewed as the \"new auto industry.\" \nSince late March, when Tesla was at its most recent low and GM at its most recent high, Tesla's stock is up 55 percent; GM, on the other hand, is down 16 percent. <p>Tesla sees record deliveries</p> <p>Tesla delivered more than 11,000 vehicles in the second quarter, reports CNBC&#039;s Phil LeBeau. </p> \nAlthough companies like Tesla are steeped in technology for electric and autonomous-drive vehicles, which are believed to be the growth engines of the future for the auto industry, Elias called this perception shortsighted. \nRead More Riding high: Auto sales set for big second half \n\"We're seeing a sea change in the automobile industry when it comes to technology, fuel economy and the types of vehicles being built,\" he said. \"GM is right there. In some cases, it's making these moves before other companies but it's not getting the benefit of the doubt.\" \nGM has likewise created some of the skepticism that's dragged down its shares. The scandal surrounding defective ignition-switches that ultimately lead to congressional hearings and the recall of 2.6 million vehicles weighed on GM's stock much of last year. \n\"GM, in my opinion, is one of the better auto companies, and the future has never been brighter for the auto industry,\" Elias said. \"But a lot of people don't see the story of how this industry is improving.\" \nSeparately on Tuesday, Deutsche Bank lowered its rating on Tesla to \"hold\" from \"buy,\" citing valuation.
