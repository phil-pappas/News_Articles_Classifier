Closing out Monday's febrile trading session at 4,054.86; a 20% correction from the height of the rally is technically bear market territory.BNP Partners says the volatility is being blamed largely on a lack of liquidity. China's central bank's efforts to help add liquidity revolved around a cut in interest rates and a reduction in so-called RRR - or the reserve ratio requirement which stipulates how much cash commercial banks must hold in reserve when lending.\"Nearly 7 trillion yuan is committed to a slew of IPOs and the move by regulators to rein in excessive levels of margin trading has taken more than a few bricks out of the wall of money that drove the Shanghai Composite up close to 150% in just a year. Until those IPOs work through the system, we've taken risk off the table,\" concluded Denning.
