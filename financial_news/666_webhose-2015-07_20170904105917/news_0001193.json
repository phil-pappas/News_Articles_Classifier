The same cannot be said of his successor, Antony Jenkins, who tried valiantly to smooth things over after regulators demanded Mr Diamond’s dismissal in 2012. A decent chap who did a decent job, “Saint Antony”, as he was sometimes depicted, was himself ousted on July 8th. What will change as a result is far from clear.\nIn this section Uncle Xi's bear market The debt trap The trials of Saint Antony Aiming for the net Glitch perfect Tax them and they will grow Costly comparison Reprints Related topics Credit Suisse Industries Financial services Barclays Securities Services Mr Jenkins was not the most inspiring banker. He lacked the Diamond-esque gumption of some of his peers, many of whom have energetically driven their institutions into the ground. A retail and commercial banker by training, his understated pitch focused on improving the bank’s “culture”—ie, discouraging traders from fiddling foreign-exchange markets and the like. He twice restructured its investment bank, clearly not his favourite division. That seemed tailored to please scalp-hunting regulators.\nBut Barclays’ board is seemingly in the market for gutsier stuff. The bank’s newish chairman, John McFarlane, is a veteran financial executive nicknamed “Mac the knife”. He is now crafting a new strategy for the group even as he looks for a new chief executive, who will arrive only in 2016. In the meantime Mr McFarlane will also run Barclays day-to-day.\nThe issues in his in-tray would look familiar to many of his peers. Like Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, Barclays rapidly sprouted an outsized investment bank in the years leading up to the crisis. At all three banks, this business has turned from glittering star to ball-and-chain. The swingeing fines it regularly attracts from regulators do not help.\nPerhaps not by coincidence, Deutsche and Credit Suisse have also turned to new bosses recently, having kept hardened investment bankers at the helm for years. John Cryan and Tidjane Thiam, respectively, are expected to recast their groups in a different mould, probably radically so in Credit Suisse’s case. Investors point to UBS, a Swiss lender which has ostentatiously throttled its investment bank and seen its share price soar as a result.\nWhat Barclays will do is much less clear. Mr Jenkins didn’t have the wrong strategy, his chairman says. Nor was he wrong to implement a change in culture. Barclays “remains committed to investment banking” while seeking to accelerate change there. Whether that means further squeezing its investment bank or beefing it up to help it compete with American rivals is anyone’s guess. Such lack of clarity is seldom appreciated by investors.\nThe current situation is clearly unsatisfactory. In theory the investment bank generated £1.4 billion ($2.2 billion) of the bank’s £2.3 billion in profits last year. But that does not include losses of £1.2 billion at a “non-core” division set up largely to house troubled investment-banking assets. Barclays’ cost of equity, the returns its shareholders expect, hovers around 10%, yet its investment bank delivered a meagre 2.7% return on equity last year. (The bank as a whole did a little better, at 5.1%.) Not once in the past five years have investors priced Barclays’ shares above the value of its tangible net assets (see chart). In theory, it would be better off winding itself up and returning money to shareholders.\nBarclays’ other problem is its rather odd mix of businesses. Its most lucrative division, British personal and corporate banking, delivers the sort of healthy profits one would expect from an oligopolistic market. It fits neatly enough with Barclays’ big credit-card operation, which is also active in America and elsewhere. But it is hard to see what those divisions have to do with the Africa Banking unit.\nBarclays is not global enough to sell itself as a logical worldwide partner for deep-pocketed multinationals. But its operations are far-flung enough to incur many of the administrative costs that plague the banks that can, such as Citi and HSBC. Regulators and investors are both keen on duller, one-trick banks.\nMr McFarlane’s only clear goal, meanwhile, is to do away with some of the 375 internal management committees bogging Barclays down. He speaks of “clunkiness” in decision-making and a lack of individual accountability. How better to change that than to fire the boss?\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/print-edition/20150711_FNC034.png", "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2015/07/articles/main/20150711_fnp506.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T01:33:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
