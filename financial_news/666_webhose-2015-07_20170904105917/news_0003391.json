the Aussie sharemarket is lifting; the Chinese sharemarket appears to be stabilising; and both the Iran and Greek issues look to be heading for resolution,\" he said. \n\"In short, the latest consumer confidence reading may actually prove to be ancient history.\" \nAnd, he said, the good news was that both business confidence and business conditions (an average of employment reading conditions and profitability measures) are now both stronger than normal. \nThat was a reference to the NAB business confidence survey on Tuesday, which UBS economist George Tharenou said could signal a \"turning point\" in the economy. \nAMP's Shane Oliver acknowledged that the agreement Greece had made with its creditors faced challenges. \n\"Given that the Greek economy will likely get worse before it gets better and debt relief is still a way off (after program reviews) another rebellion by Greece - reopening the prospect of a Grexit (Greek exit from the euro) - remains a risk,\" he said. \n\"But in the short term Greece is likely to fade as an issue.\" \nAs for the Chinese share market's slide, Dr Oliver looked on the bright side, saying the \"necessary correction\" had limited implications for Australia. \n\"Just as the rise in Chinese shares had little economic impact its hard to see the pullback having a significant economic impact either,\" he said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Shoppers going online while in-store AAP \nMobile phones and tablets aren't just used for online shopping, they play a big part in attracting customers to …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T11:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T12:16:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
