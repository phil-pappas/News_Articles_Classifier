The Saudi Market closed the month at 9,086.9 falling 6.2 per cent.\n\n\"The performance of our funds is a reflection of Daman Investments' deployment of unique investment strategies that have enabled us to perform well even in the most challenging of environments,\" Daman Investments chairman Shehab Gargash said.\n\n\"We continuously track the performance of Daman Investments funds, monitoring for risks and carefully timing and diversifying investments to maximise potential upsides,\" Shehzad Janab, head of asset management and advisory of Daman Investments, said. \"Our Daman Fifth Fund in particular exemplifies the benefits of this strategy, having increased by 750 per cent since its launch in 2010.\"\n\nDaman Investments is licensed and regulated by the Central Bank of the UAE and the Emirates Securities and Commodities Authority.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T07:37:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
