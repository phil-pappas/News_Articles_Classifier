It is also targeting the Islamic insurance market. \nThe 90-plus syndicates which operate at Lloyd's wrote 25 billion pounds ($39 billion) in gross written premiums last year, with 12 percent of the business coming from Asia. \nNelson said around $130 million in business was written for Malaysia, but said an onshore presence would likely enable that figure to grow, without giving a target. \nLloyd's said the licence would \"give Lloyd's a significant opportunity to develop its marine, energy, construction, engineering and liability business, as well as introduce new products to the market\". \n($1 = 0.6400 pounds) (Reporting by Carolyn Cohn; Editing by Simon Jessop and Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T15:10:43.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
