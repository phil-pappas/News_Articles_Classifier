He also emphasised Etihad's unique approach to constantly innovating in order to better serve customers.\n\n\"Innovation one of the greatest things about travel in this era is the consumer can find out so much about your business. In our culture, we don't have passengers, we have guests and that guest experience whether it's first class, business class or economy is fundamental, and treating the guest with respect,\" he said.\n\n\nHe further noted that Etihad competes on product in the markets in which it operates and that even as a young airline, Etihad has already differentiated itself in the market and attracted global interest with the best-in-class offerings available across every class of service, which includes The Residence, Business Studios, Economy Smart Seats, in-flight chefs, butlers and flying nannies.\n\nHogan also discussed Etihad's unique business model which extends the airline's organic growth through codeshare partnerships and equity investments in key global airlines, including airberlin, Air Serbia, Air Seychelles, Aer Lingus, Alitalia, Jet Airways, Virgin Australia, and Swiss-based Darwin Airline, to offer greater choice to consumers, including a network of more than 500 destinations worldwide all at greater convenience, with one booking and one fare. The airline's hub in Abu Dhabi now serves as a gateway between the Middle East, Asia and Australia and destinations in Europe and America.\n\nHogan said, \"Our equity strategy is about how we build our network. We work in a digital age where the consumer, whether it's corporate or leisure, can go online and they look to points of the world they wish to travel. Now within that, we have a partnership with these airlines where we're now strengthening our global network top line generating revenue and bottom line tackling cost together.\"\n\nEtihad Airways' booth at the GBTA Expo showcases The Residence, Etihad Airways' exclusive luxury travel offering available aboard its Airbus A380 aircraft.
