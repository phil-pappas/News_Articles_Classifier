Gold \nIt also added global prices of the precious metal could drop and stay in the range of $900-1,050 per ounce. \n\"Till such time the uncertainty around global growth is reduced, the chances of international gold prices falling below $900 ounce corresponding to pre-2009 levels are remote,\" India Ratings said. \nThe prices of gold, which is considered a hedge against an economic uncertainty, may weaken with the expectation of an increase in the US real interest rates. \n\"US real interest rates and gold prices have also more or less remained negatively correlated, similarly gold prices and the dollar index historically have a negative correlation, but there have been occasional bouts of a positive correlation for a short term,\" it further said. \nOn demand side, the rating agency said China and India form close to half of the total world demand for gold and they have been maintaining their pace of purchases around the 2011-2012 levels. \n\"China and India however showed some diverging trends in 1Q15; consumer demand in India rose 15 per cent Y-o-Y while it declined 8 per cent yoy in China. Investment demand in India however is down to a six-year low,\" the agency added. \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T16:08:04.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
