Banks and their brokerage units are providing structured products -- asset management plans -- for funding major shareholders’ purchases of stock.\n“This is much safer and more lucrative when compared with traditional lending,” said Lin Bocheng, a Shanghai-based analyst at Huatai. “There’s almost no risk of it becoming a bad loan and the return can be about 7 percent to 8 percent, so every bank wants to get a piece of that.”\nThe total amount of funding arranged through the products may amount to tens of billions of yuan, Lin estimated. The business is a small but welcome boost for banks when corporate demand for long-term loans is weak and soured credit is on the rise. Regulators’ support is an added attraction.\nThe funding contrasts with banks’ reluctance to channel money to the nation’s smaller businesses as an economic slowdown adds to the risk of loans turning bad.\nAs part of efforts to rescue a plummeting share market, Chinese officials banned the largest shareholders of publicly traded firms from selling stock and urged them to raise their stakes. They also told banks to do more stock-pledged lending to fund share buybacks.\nBoosting Stakes At least 1,300 major investors had boosted their holdings as of July 20 from July 8, when the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued its call to shareholders, the Xinhua News Agency said, citing information from financial data provider Hithink Flush Information Network Co. Aerospace Hi-Tech Holdings Group Ltd. said last week that its controlling shareholder will spend at least 35 million yuan ($5.6 million) to raise its stake through asset management plans.\nUnder such plans, banks hold senior tranches with fixed returns while borrowers get junior tranches. Bank of China Ltd.’s brokerage unit is offering such a product, with the lender’s Shanghai branch acting as the custodian.\nAt China Merchants Bank Co., such products have a 1:2 leverage ratio and the funding can only be used to buy the stock of companies profitable for at least one year and with market values of at least 5 billion yuan, according to an official at the lender who’s familiar with the matter. The official asked not to be identified as he isn’t authorized to speak publicly.", "external_links": ["http://www.boc.cn/aboutboc/bi1/201507/t20150713_5285332.html\\"], "published": "2015-07-27T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T05:44:04.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
