He said it was unfortunate that people who should be aware of the function of the CBL will make statements that will bring the bank to public ridicule. \nSpeaking at his farewell dinner, outgoing CBL Board Chair Bestman said: \"Despite the success which are key including financial inclusion by the Central Bank of Liberia there are some people who seek to politicize the work and intent of the Bank in promoting the well-being of Liberia\" \n\"They continue to make all kinds of irresponsible remarks about the direction of the bank including insinuating that the money be used to promote scenes from the account of the Central Government. This is false and misleading and the accusations are baseless not one penny of Government is spent on the ongoing Stimuli of the bank,\" he states. \nMr. Bestman continued: \"It does seems to me that some people are vex because the Central Bank is meeting the needs of the Liberian People to our quest to improve their wellbeing, but as the famous song says if you vex burst\". \ne added that the Central Bank is the clearinghouse for all transaction in the country adding that all members of the board of Governors of the bank take a fidelity oath to protect the agency and no matter of propaganda can stall the work of the bank. \n\"Let people know that the Central Bank is the clearing house for all transaction in the banking system, let them be aware as members of the board of Central Bank of Liberia, we took a vitality oath never to disclose anything in line with our duties, we have the judiciary responsibilities to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the banking system\", added Bestman. \nThe CBL outgoing Governor recalled a story from a spiritual leader of a certain farmer who made a trap to catch rat and all of the other animals on the farm said the trap for rat and not them, but surprisingly the trap caught a snake and the snake bit the farmer's wife, the herbalist ask for chicken bone to heal the farmer's wife so they killed chicken but the farmer's wife died.\" \n\"And for the repast they killed Goat and the feast they killed cow at the end the farmer himself died, all of the animals died including the farmer and his wife meaning the trap that was made for the rat is still running around; so you see time trap is not for rat alone\". \nIn a harsh tone, Mr. Bestman warned those he said are bent on trying to spoil the work of the bank \"those who intent to spoil the motivation of the Central Bank should be mindful that the central bank knows about every single transaction in this country nothing can save you from us\". \nIt can be recalled the House of Representatives called for an audit of the Central Bank noting that they wanted to know the whereabouts of the money being spent by the bank to run campaign in favor of CBL Governor Mills Jones. Reacting to claims, Mr. Bestman said, \"the internal audit they calling for will disclose their own skeletons quite sufficient.' \nHe boasted of the newly dean of the Central Bank Governors, Dr. David Farhat adding that he is a man of high esteem and character. Mr. John Bestman served the Bank for 11 years disclosing that he was the youngest there since Gyude Bryant Administration. On the issue of National Currency, Mr. Bestman said it was not the right time for the country to use single currency as the country continues to experience budget shortfalls and challenges. \n\"Liberia follows the dual currency regime as USD and LD as legal tenders. I know that as nationalist we must have to seek a single currency; as Liberia now we can't use a single national currency exclusively because we must produce more exports and save more money as a source of value with the low level of productivity in the country\" Bestman observed. \nHe continued: \"It is not the appropriate time to have the Liberian dollar as a single currency, while the dual currency is a double edge sword yet it has been good for Liberia in ensuring micro economic stability\". He commended President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf for the confidence reposed in him, as his retiring from public service will guarantee gains made by Unity Party led Government nonreversible. \nAdditionally, Central Bank Governor named him as a role model for younger generation as he strived to bring the bank to where it is now. He added that it was fortunate that he worked with outgoing Governor Bestman as they both shared the same ideas, and vision during his time with the bank. Dr. Jones said serving the public mainly the voiceless was the priority of the Bestman. \n\"He said his work is not done and we will continue to call him for his role played in the economic empowerment and we believe that the train has not stopped as we believe in his philosophy,\" he states. The program brought together several persons as Blue and White illustrated the hall. Some of the guest included Cllr. Gloria Musu Scott, Ophelia Hoff- Saytumah, Dr. Togba Nah Tipoteh, Senator Morris Saytumah and staffs of the Central Bank of Liberia among others.
