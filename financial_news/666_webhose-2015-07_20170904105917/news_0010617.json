Retailers hire professionals to style their stores, so that customers will buy more products. They also successfully convinced customers they will do not only want these items but actually need them. So customers need to be clever enough not to be lured by store campaigns together with other marketing schemes that these retailers promote in their stores. Children must also be taught by their parents so that they, too, isn't going to be trapped into buying a greater portion of the things they need. This may cause them stay with their budget and learn how to get control of their finances later in life.So, what are retail secrets that allure someone to buy more products? Here are a few of them:1. Turning RightResearch indicates that before a customer enters a shop, he usually looks at the left first but upon entering, turns right. Why? It happens because so many people are right-handed. Thus, retailers get their most high-priced and latest products on display to the right side so buyers are enjoined to purchase instantly.2. \"Buy One, Take One\" OffersConsumers are always enticed to obtain \"Buy One, Take One\" or bargain offers a result of the thought that they get value for their money. Retailers usually pair their not-so-saleable products with expensive ones to help make some profit out from the total transaction. Doing this will also ease them of inventories and provide them with space for their warehouses.3. Designer ClothesIf you are taking a closer inspection at the designer clothes from the stores, you'll see that these are cheaply-made clothes with designer labels in it. If you intend to buy designer clothes, these are typically for sale in their shops or their own store outlets in malls.4. Stimulating the SensesRetailers also knew the way to stimulate the peoples' senses. They play music that will invite customers to stay longer so they will be drawn to buy more in their stores. They also ensnare customers by using tempting scents that will make them hungry and look for something to eat. Based upon research, customers are drawn to buy products on tables and not those in shelves.5. Limited StocksRetailers post ads that invite visitors to get limited stocks of their products for a limited time. This sales technique of scarcity in stocks drags customers to purchase more thus, gaining them more profits.6. More Products at the CashierEach time a customer is ready paying for his purchases, there are many more available products at the cashier. These are small items that may catch his attention, thereby, tempting him to shop for more.How do we try to keep from purchasing a lot more than you'll need? Be sure to have a list of anything you'll need before entering a shop. Stick to the budget. As much as possible, you should pay in cash rather than on credit. Be quick in shopping because staying longer inside the store will entice you to buy more. When you constantly do this stuff, you may realize that you didn't only save your time but also money which can be used at some point.The Truly Rich Club encourages its members to save money and also be free from debt.
