He appealed to them to give him another chance,\" said a JD-U leader who accompanied Nitish Kumar on the door-to-door walk. Hundreds of JD-U leaders and workers accompanied Nitish Kumar during the campaign.\nState JD-U president Vashisht Narain Singh launched the campaign at the party office.\"JD-U's aim is to reach out to at least three to four crore voters through this campaign. Thousands of party workers and leaders, including ministers, members of parliament and legislators have been involved in knocking on people's doors to personally reach out to them,\" Vashisht Narain Singh said.\nThis door-to-door campaign is the brainchild of Prashant Kishore, an erstwhile key strategist of Narendra Modi during the last Lok Sabha polls. Last month, Nitish Kumar launched a high-tech 'Badh Chala Bihar' (Bihar moving forward) initiative to directly reach out to the masses and seek their ideas and suggestions for the state's development. That too was the brainchild of Prashant Kishore.\nBut the state Election Commission (EC) on Saturday suspended the 'Badh Chala Bihar' campaign after the Bharatiya Janata Party complained that it violated the Model Code of Conduct for the biennial elections to the state legislative council and misuse of government funds and resources.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T09:45:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
