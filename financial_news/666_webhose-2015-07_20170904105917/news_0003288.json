Jim Rice by Jason Clout Advisers are urging that any tax or policy changes to self managed superannuation funds be minimised in the future. Instead trustees should be allowed to properly plan for their retirement, they argue.\nThe revenue shortfall facing the country has led to proposals that the superannuation system may need to be amended to help address that fiscal problem.\nThat is creating uncertainty among SMSF members, who have been questioning whether superannuation will be the best way to provide for them later in life.\nHLB Mann Judd director Andrew Yee says SMSF clients are asking what the point of super is if the system keeps altering.\n\"SMSFs are a very useful product, but clients are asking 'Maybe I'm better off buying properties and negatively gearing them,' says Yee.\nThere is still a lot of dynamism in the SMSF market. The system continues to expand and there are increasing investment opportunities through services like the Australian Securities Exchange's mFund, which offers access to unlisted managed funds, which seems to have been embraced by SMSFs.\nBut those initiatives could be undermined if the policy framework around superannuation changes too rapidly or drastically.\nYee says there are a handful of areas where clients have raised concerns. They are worried about the future treatment of what is now tax-free income and what might happen to pensions after 60.\n Contributions to superannuation for those earning more than $300,000 are taxed at 30 per cent now. There are worries among clients that the threshold may be lowered or the rate increased, or both.\nSome proponents of the current superannuation say it will in time reduce the age pension burden on the federal budget because more people will be able to support themselves on the basis of their accumulated savings, including an SMSF if they have one. But it may take a few decades for that point to be reached.\nThe SMSF system is growing, according to RSM Bird Cameron director Brad Eppingstall. One of its own surveys found 53 per cent of respondents had an SMSF, up from 48 per cent a year ago.\nBut the overall SMSF system could be growing faster if there was more certainty around them and superannuation generally, says Eppingstall.\n\"Superannuation rules continue to be in flux in Australia and this is causing some dissatisfaction with the system. Constant changes and media reporting on potential changes have caused many Australians to lose confidence.\"\nIt was the fact that they could have more control over their investments which led many to start an SMSF, he says. That level of control and flexibility remain two of the most desirable features of an SMSF.\nBut many clients could become more cautious in the present environment, he says.\nOne initiative which seems to have secured good support from SMSFs is mFunds. It is an electronic processing service developed for investors, brokers and fund managers to improve the timeliness and efficiency for investing in managed funds.\nThat could over time help control costs, which in turn should help generate better returns for investors including those in SMSFs. It also should make diversifying portfolios easier and provide better transparency.\nThe mFund Settlement Service is online and fully integrated with CMC Stockbroking's online trading platform, says the director of stockbroking at CMC Markets, Andy Rogers.\nIts SMSF clients seem to have embraced the service, which enables them access to a range of funds in areas like domestic equities, international equities, fixed interest, property and infrastructure.\nAbout 15 per cent of its clients are SMSFs and there has been a disproportionate acceptance among those clients of mFunds, he says, highlighting that it seems to be meeting a need in the market.\nPerpetual Investments portfolio manager Vince Pezzullo says there is a lot of innovation going on for SMSFs.\n\"There is a lot more choice, which is a good thing, \" he says.\nBut Pezzullo says the question is whether SMSF trustees will be better off trying to select stocks themselves or using a professional manager.\n\"Our team of analysts will have around 1000 meetings with the management of companies this year. We stress-test those businesses, see how they behave under duress,\" he says.\nPerpetual also considers the medium-term outlook for that industry and how much is being reinvested in the company.\n\"It's not that an SMSF couldn't do those things; they can. But it's just that professional managers have the resources to do it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:55:34.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
