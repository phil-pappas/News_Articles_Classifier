The industry is in crisis, given imports from abroad, absence of any growth in the local market, and other domestic constraints including inadequate electricity and rail services and an unstable labour environment.\nGlobally, the steel industry is having a tough time as China ramps up its exports in response to falling domestic demand and stricter environmental controls.\nChina’s export volumes have jumped 73% over the past year and global steel prices that were already weak have fallen 7% since January. Steel makers have accused the Chinese of dumping.\nSA’s second-largest steel producer, Evraz Highveld, is in business rescue, while the largest, ArcelorMittal SA, has not made a profit for five years and has seen its share price lose 60% over the past year. Its CEO, Paul O’Flaherty, has described the local economy as dead, with no infrastructure spending going on that is needed to create demand for steel.\nThis tough environment was partly what prompted the summit, and organisers invited President Jacob Zuma and Cabinet ministers in the hope of getting a keynote speaker who could engage with the industry and its issues. Hardly anyone replied, indicating that perhaps this is not an industry the government takes seriously except to extract \"developmental\" pricing from it that some in the government believe would stimulate the development of a downstream metal products industry.\nFortunately, it seems, Mr Zuma is open to talking to the industry, at least to ArcelorMittal CEO Lakshmi Mittal, whom the Sunday Times reported has met with him. ArcelorMittal SA wants the government to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, and joined rivals in an application for protection.\nHowever, it is going a step further and offering in return to do a black economic empowerment (BEE) deal that would transfer some of its shares.\nThe government would do well to consider the offer seriously if it wants to sustain an industry that has been central to SA’s industrial development and continue to be a meaningful employer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T14:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T09:52:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
