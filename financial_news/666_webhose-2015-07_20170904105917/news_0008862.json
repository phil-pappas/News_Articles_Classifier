They were involved from 1 st January 2014 and the contract has been taken following their failure in all the systems. So the Minister of Finance had to intervene and bring in Webb Fontaine which had to now bring in what is called enhanced PAAR (Pre-Arrival Assessment Report) system. \n“There must be a transition plan because service providers have been operating for some time and you have to look at how you transfer the software and hardware they have been using. This is also because most of these soft-wares have to do with intellectual property rights whereby you have to go into a kind of franchise arrangement. So transition is necessary and if you don’t accommodate it in your programme, it would collapse because if you keep doing it as was done in Nigeria, the thing would collapse,” he advised. \nHe advanced his point outlining some key aspects of a transition plan necessary for successful implementation of a National Single Window Scheme. \n“A transition plan might not be more than 6 months depending on the country but first you must look at the integrity of the machines. Secondly, there must be a committee to look at the process and see if actually the handing-over is proper by looking at the scanning, the platform and all that. It is better to take over professionally rather than politically – you don’t rush to take over because there are tools you have never operated for some time” he concluded. \nMeanwhile, a government delegation from Ghana is set to embark on a fact-finding mission to Nigeria in August 2015 as part of the due-diligence process on West Blue, Trade and Industry Minister, Ekwow Spio Garbrah has revealed to JOY BUSINESS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T15:57:12.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
