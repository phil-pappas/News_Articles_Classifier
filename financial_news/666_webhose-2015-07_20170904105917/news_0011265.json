The good news is Australian business increasingly knows the importance of developing sustainable business strategies and they know it's just part of doing business,\" Griffiths says.\nAustralian consumers are a little more savvy about what companies are up to, irrespective of the federal government's relatively disengaged approach to sustainability and the environment.\nIn a highly connected world, consumers are more aware of a company's stance on issues such as climate change, recycling and diversity in the workplace, and there is a strong onus on companies to demonstrate their credentials in these areas.\nFor Griffiths, the challenge in Australia is to build more sustainable, innovative industries and unfortunately he sees us lagging in certain areas. A good example has been in the solar energy sector where companies head overseas with their intellectual property because investment conditions are more amenable internationally.\n'Significant benefits' \"There are significant benefits to be had in our advanced manufacturing industries but they have to ask themselves how far along the path do they want to travel.\n\"And for large companies, innovating to become more sustainable can be quite daunting. They have to wrestle with compliance issues that can be costly, and they need to look at the return on investment.\"\nMoreover, it's a move away from the culture of more – more productivity, more work, more profit – to something more innovative.\n\"It takes a mindset change in companies to see the value and be able to link sustainability to increased innovation and future business resilience,\" Griffiths says.\nBearing this in mind, Griffiths says it's vitally important that sustainability initiatives are driven from the top.\n\"We're already seeing boards playing a more active role and most of the top 100 organisations are across the issue but some are doing it better than others.\n\"The danger is if companies wrap all their sustainability policies in motherhood statements, this can raise the ire of NGOs who look for real action. Risk lies in no action or muted and non-transparent action.\n\"The leaders at the moment tend to get third-party accreditation and don't try to advertise their sustainable business practices too overtly.\"\nProactive in approach At present, Griffiths says banks such as ANZ and Westpac are rather proactive in their approach to creating sustainable businesses.\n\"Ironically, most of our large resource companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, tend to invest more in sustainability practices. They are companies dependent on the land – just as the agricultural and pastoral industries do as well – and understand the need to ensure their future.\n\"All these companies are looking at investments [that] make them more innovative in their operations.\n\"For example, in agriculture they might look at more innovative farming practices or they'll move away from areas unsuitable for certain farming.\"\nThe importance of sustainability goes beyond ensuring a better future for the planet. Griffiths says banks and insurance companies now look at company sustainability when they're weighing up new investment and insurance risks.\nIt's a huge growth area and while the federal government might be a laggard globally on a number of environmental and sustainability issues, Australian business needs to compete in a global market that is pushing the envelope on sustainability and we can't afford to fall too far behind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T01:00:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
