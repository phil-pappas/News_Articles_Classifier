Josh Robenstone SEEK group human resources director Meahan Callaghan said the new structure allowed staff to be more flexible with salary discussions.\n\"Your salary can change at any time, rather than bound by some crazy HR (human resources) calendar that has to happen in June.\"\nMs Callaghan said rather than setting a six monthly calendar for performance reviews, managers and employees were now expected to catch up regularly on a weekly or fortnightly basis.\n\"It is done on a needs basis. If they're struggling you may need to make it weekly. If they're going after a job, you may also need to move it weekly. We're saying fortnightly as a minimum, sitting down one-on-one with sole purpose of letting them know how they're doing.\"\n Executive remuneration In Australia, executive remuneration has to be approved by shareholders annually, a requirement which some remuneration experts say makes it \"impossible\" for executives to do away with annual performance reviews. However, Ms Callaghan could be more flexible because SEEK executives do not get bonus payments at all. Instead, their remuneration consists of base salary and long-term incentives in the form of the company shares.\nOver at LinkedIn, over 240 employees in Australia will be sticking with the current mix of informal performance conversation and bi-annual formal reviews, where employees will be measured on their budget and get a rating based on three criteria: leadership, leverage and results.\nManaging director Cliff Rosenberg said the company is constantly looking at the best options to measure performance and has not ruled out moving to an informal performance model depending on employee feedback.\n\"We're constantly looking at best practice and re-evaluating our options.\"\nOn top of the performance review the company used a system called Bravo to thank employees for contributions and provide points and comments within the professional network, Mr Rosenberg said.\nSmaller companies Smaller companies are also experimenting with new performance review structures for staff in customer-facing roles. Labour hire company First Contact replaced structured annual performance reviews with an employee-initiated review for its 180 reception and concierge employees . In addition, it uses a software known as Brownie Points which allows staff to get points from colleagues, managers and customers on the spot.\n\"We felt that performance reviews were forced and structured and employees weren't receptive. Conversations we have now are more natural and free flowing. It means you're having the conversation with the employees when they have something to say,\" chief executive Paul Schmeja said.\nBut the company could be more flexible with performance reviews because its staff are award-covered and do not typically get bonuses linked to their performance review outcomes, Mr Schmeja said.\nFor bankers and consultants, the end of performance review discussions was unlikely to spell the end of bonuses and salary rises, principal consultant of advisory firm Bendetta Jason White said. Instead, financial services firms were likely to rely on the tightly defined outcomes such as sales and client growth to determine incentive payments, Mr White said.\nNorton Rose Fulbright partner Sally Woodward said there would be no legal issues with replacing the formal review with informal structure, provided there was ongoing monitoring to make sure their performance is on track.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:08:05.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
