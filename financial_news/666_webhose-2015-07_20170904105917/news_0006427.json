To achieve this, there will be an increased investment in software licenses, specialised computer services, system advisers, and system development. \nNew analysis from Frost & Sullivan, ICT Spend in South Africa: Public Sector finds that the public sector saw an ICT spend of $615.9 million in 2014 and estimates this to reach $707.6 million in 2019. Managed services, combined with fixed and non-cellular connectivity, accounted for 73.1 percent of these investments.

Creating a fully digital government is challenged by: \nLegacy systems necessitating upgradesLimited infrastructure investment to connect all public sector buildingsLack of a coordinated plan to enforce ICT standards and ensure interoperability within national and provincial departmentsSecurity concerns surrounding shared and cloud computing servicesShortage of skilled resourcesLimited Internet reach and citizen access to online content, preventing two-way interaction with the government \n\"Defining clear roles for ICT agencies and building partnerships with the private sector will be crucial to this endeavour,\" noted Govan-Vassen. \"The breadth of knowledge and expertise that the private sector can bring on board will complement the government's commitment to strengthen ICT integration and accelerate digitisation in the South African public sector.\" \nICT Spend in South Africa: Public Sector is part of the Connected Industries Growth Partnership Service program.
