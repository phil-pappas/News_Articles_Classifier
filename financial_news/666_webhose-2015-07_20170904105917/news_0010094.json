A report has found it would deliver $2.5 billion in economic benefits. Alex Ellinghausen by Simon Evans South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill wants to shift the state's time zone forward by 30 minutes to fall into line with the eastern states by as early as April 2017, in a move that is strenuously backed by the business community.\nMr Weatherill is convinced of the economic benefits which modelling shows could reach $2.5 billion. He said the annoying 30-minute time difference inconvenienced business and harmed the state's reputation.\n\"I don't want to be a backwater,\" Mr Weatherill said. \"I want to be where the action is.\"\nBusiness leaders are right behind him. Tim Cooper, managing director of Coopers Brewery, said the 30-minute difference needed to go.\n\"It's a bit of an anomaly. We are a bit of a laughing stock by having it in place,\" he said.\nMr Cooper said as technology advanced, it was important to be closely aligned with Sydney and Melbourne for teleconferences and videoconferences, and it would help the state to snare more work in administration for national companies.\nNigel McBride, chief executive of Business SA, the body that oversees the interests of the business sector, said a change would alter perceptions.\n\"Are we open for business? There's a compelling argument on perceptions,\" he said.\n The 30-minute difference came about in the late 1890s when influential people in commerce successfully agitated for a shift to narrow what was originally a one-hour gap with the eastern states. \"It's time to finish the job,\" Mr McBride said.\nMr Weatherill said he was tired of what he called \"smart Alecs\" having potshots about going back in time when they arrived in the state or were doing business from outside.\n\"Putting aside the dollars and cents, [there's] a reputational benefit,\" he said.\nHe said Parliament would need to change the law and there would be further consultation with communities on the west coast of the state, and with international airlines.\nHe acknowledged there was still more work to be done, but \"it's certainly my preference\" to make the change.\nSome communities in the west of the state are worried that children will be going to school in the dark. Sunrise in the town of Ceduna, the closest big town to the Western Australian border, is at 8.06am in July.\nMr Weatherill aims to coincide the change with people switching their clocks for daylight saving.\nThis would most likely be in April, with the earliest practical time being April 2017, because many international flights are already booked up to April 2016 and it would cause problems with flight scheduling.\nNuclear industry He said many local businesses had Sydney and Melbourne as their main markets. \"It does create confusion,\" he said.\nThe South Australian government received 2000 submissions in a process that it began earlier this year to test the appetite for change.\nA report by the South Australian Centre for Economic Studies found the time change could deliver an estimated $2.5 billion in net economic benefits.\nSouth Australian Liberal leader Steven Marshall said there needed to be much more detailed modelling of the economic benefits before the next steps were taken.\nThe likely shift in time zone is one of several measures being closely scrutinised by Mr Weatherill and his government to try to fire up economic growth in a state that has the highest unemployment rate in Australia. Those measures include the potential establishment of a nuclear industry.\nRoyal commissioner Kevin Scarce is part-way through the hearings before his final report in May 2016 which is looking at whether the state should expand into nuclear enrichment, waste storage and nuclear power, from just being a miner of uranium.\nSouth Australia also made the radical decision in its budget in June to remove stamp duty on commercial and industrial property transactions completely by mid-2018, with a phased reduction starting in mid-2016.\nThe state faces heavy job losses from the closure of the car manufacturing industry, with General Motors-Holden set to close its factories by 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T11:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:49:44.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
