I used to see it on the Gold Coast, I actually reported it to council.”\nWayne Tseng has founded the Chinese Chamber of Property Investors. Source: Supplied\nMr Tseng said members of the community felt “frustrated” at the current debate around foreign investment and accusations that they were responsible for rising property prices, and that their voices weren’t being heard.\n“A lot of the ruling public sentiment is that [Chinese] are the ones pushing up prices, but in all honesty it’s only in defined pockets,” he said.\n“What we do know is they are purchasing new developments, and their investment funds these developments, and the stamp duty that gets charged off each purchase goes to fund infrastructure.\n“In a way they do feel a bit frustrated that they don’t have a voice.”\nIt comes as a new report by Propell National Valuers rejected the “urban legend” that foreign purchasers were responsible for the runaway growth in house prices.\nAccording to Propell’s head of research Linda Phillips, foreign buyers target specific property ranges, mostly inner-city apartments and expensive properties in Sydney and Melbourne, with Brisbane also starting to attract some interest.\nIn those specific markets, Propell found foreign buyers had added around 5 per cent to values of prestige property in preferred suburbs only.\n“If price increases were mainly the result of foreign buyer interest, then we would have expected Melbourne prices to increase at a rate closer to that of Sydney,” the report said.\n“The fact that Sydney prices have increased at double the rate of Melbourne shows that most of the increase is due to the imbalance between supply and demand in Sydney.’’\nMr Tseng said the not-for-profit group employed three full-time people to direct investors to trusted conveyancers, advisers and real estate agents, and organised workshops and education seminars. It was also lobbying for better communication with the Foreign Investment Review Board.\n“The various new rulings passed on by the FIRB are not well communicated to the Chinese community,” he said. “There needs to be a simple information dispatch. Currently there isn’t a central point where they can get information and ask simple questions about their eligibility.\n“This is very dangerous.”\nfrank.chung@news.com.au\n ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/chinese-buyers-frustrated-at-property-myths-from-australian-lobby-group/story-fndban6l-1227462382838?sv=846bbb521ee4941e00ec636f987228d9&title=Chinese+buyers+%26%238216%3Bfrustrated%26%238217%3B+at+myths", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/chinese-buyers-frustrated-at-property-myths-from-australian-lobby-group/story-fndban6l-1227462382838?sv=846bbb521ee4941e00ec636f987228d9&title=Chinese+buyers+%26%238216%3Bfrustrated%26%238217%3B+at+myths", "http://www.chineseinvestors.com.au/", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Chinese+buyers+%26%238216%3Bfrustrated%26%238217%3B+at+myths&c=CHINESE+property+investors+are+frustrated+at+the+current+debate+around+foreign+investment+and+sick+of+being+blamed+for+rising+prices.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/chinese-buyers-frustrated-at-property-myths-from-australian-lobby-group/story-fndban6l-1227462382838?sv=846bbb521ee4941e00ec636f987228d9", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/chinese-buyers-frustrated-at-property-myths-from-australian-lobby-group/story-fndban6l-1227462382838?sv=846bbb521ee4941e00ec636f987228d9", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/chinese-buyers-frustrated-at-property-myths-from-australian-lobby-group/story-fndban6l-1227462382838?sv=846bbb521ee4941e00ec636f987228d9", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/chinese-buyers-frustrated-at-property-myths-from-australian-lobby-group/story-fndban6l-1227462382838?sv=846bbb521ee4941e00ec636f987228d9&h=Chinese+buyers+%26%238216%3Bfrustrated%26%238217%3B+at+myths"], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T15:20:04.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
