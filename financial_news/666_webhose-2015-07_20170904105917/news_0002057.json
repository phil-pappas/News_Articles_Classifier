The future now should see decisive steps on further integration,\" he told a news conference.\nDraghi was responding to questions about whether Germany raising the issue of Greece taking a time-out from the euro zone had weakened the bloc.\n\"Discussion doesn't necessarily weaken,\" he said.\nSince taking the helm at the height of the euro zone debt crisis in 2011, Draghi had repeatedly said that he considered the euro \"irreversible\", meaning that he believed that no country would be ever allowed to leave or fall out the currency union.
