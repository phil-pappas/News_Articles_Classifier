Brazil's currency, the real started the day lower against the dollar, crossing the 3.40 level for the first time in over 12 years. S&P in the early afternoon affirmed Brazil's credit rating of BBB-minus, the agency's lowest investment grade rating, and revised the outlook on that rating to negative from stable, signaling a downgrade is possible over the next 12 to 18 months. S&P's announcement drove the currency as low as 3.43 per dollar before it recovered losses shortly thereafter to trade at the 3.40 level. \"Most of the market was expecting something like this,\" said Pedro Tuesta, an economist with 4Cast in Washington D.C. \"The only surprise was that it was S&P and not Moody's.\" Other analysts corroborated that view, saying the initial move was a knee-jerk reaction. Most remain on the lookout for a possible downgrade of Brazil to junk by Moody's Investor Service. The real has lost nearly 22 percent against the dollar this year as investors fret over mounting inflation, economic recession, weaker demand for commodities and political turbulence. Equities saw smaller moves. Brazil's Bovespa stock index remained in positive territory throughout the session, supported by preferred shares of mining giant Vale SA , which gained about 6 percent on higher prices for iron ore .IO62-CNI=SI. Traders said the Bovespa was also rising on bargain-hunting, snapping the index's seven-day 8.2 percent slump. Yields on Brazilian interest rate futures <0#DIJ:> rose sharply on the long end of the curve after the S&P announcement. \"The market is now operating at price levels corresponding with a downgrade to junk,\" said Bruno Gon√ßalves, an analyst at the Alpes brokerage in Sao Paulo. Financial markets were little-changed across the rest of Latin America.
