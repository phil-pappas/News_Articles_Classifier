Five years after Dodd-Frank was passed, the business-friendly American Action Forum finds it has led to $24 billion in compliance costs and 61 million paperwork hours. Financial regulators have passed 456 final rules stemming from Dodd-Frank, the study found. But the implementation of Dodd-Frank is an on-going process. The study also found there are about $7.8 billion worth of pending rules in the regulatory pipeline that could raise the total costs. Past: 1 day Trump tops national poll for...
