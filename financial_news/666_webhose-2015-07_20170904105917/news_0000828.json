Not much to think about as you look over the vast green fields, but your mind wonders onto pest control. Various media has played a part in the warning against the use of pesticides , but it doesn’t seem to hit home until you actually stop and stand beside the fields of rice, soy, and milo (Grain Sorghum). Seeing the irrigation ditches running through the fields filled with water . \nA small aircraft is seen in the distance spraying the fields. Immediately, the thought of looking for some type of mask to wrap around your face quickly becomes a priority. Looking at the birds sitting on the electric lines all of a sudden becomes a worry. They certainly can’t open their car door to look for a filter to put over their beak to protect them from breathing in the poison . Also, the birds have to drink in the nearby water spots and ditches, what’s in the water? A recent discussion from one of many sustainable groups comes to mind by James Ehlers of the ASBC (American Sustainable Business Council, www.asbcouncil.org ). He asks the question, what good is it if we \"feed\" the world and in the process poison her waters? Then the question, what about Atlanta water? What's her poison? \nAtlanta has continued to focus on cleaning up the Chattahoochee since the 1990’s, its main drinking water source. The question remains, what is still going into the water and what are the new concerns? In comparison with the Midwest, Atlanta may not have aircraft dropping hundreds of pounds of pesticide over hundreds of acres holding various crops, but we have other challenges. The disposable wipes flushed down the toilets, which www.atlantawatershed.org has to remind our citizens not to do. \nNot only are the wipes a nuisance to the sewer authority, the chemicals manufactured into the wipes are for external use only. Flushing them into the local sewer system to then eventually make it back into our drinking water, exposes the chemicals to the general public. The wipes are reported to include cancer-causing properties. Although these chemicals have been removed from the baby wipes, other types of wipes leave older children and adults at risk ( http://kstp.com/article/stories/s3846985.shtml ). \nNot only are their human concerns, but physical damage to take into consideration. New York City reported that it has spent over $18M on flushable wipe related problems ( http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/04/04/flushable-wipes.aspx ). Atlanta has not reported a dollar amount focused on wipe related problems, but it will eventually have to deal with these types of issues if the campaign “do not flush” does not become stronger. Other cities such as London, England had to spend a large sum in 2013 to remove a disposable wipe blockage weighing 15 tons. \nAlong with pesticides, prescription drugs have been a concern in relation to drinking water for many years. Today, many local pharmacies now participate in the reclamation of old or unused prescriptions in order to reduce the amount getting into the local water systems. The new and immediate concern along with the pesticide and prescription alerts is the need for a dominant campaign on the appropriate disposal of convenient-wipes. \nBaby, sanitizing, cleaning, polishing, and automobile wipes. Every type of product, it seems, is trying to produce a handy-wipe to lessen the workload of the user for the promotion of their product. Again, convenience is putting a chemical load on the watershed system leading right back to living organic matter, such as animals and mankind. \nYes, we are poisoning the water all in the name of convenience!
