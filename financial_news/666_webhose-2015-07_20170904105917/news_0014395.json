Share on twitter by Kate Cowling Fancy a $10 million self-managed super fund (SMSF)? Your chances of getting there are slim, with changes to law making it near-impossible for DIY savers to reach those lofty heights, experts say.\nAccording to the Australian Tax Office, 22,000 Australians have 'uber SMSFs' with balances above $10 million, but Michael Hallinan, special counsel at Townsends Business & Corporate Lawyers, said that's a \"legacy issue\" that's been corrected by newer limits.\nAs a result, there's no point in capping tax-free earnings in the pension phase, given that the problem it's intended to correct has already gone away, he added.\nHallinan said it was \"very unlikely\" investors could use their DIY vehicles to build up large wealth reserves, due to current limits on how much can be put into super without attracting tax.\nA measure was also introduced in 2012 to cut down on high super contributions by taxing those with more than $300,000 on their additional top ups, he said. At the time, the change was said to affect around 1 per cent of super savers.\n\"The main point is the attention focusing on very large balances is distorted, because most people don't have very large balances at all,\" he said.\n\"Uber SMSFs ($10m plus in asset value) became uber as a result of the pre-July 2007 system. The problem arose when there were no limits on the amount of money going in, but there were limits on how much you could take out on a concessional basis,\" he added.\nHallinan estimated a person who put as much into super as the system allows over 40 years would end up with $8.2 million.\n However, the chance of that happening is very unlikely, he said, as you would rarely see a 25-year-old who could put $205,500 each year into super.\nThe SMSF Association's technical director Graeme Colley, who last month pointed out that the system as it stands could theoretically allow a 25-year-olds to build up a $6 million super balance, agreed it's an out of reach benchmark.\nEven young people with time to save and invest would struggle to hit $10 million, unless they exposed themselves to a high degree of risk, he said.\n\"To reach a figure like $10 million a person who could contribute the maximum, assuming that remained in the long term, would have to take very high levels of risk or have been able to use the CGT small business concessions or structured settlement amounts to increase the amount in the fund,\" he said.\n\"The use of the CGT concessions and structured settlements are relatively rare in relation to the total numbers of SMSFs and overall fund members.\n\"It would therefore be up to a fund member exposing their superannuation balance to high levels of risk which may reach the $10 million figure but it is possible their benefit may decrease substantially due to risk, especially in the short term.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kate_cowling"], "published": "2015-07-02T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T14:04:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
