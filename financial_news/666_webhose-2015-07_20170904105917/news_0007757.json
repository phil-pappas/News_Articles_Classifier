The loans will be underwritten and funded by Marlin Business Bank – a state-chartered, federally insured commercial bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System. “We are excited to lend to a segment that has been greatly underserved by traditional lenders that have not focused on loans of this size to small and medium-sized businesses,” said Daniel Dyer, Marlin’s co-founder and CEO. “Our strategy and culture is to partner with small businesses – to whom we have lent over $4 billion since our inception in 1997 – in order to help them grow.” FundingStream.com makes applying for a loan convenient, quick and easy for small business owners. Customers can access the short, simple loan application via a computer, mobile device or tablet. The entire process takes less than 10 minutes on average, with loan decisions in as little as two hours and funding in as little as two days. Loans range from $5,000 to $100,000 with repayment terms of six to 24 months. “Over the past two decades, we have amassed deep experience in underwriting equipment lease financing to more than 300,000 small and mid-sized businesses, and we understand their needs,” said Dyer. “FundingStream.com leverages all of our strengths to the benefit of small businesses in new ways by offering a convenient working capital loan solution.” Funding Stream loans can be used for anything a business needs to grow, from business expansion and purchasing inventory to upgrading equipment and marketing, or simply as working capital.
