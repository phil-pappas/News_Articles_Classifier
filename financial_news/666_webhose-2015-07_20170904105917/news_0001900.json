She had said the meeting was to understand the broader context of e-commerce and whether FDI in the sector is affecting the level-playing field of the brick and mortar stores.\n\nAt present, 100 per cent foreign direct investment is allowed only in business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce and not in the retail segment.\n\nGlobal retail giants, including Amazon, and the domestic industry want the government to relax the foreign investment norms in the e-commerce space.\n\nFurther on July 15, the minister has called a meeting with the states on the issue.\n\nThe ministry has written a letter to all Chief Ministers requesting them to nominate the concerned minister on the matter to participate in the meeting.\n\nGlobal players are looking at India because the country is one of the fastest-growing markets in Asia-Pacific, along with China. Rise in Internet penetration, adoption of smartphones and lower data rates are completely changing the way India shops.\n\nAccording to estimates, the sector's market size in the country is at around USD 5 billion annually. Analysts said online shopping is expanding at a massive rate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T16:38:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
