Share on twitter by Karen Maley PayPal boss Dan Schulman will ring the Nasdaq stock market's opening bell today in celebration of his company's return to being an independent, publicly traded company.\nBut the PayPal of today is a hugely changed animal to the business that formerly traded under the PYPL symbol. Although the online specialist payment system survived the dotcom crash, and was listed in 2002, it was a struggling enterprise when it was acquired by eBay a few months later for the rock-bottom price of $US1.5 ($2) billion.\nAs it turned out, the backing of the online auction site transformed PayPal's fortunes. eBay used PayPal for its transactions, while PayPal was able to tap into a vast network of merchants and consumers.\nThis allowed the small Palo Alto small start-up to transform itself into financial giant, with 165 million active customers and a presence in 200 markets.\nBut now PayPal and eBay are going their separate ways. On Friday, eBay shareholders received one PayPal share for every eBay share they own.\nBased on pre-market trading, PayPal is expected to start off with a market capitalisation of around $US45 billion, compared with eBay's market capitalisation of around $US80 before the split.\nThat's enough to elevate PayPal into the elite of the global \"fintech\" firms - those businesses based on the fusion of finance and technology that are transforming the world of commerce.\nInvestors enthusiastic It's little wonder that investors are enthusiastic about PayPal. In the first quarter of 2015, PayPal's revenue for the first time exceeded that of its parent Ebay. In the second quarter, PayPal's revenue grew 16 per cent to $2.3 billion, or 52 per cent of the group's total earnings.\nWhat's more, for the rest of the year, PayPal's earnings are expected to increase by 15 to 18 per cent, whereas the eBay online auction business is forecast to have a much more modest 3 to 5 per cent lift in its earnings.\neBay announced its plans to spin off its PayPal business in September last year, after initially resisting the determined campaign that was run by Carl Icahn , the billionaire activist hedge fund investor\nIcahn argued that PayPal was being penalised by its close tie to eBay, because this prevented the online payment site from forming alliances with powerful competitors such as Amazon and Alibaba.\nAnd the synergies of keeping the two businesses together didn't make up for this handicap, because only around one-fifth of the payments processed by PayPal are tied to eBay transactions.\nBut with PayPal now formally split from eBay , and with former American Express executive Schulman at the helm, the company is gearing up for a fight as it tries to maintain its dominant position in the fiercely competitive online payments sector.\nMoney for acquisitions Schulman starts with some considerable advantages, including a $US6 billion war chest that is a legacy of the split with its parent.\nThe PayPal boss has left little doubt that he intends to use this kitty on acquisitions. The company has already spent close to $US1 billion to purchase Xoom , an international money transfer system.\nThe challenge for Paypal is that it exists in a fiercely competitive universe where new technology is constantly being developed. While no one knows exactly which app is about to revolutionise the online financial world, PayPal's challenge is to ensure it doesn't miss out on the next big trend.\nPayPal has already succeeded in moving into the mobile payments solution through its 2013 acquisition of Braintree , which boasts Uber and Airbnb as clients.\nBut some analysts question whether PayPal will be able to compete with cashed-up and aggressive rivals such as Apple, Google and Alibaba. Already Apple has unveiled a new mobile payment system, Apple Pay that is expected to provide fierce competition.\nSome, including Icahn, who owns a 4 per cent stake in the company, believe that a newly independent PayPal could be a target for larger companies wanting to stake out a position in online commerce.\nIn a blog posted last year welcoming eBay's decision to hive off PayPal, Icahn wrote that he believed that \"the payments industry, of which PayPal is an important part, must be consolidated â€“ either through acquisitions made by PayPal or a merger between PayPal and another strong player in the industry\".", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&sqi=2&ved=0CD8QFjADahUKEwjswIbNpejGAhVBp5QKHe8bAR4&url=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F392515%2Fin-its-breakup-with-ebay-paypal-is-coming-out-on-top%2F&ei=bSusVazWBsHO0gTvt4TwAQ&usg=AFQjCNElouAFM2_Mz2kJhZ9cZskYqsWfLA&sig2=Dq4J-76ZZViHO4hR0eSpsg&bvm=bv.98197061,d.dGY", "https://twitter.com/KarenMaley", "https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB0QFjAAahUKEwjStZiKpujGAhVEppQKHd-CD84&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-pay%2F&ei=7SusVZKLFMTM0gTfhb7wDA&usg=AFQjCNHzohynWi6gJnDwL0Kvk52vtgNpOQ&sig2=R3oWNSydEnRpaOYJCqxeCg&bvm=bv.98197061,d.dGY", "https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CC0QFjACahUKEwjV-47jpejGAhVGkpQKHRn9ARs&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fdanschulmanaxp&ei=myusVZXCF8ak0gSZ-ofYAQ&usg=AFQjCNH9kJCgc6iEx2B9EwJ3cdPNjtCzXQ&sig2=7vdxiqkiMBj5aOuXEOPxgA&bvm=bv.98197061,d.dGY", "https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQFjAAahUKEwiruaKlpejGAhXLFZQKHVRADcQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fryanmac%2F2015%2F07%2F01%2Fpaypal-acquires-digital-money-transfer-company-xoom-before-ebay-split%2F&ei=GSusVevIKcur0ATUgLWgDA&usg=AFQjCNEuQU-xAZsZsUBu3tvOG-c1ujae_g&sig2=BuMmQgrLhSid65Qf20xzUA&bvm=bv.98197061,d.dGY", "https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDUQFjADahUKEwiBltegpujGAhXIG5QKHQhiAm0&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fcarl_c_icahn&ei=HCysVYGYHsi30ASIxInoBg&usg=AFQjCNHU60_HkuJVBbD-CuIzzhqdd2CxRg&sig2=f00rjdPfXF6WCij_Yry5bw&bvm=bv.98197061,d.dGY", "https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDEQFjAAahUKEwiDmbL6pejGAhXBKZQKHSCRCqM&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.braintreepayments.com%2F&ei=zCusVYODDMHT0ASgoqqYCg&usg=AFQjCNF6NvJvRc6fRabooXKcJ7YwCvT8Lw&sig2=NiLgcezApRvBOo9PAxqFaA&bvm=bv.98197061,d.dGY"], "published": "2015-07-20T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T04:05:10.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
