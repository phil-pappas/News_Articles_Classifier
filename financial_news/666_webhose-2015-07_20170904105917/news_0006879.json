The stock was little changed at $26.04 at the close in New York.\nThe company recorded refinancing costs of $17.6 million, Chief Financial Officer Richard B. Hare said Monday in a statement. Excluding those costs and some other items, Carmike reported earnings of 36 cents a share. Analysts were projecting 54 cents.\nRevenue rose 20 percent to $219.1 million, a reflection of higher admission prices, more screens and a strong slate of pictures from Hollywood. That missed the $219.9 million average of seven analysts’ estimates.\nColumbus, Georgia-based Carmike reported a second-quarter net loss of $1.45 million, or 6 cents a share.\n(Carmike plans a conference call at 5 p.m. New York time.
