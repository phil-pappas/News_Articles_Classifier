Matt Dunham by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Lloyds Bank will be the laughing stock of the distressed debt world if it keeps fumbling and bumbling around with its $100 million-odd loan to Queensland's Wiggins Island Coal Export Terminal.\nWhile no one questions the British bank's ability to write loans and offload performing loan books or business units, it's showing little sign of the finesse required to pull off a distressed debt trade.\nIt is understood Lloyds has engaged with distressed debt funds over the past week and even started the process of signing the hedge funds to confidentiality agreements.\nAll signs point to a traditional auction or jump-ball process. As one source said: \"A bank like Lloyds doesn't run around the market making these noises without the full intention of doing something.\"\nThere were no official sale instructions by late Thursday. Sources said the auction could be run by Lloyds and out of the bank's London office on Friday night. However, bidders were awaiting more information.\nOne wonders whether Lloyds has had a change of heart since engaging with potential buyers.\nSurely it would have come under some pressure since Street Talk revealed its sale intentions on Wednesday. Perhaps WICET's largest stakeholder Glencore, which owns 40.4 per cent of the port's class A shares, has made a phone call.\nOr even Australia's own Wesfarmers, the other $45 billion gorilla among the take-or-pay miners and shareholders, or ANZ Banking Group, which organised – and was awarded for – WICET's complex project finance deal in 2012.\n Street Talk also understands there is at least one other bank considering a sale. While there are three things drawing distressed debt funds to WICET (size, coal and legal jurisdiction), it's uncertain whether there is a buyer big enough to mop up multiple sellers and ensure future auctions don't become a race to the bottom.\nAs for price, traders expect buyers and sellers to match in the \"low-80s\". It would imply a high single-digit return for investors should WICET meet its repayments on time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:11:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
