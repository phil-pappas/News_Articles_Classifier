Meanwhile, prices elsewhere are still falling, and homes in areas such as Buffalo and St. Louis are undervalued, the analysts wrote.\n“The broad national indexes are skewed by high prices in a small number of large markets,” Goldman Sachs economists Zach Pandl and Hui Shan wrote. “While there appears to be some evidence of regional froth, in our view the broader national picture is one of leaders and laggards, with strong rebounds in some markets but still-soft prices in many others.”\nIn the first quarter, most metropolitan statistical areas tracked by Goldman had undervalued properties. There were 202 housing markets that were undervalued by at least 1%, compared with 140 markets that were overvalued by at least 1%.\n“Large cities drag up the national indexes, even if real estate markets in many smaller [metropolitan areas] have yet to fully recover,” Goldman analysts wrote.\nAnalysts looked at valuation in several ways. They compared home prices to gauges of consumer inflation, rent, income and population.\nRead more: Rent inflation shows no signs of letting up\nGoldman Sachs Most metropolitan statistical areas tracked by Goldman have undervalued homes. Interest among would-be borrowers in buying a home recently hit a two-year high. Even as home prices have grown, a strengthening U.S. jobs market and still-low interest rates are supporting sales. In hot markets, low inventory is driving prices higher.\nThere are benefits and disadvantages to rising home prices. Higher prices help struggling homeowners gain equity, sell their home and firm up their personal finances. But prices that run higher too quickly mean that families, especially younger households, can’t afford to buy a home.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T20:17:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
