Major investors Baillie Gifford and Setanta Asset Management see that offer as inadequate. \nENOC's majority stake in Dragon Oil would allow it to vote against any proposal to pay dividends at the company's annual general meeting. \nFirst Energy analyst Stephane Foucaud said ENOC's statement could be part of a strategy to convince hesitant shareholders to accept its offer. \nThe takeover would help downstream-focused ENOC become a fully-integrated global oil and gas company. \nDubai-based ENOC also said Dragon Oil's capital expenditure budget of $700 million would not be enough to deal with the operational challenges that it expects Dragon Oil to face. \nDragon Oil, which produces oil from the Cheleken field in Turkmenistan, targets production of 100,000 barrels of oil per day over the next five years. ENOC said it would lower that target to about 90,000 barrels. \nDragon Oil declined to comment, while Baillie Gifford said its stance remained unchanged. \nThe company's shares were trading marginally higher at 726 pence on Thursday morning.
