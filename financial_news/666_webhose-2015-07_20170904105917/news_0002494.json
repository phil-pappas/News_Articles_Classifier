Jon Reid Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Former independent member for New England, Tony Windsor says he is considering a return to politics to fight Deputy Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce for his seat, motivated by the Coalition government's approval of the Shenhua mine.\nThe conditional approval of the contentious Shenhua Watermark coal mine by Environment minister Greg Hunt led to a hot-blooded outburst of political tension on Wednesday night.\nMr Joyce hit out at his coalition colleagues, and said the decision was a sign of a \"world gone mad\".\n\"I've never supported the Shenhua mine. I think it is ridiculous that you would have a major mine in the midst of Australia's best agricultural land,\" Mr Joyce said.\nBarnaby Joyce takes to Facebook to expre Shenhua mine approval screenshot Liverpool Plains farmer and fierce opponent of the mine, Tim Duddy, announced the pastoral opposition was now \"at war\" with the minister over the decision.\n\"Disaster today as incompetent minister signs off [on] Shenhua. Does not understand difference between water take and interception. We're at war,\" he said on Twitter .\nMore anger was directed at Mr Joyce, with Labor's agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, saying he should reconsider his frontbench position after failing to prevent the mine's approval and NSW Greens MP and mining spokesman Jeremy Buckingham saying he was \"useless\".\n\"Putting a coal mine in the middle of your best farm land is like putting a toilet in the middle of your kitchen,\" Mr Buckingham said.\n Mr Windsor stepped down from representing New England in 2013 for health and family reasons, allowing Barnaby Joyce and the Nationals to take the seat by an over 14 per cent margin.\nMr Windsor has described the Shenhua approval as an \"atrocious decision\".\n\"I am considering it. I have not made a firm decision one way or another. I've found since I have left politics I'm still very interested in it.\n\"The approval of the Shenhua mine yesterday was a definitely a tick in the positive box, in a sense that I would re-considering reentering,\" he said.\nMr Windsor said the mine was against \"the heart of agriculture\", and would have disastrous impacts on local groundwater water.\nMr Windsor also accused Mr Joyce of false political outrage in opposing the mine publicly, while deferring to the government's position.\n\"That is a nonsense that he did everything he could. In fact he stood by,\" he said.\nMr Joyce hit back, saying NSW Labor government was to blame for granting Shenhua Watermark the $300 million exploration licence. He said he would continue to lobby the NSW Premier not to give final approval.\nMr Hunt has rejected the claim the mine would damage local water, saying there would also be strict conditions to protect the black soil of the Liverpool plain.\n\"The groundwater modelling for the project is robust and ... actual ground water impacts are likely to be smaller than previous conservative predictions,\" he said.\nGreg Evans, Executive Director of Coal at the Minerals Council of Australia, welcomed the approval, saying it was subject to strict conditions and based on independent advice.\nMr Joyce cancelled an joint media conference with the Prime Minister on Thursday, due to a scheduling clash. Speaking in Grafton, Mr Abbott defended the outburst.\n\"As a local Member you've got to give voice to the feelings of your constituents while at the same time being a loyal member of the Government,\" he said.\nThe approval is the 15th of 17 steps needed for the mine to proceed, according to Mr Joyce and Mr Hunt.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-07-09T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:58:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
