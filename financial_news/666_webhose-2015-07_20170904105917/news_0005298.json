Officials at the consumer regulator have been eyeing servicers, which are typically borrowers’ main point of contact when repaying their student loans, over the past several months, citing complaints from borrowers, who claim servicers aren’t doing enough to help them avoid falling behind on their payments or defaulting on their loans. \n“There have been few regulators, if any, that have focused on servicing and collection so I think it’s important that the CFPB shows that it’s willing to take action,” said Deanne Loonin, the director of the student loan borrower’s assistance project at the National Consumer Law Center, a consumer advocacy group. “We want to see more oversight and public enforcement and that’s why this is a good sign that hopefully there’s more to come.” \nThe CFPB issued a call out earlier this year for suggestions from stakeholders on how servicers can improve the borrower experience, the findings of which could influence any proposed CFPB regulations on the matter. Coming on the heels of that request, “this makes the case for changes and shows the harm to borrowers in the current environment,” said Ben Miller, the senior director for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress. \nEven loans originated by the federal government, which make up the bulk of the country’s student loan portfolio, are managed by servicers. \nThe CFPB’s action against Discover DFS, -0.24% and its student loan affiliates, The Student Loan Corp. and Discover Products Inc., is over how the company handled a portfolio of 800,000 private loans it acquired from Citibank C, +1.73% in 2010. Private student loan borrowers face particular challenges with servicers in part because the terms of the loan are typically much less flexible than their federal loans, which offer protections like the ability to make payments based on a borrower’s income, said Loonin. \nA lack of basic customer service protections also appears to be a “pervasive” problem for borrowers with private student loans, Loonin said. The CFPB’s claims against Discover fall in this category. Borrowers who were just starting to pay their loans got bills from Discover with minimum payments that were too high, according to the CFPB. The company also failed to provide borrowers with the paperwork they needed to qualify for a tax deduction on the interest paid on their student loans, the enforcement action claims. \nIn addition, Discover representatives engaged in illegal debt collection practices, calling borrowers a total of 150,000 times between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m. \n“Discover created student debt stress for borrowers by inflating their bills and misleading them about important benefits,” Richard Cordray, the director of the CFPB said in a statement announcing the enforcement action. “Illegal servicing and debt collection practices add insult to injury for borrowers struggling to pay back their loans.” \nUnder the terms of the agreement with the CFPB, Discover will pay $16 million to more than 100,000 affected borrowers and will also pay $2.5 million to the CFPB’s civil penalty fund. A representative from the company declined to comment on the CFPB’s action. Discover neither admitted or denied wrongdoing as part of the deal.
