Chris Pearce Share on twitter by Christopher Joye The $32.5 billion question investors have been debating over the past week has been what exactly the regulator meant when it declared on July 13 that \"the Australian major banks are likely to need to increase their capital ratios by at least 200 basis points … to be comfortably positioned in the fourth quartile over the medium to long term\".\nThe answer determines whether we get tens of billions of dollars of equity, hybrid and/or debt issues and whether crucial credit ratings on major bank securities are upgraded by Standard & Poor's and result in a fundamental re-rating of the banks' assessed risks.\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) reaffirmed its focus on this objective on Monday when it announced it had decided to boost the average \"risk weight\" applied to the majors' home loans from 16 per cent to \"at least\" 25 per cent by July 1, 2016, which APRA says necessitates an extra 80 basis points of capital.\nNoting that this was only an \"interim measure\" that may become more punitive under the yet-to-be-resolved banking rules known as Basel 4, APRA also clarified that the 80 basis points would contribute to cutting the overall capital shortfall of \"at least\" 200 basis points.\nThe sharpest analysts landed on the view that APRA was referring to 200 basis points of \"Common Equity Tier 1\" (CET1) capital, which is made up of real \"going-concern\" equity (e.g., shares). It's also possible APRA will permit a bit of Tier 1 capital, which includes \"hybrids\", or \"Additional Tier 1\" (AT1) capital instruments, which are perpetual equity securities like CBA's Perls VII (ASX: CBAPD).\nAn investment bank, one optimistic major banker and stockbrokers argued APRA would allow the big four to meet the 200 basis points through a combination of AT1 hybrids and subordinated debt, which are much cheaper than true equity and don't reduce real leverage. This also has the convenient consequence of mitigating any dilution of the majors' world-beating returns on equity, which are attributable to their unusually high leverage.\nS&P not sure what APRA meant When S&P published a report on Monday with the headline \"Higher regulatory capital requirement for Australian [banks] would boost credit profiles\" it was likewise not 100 per cent sure what APRA meant.\n S&P had not had a chance to directly consult with APRA and stated that any upgrade to the major banks' \"Stand Alone Credit Profiles\" from single A to A+, which automatically lifts the credit ratings on their subordinated bonds and hybrids, was predicated on a 200 basis-points increase in equity capital, as defined by S&P, which includes CET1 and AT1.\nSo it is helpful to resolve this uncertainty. First, APRA believes it is reasonable to assume the majors will need to raise 200 basis points of CET1, although it deliberately left its statements on this subject vague given the precise quantum of CET1 may be materially higher under Basel 4. With this in mind, it would be highly imprudent to assume the majors could meet APRA's 200 basis points shortfall via AT1 hybrids and subordinated bonds, as some have claimed. APRA is certainly not countenancing substituting a Tier 1 capital ratio or so-called \"Total Capital\" ratio for its all-important CET1 ratio, which remains its foundational focus.\nSecond, APRA believes that the reasonable probability case of 200 basis points of extra CET1 is a \"minimum\" for the majors. This is why it has repeatedly qualified the 200 basis points with the words \"at least\", which were also used when instructing the banks to increase their average residential mortgage risk-weights to \"at least\" 25 per cent.\nWhile APRA is confident the majors can comfortably source 200 basis points plus of CET1 over the next few years (noting they organically generate about 100 basis points per annum), there is a risk the Basel 4 rules could drive CET1 and AT1 requirements to 300 basis points or higher.\nThe major banks get this – which was highlighted by ANZ's CFO, Shayne Elliott, giving an excellent interview during the week canvassing the full suite of CET1 solutions, including discounted dividend reinvestment plans, rights issues, asset sales (Esanda) and some divestitures of ANZ's many minority equity interests scattered around Asia.\nNew normal will be competing on leverage ratios But $32.5 billion of equity is not small change and that number probably migrates north of $40 billion under Basel 4. The \"new normal\" for large, systemically important banks will be to compete during times of stress on the basis of their bona fide \"leverage ratios\". This represents equity divided by the dollar value of a bank's non-risk-weighted assets.\nYet because the majors' risk weights are so low, they do not rank at all well on these leverage ratios in global terms. According to APRA's latest analysis, the majors were disappointingly below the 50th percentile of 94 comparable banks around the world based on their CET1 leverage ratio of 4.2 per cent as at June 2014 (i.e., their equity is leveraged 24 times).\nUnder Wayne Byres, a newly emboldened and independent APRA sees no upside in under-cooking the already wafer-thin equity buffer that protects over $1.5 trillion in major bank deposits. There is, after all, tremendous asymmetry in the payoffs.\nGetting capital wrong can have catastrophic consequences for banks and the wider economy, as the North Atlantic learned during the global financial crisis. In contrast, carrying excess capital might mean slightly more expensive loans, skinnier deposit rates, weaker credit growth and low to mid-teen returns on equity. So what? With record household leverage and residential property valuations, and home loans accounting for 60 per cent of bank assets, that might be a very good thing.\nThis is where the game theory gets interesting. The major banks can wait two to three years to slowly build 200 basis points-plus of CET1 to minimise their return on equity leakage. Alternatively, they might decide that with share prices not far off their peaks, it is smarter to get ahead of their peers and raise a big slab of the 200 basis points today at some of the cheapest levels in history.\nThis \"first mover\" advantage is especially appealing if you think equity might get much more expensive in the future (e.g., during a recession when provisions for bad debts are soaring) and if you suspect the endgame for CET1 and AT1 under Basel 4 is more like 300 basis points.\nFitzsimmons buys reasoning One of the biggest equities investors in Australia, Mike Fitzsimmons, who runs $10 billion of Aussie shares at JCP Investment Partners, buys into this reasoning. \"If I was CBA I would announce a $10 billion rights issue right after my results, given the finite pool of equity capital available from investors,\" he says. \"The first bank that goes will pick up this capital cheapest.\"\nTaking equity off the table now would allow a major bank to compete on the basis of an impressive CET1 ratio over 10 per cent, which could lead to a fundamental re-rating of their risk. There is some evidence that this is already happening, with the majors' senior and old-style subordinated bonds strongly bid after APRA's remarks, which reduces their implied cost of capital.\nBeyond going-concern CET1 and AT1, APRA will eventually also start to address the majors' \"resolution capital\", which is reflected in a ratio called Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). But APRA is open-minded about the securities the majors design to satisfy TLAC, which will not likely be implemented until after 2019. It is, for example, possible the majors could introduce relatively cheap senior bonds with a contractual non-viability clause that allows this debt to be used to recapitalise the bank if APRA declares it has gone bust.\nWith the current focus on bolstering CET1 and AT1 to ensure the majors never go under in the first place, it would seem like there is little incentive to artificially inflate funding costs further through resolution capital instruments. This logic is reinforced by the fact APRA has not finalised its TLAC policy and does not intend to get well ahead of the curve as it is has on CET1.\nAustralia has four of the biggest banks in the world. They will shortly be among the strongest too.", "external_links": ["http://www.apra.gov.au/MediaReleases/Pages/15_18.aspx", "https://twitter.com/cjoye"], "published": "2015-07-24T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:14:28.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
