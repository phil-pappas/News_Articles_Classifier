The decision was taken in a review meeting of the vice chancellors here. \"All VCs assured that their preparations are complete and they will be starting CBCS from this academic session,\" the ministry said in a statement. Teachers and students have been protesting against the implementation of CBCS, saying it was adding to their distress. However, the University Grants Commission (UGC) clarified that the introduction of CBCS would not \"in any way\" hamper the academic liberal environment of the universities. Out of 39 central universities, 37 have introduced CBCS at the post-graduate level and 18 introduced the same at the undergraduate level, the statement said. In the meeting, it was said that the UGC has developed model syllabi for 85 mainline and 18 specialised courses. The syllabi will give leverage to the universities to modify the same to the extent of 30 percent depending upon their areas of specialisation, the statement added.
