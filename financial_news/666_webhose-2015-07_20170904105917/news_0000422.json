When mentions of the country are below average, stocks lose an average 0.2 percent. That compares with an average gain of 0.1 percent on all weeks.\nPerennial drama this year between Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s government and its creditors to reach a bailout deal creates an opportunity for positive surprises to drive the market upward, according to Rhino Trading Partners LLC’s Michael Block.\n“No matter what, the world will move on from this with little damage done,” said Block, chief strategist at New York-based Rhino.

Volatility measured by the size of weekly market swings increases when Greece is on the forefront. This year the S&P 500 has swung an average 1.8 percent in weeks with above-average Greek mentions and 1.5 percent in others. That was most apparent in 2011 and 2012, when the benchmark moved an average 2.1 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively.\n“The question at the end of the day was really how important was this,” Steve Bombardiere, an equity trader at Conifer Securities LLC in New York, said by phone. “You ask how much was the prospect of something bad happening keeping people out, and it probably wasn’t that much.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:47:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
