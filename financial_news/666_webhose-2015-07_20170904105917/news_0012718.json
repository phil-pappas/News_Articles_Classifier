What and when you collect will make a huge difference to your lifetime benefits.\nToday’s Social Security question is about whether it’s really worth it to file later rather than sooner.\nQuestion : I would like to begin Social Security benefits next year at my full retirement age of 66, but I want to continue working for my current company for one more year. Can I draw Social Security and still work? Or do I have to actually retire from my current company and work somewhere else? I read that you can work full time after your full retirement age.\nAnswer : You can, indeed, work full time or part time after reaching full retirement age with no loss in benefits. The real question you should be asking, however, is whether you should collect your retirement benefit now or at age 70, when it will be 32 percent higher above and beyond any adjustment for inflation (as will your survivor benefit if you die, which your spouse or ex-spouse may be able to collect). Giving up a 32 percent higher benefit for 30 years, were you to live to 100, is a big price to pay for more money in the short term, especially given that you can still work.\nMy weekly Social Security column appears on PBS NEWSHOUR’s website .", "external_links": ["http://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/lkotlikoff/"], "published": "2015-07-30T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T10:29:12.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
