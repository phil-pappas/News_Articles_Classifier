Marina Neil Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Geoff Winestock NSW coal miners have slammed a decision by the Baird government to scrap a clause in state planning rules which made economic benefit the key criterion in assessing whether a mine should go ahead.\n\"This is a retrograde step that will hurt NSW. It will put at risk thousands of current and potential jobs, particularly in regional mining communities where unemployment is often well above the state average,\" NSW Minerals Council CEO Stephen Galilee said on Tuesday.\nThe decision could affect controversial applications for extensions to Rio Tinto's Mount Thorley Warkworth and Anglo-American's Drayton South coal mines in the Hunter Valley region.\nNSW Planning Minister Rob Stokes announced on Monday he would repeal a clause in state environmental planning policy regulations which said the \"principal consideration\" for approving a mine should be \"the significance of the resource\" defined as the economic benefit from the project and the relative size of the deposit.\nNSW premier Mike Baird visited the Mount Thorley Warkworth area with Mr Stokes shortly after the election where the Coalition suffered big swings in the seats of Tamworth and Upper Hunter affected by proposed coal mines.\nThe amendment to planning rules which is now being repealed was rushed through in 2013 after Rio Tinto complained bitterly that the NSW Land and Environment Court overturned a state government decision to approve the Mount Thorley mine partly on the grounds that Rio Tinto had overstated the economic benefits from the project.\nDecision welcomed Environmental groups welcomed the decision to drop the clause and said it could play a crucial role in the looming decision on Rio Tinto's revised application for Mount Thorley Warkworth which is now being considered by planning authorities. The Rio Tinto plan would extend the mine close to the village of Bulga.\n \"It is hugely significant that this change is being made prior to the final decision on the Warkworth expansion. There is a lot more work to do to restore the balance in New South Wales, but Minister Stokes has set the ball rolling with this crucial first step,\" said Georgina Woods, spokesperson for Lock the Gate Alliance, an anti-coal mining group.\nNSW Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham welcomed the decision but said that the government had little choice but to repeal the clause because the independent Planning Assessment Commission which issues approvals had argued it was badly drafted and inconsistent with other provisions of the planning act.\nHe cited a case for Korean firm Kores Wallarah II mine in the NSW Central Coast in 2014 where the PAC said the clause did not \"sit comfortably\" with other provisions of the act.\nThe PAC wrote that \"the courts have consistently held that the public interest is a much broader concept than the economic value of a mining project, particularly when this value is calculated using methodologies that cannot properly estimate the costs associated with non-market impacts.\"\nMining industry sources however said the Wallarah decision was not representative because the NSW government had not yet been ready to provide advice on the significance of the project.\nIn more recent cases the NSW Trade and Investment Department has provided input on how each project meets the provisions and the PAC has become more familiar with the interpretation of the provisions.\nSince the clause came into force, the PAC has continued to reject major coal mines including an earlier version of the Drayton South project which is close to sensitive horse studs.\nIt also rejected the Coalpac mine project near the Gardens of Stone National Park in the Blue Mountains. It has however approved Shenhua's controversial Watermark project in the Liverpool Plains.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/GeoffWinestock", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108137886892627412852"], "published": "2015-07-07T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:58:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
