Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $14.08 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company also cut its 2015 capex forecast to $7.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. It had cut its full-year capex forecast to $8.7 billion from $10 billion in April.\nIntel's net income fell to $2.71 billion from $2.80 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share, however, were flat at 55 cents as the number of weighted average shares outstanding fell. ( bit.ly/1Hvmgay )\nAnalysts had expected a profit of 50 cents per share.\nNet revenue fell 4.6 percent to $13.19 billion, but edged past the average analyst estimate of $13.04 billion.\nUp to Wednesday's close, Intel's stock had plunged about 18 percent this year, compared with an 2.9 percent fall in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.\n(Editing by Simon Jennings)", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1Hvmgay"], "published": "2015-07-16T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T00:59:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
