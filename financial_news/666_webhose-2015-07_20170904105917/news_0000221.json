No, it's not ignoring financial advice or racking up credit card bills.\nIt's being a woman. In every facet of economic life, women are quite possibly worse off. And it is true no matter if she's rich or poor.\nYou will have heard a lot about the gender pay gap and women retiring with much lower super balances.\nAs ANZ pointed out today, women on average earn 18.8 per cent less than men, or $700,000 over a lifetime and 15 per cent are likely to experience poverty in retirement.\nAs a group, high-income women make rental gains. But there are other striking statistics that highlight the role of gender in financial decision making.\nIf Australia imposed a minimum income at 35¢ in the dollar, the so-called Warren Buffett rule that has been hotly debated over the past few days, a whopping 90 per cent of the extra $2.5 billion collected would come from men.\nWhat that means is that even wealthy women use fewer legitimate, legal tax deductions and offsets than men. They don't do as much tax planning and, as a result, have less wealth.\nWomen claim fewer tax breaks Take negative gearing, which is one of the key strategies Australians use to accumulate wealth and minimise their tax bills.\nAustralian Tax Office statistics show men negatively gear – that is, borrow to buy property or shares and use the losses to minimise tax on salary income - in much higher numbers than women.\nAs tax academic Miranda Stewart from the Australian National University explains, there were about 95,000 taxpayers in the top 1 per cent earning more than $312,000 a year in 2012-13.\nOf those, 74,660 were men and 20,110 were women.\nThose men claimed net rental losses stemming from negatively geared property of $301 million.\nWhen taken as a group as the women in this top 1 per cent did not negatively gear their properties.\nInstead, they had a overall net rental income of $40 million, so they were positively or neutrally geared.\n\"Any steps taken to constrain negatively gearing are more likely to impact more men than women,\" says Ms Stewart. \"I would support a constraint on negative gearing with a limit on net rental losses.\"\nWomen more risk averse Gender differences also show up in home ownership rates and the proportion of money tied up in bank deposits, which earn interest at lower yet more stable rates compared to, say, shares.\n\"Overall, women have less superannuation savings than men and although there is little supporting data available, it seems they are more likely to derive interest income than dividends or capital gains,\" KPMG says in its submission to the government's tax review.\n\"Women also tend to have a greater portion of their wealth in home ownership than in other assets while consumption taxation is likely to affect them disproportionately.\n\"With such factors in mind, it is readily apparent that any changes to the whole taxation system must be considered through a gender equity prism.\"\nRead next Chanticleer on the $700,000 gender pay gap", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T11:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T07:18:03.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
