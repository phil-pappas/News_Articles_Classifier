The trouble is the ASX hasn't been shedding quite enough blood yet to convince this punter it's time to rush out and buy.\nAt the depth of the market trauma on June 30, when investors were spooked by Greece's probable exit from the EU, a mate sent me the following list of shares to buy in a panic, together with Macquarie estimates on earnings and dividends per share. The table has applied those EPS and DPS estimates to the closing prices of the eight stocks last Friday, July 3.\nThe table is worth printing out and pasting on the nearest wall of your study, because if the blood ever gets flowing in the streets, these are the sort of stocks we should be contemplating. They're all likely to survive and if they get much cheaper they should be seriously considered.\nBy the traditional yardsticks, price-earnings multiples are low when they're in single figures and high when they climb through 20 times. Like baby bear's porridge they're traditionally about right around times 14 or 15.\nYields dragged down While the P/E ratios in the table are not low by historic standards, we must remember that we are in unusual times. Interest rates are the lowest in living memory, which is tending to drag down dividend yields. And low dividend yields – all other things being equal, which they never are – imply higher P/E multiples. Bearing this in mind, the mid-rate P/E for quality industrials such as those in the table is probably closer to 18x these days.\nFive of the eight stocks are on yields between 3 per cent and 4 per cent. Not spectacular by traditional standards, but we have to adjust to times where bonds and cash management trusts are paying around 2 per cent.\nIt would pay to be wary of the dividends from Tabcorp (TAH), because the payout ratio is close to 100 per cent. A company has to be very sure of its profits before a payout ratio at this altitude can be tolerated. Perpetual on 95 per cent also looks high. Payout ratios for the rest range from 75 per cent for Medibank Private to 50 per cent for Computershare.\n Of course a high payout ratio is misleading where a company is likely to enjoy a strong increase in earnings per share, but in the current year that would be a brave assumption to make about almost anyone.\nOn the table numbers, the standout stock would appear to be Computershare. It has a relatively low price/earnings multiple and a conservative payout ratio.\nIt also has a strong ongoing share registry and associated businesses. Revenues were down in the December half but by less than 2 per cent. Computershare is a true global player, having grown from its Australian base to acquire and build operations in North America, Europe and the United Kingdom.\nImportantly in the current environment, it has a strong exposure to the United States, which accounts for 42 per cent of its revenue ($US409 million in the December half). The downside is that, as a global player, its dividends are only 20 per cent franked.\nAnother worth considering is Sonic Healthcare, which continues to enjoy good growth in most of its businesses while cutting back on costs. It's another global player, with 21 per cent of its revenue in US dollars, which cuts back its franking to 55 per cent.\nNone of these stocks would be out of place in a well constructed portfolio. So keep them in mind, and when the blood starts flowing, you'll be the one with a mop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T11:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T09:04:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
