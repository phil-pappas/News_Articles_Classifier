The small business produces recipe kits and monthly spice boxes, which include a Six Month Date Night Spice Subscription. \n“Subscriptions are the gift that keeps on giving,” says founder James Ransome, 41. “People feel that they have enough stuff, so food and experiences are becoming more popular every year.” \nThe Spicery, which is now 10 years old, will turn over £1.5m this year. “The majority of that is subscriptions,” Mr Ransome said. \nNotOnTheHighStreet also offers shoppers 94 different experiential gifts. There has been a 145pc increase in sales of experiences in the first six months of 2015, compared to this time last year, with the Vintage Perfume Experience, Hula Like A Pro Class, and Gin Tasting And Distillery Tour all becoming bestsellers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:12:34.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
