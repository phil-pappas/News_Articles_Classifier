Congress this fall will cast the most significant national security vote since 2002, when it backed President George W. Bush on invading Iraq. \nRep. Dave Brat , R-Va., said Ambassador Ron Dermer's main argument during a nearly hour-long meeting with 30-40 House Republicans was \"pay less attention to all the details\" like centrifuges and years, and \"pay more attention to who's on the other side of the ethical debate, and that is Iran.\" \nCongress is in the midst of a 60-day review period of the deal designed to slow or halt any attempt by Iran to produce nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of economic and other sanctions. \nDermer was invited by Rep. Steve King , R-Iowa. \n\"It's not so much what was on the table, it's who was on the other side of the table,\" Rep. Trent Franks , R-Ariz., said of Dermer's main message. \nCountering that argument are Secretary of State John Kerry , Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, who planned to hold back-to-back classified briefings for House and Senate members Wednesday afternoon. \nThe agreement is scheduled to take effect unless lawmakers vote to thwart it, and the Republican-controlled House and Senate are expected to approve legislation in September to do that by preventing the lifting of congressionally imposed sanctions. \nObama has already threatened to veto the bill, but Republicans would try and override his veto. If they prevail, Iran could abandon the deal as its parliament plans to vote around the same time as the U.S. Congress. \nSupport from 34 members of the Senate or 146 members of the House would assure Obama of prevailing in the veto struggle. \nIn a boost for Obama, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., a member of the Democratic leadership, said on Tuesday that he supported the deal. \n\"Strong leaders of nations such as the United States meet and talk to their enemies and negotiate when it's in their national interest,\" Durbin said. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T18:22:15.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
