Various instruments of credit that we are looking at,\" said Kamath, who in Ufa to attend the BRICS summit in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders from other member countries participated. \n\"Idea is that we will lend for developmental assistance in member countries,\" said the former independent director of Infosys and former chairman of ICICI Bank, who has been made the NDB president for five years. \nBRICS countries had decided last year to establish the bank, with India getting the right to nominate the first President. \nAsked whether the NDB would consider lending to non-member countries, Kamath said: \"We will primarily lend to member countries. In due course, we will look at opening membership, in the next few months.\" \nSpecifically asked whether NDB could consider helping Greece which is in financial crisis, Kamath said: \"I have no mandate to help any non-member... Beyond BRICS, I have no mandate.\" \nAt the same time, he said, \"We will talk to the board of governors to expand in due course.\" The Board meeting is likely to take place later this month in Shanghai, the headquarters of NDB. \nKamath was asked to comment on a view that the BRICS bank has been set up to undermine the Dollar as it will lend in local currencies. \n\"I will put it like this. In developing countries, particularly BRICS, there are pools of capital which can be tapped and lent. Local currency financing is what we will look at in addition to hard currency finance. We will look at all pools of capital in addition to hard currency,\" he said. \nHe went on to add that local currency credit will protect the BRICS countries from currency fluctuations and volatility and \"it is critical that we do it\".
