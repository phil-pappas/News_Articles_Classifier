Police identified the three as brothers Arbaz (15) and Dilbaz (10) and Nagraj (10).\nHours later, six people were killed when a building collapsed at Bharatpur due to heavy rainfall. Officials said three people were rescued alive from the debris of the building. In Sikar, floodwaters washed away a man at Gothada on the same day.\nHeavy rains triggered landslides at several places in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh and cut off many remote places in the Himalayan region.\nAuthorities deployed State Disaster Relief Force personnel on Char Dham and Mansarovar yatra routes to ensure safe movement of pilgrims.\nTraffic jams were reported from Punjab and Haryana thanks to water logging across the two states.\nThe rains eased power situation as the demand dipped sharply in the two states with minimum temperature in many parts dropping several notches below normal.\nUttar Pradesh experienced moderate to very heavy rain and thundershowers. Mathura recorded the highest amount of rainfall at 14 cm in the state.\nExperts said the heavy rains, which are predicted to continue till Monday, would be beneficial for plantation of crops like paddy in the ongoing 'Kharif' season. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias= Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-07-12T12:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T10:59:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
