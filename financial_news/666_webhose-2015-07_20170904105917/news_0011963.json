The ECB Monday made it harder for Greek lenders to tap the emergency loans, tightening collateral rules.\nWhile fresh ECB aid is needed to keep banks ticking, injections of capital from shareholders, bondholders or even customers’ savings may be inevitable, according to a person with direct knowledge of discussions on lenders. The crippled financial system poses the greatest threat to the country’s remaining in the euro, even in limbo -- or “grimbo.”\n“Greek banks could easily require an additional 10 billion euros ($11 billion) of equity capital if grimbo continues, perhaps more, diluting existing shareholders,” Citigroup Inc. European banking analysts led by Ronit Ghose wrote in a note to clients. “In the context of grexit, a full nationalization is likely.”\nAttempts to reach an agreement with creditors over the past five months have failed, triggering deposit outflows, increasing non-performing loans and damping economic activity. Banks have been closed since last week and daily ATM withdrawals are limited to 60 euros. Greece’s financial system will be discussed at Tuesday’s meeting in Brussels with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and European leaders.\nFor months, Greek lenders have been locked out of standard ECB refinancing operations, running up a tab of 89 billion euros in emergency lending, or ELA. The ECB froze the ELA on June 28, prompting the bank holiday and controls after the plebiscite was announced.\nEmergency Line The ECB sees Greece’s financial system surviving without an injection of extra liquidity at least until after Tuesday’s summit, people familiar with the matter said Monday. The governing council that day rejected a Greek request to raise the emergency line by 3 billion euros. It also raised the discount on the government debt pledged as collateral to 45 percent, a person familiar with the matter said, effectively forcing banks to exhaust more of their available collateral.\nThe Frankfurt-based institution is set to review the situation Wednesday. Even if Greece reaches a deal with creditors, its damaged banks may need capital. The funds could come from taxpayers, shareholders, bondholders and customer deposits, said a person with direct knowledge of the talks.\nThe four largest banks either declined to comment or weren’t available to comment.\nShrinking Deposits The range of options regulators are considering include deploying a backstop from creditors for banks under a new bailout agreement to attempt to raise capital privately, said the person. Alternatively, banks could impose a levy on deposits, an option that would first require a contribution from stockholders and bondholders, the person said.\nA third option, consisting of seizing deposits on accounts of more than 100,000 euros, is also on the table, said the person. Such a “bail-in” of unsecured deposits was a feature of the 2013 Cyprus rescue package, with accounts above that insurance ceiling tapped. In Greece, deposits shrank by almost 40 billion euros between December and June this year amid renewed doubts of Greece’s place in the currency bloc.\nPenalizing depositors is “virtually anathema,” Petros Doukas, the former deputy finance minister, told Bloomberg Television. “It would strike at the heart of the middle class and be very destructive for the economy.”\nThe four largest Greek banks have failed and would also have defaulted had capital controls not been imposed, Fitch Ratings analysts wrote in a note July 2. Liquidity and solvency are very weak and some banks may be nearing a point where unwinding them becomes a real possibility. Loans overdue by 90 days or more accounted for 36 percent of the domestic loans at the end of March and arrears probably have increased significantly since then.\nFrancois Cabau of Barclays Plc’s economics research sees shareholder equity being wiped out if a deal with creditors isn’t reached.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T11:56:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
