Photo: Kimberly White\neBay has agreed to sell its enterprise unit to a private-equity-led group for $US925 million ($1.25 billion) and reported results that topped analysts' estimates, days before the e-commerce company spins off its PayPal transactions business.\neBay reported gains in second-quarter sales and underlying earnings. It also forecast revenue growth for its core online marketplace and the transactions business. The results cheered investors watching for signs of how the company's new focus will fare.\n\"PayPal has been growing strongly for the past several years, so this is really about the e-commerce business,\" said Victor Anthony, an analyst at Axiom Capital Management. \"They're not out of the woods yet, but better growth rates show investors that things are starting to improve.\"\nSales fell 3 per cent for that core e-commerce operation, to $US2.1 billion, the drop was mainly because of the strong dollar, the company said in a statement on Thursday US time. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange, the operation's revenue increased 5 per cent.\neBay forecast that marketplace net revenue would rise 3 per cent to 5 per cent this year, excluding currency effects. For PayPal, which will trade on its own Monday, the company projected sales growth of 15 to 18 per cent. Investors have been watching to see how the transactions operation will do amid new competition from Apple's ApplePay feature and whether the marketplace business has recovered from a data breach last year and changes to Google's search engine that decreased traffic.\nRevenue rises Total company revenue, including the enterprise business, rose to $US4.68 billion. The average estimate of analysts was $US4.49 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings from continuing operations rose to $US931 million, or 76 cents a share, from $US883 million, or 70 cents. Analysts had predicted 72 cents a share.\neBay shares rose 3.4 per cent to close at $US65.59 in New York. The stock was up 17 per cent this year.\nDevin Wenig, the current president of the marketplace division and the chief executive of eBay starting on Monday, said he wanted to make the operation less vulnerable to changes by one search engine. The company was building its presence on social media sites such as Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram, he said in a conference call. eBay attracts 157 million buyers to its site and handles more than $US80 billion in annual sales volume.\nIncoming PayPal CEO Dan Schulman, who is now the division's president, said he wanted the company's 169 million users to make two or three transactions a week, up from the two or three times a month that is typical today. The company is working with more merchants, such as Burger King and Subway, to increase payments volume, he said.\n\"We want to be more of a part of their financial lives,\" Schulman said.\nThe sale of the enterprise division, to a group including Permira, Sterling Partners and Longview Asset Management, is expected to be completed in the second half.\nUnloading the operation, which provides warehousing, delivery and customer support to web merchants, is another step in eBay's effort to focus on its core marketplace. As online sales continue to climb, big eBay enterprise customers such as Toys \"R\" Us and Dick's Sporting Goods are starting to run such operations on their own.\neBay acquired the division, previously called GSI Commerce, for about $US2 billion in 2011 to try to catch up to Amazon's distribution network. Like eBay's online marketplace business, sales growth in the enterprise division has lagged behind overall e-commerce.\nLast year, eBay announced plans to spin off PayPal following pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn, who said the slow-growing marketplace was holding back the payments business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:51:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
