That is one year until the 2016 Opening Ceremony. But major travel sites are getting ahead of the game with early booking discounts and several tour operators are offering travel packages. For sports fans who plan ahead, it is the best of both worlds – lower prices and certainty about knowing where they will stay in time to plan their event ticket purchases. \nTraditionally, hotels start taking reservations twelve months in advance. The Starwood site makes online reservations for the Sheraton Rio Resort and is currently only taking reservations through July 21, 2016. Currently, Expedia is already offering part of its contingent of accommodations during the 2016 Summer Olympic Games and rewarding early bookers with big discounts. Advances in reservations software have made it easier to enable early booking. This also helps travel companies plan their inventory management, creating a classic win-win situation. \nExpedia currently has 36 accommodations available in the Rio area for the first week of Rio 2016. This includes 13 hostel style facilities for under $ 100 per night. Several traditional inns called “Pousada” have rooms for about $200 per night with early booking discounts. Most apartments cost several hundred dollars a night, but sharing with a typical group of four keeps the cost per person under $100 per night. Expedia is featuring studios at the ultra-modern “Copacabana 120” tower between $443 and $475 per night. Travelocity is also taking reservations for Rio apartments in this price range during the 2016 Summer Olympics and also offers a 2 Bedroom luxury unit for just under $ 900 per night. \nWhile Expedia and Travelocity do not currently offer upscale hotel accommodations directly in Rio during the 2016 Summer Games, there are good choices available in the beach resort of Buzios, about two hours from the center of Rio de Janeiro. Expedia is offering the Costa del Sol resort for $190 per night. Expedia also offers many inns in Buzios for under $100 per night, as well as luxury hotels for over $1,000 per night. \nSports travel specialist Roadtrips is offering one week packages to the 2016 Summer Olympics starting at $5,975 per person. The price includes a hospitality lounge at the Hotel Santa Teresa with a panoramic view of the many free events that will take place in the area. One of the world’s largest cruise ships, the Norwegian Getaway, will dock in Rio de Janeiro during the 2016 Summer Olympics and become a floating hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T22:30:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
