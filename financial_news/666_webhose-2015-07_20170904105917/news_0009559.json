By contrast, she spoke twice with European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and just once with Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda.\nOverseeing the two largest economies likely to require higher interest rates over the next year, Yellen and Carney no doubt had much to talk about in the way of exit strategies.\nTo some investors, the frequency of the chats provides further evidence of the “special relationship” they assume to exist between the Fed and BOE. The historical ties that bind the U.K. and the U.S. and recent similarities in economic performance are thought to mean they will raise rates in virtual lockstep when the time comes.\nU.K. officials are already quashing that notion. “It is a daft idea that we cannot raise rates in the U.K. before the U.S. and also cannot be long behind them,” outgoing BOE policy maker David Miles said on July 14.\nNot Synchronized History backs him up. Since the BOE was made independent in May 1997, it has raised interest rates over four periods and there is little correlation with the Fed.\nThe hikes of May 1997 to June 1998 and August 2006 to July 2007 took place when rates were stable in the U.S., while the September 1999 to February 2000 hikes began three months after the Fed stated tightening. The increases of November 2003 to August 2004 began even months before the Fed shifted.\nCrunching the decision-making since 2001, Citigroup Inc. estimates the policy correlation over 12 months was 55 percent.\nWhile pretty high, that compares with 80 percent for the U.K. and euro-area. It was also closer between the U.K. and New Zealand, South Korea and China than it was with the Fed.\n“To our knowledge no one has ever argued that the BOE is following the Reserve Bank of New Zealand or the Reserve Bank of Australia,” Citigroup economists Michael Saunders and Ann O’Kelly said in a July 17 report. “The BOE is clearly not a monetary satellite of the Fed.”\nRather, both are independently responding to developments in their own economies which are impacted by global events.\nEven when they do start lifting rates, the past suggests they will do so by different degrees. In the hiking cycles since 1997, the U.K. benchmark rose 125 basis points on average, while the Fed’s increased 300 basis points.\nThis time around, Citigroup predicts the Fed will act in September and the BOE will follow in the first quarter of 2016. The gap is explained by the pound’s strength and less concern about asset bubbles in the U.K. A sharp pickup in pay growth or slide in sterling could mean the BOE acts first.\n“If and when the U.K. does hike it will be for domestic reasons rather than a sense that the BOE is tied to following the Fed,” said Saunders and Kelly. “It is not a given that the U.K. will hike after the Fed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T11:37:49.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
