It also surged nearly three yen to 136.86 yen. \n\"The current proposals set forth by Greece and the creditors should have enough common ground that an agreement can be reached before the negotiation deadline on Sunday,\" said Christopher Vecchio, an analyst at DailyFX. \nThe greenback showed little effect from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's reiteration that the Fed's first rate hike since 2006 will likely come before the end of the year. \nYellen though remained cautious -- reflecting sentiment from the last Fed policy meeting -- noting continuing signs of slack in the jobs market and the risk of moving too soon on rates. \n\"We will be watching carefully to see if there is continued improvement in labor market conditions, and we will need to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to two percent in the next few years,\" she said. \n2100 GMT Friday Thursday", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T01:14:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
