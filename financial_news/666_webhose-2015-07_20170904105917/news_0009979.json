Traders pared bets on the pace of policy easing after Wheeler said the economy isn’t weak enough to warrant big reductions in interest rates.\n“Wheeler’s comments today continued to be more balanced than markets had been hoping for and confirmed recent reductions in positions shorting the kiwi,” said Sam Tuck, a senior currency strategist at ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd. in Auckland. “Longer-term drivers of the currency remain in place with trend declines expected to continue after a period of consolidation.”\nPolicy makers lowered the benchmark cash rate in June, and again last week, as slumping dairy prices weighed on the economy. The RBNZ however removed language describing the currency as “overvalued” in its statement, spurring a rally in the local dollar.\nThe kiwi gained 0.5 percent to 67.22 U.S. cents as of 9:18 a.m. in Wellington. It slumped to six-year low earlier this month.\n“Some local commentators have predicted large declines in interest rates over coming months that could only be consistent with the economy moving into recession,” Wheeler said in the speech as published on the RBNZ’s website. “At this point, we believe that several factors are supporting economic growth.”\nWhile most economists predict two more reductions by October, returning the key rate to a record 2.5 percent, some see even deeper cuts.", "external_links": ["http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/research_and_publications/speeches/2015/some-thoughts-on-inflation-and-monetary-policy.html\\", "http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/news/2015/news-release-gw-speech-inflation-outlook-july-2015.html\\"], "published": "2015-07-29T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T01:45:15.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
