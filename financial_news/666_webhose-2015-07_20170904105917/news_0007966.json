LOUISE KENNERLEY Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jenny Wiggins UGL plans to become a smarter engineering company sourcing world-class technology from overseas after losing property arm DTZ, says new UGL chairman Kate Spargo.\n\"We will look at best practice and look overseas at what people are doing, especially in the technology area because the whole company really lends itself to being technology-enabled,\" Ms Spargo told The Australian Financial Review .\nUGL, which designs rail locomotives as well as rail systems like signalling equipment, wants to start adopting more innovative technology to remain competitive after becoming a much smaller company, Ms Spargo said. \"We've got to make sure we make the most of what we've got and be smart; there are always opportunities if you're smart.\"\nThe $1.2 billion sale of DTZ to private equity group TPG in November has left UGL with a market capitalisation of just $360 million – a minnow in comparison to contracting rivals Downer EDI, which has a market capitalisation of $2 billion, and Transfield Services, which has a market capitalisation of $664 million.\nUGL is viewed as a possible takeover target for either Downer or Transfield, as well as foreign companies eager to expand in Australia. While acknowledging that there were \"always conversations\" about potential consolidation, Ms Spargo said she was not worrying about a potential takeover of UGL.\nNew UGL chief executive Ross Taylor , who replaced Richard Leupen in November, has not wasted any time in overhauling the company, cutting jobs and introducing new risk-management systems to make it more efficient.\nUGL has undergone \"significant change\" after losing DTZ and shrinking to fewer than 9000 employees from 55,000 previously, Ms Spargo said, crediting Mr Taylor – previously CEO of engineering group Tenix before it was acquired by Downer for $300 million in October – with \"not hanging about\" and improving the flow of information to the board.\n\"When he says he's going to do [something,] he does it,\" she said. \"Ross is detailed, he believes enormously in transparency, and that's both up and down – he's given the board information to better see how the whole of the business is operating.\"\n Mr Taylor had to make some early tough decisions, in February setting aside $175 million for provisional writedowns on the group's $550 million Ichthys power project in Darwin, a 50-50 joint venture with United States engineering group CH2M Hill for Japan's Inpex group.\nInvestors shocked at $200m cost blowout Investors were shocked in November when UGL revealed some $200 million of cost blowouts on the project without specifying whether it would take write-downs, and raised questions on the timing of the announcement – which came just after the company completed the DTZ sale to TPG.\nInvestors have also been concerned about UGL's remuneration policies, with the group receiving a first strike against its remuneration report last year following a US$3 million sign-on bonus to DTZ head Tod Lickerman and the pay out of $1.8 million in succession incentives to Mr Leupen.\nMs Spargo, who replaced Trevor Rowe as UGL's chairman after the 2014 AGM, said there were \"special circumstances\" around previous salary packages. \"We don't have anything that is unusual in terms of remuneration now; it's fairly standard,\" she said.\nStill, investors have raised questions about Mr Taylor's salary package, with UGL's largest shareholder Allan Gray, which owns 19 percent of the company, warning in May that it was unhappy with some of the CEO's performance metrics.\nMs Spargo said it was hard to get \"a common view\" on remuneration from shareholders. \"We're extremely happy with Ross and his performance and I think his remuneration is appropriate.\"\nShe does, however, aspire to be a different kind of chairman from Mr Rowe. \"My approach is to be consultative with the board, and with management.\"\nMs Spargo plans on adding more directors to UGL's six-strong board, including more women – she is currently the only female. \"I'm committed to the concept of diversity and diverse thinking, and an obvious part of that is diversity by gender.\"\nDespite being one of just 13 women who chair ASX-200 listed companies, Ms Spargo says she is also \"more optimistic\" than she was several years ago about the prospect of more women joining corporate boards. \"I think we are seeing some actual step change in numbers. A lot of men who have been on all-male boards all their director career are positively surprised at how much better it is when women are added.\"\nMs Spargo, who was paid less than her male colleagues for doing the same work in her first job in 1969 as a histopathology technician in a mortuary, only favours quotas for women on boards as a last resort. \"I'd rather do it by targets if we could.\"\nShe is keen to increase the proportion of women at UGL and support diversity programs that will be implemented by the company's new head of people and culture, former Tenix executive Jane Whitney.\nAlthough 25 per cent of UGL's senior executive team are female, only 11 per cent of its general workforce are women.\n\"You can develop terrific programs, but if those at the top either explicitly or implicitly don't support it, the chances are it won't go well,\" Ms Spargo said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennywiggins", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/allan-gray-joins-investor-backlash-to-ugls-remuneration-report-20150517-gh2ayh.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/ugl-joint-venture-faces-damages-claim-over-550-million-power-plant-at-ichthys-20141106-11i4ar.html", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/117166018980952797102", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/ugl-shareholders-award-first-strike-over-signon-bonus-20141030-11ehv1.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/ugl-confirms-dtz-sale-appoints-new-ceo-20140615-3a6gw.html"], "published": "2015-07-26T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:03:43.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
