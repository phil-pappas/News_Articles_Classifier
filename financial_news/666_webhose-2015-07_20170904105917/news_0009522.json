While African nations including Uganda tightened monetary policy this year, most developing countries cut borrowing costs or held rates to support their economies amid a global commodities rout.\nThat may change as accelerating consumer prices spur negative real rates in about half of the developing economies the JPMorgan covers, the bank said in a report. South Africa’s inflation rate threatens to exceed the 6 percent target, while in Brazil the level now stands at more than 9 percent. Developing-nation consumer prices reached a low of 4.6 percent in May and will soon quicken, in part because oil won’t fall as far as it did last year, according to Capital Economics.\n“The South African Reserve Bank move foreshadows a broader shift toward emerging-market tightening late this year and in 2016 that is not priced into financial markets,” David Hensley, the New York-based director for global economics at JPMorgan, said in an e-mailed response to questions on Friday. “Inflation is set to rise across the emerging-market complex against a backdrop of very low policy rates.”\nCapital Flight Many developing economies depend on stock and bond investments to finance current-account deficits, making them vulnerable capital outflows in the the event of a Fed rate increase. Economists project a 50 percent chance of a rates liftoff at its September meeting, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.\n“The emerging-market economies broadly have become dependent on portfolio inflows to finance activity, regardless of their current-account position,” Hensley said. “When the Fed starts raising rates, these vulnerabilities will show through, pressuring currency rates and creating problems with inflation, currency mismatches on dollar debt and higher debt servicing costs.”\nFour out of 31 emerging-market nations monitored by Bloomberg cut interest rates this year, while 14 increased borrowing costs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T19:31:24.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
