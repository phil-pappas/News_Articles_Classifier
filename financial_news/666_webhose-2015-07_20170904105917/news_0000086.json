GPIF, the world's largest public pension fund, entrusts trust banks with a portion of its assets for investment.\nGPIF has steadily sold government debt this year in a bid to rebalance its bond-centric portfolio in favour of riskier assets.\n($1 = 124.3600 yen) (Reporting by Tokyo markets team; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:10:39.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
