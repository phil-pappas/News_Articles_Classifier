Each of these individuals earned more than a million dollars for the year but had an average taxable income of just $1.09.\"\nBut tax experts have said there could be many legitimate expenses that may reduce taxable income to zero such as investing in a loss-making business.\nMr Hockey also indicated there could be reasons for this if, for example, if people were investing in start-ups or innovative businesses.\nA paper released as part of the tax reform debate last month shows the wealthy use negative gearing, donations and professional fees as part of strategies to reduce their tax.\nNow read why men in their 50s would bear the brunt of the Buffett rule .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T10:11:28.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
