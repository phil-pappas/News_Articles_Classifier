It’s also a day to celebrate Canadians. As the country’s government site puts it, “Canada Day is a time to celebrate the heritage passed down to us through the works of our authors, poets, artists and performers.” \nFans in the United States might not realize that some of the most famous and celebrated entertainers and millionaires — such as Drake and Jim Carrey — in the country are Canadians. While Americans might not share that heritage, they still enjoy the work of successful Canadians who have made their homes and fortunes in the U.S. \nHere’s a look at some of the wealthiest and hottest Canadians today. Drake’s Net Worth: $55 Million \nDrake is best-known today for his rapping career, but this music artist actually got his start as regular character Jimmy Brooks on hit Canadian high school drama “Degrassi: The Next Generation.” \nWith chart-climbing hits like “Best I Ever Had” and “Started From the Bottom” along with millions of albums sold, Drake’s net worth has grown to an impressive $55 million, according to CelebrityNetWorth. His music is even blasted by PGA golf competitors; Will Wilcox got in a Twitter scuffle with Brendan Steele when the pro golfers had a disagreement over Drake tunes played on the green. \nDrake’s also known for his partying ways and was recently seen tearing it up with the likes of Kendall Jenner and Rita Ora in London, reports TMZ. With proven talent and success, music fans are definitely glad this Canadian quit his acting career to pursue his real dream of rapping. Jim Carrey’s Net Worth: $150 Million \nWith a $150 million net worth, according to CelebrityNetWorth, Jim Carrey is a rich and successful comedian and actor known for his roles in movies like “Dumb and Dumber,”“Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,”“The Mask” and “Liar Liar.” Originally from Ontario, Canada, Carrey has more than three decades under his belt in the entertainment industry. \nCarrey has also been known for his activism in recent years. On Wednesday, he made several strong comments against a new California law that makes vaccinations mandatory instead of leaving the decision to vaccinate children up to their parents. \n“California Gov says yes to poisoning more children with mercury and aluminum in manditory [sic] vaccines,” Carrey tweeted. “They say mercury in fish is dangerous but forcing all of our children to be injected with mercury in thimerosol is no risk. Make sense?” Justin Bieber’s Net Worth: $200 Million \nIn the case of Justin Bieber, the public opinion is split. While his legions of die-hard fans love him, plenty of Americans wish he’d kept his music and trouble-making ways — such as wearing an Antichrist T-shirt to a church service, as he did recently in Sydney, reports the Daily Mail — in Canada. \nWhatever your opinion on Bieber’s behavior, there’s no denying his unparalleled success. With huge hits like “Baby” and “Boyfriend,” millions of albums sold and mega-selling tours, Justin Bieber’s net worth has grown to $200 million, reports CelebrityNetWorth. Bieber’s recent collaboration with Skrillex and Diplo, “Where Are U Now,” has been climbing Billboard charts and is a huge hit of the summer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T22:37:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
