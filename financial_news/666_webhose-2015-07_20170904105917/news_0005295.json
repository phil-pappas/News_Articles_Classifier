In approving the deal, the OCC terminated an enforcement action against Pasadena, California-based OneWest stemming from a 2011 settlement over foreclosure practices.\nShares of CIT rose as much as 4.6 percent to $49.27, the most in about a year, after the news was announced. The stock price has increased about 0.7 percent so far this year.\nCurt Ritter, a spokesman for CIT, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nCIT’s takeover of OneWest, which is backed by billionaires John Paulson and George Soros and overseen by Chairman Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive, signals a rebound for CIT Chief Executive Officer John Thain and a sign that larger bank deals could accelerate. Thain, who joined CIT in 2010, was CEO of Merrill Lynch & Co. before it was sold to Bank of America Corp.\nSystemically Important Bank acquisitions have slowed since the credit crisis amid concerns that more lenders would be seen as systemically important and draw additional scrutiny from regulators. For example, M&T Bank Corp.’s takeover of Hudson City Bancorp, the largest pending bank merger, has been delayed four times since it was announced in 2012, amid probes of M&T’s money-laundering controls.\nThe merged CIT will have about $70 billion in assets, according to the Fed, putting it above the $50 billion threshold that triggers increased oversight under the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe CIT deal was delayed by objections from low-income borrower advocacy groups. The agencies earlier this year held a hearing in San Francisco to collect information on how the proposed deal might affect communities after groups including the California Reinvestment Coalition raised concerns about how the combined business could be another “too-big-to fail” bank.\nOneWest was known as IndyMac Bancorp before it went bankrupt in 2008. IndyMac made mortgages to people without verifying their income, which prompted the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to take control of the lender in 2008. IndyMac is the second-largest U.S. commercial bank failure on record, behind the collapse of Washington Mutual Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T00:20:12.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
