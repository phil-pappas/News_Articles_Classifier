For the first time people were talking, really talking, about a smart watch. And for the first time watch folk realised there’s likely to be real competition – not watch to watch necessarily, but for a place on your wrist.\nFrom denial to criticism of the Apple Watch design, came a remarkable turnaround that’s seen traditional cogsters scrambling to embrace connectivity while others wait and see. As a sign of how fast this has happened, consider this: at Geneva’s powerful Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie (SIHH) fair in January, Apple was mentioned only in the context of pie for dessert. At Baselworld eight weeks later, it was the most talked about watch, despite not being on show.\nAs we see it, the argument is not about whether the Apple is a better watch, but is it a better tool for life today, something the traditional watch was in its day. The latter is now a luxury item, the common adornment for men, a brilliantly self-sufficient piece of engineering and craftsmanship. The question is whether that will be enough to maintain its place on our wrist.\nIt’s early days, but here’s the state of play in the smart watch versus traditional watch contest right now.\nTop row, left to right: Montblanc, IWC, Tag Heuer. Bottom row, left to right: Bulgari, Breitling, Frederique Constant. On one side of the divide Apple stands virtually alone; it’s the richest company in the world and has single-handedly made the connected watch an “item”. Don’t underestimate its sleek looks and multitude of functions. You can forget about your Fitbits, Garmins and Galaxy Gears; sooner or later they’re destined for the same sarcophagus as your mini-disc player and Blu-ray kit.\nOn the other side you have the Swiss wristocrats, who might argue the smart watch lacks soul, will never be special, will soon be outdated and, with its need for recharging, is in any case limited if not downright inconvenient. That overlooks the fact that the mechanical watch was the smart watch of its day, with constant innovations and upgrades offering functions such as chronographs, moon phases and perpetual calendars. It didn’t need charging but did need winding every day before the innovation of the automatic movement.\nEven so, the elite brands for the most part seem to believe they are safe because of their exclusivity and desirability, while their more mass-market brethren might be wondering whether to have a bet each way. That could mean producing their own smart watch, or it could mean adding a few “connected” features to the watch as we know it, or … well, it could mean anything or nothing.\nAlthough the Apple Watch has been available only in restricted markets since late April, a growing line-up of brands has swung into action. Names from Gucci to Google have been mentioned, spawning ideas both wonderful and wacky. Guess Watches is working with Californian smart-watch maker Martian on the Guess Connect , which has a microphone and speaker connected to your phone. Some ideas seem a fraction rushed; Gucci doesn’t exactly have a product yet, but has announced a partnership with rapper will.i.am to bring out a self-contained and wearable android device meeting the criteria of “fashionology”. The genre is also seeing new brands emerge, for example Vector , a British outfit whose effort uses the web-based IFTTT (If This Then That) platform to facilitate photo, Twitter and Dropbox doings at the flick of a wrist.\n The approach is equally varied among the established brands. Here we look at six, and assess their chances:\nFrederique Constant Frederique Constant was the first Swiss brand out of the blocks, linking with Fullpower Technologies of Silicon Valley to announce a smart watch powered by MotionX®, one that looks more like your conventional ticker. If that’s a first, there’s another: it’s a hybrid that actually works; most of the efforts we’ve seen to date are still at the concept stage. FC’s Swiss Horological Smartwatch is capable of “bi-directional communication” with iPhone and Android apps. Instead of using a digital screen, it features hands on a traditional dial to display information in analog form. The watch offers time and date, sleep cycle alarms, get-active alerts, adaptive coaching and Cloud backup – along with two years’ battery life.\nOur verdict:\nWho would exercise in a watch that looks this good?\n3 stars\nIWC IWC has released pictures and a teaser video of a small, discus-like electronic module that will be incorporated into the watch strap of its Big Pilot model, the aim to track activity and connect with other devices. IWC chief executive Georges Kern says the brand was influenced by customers and ambassadors beginning to wear connected devices alongside their IWCs. “But, and this is essential, we do not touch our beautiful watches,” Kern stressed. For the module, IWC has turned to “a like-minded digital technology company” based in Silicon Valley. It’s yet to be seen how it works.\nOur verdict:\nNo screen, and IWC’s famed heavyweight is hardly a jogging accessory.\n1 star\nBulgari Bulgari has opted for a watch that looks deceptively attractive – it’s mechanical with no clunky flagging of its covert connectivity. Out of sight, though, is an embedded microchip and an invisible antenna that gives access to the “Bulgari Vault”, an app that stores sensitive information such as passwords. When presenting the Bulgari Diagono Magnesium model, chief executive Jean-Christophe Babin stated: “It’s not a smart watch but an intelligent one.”\nOur verdict:\nSurely a bit left-field for a luxury label.\n2 stars\nMontblanc Rather than incorporate anything techy into an existing watch, Montblanc has optioned its mechanical TimeWalker Urban Speed model with an interchangeable “e-Strap” that incorporates a Bluetooth connected screen the size of an airmail sticker, good for notifications, activity tracking and remote functions. It adds about $500 to the price of the watch.\nOur verdict:\nTiny screen and looks like a token toe-in-the-water.\n1 star\nBreitling Breitling claims to have “reinvented the connected watch” with this B55 Connected concept. The idea here was to give pilots, in particular, access to genuinely useful functions such as flight-time log, mission elapsed time and countdown to mission start. We’ve seen the demo and were impressed.\nOur verdict:\nClever, comprehensive and tailored to a specific user.\n4 stars\nTag Heuer Tag Heuer went the full Monty at the Baselworld fair, announcing in dramatic fashion a tie-up with Google and Intel to produce a watch that “connects watchmaking with the universe”. We’ll have to wait until later in the year to find out just how that works. Announcing the planned newcomer, CEO Jean-Claude Biver made the somewhat startling claim: “We don’t have the know-how in Switzerland, so we’ve turned to geniuses from Silicon Valley.”\nOur verdict:\nHigh tech looks could make it highly desirable.\n4 stars", "external_links": ["http://www.gucci.com/au/category/f/watches", "http://frederiqueconstant.com/", "http://www.montblanc.com/en/collection/watches.html", "http://www.montblanc.com/en/discover/sihh-2015/timewalker-urban-speed-collection.html", "http://www.frederique-constant.com/watch-finder/smartwatch/smartwatch-fc-285v5b4/", "http://www.bulgari.com/en-gb/watches/new-launches", "https://www.martianwatches.com/guess-connect/", "https://www.vectorwatch.com/", "https://store.google.com/category/android_wear?utm_source=en-ha-au-sem&utm_medium=text&utm_content=bkws&utm_campaign=androidwear", "https://www.sihh.org/index.php?page=sihh-en", "http://au.tagheuer.com/", "https://www.breitling.com/en/campaigns/b55-connected/", "https://www.apple.com/au/watch/", "https://www.breitling.com/en/", "http://www.iwc.com/en/"], "published": "2015-07-26T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:08:50.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
