[ http://bit.ly/1I8Nn8i ] \nCampbell said he would be surprised if GVC could land the deal without the backing of a company such as Amaya. \nA GVC spokesman declined to comment on Tuesday about the possibility of making a solo bid for Bwin, but added it was not ruling in or out any options. \n888 and Bwin were not available for comment, while Amaya was unavailable to comment outside of normal business hours. \nGVC shares were up 2.7 percent on the London Stock Exchange (Other OTC: LDNXF - news ) on Tuesday morning. Shares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in Bwin were flat, while 888's shares were marginally down. \n($1 = 0.6422 pounds) (Editing by Anupama Dwivedi and Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T12:42:57.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
