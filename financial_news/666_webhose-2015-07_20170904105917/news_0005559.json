We are ready to deepen and broaden our economic ties with Belaz. Zimbabwe will soon grow into a mining giant and our partnership with the company will help us realise this dream.\" \nVP Mnangagwa said owing to the imposition of US sanctions on Harare, Zimbabwe should shun western companies that have traditionally supplied mining equipment, so as to pave way for the enhancement of cooperation with firms such as Belaz, which employs 10 000 workers. \n\"We have companies from America, which have been supplying such machinery to us. Because of the sanctions imposed on us, it is difficult for such companies to do business with us. We do not see Belarus imposing sanctions on us, so we need to deepen relations with Belaz and do away with other companies.\" \nVice President Mnangagwa said he will, today sign agreements worth up to $150 million to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries. \nThe agreements will be anchored on four sectors, which are mining equipment, road and dam construction and agriculture. \nPrior to signing the agreements, Vice President Mnangagwa will hold talks with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko. \n\"I have been sent by my President to sign agreements with Belarus. The initial agreements are worth between $120 million and $150 million. The agreements we are signing tomorrow (today) are in four areas; mining equipment, road construction, dam construction and agriculture.\" \nSpeaking during the tour, Belaz director general, Mr Peter Parkhomchik said his company is on the verge of finalising arrangements with a number of Zimbabwean mining firms following the recent deal, which saw the firm supplying machinery to Hwange Colliery. \n\"We are negotiating other agreements regarding other deals on extraction of diamonds, gold, chrome and other minerals. When our representative was in Zimbabwe recently, we reached agreements regarding financing with the Africa Development Bank. Your country is very rich in minerals, we have the equipment, so our relationship will be mutually beneficial,\" he said. \nAs well as dump trucks, Belaz also manufactures tractors, road rebuilding equipment, railway freight cars, bulk mineral fertilizers and other heavy duty equipment. \nBelaz exemplifies the resilience of Belarus as a dynamic country, which has a sound economy despite economic sanctions that have been imposed on Minsk by the United States and the European Union. \nAs well as the imposition of the western sanctions, Belarus also shares a lot in common with Zimbabwe as it is a land locked nation with a high adult literacy rate of more than 99 percent. \nZimbabwe is increasingly looking to strengthen ties with friendly nations from the East, as the West has obdurately refused to remove its skewed policy on the Zanu-PF government while remaining sympathetic to opposition parties and other functionaries working against the ruling party.
