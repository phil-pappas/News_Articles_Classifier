The yield on the two-year note TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.77% fell 0.4 basis point to 0.637%. The yield on the 30-year bond TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.77% fell 4.6 basis points to 3.145%. Bond yields rise as prices fall.\nDuring the question-and-answer session, Yellen shifted the focus away from the timing of the first hike by emphasizing that the pace of interest rate hikes would be gradual. This likely drove the move lower in long-term yields, which are more sensitive to long-term interest rate expectations, said Donald Ellenberger, senior portfolio manager and head of multisector strategies at Federated Investors.\nBut there’s also another likely explanation. During her testimony before Congress, Yellen was expected to represent the view of the open-markets committee as a whole, which is likely more hawkish than her own position. Her personal views likely bled through during the question and answer session, which also could have contributed to the reversal.\nA recent raft of disappointing economic data—including a retail-sales report, released Tuesday, which showed a surprising contraction in consumer spending in June—could inspire the Fed keep rates lower for longer, some analysts say. Worries about plummeting Chinese stock valuations and a possible collapse of Greece’s third bailout deal also could inspire Fed policy makers to be more cautious about raising interest rates.\nYellen will again testify before lawmakers on Thursday, when she addresses the Senate Banking Committee.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:49:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
