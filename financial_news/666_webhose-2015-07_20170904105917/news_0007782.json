Dhurandhar said that he first noticed this phenomenon years ago in rodents while researching how the virus causes obesity.\nDhurandhar isolated a protein from the virus that is responsible for reducing blood sugar and tested it on diabetic cells and animals. The experiment showed the protein improved diabetes.\nThe next step for Dhurandhar was to develop a drug that could be tested on humans and could be used to treat diabetes.\nDhurandhar, who is president of the Obesity Society, has been studying viral obesity for years, which he started when he was a physician in India focusing on patients with obesity.\nHe holds a number of patents for his work on adenovirus 36.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=physician,Obesity Society,Obesity,Nikhil Dhurandhar,Houston Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-07-28T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:41:33.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
