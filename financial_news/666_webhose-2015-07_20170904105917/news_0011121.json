As a consequence I hope it has given the market new confidence we’re going to hit our targets.” \nVirgin Money's share price soared on Tuesday \nMs Gadhia is lobbying the Treasury behind closed doors in a bid to tweak the tax. \n“We have spoken to HM Treasury, but the right way to talk about this is in private. We will see what happens when the Finance Bill becomes the Finance Act (Frankfurt: 0LW.F - news ) ,” Ms Gadhia said. \nShawbrook Bank is also lobbying the Chancellor privately in an effort to get him to change the tax. \n“The tax position is something we were naturally disappointed by, but we have not been vocal on it. We will deal with these matters behind closed doors,” said the challenger bank’s interim chief executive Tom Woods. \nIt follows TSB chief Paul Pester’s request last week that the threshold for paying the tax should be raised from £25m to £250m, arguing the levy will reduce the amount of funds available for small banks to invest and grow. Secure Trust Bank’s chief Paul Lynam is also pushing for small lenders to be excluded from the tax. \n\"The tax kicks in at £25m of profits, and we’ve made our views clear to the Treasury that we would love to see that level raised a bit,\" said Mr Pester. \"It takes a big chunk off our profits, it makes it more difficult for us to invest to grow, and to bring more competition to the UK market.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T18:45:29.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
