Manuel Balce Ceneta Share on twitter by Philip Baker If any investor was in doubt about what the future looks like, at least from the vantage point of the United States Federal Reserve's monetary policymaking committee, they now have more proof.\nDon't worry about China or Greece, and forget the surprise move by the Bank of Canada, which cut its cash rate by one quarter of a percentage point to 0.50 per cent on the back of downgrades to its growth forecasts.\nInstead, get ready for interest rates to rise in the US sometime this year.\nIgnored warnings Despite a warning from the International Monetary Fund that higher rates in the US comes at a tricky time with so much else going on around the globe – and it might be an idea to postpone them – the chairman of the Fed, Janet Yellen, said on Wednesday night there were \"always\" uncertainties to worry about.\nFor sure, there were no explicit hints on when the first hike would be, but it's worth noting that after Yellen's speech the San Francisco Fed President John Williams – a voting member of the FOMC – said that September would be a \"very plausible\" time to start raising them.\nTraders are betting that's only a 35 per cent chance so it will cause more heartache for investors if it pans out to be the case.\nOne reason Yellen is so intent to hike is the unemployment rate is close to 5.3 per cent and she was quite upbeat about consumers too, despite some disappointing retail sales numbers this week.\n Instead she said US consumers were in high spirits and happy to spend citing that \"households have both the wherewithal and the confidence to purchase big-ticket items\".\nYellen seemed to be pointing to the upbeat sales of cars in May and June.\nShe also said that \"If we wait longer it certainly could mean that when we begin to raise rates we might have to do so more rapidly.\"\nGood news for stocks The talk was the major reason why the Australian dollar is at around US73.65¢ but it's good news for a range of stocks that get a windfall from the weaker $A.\nUBS equity strategist David Cassidy has prepared a research note on what he terms the \"US dollar earners.'\"\nOn his numbers, around 13 per cent of the companies in the top 100 have \"significant\" exposure to earnings they get from offshore. That is around 50 per cent of total revenues.\n\"This does not account for \"minor\" currency exposures across other stocks where foreign exposure is say 10 per cent or 20 per cent of revenues. In addition it does not account for the second round import competing or demand multiplier benefits of a lower economy on company competitiveness or the general level of domestic demand,\" said Cassidy.\nFall of the Aussie The big fall in the $A over the past few years has been against the greenback and the British pound. This week the $A fell to its lowest level in seven years against the pound when it was fetching 47 pence, compared to 70 pence at the beginning of 2013.\nThe $A has fared better against the euro, the Japanese yen and New Zealand dollar.\nCassidy says it's possible for the $A to fall further and US65¢ to US70¢ isn't out of the question.\nOn his analysis of both exposure to the $US earnings theme, the basic fundamentals and valuation measure of each stock his strongest conviction picks are CSL, Resmed and Incitec Pivot.\nBut others that will benefit as the $A falls include Amcor, Ansell, Aristocrat Leisure, Brambles, Cochlear, Computershare, Crown Limited, JamesHardie Industries, Macquarie Group, QBE Insurance Group, Sonic Healthcare, Treasury Wine Estates and Westfield Corporation.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-07-16T12:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:04:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
