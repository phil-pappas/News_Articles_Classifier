We must also stop illicit financial flows and increase domestic resource mobilization,\" he told the audience. \n\"Only by doing all of these things together will allow us to leverage the billions of dollars in official development assistance to the trillions that we need.

He also noted the clear call in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda for the financial institutions to promote regional integration, and cited the need to increase investments in addressing hunger and malnutrition, including in sustainable agriculture. \n\"The Millennium Development Goals have significantly advanced poverty reduction and social development,\" he stated. \"Now we must tackle the unfinished business of the MDGs, consolidate achievements and put our world on a more sustainable and equitable trajectory.\" Africa \nAt the opening of a five-day conference on global development funding on Monday United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki … see more » Copyright © 2015 UN News Service.
