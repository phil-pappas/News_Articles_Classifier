Chris Hopkins by Michael Bleby Ageing Baby Boomer rockers will be able to fly like an eagle for longer, thanks to 3D-printed guitars that take kilograms off the weight of their axes.\nWhile lighter guitars might not be the only trick that keeps septuagenarian stars such as the Rolling Stones touring energetically, this new breed of guitars shows one immediate market for the fast-evolving 3D manufacturing technology that is promising a new industry of customised goods, even in high-wage economies like Australia.\nJust ask Kenny Lee Lewis. The Steve Miller Band guitarist, bassist and lyric writer of 30 years already has a five-string bass, printed out of nylon substrate and decorated with a beehive pattern. It's about 1.5 kilogram lighter than a conventional alternative.\n\"Gravity is a fierce thing,\" Lewis tells AFR Weekend by phone during a break in the veteran rock band's United States summer tour.\nA 3D-printed 5-string Hive bass, made by Olaf Diegel, and owned by Kenny Lee Lewis of the Steve Miller Band. Supplied Ageing musicians already do what they can to lighten guitars. Lewis's 72-year-old \"boss\" Steve Miller buys customised Fender Stratocasters made of lighter wood that cuts about 1kg from the conventional alternative.\n\"Even though it doesn't sound like much, when you have this thing slung around your neck for hours at a time it can make some difference,\" Lewis says.\nBut while the leader of a band with decades of hits, including Fly Like an Eagle , Rock'n Me and Jet Airliner, can afford his own customised guitars, not everyone can. Until now.\nNext step Lewis is focussing on the next step – printable guitars that are lighter and can be shaped to their players. Technology is already available that permits cheaper customised guitars.\n\"If we can design a guitar that matches your body shape and your position that you like to play in, and we could put the strap points to an angle such that your arm is exactly where you want it to be, we can design an instrument that will fit your personal body by scanning your body and then designing the guitar on a computer,\" he says. \"It's almost like a prosthetic guitar just for your body style.\"\nOlaf Diegel is a rock and roll fan and professor in design sciences at Sweden's Lund University, who started making 3D guitars as a hobby in 2011. The technology not only permits fancy designs such as Lewis' Hive bass – which Diegel made – but also allows customisation of weight balance and even shape.\n\"I could scan your stomach and put it into the back of the guitar so the guitar hangs on you perfectly,\" says Diegel, in Geelong for Deakin University's Design Technology Conference.\nDiegel, who has sold 50 of them so far – ranging between $US3000 ($3924) and $US4000 – says customised guitars show perfectly the scope for higher value-added products that customers will buy.\nOutside of a niche like guitars, the biggest applications will be in health, with customised implants, or products like shoe soles, Diegel says.\nMultiple materials Lewis, who has a commercial relationship with US company 3D Systems, says in five years machines will be able to print guitars out of multiple materials at once.\n\"We'll be able to have multiple-material machines where we can print an entire guitar – frets, coils, tuning heads with the screws in place.\"\nA relative spring chicken at 61, Lewis intends to keep playing for some time.\n\"I don't know about beyond 80, but I know I'll be playing through my 70s.\"\nAnd they will have the guitars to match.\n\"And we can even age it and make it look like it was old, so it could come out looking like a really old, vintage guitar.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T19:11:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
