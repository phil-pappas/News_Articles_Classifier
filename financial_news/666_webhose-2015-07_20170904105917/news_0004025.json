So we go on, locked together in misery \nIn 1991, the Kohl government introduced the \" Solidarity Tax \", effectively an earmarked tax on incomes, capital gains and profits to finance fiscal transfers from West to East Germany. The president of the Mannheim-based Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW), Clemens Fuest, has recently proposed to raise the Solidarity Tax rate from 5.5% to 8%, and to use the additional revenue to fund fiscal transfers to Greece, in lieu of the recurring bailouts and rescue packages. \nFuest’s logic is simple: Emergency ‘loans’ to Greece are not really loans. Much of it will be never be repaid; it will not be officially written off, but it will be decimated through all kinds of accountancy tricks. So either way, there will be a net transfer of resources from Germany to Greece, and according to Fuest’s back-of-the-envelope calculation, a 2.5 percentage point hike in the Solidarity Tax would cost the German taxpayer no more than the policies currently pursued. It would merely replace a roundabout, highly complex transfer mechanism with a direct and simple one. \nIt is the sort of proposal only an economist could make. It would be transparent, it would be honest, and it would be far more efficient than what is currently going on. And that is exactly why it has exactly zero chance of becoming a reality. Instead, the current course of muddling through will continue. Today, the Bundestag has ratified the third Greek bailout package with an overwhelming majority. The Social Democrats are in favour of it, the Greens are in favour, and a few grumbling backbenchers aside, the Christian Democrats are in favour of it too. \nBut the general population is far less enthusiastic. According to the latest survey , Germans are roughly evenly split on the issue, with 46% supporting the third bailout package, and 49% opposing it. Now (Frankfurt: 11N.F - news ) imagine Fuest’s proposal were implemented. The tax would immediately become known as the \"Greece Tax\", or something to that effect. Month after month, people would see on their payslip how much of their income is being transferred to Greece, euro by euro, cent by cent. That brutal transparency would tip the balance towards Germany’s own \"Oxi\" camp. \nThe Solidarity Tax was never hugely popular in West Germany, but it did not cause much discontent either. Most West Germans are prepared to subsidise East Germany, just as most people in London and the South East of England are prepared to subsidise the less prosperous parts of the UK. But unless very special circumstances apply (say, a country has been hit by a natural disaster), that sense of solidarity does not automatically extend to other countries, and this is one of the fundamental design flaws of the eurozone. Pushing transfer levels above what most people feel comfortable with is a surefire way to create resentment and bitterness. \nBefore the euro crisis, Greece was already a long-term net recipient of transfers from the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the European Cohesion Fund. This seemed to be roughly the level of transfers that taxpayers in the net contributor countries were prepared to pay (although the funding streams were never particularly transparent, so we cannot even know that for sure). But a currency union of countries that are so economically far apart requires transfer levels an order of magnitude above that. \nThe founders of the euro project hoped that a common currency would help to foster a pan-European identity: West Germans would be as naturally prepared to pool resources and share sovereignty with Greeks as they are with East Germans. That, frankly, has not happened, but in Germany and elsewhere, political elites are not willing to admit that to themselves. So they insist on dragging on, whilst trying to hide the true cost of their policies from their electorates. \n• AEP: Greece should seize Germany's botched offer of a velvet Grexit • Halle Institute's Reint Gropp: The Greek deal is in Germany's best interest \nWhen German politicians try to present themselves as hardliners in negotiations with Greece, don’t take it at face value. The tough-on-Greece rhetoric is really just a signalling exercise to assuage voters back home. \nYet the Greek crisis will not be solved by this this package, nor by the next, because the country’s structural problems are far deeper than that. The Greek economy is simply not productive enough to sustain incomes and government transfers anywhere near the pre-crisis level, and that cannot be solved by a few parametric changes. Greece’s economy needs a fundamental overhaul, and this overhaul will never happen as long as it is perceived as an imposition from outside. \nGreece needs to find its own way towards reform, which means that Northern European politicians need to stop meddling but they cannot stop meddling as long as Greece is a recipient of transfers that most Northern European voters are not really prepared to pay for. That is the fundamental dilemma behind this never-ending Greek tragedy, and as long as Greece remains within the Eurozone, it will continue in one way or another. \nDr Kristian Niemietz is senior research fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T17:26:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
