It means that less than one per cent (1.7 million) of Nigerians travels by air. About 85 per cent of that number travels regularly while 15 per cent may be the new people that travel for the first time every year. This might be because airlines like Aero, Dana Air and others introduced promo tickets, which slashed the fares so those who could not afford air ticket in the past were able to travel. \nHe attributed it to the economic empowerment of the average Nigerian and he also pointed out insecurity, lack of airfield lighting system in most of the airports and scarcity and high price of aviation fuel as major problems affecting airline operation in Nigeria. \nDuring the International Air Transport Association (IATA) AGM in Miami last month, the Director General and CEO of the international body, Tony Tyler said that one of the major factors mitigating against the growth of air transport in Africa is governments' tendency to over tax the airlines, aviation fuel and high cost of airport services. Tyler wondered why governments in Africa could not liberalise its skies for African airlines and allowed the region to be dominated by the Gulf and international carriers. \nThreat of Foreign Carriers \nWhenever the issue of why Nigerian airlines are not doing well is raised, the operators and others in the industry always blame government and its policies. They accuse government of giving multiple entry points to foreign airlines; they accuse government of its failure to introduce a policy that would force these foreign carriers to partner with domestic carriers. They also accuse government of not encouraging the training of indigenous technical personnel. \nThese operators complain of high price of fuel, the irregular supply of the product and the delays in the supply of the product. They also estimate that they lose over N21 billion annually to the failure of government through the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) to provide airfield lighting at about 16 airports in the country. \nThe operators argue that airlines could operate to many of these airports after 6:00 pm if there were runway lighting. For example, Arik Air or Aero could operate twice to Owerri airport after 6:00 pm. The airlines that operate to Port Harcourt International Airport, Omagwa schedule flights as late as 9:00 pm; so not having runway lighting stifle their operations to these airports. \nEntry Points \nDomestic carriers argue also that it is wrong for government to designate foreign airlines to operate from different airports in the country, insisting that these foreign airlines should partner with local operators so that when the international airline lands at one airport in the country, the domestic carriers will take the passengers to other destinations. Over 10 years ago Lufthansa had such partnership with Aero Contractors. So when the former landed in Lagos, Aero would take the passengers to Port Harcourt. \nBut now Lufthansa has been designated to operate from Port Harcourt, Lagos and Abuja, so such partnership is no more necessary. Other foreign carriers have been given similar multiple entry points, thereby defeating the possibility of any foreign airline partnering with local carriers to distribute passengers to other local destinations. \nIn recent meeting in Lagos Lufthansa top official said that the airline would not partner with any of the domestic carriers because many of them do not have IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) in order to maintain a given international safety standard. \nBut industry operators described that excuse as hogwash because in some other parts of Africa government made it compulsory that any foreign airline operating in that country must partner with local carriers. The foreign carriers usually assist such airlines technically until they upgrade to the safety standard that dovetail with their expectation. In Nigeria, because of lax government laws foreign airlines can operate anyway they want and repatriate all their earnings. \nPoor Policies \nThe Executive Chairman of AON, Captain Nogie Meggison has noted that aviation is not a standalone in a country; that it is a reflection of the policies and financial health of any country. He explained why Nigerian carriers are not doing well. \n\"When you take aviation and you say we are not doing well, you have to look at the policies that are on ground. Are the policies supporting us to grow? Where we are and where we can be are two different issues: the interference and different policies of the government have stifled the growth of aviation locally. \n\"A lot of bilateral treaties have been entered without carrying the aviation community along. These treaties were done without even looking at the potential or looking at the damage that it will create to the fabric of our economy in the long run, it is akin to selling the birth right of our children unborn, because a treaty is a treaty. It's like signing the Bakassi treaty and 20 years later you will say you don't want to sign. If when you sign a treaty like Bilateral Air Service Agreement (BASA) and you don't carry the aviation along then you end up putting our airlines that are not yet developed fighting a very developed market. It is not possible to fight,\" Meggison said. \nSelf-inflicted Wounds \nBut other aviation insiders allege that Nigerian airlines are suffering from self-inflicted wounds, acknowledging that some of government policies may not be favourable but these policies are not static but the airlines never come together to agitate for what they want with one voice. Industry analyst and CEO of Belujane Konsult, Chris Aligbe said since 1986, close to 30 years the aviation industry was deregulated and private airlines came into existence, they have not made any significant contribution to the development of the industry. \n\"There is nothing to write home about in terms of their contribution to the growth of the industry. From the records, over 32 domestic airlines have collapsed since the liberalisation in 1986 and what do we have today, what is their capacity, what has been their growth rate, what is their current position? \n\"Operationally we are nowhere in the industry and there is nothing put in place for the airlines' growth. There is nothing put in place for them to correct this position. All that every one of them wakes up to tell you is that if government can put good policy in place. What is the policy that you are asking government to put in place? They don't have the foggiest idea. \n\"They will mention aviation fuel and say the cost is too high, multiple taxation, these are not policies, these are things you take out, even when you take them out the airlines will still not do well for the simple fact that the airlines constitute the problems themselves. First, ownership, the owner-manager syndrome is still plaguing all the airlines. And most of the domestic airlines think alike,\" Aligbe said. \nLack of Unity of Efforts Why does the federal government designate foreign airlines to different international airports in the country? The General Manager, Corporate Communications of FAAN, Yakubu Dati said that government wants to make it easy for Nigerians to travel. THISDAY had learnt during the late Umaru Musa Yar'adua administration that it is government policy to ensure that every geo-political zone has an international airport so that it will be easy for Nigerians to travel overseas. \n\"Will it be easier for a passenger who lives in Kano and environs to travel from Kano to Lagos before he will travel overseas? I know the answer is no. By designating foreign airlines to Kano, government wants to make it easy for Nigerians to travel. The responsibility of government is to make life better for its citizens. Nigerian airlines have not prepared themselves to compete in this market. They do not cooperate among themselves. They should key into the market by cooperating among themselves,\" Dati said. \nHe noted that aviation is changing world-wide and what is in vogue now is merger and acquisition, strategy Nigerian airlines will not have anything to do with. \n\"Look at the partnership between British Airways and Iberia; Air France and KLM; in the US three big airlines and more merged to become one single airline, but ordinary cooperation has been difficult for Nigerian airlines. They want to go it alone and they still want government to sway everything to their favour when they cannot come with one voice to make their demands before government. Aviation of the future will be defined with merger and acquisition,\" Dati also said. \nHe said while Nigerian airlines are concentrating of schedule passenger service, cargo freighting is becoming the lucrative business in aviation now. \n\"Cargo is the future. 90 per cent of cargo freighting is one-way. Nigerian airlines can develop cargo operations from within,\" Dati said. He regretted that most of the owners of the airlines are not in the aviation business and that explained why when government gives then intervention fund they divert it to funds other businesses. \n\"We agree that our airlines need government assistance but if they are given money they may not use it to acquire aircraft or strengthen their operations. They will divert the money. We should have strong airlines for us to compete and this can work if the airlines decide to work together. The present one man business cannot work,\" the spokesman of FAAN said. \nNigerian airlines must agree to work together and in their togetherness approach government to introduce policies and regulations that will help them to succeed.
