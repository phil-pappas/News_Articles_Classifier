AP Share on twitter by Joanna Mather The government's response to multinational profit shifting will actively discourage the world's biggest companies setting up here and employing locals, Baker & McKenzie has told the Abbott government.\nThe global law firm has sharply criticised a legislative amendment that will give the Australian Tax Office more power to go after big companies suspected of shifting profits offshore and avoiding tax.\nBaker & McKenzie also says it would be \"highly inappropriate\" for Australia to adopt measures that expressly override existing tax treaties without any assessment by Treasury of the revenue to be gained.\n\"The amendments proposed â€¦ are inconsistent with the Australian government's objective of attracting foreign multinationals to carry on business in Australia using Australian-based employees and other resources,\" Baker & McKenzie's Asia Pacific head of tax, John Walker, says in a submission to Treasury about the draft amendments.\n\"As specifically noted in the explanatory memorandum, companies that reduce or entirely eliminate their staff in Australia are more likely to fall outside the scope of these provisions.\"\nThe federal government has put forward legislation that will amend the anti-avoidance rules in Part IVA of the Tax Act.\nIt is targeting 30 multinationals with turnover of $1 billion plus that divert profits derived from Australian customers to overseas tax havens through \"contrived or artificial tax arrangements\".\nCompanies found to be in breach will be required to pay back double what they owe, plus interest.\n Treasurer Joe Hockey had not provided figures for what could be raised by what is essentially his alternative to Britain's so-called Google tax.\nAccounting firm Ernst & Young urged the government to drop the changes, warning that the legislation as it is drafted will capture more than the 30 companies earmarked by the government. They have not been named.\n\"The proposed legislation oversteps the announced policy intention and would be uncertain in its application,\" EY's submission says.\n\"As such, there is the potential that it will impact a much larger range of multinational enterprises than the claimed targeted 30.\"\nAlf Capito, EY tax policy leader for the Asia Pacific, said banks and private equity firms were in the frame alongside technology companies such as Google and Apple, which have been the focus of most attention.\nBut the Tax Justice Network Australia says the laws do not go far enough. The $1 billion threshold should be replaced a $250 million one, the network's submission says.\n\"Also, there remains the concern that some [multinationals] will seek to load up their sales in Australia with intangible charges, especially around intellectual property, even if the draft legislation successfully closes off the loophole by which nonresident [multinationals] seek to avoid having a taxable presence in Australia.\"\nThe Australian Financial Markets Association says the Australian government is acting out of step with the OECD's plan to tackle base erosion and profit shifting.\nThe government's premature action had \"attracted a considerable amount of international attention and has caused concerns to be raised regarding the interaction between the proposed measures and Australia's obligations under Double Taxation Agreements\".\nSome companies avoid paying tax in certain jurisdictions by not setting up a permanent establishment, even though much of their economic activity occurs there.\nInstead, they book their profits in a low-tax or no-tax haven, which is an issue the legislation seeks to deal with. But submissions say the draft legislation does not adequately define \"low tax\" jurisdiction.\n\"If the government is going to pursue a retrospective change to our already-stringent general anti-avoidance laws which carry a potential 100 per cent penalty, then the legislation should at the very least be very clear in its application,\" Corporate Tax Association executive director Michelle de Niese said.\n\"In our view, the current draft does not get over this hurdle.\"\nAfter the measure was announced in the May federal budget, the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia said the Abbott government should be wary of throwing up new hurdles when Australia was already a high-cost place to do business.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-07-14T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:03:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
