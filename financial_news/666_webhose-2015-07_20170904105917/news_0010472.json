Spending on mobile devices is expected to decline for the first time since 2010, down 5.7% to $606 billion.\n“[The adjustment] was partly due to a continued slowdown in PC purchases in Western Europe, Russia and Japan in particular, largely due to price increases resulting from local currency devaluation against the dollar,” Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner, said in the statement.\nThe introduction of Windows 10 on July 29 is expected to slow professional demand for PCs in 2015, as businesses test the longer-lasting operating system. However, Gartner expects an adjustment to higher prices could increase sales of mobile PC replacements in 2016.\n“We do not expect the global PC market to recover until 2016,” Atwal said.\nSee also: AMD the latest to highlight floundering PC market\nTablet sales are also expected to be sluggish—down to 214 million from 226 million in 2014—due to their extended lifetime, while smartphones continue to show growth.\n“The tablet has become a ‘nice to have’ device, and there is no real need for an upgrade as regularly as for the phone,” said Roberta Cozza, another research director at Gartner.\nMobile phone sales are expected to increase to 1.94 billion in 2015, up from 1.88 billion in 2014.\nWhile first-time phone buyers in China have been driving worldwide growth in past years, the market has shown weaker performance recently, suggesting it is reaching saturation.\n“Vendors in China will have to win replacement buyers and improve the appeal of their premium offerings to attract upgrades, if they want to maintain or increase their market share,” said Annette Zimmerman, research director at Gartner.\nSee also: Windows 10 will not revive PC market\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T04:38:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
