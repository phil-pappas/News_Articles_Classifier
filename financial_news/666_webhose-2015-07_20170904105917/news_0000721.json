The relatively strong figure is up from an average of £1.9bn a month in 2014, £1.1bn a month in 2013, and £0.9bn a month in 2012. \nMeanwhile, small businesses’ demand for credit surged in the three months to June, registering the first sharp rise in a year. \nThe proportion of banks reporting a rise in demand outweighed those reporting a fall by a margin of 19.6pc a big turnaround compared with the previous three quarters . \nThe increase represents the fastest rise in demand for credit from small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) since 2013. \nMortgage lending is on the rise again \nBanks also said they are increasingly willing to approve loans to SMEs. A net balance of 26.6pc of banks - which reflects the percentage of lenders reporting rising loan approval levels less the proportion reporting falling levels - said they approved a greater proportion of SME loan applications in the second quarter of the year compared with the first quarter, the fastest increase in lending for five years. \nEconomists said the data indicate the UK economy is on the right track. \n“It is also encouraging to see that default rates fell across all sectors in the second quarter on mortgage borrowing, unsecured consumer credit and on corporate lending, especially for small businesses,\" said Howard Archer, chief economist at HIS Global Insight. \n\"This is clearly a reflection of recent sustained healthy UK growth as well as the help to consumer finances coming from negligible inflation, rising earnings growth and higher employment. \n“Low interest rates are also clearly a help. However, consumers and businesses need to allow for the fact that interest rates are likely to start rising from early on in 2016, even if the increase should be gradual and limited compared to past norm.” \nRetail deposit levels have also stabilised in the past six months, ending a period of rapid growth, according to the Bank of England’s study of banks’ liabilities. \nBetween 2012 and 2014 bank deposits grew in almost every quarter as cautious consumers chose to save more. But this trend started to reverse in the final quarter of 2014 and continued into first quarter of 2015, with lenders reporting declining deposit levels. \nWhile deposits have risen slightly in the second quarter, most banks expect savings to fall again in the third quarter, as households grow more confident and are able to spend more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T15:06:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
