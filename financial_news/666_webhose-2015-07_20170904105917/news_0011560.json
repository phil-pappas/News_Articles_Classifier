Disposable syringes have been identified as one of the fastest growing segments of the syringe market, accounting for approximately 70% to 80% of the global market in 2013. Globally, disposable syringes are becoming more popular than re-usable syringes, primarily due to cost, accuracy, sterility, and ease of handling. Increasing cases of needlestick injuries, strict regulatory guidelines, and overall growth in the injectable drugs market have been identified as the major factors driving the growth of the global disposable syringes market. \nThe disposable syringes market has been segmented into two major types: safety syringes and conventional syringes. Syringes equipped with safety mechanisms are known as safety syringes. Safety syringes have been further categorized into automatic retractable safety syringes, manual retractable safety syringes, and non-retractable safety syringes. Conventional syringes are not equipped with any kind of safety mechanisms. Conventional syringes have been classified into syringes without needles and syringes attached with needles.
