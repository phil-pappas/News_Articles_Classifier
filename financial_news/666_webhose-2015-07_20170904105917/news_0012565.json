Nobody can manufacture plastic products of below 20 microns,” he said. \nHe further stated: “Every plastic that is produced for packaging, you have to put a biodegradable material in it so that the plastic that would be produced would be biodegradable.” \nMahama Ayariga insisted, “after 90 days [starting from August 1] no plastic should be in the market unless it is biodegradable.” \nMore soon", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T19:47:51.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
