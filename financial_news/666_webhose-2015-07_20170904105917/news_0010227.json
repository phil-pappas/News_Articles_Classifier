When combined with the debt and economic restructurings underway, that will most likely result in slower growth, and more stimulative government policies to offset these downward pressures.\"\n\"Bridgewater's view that China faces debt and economic restructuring challenges, and that it has the resources and the capable leaders to manage these challenges, remains the same.\"\nChina 'on top' of risks Chinese authorities appear to have arrested the wild slide in the country's stocks, via a range of emergency measures such as banning large investors from selling shares, nudging banks to finance companies to buy their own shares, pumping liquidity into the market and vowing to investigate \"malicious\" short selling. Hundreds of companies were allowed to suspend their shares from trading.\nThe Chinese government is also trying to manage a challenging transition from a debt-fuelled investment-led economy to more consumption driven.\nDambisa Moyo, a global economist and board member of major miner Barrick Gold, said China was not immune from a slowing world economy, but the \"government is much more ahead than people give them credit for\".\nMs Moyo, a director of Barclays Bank, said she had confidence in the Chinese government's ability after meeting President Xi Jinping last year.\n\"It will be choppy and it won't be linear, but I think they are very much on top of the risks that the economy faces,\" she said.\n\"The authorities' willingness to really step in and use their tools is something the market discounts.\"\nThe Chinese government this month reported that its economy grew at a robust 7 per cent annual pace in the June quarter, though analysts questioned if the better-than-expected result was trustworthy.\nCommodity crunch Its moderating economy, from growth of 10 per cent a few years ago, has contributed to the recent plunge in the price of iron ore, Australia's biggest export commodity, as well as copper, gold, oil and natural gas.\nThe commodity crash is rendering many smaller Australian miners unprofitable, and raising the prospects of more mine closures and asset sales.\nQuestions remain about huge debts in China's shadow bank and overdeveloped real estate sector, as well as the apparent slow down in the economy.\nA simultaneous bursting of stock market and debt bubbles has occurred 28 times in major economies in the last 100 years, according to Bridgewater analysis.\nThese events created a \"depressant\" on real GDP growth of 1.8 per cent on average annually for three years, relative to what growth should have been without the twin crashes.\n\"We would expect China's outcome to be within that range, depending on how Chinese policymakers use their tools.\"\nMeanwhile, there are concerns the recent volatility may cause China's leaders to delay liberalising their economy and financial markets.\nFinancial reforms 'dragging their feet' David Li, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Committee and who served on China's Monetary Policy Committee, said the stock market crash would slow the country's planned financial sector reforms.\n\"Overall the financial reforms are still dragging their feet,\" Mr Li said in Washington at the Brookings Institution this week. He said it was difficult for entrepreneurs and small businesses to access credit, which was holding back the economy's potential.\nSeveral US companies reporting second quarter earnings this week have disclosed disappointing results in their China operations, though Apple's iPhone sales surged 87 per cent in greater China.\nMr Dalio's shift reflects growing pessimism on Wall Street about the outlook for Asia's biggest economy . Hedge fund tsars including Elliott Management's Paul Singer, DoubleLine's Jeffrey Gundlach and Pershing Square Capital Management's Bill Ackman all raised the alarm on China at a hedge fund conference last week.", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/giant-hedge-fund-bridgewater-flips-view-on-china-no-safe-places-to-invest-1437613434"], "published": "2015-07-24T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:12:35.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
