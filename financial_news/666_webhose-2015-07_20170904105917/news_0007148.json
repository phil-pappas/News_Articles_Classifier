The couple has been together for 21 years. \nLikewise, longtime partners Graham McReynolds and Clay France sent out wedding invitations in April for an early July wedding in the hope that it would be right after a favorable ruling. They live in Idaho, where a same-sex marriage ban had already been struck down, but they were waiting for assurance from the high court. \nBoth couples acknowledged they'll have some financial issues to sort out along the way, but those are the cart, not the horse. Advertisement \n\"We'll end up paying more in taxes, and we talked about that,\" said McReynolds, 55, a semiretired nonprofit executive who is now farming organic alfalfa and barley in Idaho with France, 50. \nTheir largest asset is their 900-acre farm, McReynolds said, so having survivorship rights to the property is more important than any potential dings from the so-called marriage penalty, under which some couples pay higher income taxes than they would as singles. \nRecognition on other estate-planning documents was also essential, he said. \n\"Many years ago, Clay was hit by a car, and I wasn't allowed in the emergency room,\" McReynolds said, an experience that left them craving a sense of security about legal and financial matters. \"It's important that we know without any worries that we have shared assets.\" \nWith many couples today deciding not to marry later in life because of complex financial lives, the sentiment is worth noting. Experts also say they'll be watching for a potential scaling back of benefits commonly afforded to unmarried couples now that everyone has the legal right to marry. \nHere are a few issues that experts said older couples should discuss: \nMedicare. Means-testing rules for Medicare could mean higher premiums for some same-sex couples on two levels, said Merrill Matthews, resident scholar with the Institute for Policy Innovation in Dallas. Fewer same-sex couples have a stay-at-home spouse, so as a group they tend toward higher incomes, meaning more may be caught up in means testing, Matthews said. (Higher premiums for Parts B and D kick in at $85,000 for individuals and $170,000 for couples.) \nAnd in couples with substantially different income levels, the lower-earning spouse who might otherwise not be subject to higher rates could be pulled into that category, experts said. \nSocial Security. Even couples with substantially similar projected benefits (meaning their benefits on their own work record would be higher than any potential spousal benefit) should review their Social Security claiming strategies. Sometimes, it makes sense for one spouse to file for benefits and then suspend them to earn delayed credits up to age 70, while the other spouse claims reduced benefits. \nAlso keep in mind that remarriage can terminate spousal benefits for some divorced recipients. \nDebt. Marrying into a partner's past debt is obviously something for discussion, but so are future debts. Figure out how you'll handle a lengthy nursing home stay, for example. \nEstate planning. In addition to survivorship issues on property transfers, the ability for couples to care for their spouses as they age is critical, even putting the financial cart before the horse, said Stuart Armstrong, a financial planner in Needham Heights, Mass.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T10:22:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
