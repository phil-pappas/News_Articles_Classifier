I am amazed we have had no response.\" \nBut RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: \"Despite strenuous efforts by union negotiators to press London Underground to address the issues of fairness, safety, work/life balance and equality at the heart of this dispute, they have come up with nothing in the talks this afternoon. \n\"The action is on and RMT will be mobilising picket lines and effective action with our sister unions and there are no further talks planned at this stage.\" \nFinn Brennan, ASLEF's organiser on the Tube, said responsibility for the strike and resulting disruption lay with the management of London Underground. \nHe said: \"They have played foolish games of brinkmanship, taking their offer off the table then denying they had done so.\" \nManuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: \"They were only interested in one thing, blaming the unions for the stoppage which they could have avoided by taking a serious negotiating position on Monday morning.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T07:09:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
