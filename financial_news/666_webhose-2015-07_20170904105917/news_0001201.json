Chris Ratcliffe Share on twitter by Philip Baker The Australian dollar may be at its lowest level against the greenback since 2009 but according to the Reserve Bank it hasn't fallen enough to make a difference.\nThe conundrum for the bank is the dollar has held its own against the our other major trading partners' currencies , such as the Japanese yen.\nSo the economy isn't getting the benefit that it perhaps would be if the dollar had fallen the same amount against those currencies that it has against the greenback.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia noted that \"the exchange rate had thus far offered less assistance than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the economy and that further depreciation seemed both likely and necessary,\" in the minutes of the meeting held earlier this month that were released on Tuesday.\nAccording to Paul Dales from Capital Economics, the RBA should get that \"further depreciation\" sometime next year.\nMore generally, he thinks the economic outlook will sour so much that it will prompt the Reserve Bank to cut the official cash rate to 1.5 per cent.\nThat all means the Australian dollar will weaken later this year to US70¢, from around US73.65¢ now, and then even further to as low as US65¢ next year, according to Dales.\nThat's the pessimistic view on the economy, but the minutes on Tuesday did reveal some pockets of optimism.\n Pockets of optimism They also tried to explain why the labour market hasn't worsened even though economic growth is below average. The answer lies in the slowing growth in population.\nBut if the dollar is to fall further it will be the strong US dollar that makes all the play as the US Federal Reserve hikes rates. The rising greenback is also playing havoc in commodity markets.\nWhile other commodity prices have been on a downward slide since the middle of 2014, gold hasn't fallen quite as much but is now playing catch up .\nAnd some.\nThe accompanying graph shows just how much gold has fallen as the greenback has fallen and maybe it won't fall that much further.\nGreg Gibbs from RBS, however, is also telling clients gold may still appear over-valued compared with global bond yields and break-even inflation expectations that reached record lows earlier this year.\nThere's no doubt gold has fallen, as the US dollar recovery takes off and markets start to price in rising rates in the US.\nBut Capital Economics point out that \"US monetary policy is likely to remain loose by past standards and any tightening is only likely to take place in the context of rising inflation risks, limiting the downside for gold\".\nThe other reason why gold has fallen so much is there has been no real safe haven demand buying through the turmoil sparked by Greece and the slump in the Chinese sharemarket.\nTraditional buying from central banks has also seemed to dry up but as Capital Economics note \"the still-low share of China's reserves held in gold (and those of most emerging market central banks) leaves plenty of room for further accumulation\".\nCapital Economics also thinks demand from households in China and India will resume its strong upward trend and are forecasting the gold price to recover to $US1200 per ounce by end-2015 and $US1400 next year.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-07-21T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:07:56.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
