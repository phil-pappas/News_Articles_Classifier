The lifeline until Oct. 29 is expected to pass the House on Wednesday followed by quick action in the Senate.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, vowed on Tuesday to also pass a highway trust fund extension with three years of funding in the hope the House would follow suit in coming months.\nLate on Monday, the Senate demonstrated strong support for renewing the Ex-Im Bank, whose charter expired on June 30, by attaching a renewal to its longer-term transportation bill.\nBut House Republican leaders effectively blocked that measure by arranging to pass the three-month highway extension and leave Washington on Wednesday. The maneuver gives the Senate little choice but to rubber-stamp the House measure.\nThat would leave the Ex-Im Bank unable to make or guarantee new loans until September or October, when its backers in Congress will have another chance to revive it. See Factbox\nPutting a positive spin on developments after days of Republican infighting, McConnell told reporters: \"The good news is the House ... has decided to process in early September a multi-year highway bill of their own.\"\nIf the House succeeds, the two chambers would work out their differences this fall, including the fate of the Ex-Im Bank. Conservative Republicans have been trying to kill the agency for years, calling it a relic of \"crony capitalism\" that subsidizes corporations like Boeing and General Electric.\nRepresentative Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking House Democrat, attacked the effort to kill the Ex-Im Bank, telling reporters it would put U.S. companies at a disadvantage with foreign competitors.\nThe bank, he said, \"ironically does not cost the taxpayer money but in fact gives money back to the Treasury.\"\nIn Ethiopia on Tuesday, President Barack Obama underscored the threat to exports by viewing a Boeing 787 Dreamliner that was sold to Ethiopia Airlines with Ex-Im support.\n\"These purchases are not made without the Ex-Im Bank,\" Obama said.
