Chris Pearce by Narayanan Somasundaram and Benjamin Purvis Australia's banks are among the world's most reliant on bond funding. That could be problematic if the kind of turmoil sparked in recent weeks by Greece and China flares up into a 2008-style crisis.\nEven after building up funding from savers, the four largest Australian lenders have an average loan-to-deposit ratio of 118 per cent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That's the biggest such dependence outside Spain, Italy and Brazil for global banks with a market worth of at least $US60 billion ($80.3 billion).\nAustralia's banks have over the past seven years sought to boost defences against a repeat of the post-Lehman Brothers debt squeeze by borrowing for longer, raising more money locally and lifting liquid assets to record levels. Continued reliance on bond markets is one reason the regulator says the four biggest lenders may need to boost capital ratios to be considered among the world's safest, according to Omega Global Investors.\n\"They're more reliant and therefore more exposed to an external event happening and their funding drying up,\" said Mat McCrum, a Melbourne-based investment director at Omega, which manages more than $US2 billion. \"If you're in the Australian banks' position, you want to make the argument that 'we're one of the safest in the world'.\"\nAustralia & New Zealand Banking Group, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and Westpac Banking Corporation rely on bonds for 33 per cent of their funding. They have $484.7 billion ($US360 billion) of notes outstanding between the four of them, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nStill, the big four are highly regarded by the big global credit assessors. They all have ratings of Aa2 at Moody's Investors Service, the third-highest score, and AA- at Standard & Poor's, the equivalent of one level lower.\nWhile funding costs have climbed in recent months, they remain far below the levels reached in 2009 and 2012. The average yield premium over swap rates for company bonds in Australia was 1.03 percentage points on Tuesday, about half what it was in early 2012, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data.\nBanks in Australia have strengthened their capital and their liquidity, Westpac's Group Treasurer Curt Zuber said by phone on Tuesday.\n \"We don't have a deep liquid government treasury bill in Australia, so when there's a flight to quality, it is to bank deposits and that is one of the defences for Australian banks if bond markets freeze,\" Zuber said. \"That's exactly what happened during the 2008 crisis and that's exactly what I'd expect to happen in the event of another crisis.\"\nMarket turmoil Local lenders are also viewed as considerably less risky than many global peers. While the cost of insuring the bonds of Australia's four biggest banks against non-payment has climbed, it's still below the level for overseas counterparts such as Spain's Banco Santander SA and Italy's Intesa San Paolo SpA.\nThe average price for Aussie bank credit default swaps climbed to as much as 73.5 basis points last week and was at 66.5 on Tuesday, according to CMA pricing. In comparison, the cost for Santander was 100 basis points, while contracts on Intesa were at 98.\nMarket turmoil has spurred a widening of credit spreads. CBA, the nation's largest lender by market value, this week priced $1.5 billion of five-year notes at 90 basis points more than the swap rate. ANZ and NAB both sold similar tenor notes in May at a gap of 80 basis points.\nGreece surrendered to European demands this week to stay in the euro after a six-month effort to stave off calls for more austerity. The stalemate, coupled with a Chinese stock market meltdown that wiped out almost $US4 trillion of value, spooked investor appetite and roiled markets.\nTo insulate themselves against such turmoil, Australia's banks have diversified their sources of money. For the four lenders, deposits on average made up 66.8 per cent of total funding, according to their latest filings compared with 57.5 per cent in 2010. They also doubled their average liquidity holdings to $151.8 billion in that period.\nDavid Ellis, a Sydney-based analyst at Morningstar, said: \"While the funding profiles of Australia's largest lenders are significantly better than 2008, it still doesn't eliminate the risk. If markets were to close for an extended period of time, Australian banks will be challenged.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:09:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
