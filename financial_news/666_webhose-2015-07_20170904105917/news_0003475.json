That said, the odds are still against you when you launch a campaign.\nHere are 10 things you should know that may help tilt the odds in your favor:\n1. -- Facebook won't save your project . Don't rely on the fact that you have gazillions of Facebook ( FB ) friends.\n\"Simply having many Facebook friends does not seem to have an effect on campaigns,\" according to a new working paper titled Crowdfunding as a Social Movement : The Determinants of Success in Kickstarter Campaigns by Rossitza Wooster, associate professor of economics at Portland State University, and Emily Robertson, an incoming economics graduate student at the University of California - Santa Barbara. The two studied two months of data on 3,348 Kickstarter projects from Nov. 9, 2014 through Jan. 9, 2015.\nMust Read: How Shopping for Car Insurance Can Put Money in Your Pocket\n2. -- Follow the numbers. Specifically, look at how many projects get successfully funded. On average, fewer than four in 10 projects attract enough support to trigger funding, but some categories do much better. Dance projects, for instance, succeed in full funding almost two-thirds of the time (64%.) The opposite is true of technology or journalism projects, where the odds are really against you. Those categories have a success rate of just 21% and 23%, respectively. Kickstarter, founded in 2009, publishes the statistics daily on which types of projects have succeeded. The data mentioned is from Thursday, July 23.\n3. -- Don't always follow the dollars . Just because a category of projects has attracted large sums of money doesn't mean you'll get any. Sometimes a few projects take the lion's share. Look at the fashion category. As a whole, it's won more than $54 million dollars of funding, but fewer than one in four projects actually get any money.\n4. -- Don't hound your friends for financial support. Remember, just because someone is nominally your friend doesn't mean you can repeatedly hit them up for money. It could actually be a way to lose friends. If you ask a friend once to donate to the project, that's probably enough.\n5. -- Make sure you get off to a good start. The same report by Wooster and Robertson says \"high initial participation can lead to herding behavior.\" In the simplest terms, if you get a load of your buddies to pile into funding the project on the first day, then others will likely follow. \"Projects that look promising on the first day do, in fact, garner larger contributions than projects with more anemic first days.\"\n6. -- Follow Kickstarter's advice. Kickstarter has a financial incentive for you to succeed. It charges a fee when the project gets funded. So listen to the company's advice: It says you should have a video on your project page, so make one. There are other suggestions in its online handbook, and it makes sense to follow them.\n7. -- Keep your promises. If you do promise your contributors a gift, make sure you send it to them. I have given twice to Kickstarter projects, both times modestly. Nevertheless, on one of those occasions, according to the offer, I was entitled to a T-shirt. It never came, even after inquiries to the project's leader. I'm doing perfectly well without the T-shirt, but the experience still left a bad taste in my mouth. Don't be the person leaving that bad taste.\n8. -- Be realistic. If you have never pumped up the tires on a bicycle then it's probably not reasonable to ask for thousands of dollars to build a prototype racecar. Likewise, if you rarely use a computer don't make out like you could program the next hit video game.\n9. -- Consider other ways to fund your project . Maybe you want to get your book published. So, write it and use Amazon 's ( AMZN ) CreateSpace to publish it. It has minimal costs and you can see how the book does. Who knows, you may be the next John le Carre. Going that route might actually be easier than launching a campaign on a crowdfunding site.\n10. -- Don't be discouraged if your effort fails. We don't remember Thomas Edison as the man who made many failed attempts to invent the light bulb. He is remembered as the man who eventually succeeded. If your first project doesn't get funding, then try again.", "external_links": ["http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13229480/1/10-secrets-to-kickstarter-success-its-not-about-facebook.html&title=10", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13229480/1/10-secrets-to-kickstarter-success-its-not-about-facebook.html", "https://www.kickstarter.com/hello?ref=footer", "http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2631320", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13229480/1/10-secrets-to-kickstarter-success-its-not-about-facebook.html", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13229480/1/10-secrets-to-kickstarter-success-its-not-about-facebook.html", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13229480/1/10-secrets-to-kickstarter-success-its-not-about-facebook.html&text=10"], "published": "2015-07-27T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T22:37:24.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
