Henry Zwartz Share on twitter by Will Willitts Investors are likely to start the week wary of any big bets, as they try to assess the $A's fall, iron ore's retreat and the Reserve Bank's policy meeting on Tuesday.\nThen there's what's happening overseas. Last week was the worst week for European equities since December. Viewed another way, it was just a few days of gains unwinding - though more volatility is virtually assured.\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 Index lost 5 per cent in the week after Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras announced a surprise referendum on creditors' bailout demands. The drop did little more than erase the previous week's rally and send European stocks back to where they were in mid-June, with volatility near a three-year high. Heading into the referendum, polls showed a deeply divided nation. Official results are to be released on Monday.\nLast \"week really felt like a game of chess which just needs to be played out,\" said Yogi Dewan, founder of Hassium Asset Management, which oversees $US1 billion from Gerrards Cross in the UK. \"You can be sure that we'll get more sharp moves on Monday. It's going to be another turbulent week.\"\nWeek Ahead Agenda Monday 6 July : Australia June ANZ job ads, US May pending home sales, Japan May industrial production, Hong Kong May retail sales, Germany June CPI.

The transaction, which prices Humana at $US230 a share, combines the second- and fifth-largest US health insurers by market size. The deal values Louisville, Kentucky-based Humana at 23 per cent more than its closing price on Thursday, and including assumed debt totals about $US37 billion.\nConsolidation continues to be necessary in the auto industry but there is nothing new to report on Fiat Chrysler's desire for a tie-up with General Motors, FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne said on Friday. \"The (need for) consolidation remains valid, no one has questioned its economic rational,\" Marchionne said, speaking on the sidelines of the launch of a re-styled version of its popular Fiat 500 hatchback.\nFrequent assurances by US airline executives that they would maintain \"discipline\" when adding seats on competitive routes were a red flag for antitrust regulators on alert for collusion between the four largest air carriers, antitrust experts said.\nEurope European stocks fell for a second day on Friday and German bonds gained as Greece called for a writedown on its debt and investors braced for a referendum this weekend.\nGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras short-circuited bailout talks with the nation's creditors by calling the referendum. Tsipras said on Friday that a 30 per cent so-called haircut and a 20-year grace period was the only way the country's debt could become sustainable. Greece has been pushing for debt relief to be part of the accord with creditors, which have insisted that the Athens government first accept more spending cuts and tax increases.\nMore than two shares declined for every one that advanced in the Stoxx 600, with trading volumes 36 per cent lower than the 30-day average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Banking stocks rose across the board, lifted by a report that Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group will create targets this fall to reduce cross-shareholdings.\nJapanese banks' large cross-shareholdings make them vulnerable to any slump in the stock market, the Financial Services Agency said Friday. The three biggest banks need to take steps to strengthen their capital base, including by reducing risks from stock-price fluctuations, the FSA said in its annual financial monitoring report.\nJapan's biggest banks still had about 16 trillion yen ($US130 billion) in equity holdings as of March, down from a peak of 39 trillion yen, Bank of America analyst Nana Otsuki wrote in a June 2 report. Sumitomo Mitsui had 3.8 trillion yen and Mizuho held 4.1 trillion yen, according to the note.\nThe Nikkei share average rose 0.1 per cent to 20,539.79 after losing as much as 0.4 per cent.

The Shanghai Composite Index shed 5.8 per cent to 3686.92 points on Friday, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.8 per cent to 26,064.11.\nThe China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has set up a team to look at \"clues of illegal manipulation across markets\". The regulator also plans to cut initial public offerings and capital raisings and support long-term investors entering the market to help stabilise prices. It also said China's official margin lender for brokerages, which makes loans available for stock market investment, would boost its capital base to 100 billion yuan ($US16 billion) from 24 billion yuan to expand its business.\nThe People's Bank of China rolled over 250 billion yuan of medium-term loans to banks late on Friday to ensure adequate liquidity in the system.\nChina releases second-quarter gross domestic product data on July 15, and many economists expect growth to dip below 7 per cent, which would be the weakest performance since the global financial crisis.\nCurrencies The Australian dollar fell to a six-year low on Saturday morning , hurt by disappointing domestic retail sales data and a continued sell-off in the Shanghai stock market. China is Australia's biggest trading partner and the Aussie is used as a proxy. The Aussie fell to US75.09¢, down 1.6 per cent on the day, and its lowest level since mid-2009. \"We expect the Aussie to trend lower towards US72¢ medium-term,\" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank.\nThe dollar index was down 0.1 per cent at 96.001 on Friday morning in New York, retreating from a four-week high of 96.422 hit earlier in the day. The greenback was buying 122.65 yen, 0.3 per cent lower on the day. The euro shed 0.2 per cent against the safe-haven yen but edged up 0.1 per cent to $US1.1100. \"With liquidity thin and the Greek referendum coming up, not many would want to take large positions going into the weekend. The US jobs report has taken the wind out of the sails for the dollar for the time being,\" said Alvin Tan, currency strategist at Societe Generale.\nIn his look into the new financial year, CommSec chief economist James Craig writes that: \"The Aussie dollar is largely expected to hold between US75-80 cents. Higher US interest rates could push the currency below the range but firmer Australian economic growth represents an upside risk for the exchange rate.\n\"The Reserve Bank is expected to stay on the interest rate sidelines for most of 2015/16. If the economy lifts as expected, underpinned by low interest rates and stimulus to small businesses, the RBA could start to lift rates in late 2016.\"\nAnother factor that will weigh on the Aussie is the likelihood that \"The US Federal Reserve is expected to start lifting rates by the end of 2015,\" Craig says, adding that Australia's key export partner, China, is \"expected to continue expanding at close to a 6.5-7.0 per cent annual rate.\"\nCommodities Iron ore capped the biggest weekly loss since April as shipments surged and data showed the slowdown in China's steel industry deepened, vindicating banks from Goldman Sachs Citigroup that had forecast declines. Ore with 62 per cent content delivered to Qingdao lost 0.7 per cent to $US55.26 a dry metric ton on Friday, falling for a seventh day, according to Metal Bulletin Ltd. Prices lost 11 per cent last week to the lowest level since April. Producers' shares sank, with Rio Tinto Group dropping to the lowest since 2009 in London and Anglo American falling to a 12-year low.\nOil prices dropped on Friday, in thin trading as most Wall St traders took the day off work, as a rising US rig count stoked more concerns about global oversupply. Brent crude for August settled down $US1.75 at $US60.32 a barrel, extending a downward trend since early May during which prices have fallen around 13 per cent. Front-month US crude was at $US55.52, down $US1.41, dropping below a trading range of $US57 to $US62 seen since early May.\nAsian liquefied natural gas (LNG) spot prices for August delivery rose on Friday, with a pick-up in activity driven by trading houses and portfolio players manoeuvring volumes between the competitively priced Atlantic and Pacific basins. The price of Asian spot cargoes rose to $US7.55 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), from $US7.30 the previous week.\nGold prices firmed on Friday, rebounding from a 3-1/2-month low as the US dollar softened. Spot gold was up 0.2 per cent at $US1167.73 an ounce by 1823 GMT.\nCopper prices are expected to come under pressure in coming weeks from a seasonal lull in Chinese demand. China accounts for about half of global consumption estimated at about 22 million tonnes this year. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange was untraded at the close on Friday but bid at $US5758 a tonne from $US5795 at Thursday's close.\nThree-month aluminium closed at $US1710 a tonne, down from $US1724 on Thursday. Aluminium is already under pressure from excess supply, a problem that is likely to worsen as metal leaves LME-approved warehouses at a faster rate after new measures to reduce queues. This oversupply is reflected in the physical premiums for aluminium over the LME cash contract. In Japan, aluminium premiums for July-September shipments were mostly set at a six-year low of $US100 a tonne, plunging 74 per cent from the previous quarter.\nMacquarie Wealth Management said the June result of the China Copper Survey shows the weakness in copper demand as \"the construction sector moved back to contraction again; transportation continued its falling trend; order book growth from power also lost momentum.\n\"The only spotlight has been an improvement in orders from the machinery sector, which only accounts for 8 per cent of total copper demand. With visible weakness in the near term, Chinese refined copper demand is likely to miss our forecast of 4.5 per centYoY by 0.6 per cent in 2Q15; and the rather muted progress of local infrastructure project, delays in power grid projects, and weaker consumption-driven sectors (such as automobile and home appliance) has prompted us to downgrade the demand outlook for refined copper from over 6 per centYoY to 4.5 per centYoY for 3Q15.\n\"We still firmly believe in a more visible recovery in Chinese copper demand, though now it looks more likely to be delayed to late 3Q15. As a result, our full-year forecast for refined copper demand is downgraded from 4.6 per centYoY to 3.9 per centYoY in 2015.\"\nAustralian Sharemarket The Australian sharemarket ended the week as it began - with a broad-based sell-off that was sparked by worries around an escalation in the Greek debt crisis ahead of a key referendum in the country on Sunday. The All Ordinaries lost 1 per cent to close on 5528 points, while the ASX200 was down 1.1 per cent to 5538, with all sectors losing value.\nFriday trading saw key sectors such as financials and materials decline steadily throughout the day, under pressure from a plunge in the iron ore price, disappointing May retail sales data, steep declines in Chinese bourses as well as fears about the outcome of a Greek referendum on a bailout proposal by its creditors.\nHow to survive the year ahead : The return of volatility and a shock end to the 2015 financial year would have any investor questioning whether the buy-and-hold strategy that has been so rewarding for the previous two years still fits.\nSuper funds may miss long-term targets : The annual gain generated by a typical super fund is tipped to be about 2 percentage points lower than long-term return objectives.\nStocks in Focus Iron ore's rout has hammered producers. Rio Tinto closed last week at $52.50, down by 2.9 per cent while BHP Billiton was down 3.3 per cent to close at $26.59. Fortescue Metals Group was down for the week by 8.54 per cent, ending at $1.82.\nThe biggest gainer of the week was the struggling Pacific Brands , up 46.9 per cent to 0.47 after a profit expectations upgrade.\nFellow retailer Kathmandu Holdings also surged, up by 23.29 per cent to $1.53 on the back of a takeover offer made to the board.\nStreet Talk Salteri's parking company could reap $100m ticket : The Salteri family-controlled Duncan Solutions parking management company is undertaking a strategic review, which could result in a $100 million sale.\nPort Hedland airport auction takes off in potential $200m deal : Port Hedland council has scrapped plans to offer a 49-year extension with the town's international airport, settling on a 50-year lease for the asset, which is expected to fetch about $200 million.\nCBA hybrid trading sparks interest : The scars of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's infamous PERLS VII hybrid deal are still evident.\nBroker Watch UBS has a \"neutral\" recommendation on James Hardie (JHX) and a $16.13 price target.\n\"JHX remains an attractive play on the A$ and has good leverage to the Australian and US housing recoveries. Capital management via buybacks offers share price support.\n\"Longer term we are less favourable on the 35/90 strategy. If the strategy is achieved it is likely to come at the cost of lower margin or JHX risk losing share. Valuation is full, in our view, with the current share price factoring in near perfect execution of 35/90.\n\"Capital management potential (company leaning toward buybacks over special dps) may offer additional share price support despite strong valuation. Free cash flow (post asbestos payments) does not cover JHX dividends on our estimates, with an $89m shortfall in FY16 ($189m shortfall post an assumed $100m buyback) and a $101m shortfall in FY17.\"\nCredit Suisse has an \"outperform\" rating on Brambles and a $13.20 target price.\n\"Technology driven improvements in asset tracking and efficiency could raise capital returns in its high quality pallet pooling business by 7ppts to ~30 per cent.\n\"Cost cutting and asset efficiency initiatives, along with high growth in the US RPCs and emerging market pallets could provide average earnings growth above 10 per cent per annum over the next five years.\n\"Brambles has significant upside in the next 12 months. Key catalysts include: Strong growth in RPCs business, particularly in North America. Management updates on the potential for new asset tracking technology to improve asset utilisation, particularly in the North American and European pallet businesses.\nJPMorgan has a \"neutral\" rating on GPT Group (GPT) and a $4.52 target price.\n\"We maintain GPT at Neutral on relative valuation grounds. We believe the group is well positioned to at least meet its FY15 earnings guidance. The impending new CEO appointment and any potential strategy changes following this appointment is the major item to watch.\n\"Our new Dec-15 price target is $4.52 ($4.53). Our price target has fallen 1c after incorporating lower assumed floating debt costs following the recent cash rate cuts in Australia and subsequent revisions to the 90 day bank bill forecasts from JPMorgan economists. Our PT is based on the midpoint of our $4.34 NAV and our one-year rolled forward NPV of $4.71.\n\"Our NPV is based upon a discount rate of 7.1 per cent applied to 5 years of our AFFO forecast. Our terminal value is based on a terminal cap rate, which reflects our CAPM derived discount rate of 7.1 per cent, less a long-term allowance for growth of 1.75 per cent i.e. R-G of 5.4 per cent. Our discount rate is based on an equity market risk premium of 5 per cent, and a risk adjusted beta of 0.53. GPT has one of the lowest betas in the sector, which we think reflects the high-quality portfolio and low risk balance sheet.\n\"Key upside and downside risks to our Neutral rating and price target include: major changes to interest rates, currencies and higher/lower than expected net property income. Company-specific risks relate to changes to what is a narrowly defined strategy; stronger or weaker-than-expected white-collar employment levels in the Sydney CBD; and a medium-term impact on shopping centre valuations should the current weak sales environment persist.\nUBS has a \"neutral\" rating on Recall Holdings and a $8.00 target price.\n\"Recall has entered into a binding Scheme Implementation Deed to be acquired by Iron Mountain (IRM) for a revised offer which now includes cash consideration of US$0.50 in addition to the original scrip offer of 0.1722 IRM shares per Recall share. Using the current spot AUD/USD exchange rate and IRM share price implies A$7.94 which represents a c.9 per cent increase to the current implied A$ bid price under IRM's previous all-scrip offer.\n\"Incorporating IRM's revised synergy estimate of US$155m implies a 2016 EBITDA multiple of 6x, or 10x on a pre-synergy basis.\n\"IRM's increased offer primarily reflects an increase in estimated cost synergies to US$155m, previously US$125-140m, following a period of due diligence with c.70 per cent (US$110m) to be realised by the end of 2017. This revised synergy estimate implies 13 per cent cashflow accretion (AFFO) to IRM after incorporating further dilution from the scrip component of the estimated 2016 distribution of pre-REIT accumulated earnings.\n\"Both Recall and IRM have indicated that further synergies could be realised as a result of potential real estate consolidation. Incorporating Recall's estimated synergies of $250m from December 2014 would result in 23 per cent cashflow accretion.\"\nEx Dividends Abacus Property Group, King River Copper, PLD Corp, Welcom Stranger Mining.\nFriday's Market Movers Top gainers: Echo Entertainment +2.4pc, Trade Me Group +2pc, Asciano +1.9pc\nTop losers: Mineral Resources -8.1pc, Greencross -5.7pc, Whitehaven Coal -5.5pc\nAustralian Economy Looking at the latest credit growth statistics from May, Michael Workman, economist at CBA Global Markets Research , writes that \"The RBA reports that private sector credit rose by 0.5% in May to be 6.2% higher over the past year. The drivers of the modest expansion in overall credit remain in place. Housing and business credit are expanding, thanks to very low interest rates. Personal credit expansion is quite weak, as consumers find alternative sources of finance.\n\"Housing credit rose by 0.5% in May to be 7.2% higher over the past year. It is running at close to its fastest annual pace since late 2010. The major driver is investor housing credit which is growing at 10.4%, the fastest since early 2008. Investor housing credit rose by 0.8% in May to be 10.4% higher over the past year. The recent APRA guideline to lenders set a ceiling for this category at 10%pa. APRA also introduced some other measures to control lending growth. There are some early signs that the changes may be working and that monthly and annual investor housing credit growth may be at their peak in this cycle.\n\"The background conditions for housing demand remain positive, in our view. National population growth remains firm, mortgage rates are low and the unemployment rate remains near 6%. federal government tax policies tend to overheat demand rather than supply. Investor interest in housing reflects the relative attractiveness of rental yields, and capital gains, in a low interest rate world. One of the arguments for buying investor housing is that Australia is set for a prolonged period of low interest rates and low yields. It means higher yielding investments are attractive, even low yielding residential property, rather than traditional bank deposits.\n\"Business credit rose by 0.4% in May with annual growth at a modest 5.2%. Higher growth in business credit growth would assist with the transition to higher levels of non‑mining capex in 2015 and 2016. Business surveys indicate a reluctance to commit to significantly higher investment until the domestic activity levels rise and guarantee higher profitability. It may also require a lower AUD as well, as a shield against import competition and a boost to export receipts.\"\n\"The risks lie with another RBA rate cut. Strong residential construction activity and a pick‑up in consumer spending are providing a significant offset to the mining capex decline. But, for a return to average growth, there needs to be a stronger contribution from other areas of construction and public sector infrastructure. Net exports are set to provide a positive contribution to growth over the next few years. ... Markets are now pricing in the chance of another interest rate cut by March 2016.\"\nDebt Markets Wei Li, China and Asia economist at CBA Global Markets Research , offers insight into the Peoples Bank of China recent rate cut.\n\"Cutting the required reserve ratio (RRR) and interest rates at the same time by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) is like firing a bazooka and RPG together. The key difference is that the RRR is more of a quantitative monetary policy (altering the aggregate credit supply in the system), whereas interest rates are price‑based measures (sometimes favoured in a market economic system). Nevertheless, both are pro‑growth monetary policies, and should encourage credit growth and a firmer economic recovery over time.\n\"Over the past weekend (on 27 June), the PBoC cut the RRR and interest rates at the same time. The RRR was lowered by 50bps for selected banks that have lent over 50 per cent of their new loans in 2014 to either small companies (小微企业) or agricultural developments (三农), and having at least 30 per cent of their outstanding loans in either of the two sectors.\n\"Finance companies (often focused on internal funding management of their large corporations) also saw their RRR lowered by 300bps. The PBoC also cut benchmark deposit and loan interest rates by 25bps. The new benchmark 1y deposit and rate is 2 per cent, and the new benchmark 1y loan rate is 4.85 per cent. The new policy took effect on 28 June.\nIt is \"clear that Beijing wants to channel more funds into areas that are consistent with China's long‑term economic reform plan, rather than seeing extra liquidity flowing into heavy industries and real estate sectors again, which are already in oversupply\".\n\"We estimate the targeted 50bps RRR cut to release about CNY 500bn ($106 billion) new liquidity into the market,\" CBA said, adding that it was maintaining its \"7 per cent GDP growth forecast for China in 2015, as Beijing renames growth as its top work priority\".\nwith Reuters, Bloomberg, AAP, AFP\nComments?
