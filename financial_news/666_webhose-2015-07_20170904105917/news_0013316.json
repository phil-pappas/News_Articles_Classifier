The pledge also involves increasing the amount of non-fossil fuels in its energy mix to 20 per cent. \nFrance is hoping that a global emissions cutting deal can be agreed on at the UN climate summit in Paris at the end of the year. \nChina, as the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitter, could encourage other developing countries. \nEkman says the announcement in Paris is symbolic, but does not mean that China will follow through. \n\"It's really too early to say how China will behave during the summit, but for France, it's a key topic,\" she said, adding that this is more important for France than it is for China. \nBy announcing its goals in Paris, \"maybe it's a way to move on to topics of greater interest to the Chinese. One of these topics, of course, is economic cooperation.\" \nInvestment sceptic \nFrance is looking to rebalance a 26-billion-euro trade deficit with China by encouraging more French products to be exported. \nBut not everyone welcomes the deals that are being made between China and French companies during Li's visit. \n\"Until now, we have had very little benefit from cooperation with China,\" Jean-Vincent Brisset, of the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs, told RFI. \nHe says Chinese companies want access to European technology to copy it. \n\"We are helping them to counterfeit lots of things,\" he says about French and Europe cooperation with China. He gives examples of military equipment: \"They have ships that are really just counterfeit French ships; they have helicopters that are copies, with help from Eurocopter.\" \nLi will be in Marseille on Wednesday and is expected to finish his French visit in the city of Toulouse, where he will visit the Airbus headquarters.
