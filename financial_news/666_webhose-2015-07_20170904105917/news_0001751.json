Prasa has to date received 13 new diesel locomotives that are too high for the long distance routes they were intended for,\" according to the report. \nThe 13 Afro 4000 diesel locomotives that have so far been delivered to Prasa are worth R600m and form part of a larger R3.5bn order for 70 new locomotives. \nPrasa hit back two days later, saying the locomotives it had acquired were the best in the world, and that they were suited for local tracks. \n\"We meet the safety standards,\" said Montana at the time. \n\"We have bought one of the best locomotives in the world and we are not even apologetic about that.\" \nThe Prasa board said it would address the media on Montana's removal on Friday. \nThe transport ministry and department thanked Montana for the \"sterling leadership and guidance he provided during his seven years of service\" at Prasa. \n'We find it hard to comprehend' \nThe Democratic Alliance claimed Montana's removal reinforced its call for Peters and the rail agency to come to Parliament and account for so-called scandals. \n\"The minister has been conspicuous in her absence and has yet to show any leadership in dealing with these allegations as the political head,\" DA MP Manny de Freitas said in a statement. \n\"It is high time that she breaks her silence.\" \nThe SA Transport and Allied Workers Union said it was disturbed by Montana's removal before his notice period had ended. \n\"We have not been given the full details, but we find it disturbing that he is released,\" Satawu general secretary Zenzo Mahlangu told News24. \n\"That he doesn't serve notice and is told to go and stay at home and be paid. \n\"We find it hard to comprehend what has happened. The government does not have endless money to pay chief executives to stay at home.\" \nMahlangu said processes needed to be followed if there were any transgressions. \nThe union was disappointed that the discussion on these issues was taking away from the issues relevant to rail transport. \n\"Whatever happens in the boardroom must not disadvantage the commuter. Service must continue to be provided without interrupting and making personal issues a stumbling block,\" he said. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:08:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
