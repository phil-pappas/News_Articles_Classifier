It’s the second price reduction from British Gas this year, bringing bills down by an annual average of £72. \n“There are a range of costs that make up energy bills, some decreasing and others increasing. This reduction reflects our lower projected total costs for 2015 and 2016 and we’re pleased that customers will see the benefits in their gas bills ahead of next winter. \n“We will also continue to help our customers understand and control their bills by leading the national drive to install smart meters, and by developing innovative products that offer them the latest technology to manage their energy usage.” \nAnn Robinson, Director of Consumer Policy at uSwitch.com said: “This is a bold move by British Gas which could spark a major price war between suppliers. \n“Although these price cuts are to be welcomed, the average British Gas dual fuel standard tariff customer will see their annual bill cut by less than 3%. \n\"Wholesale energy costs, which make up around half of bills, are at their lowest levels in five years and so reductions can and should be in double-digits.\" \nMore follows...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T14:31:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
