It closed at 102.45/65 per dollar a week ago.\n\"The market is cautious,\" said one senior trader.\nThe new central bank governor, Patrick Njoroge, has said the there was no \"optimal level\" for the exchange rate but said the central bank was concerned about volatility.\nTANZANIA\nThe shilling is seen under pressure, and could trade in the 2,130-2,140 range.\nCommercial banks Quote: d the shilling at 2,110/2,120 to the dollar on Thursday, weaker than 2,060/2,080 a week ago.\n\"The shilling is expected to continue weakening against the dollar in the days ahead on the back of demand for dollars from oil companies and traders amid limited supply,\" said Sameer Remtulla, a dealer at Commercial Bank of Africa Tanzania.\nUGANDA\nThe shilling is forecast to trade in a range of 3,400-3,420 but with a weakening bias.\nAt 1013 GMT commercial banks Quote: d the shilling at 3,410/3,420, weaker than last Thursday's close of 3,320/3,330.\n\"Some end of month demand from corporates will come in and also in the interbank there could be short position covering,\" said Ali Abbas, trader at Crane Bank.\nAbbas said banks would cover their short positions due to a surge in liquidity after the central bank injected 474.3 billion shillings ($139 million) into the market on Thursday.\nNIGERIA\nThe naira is seen unchanged on both the interbank and parallel markets on the back of growing forex reserves and a decision by the central bank not to devalue the currency.\nThe naira was trading at 241 to the dollar in the parallel market, unchanged from last week, and 198.50 to the dollar on the interbank market from 197 a week ago. The bank introduced tight controls on foreign exchange trade in Feb.\nThe central bank on Friday said the naira, which has lost around 15 percent against the dollar over the last year, was \"appropriately priced\" at 197 per dollar.\nZAMBIA\nThe kwacha could recover, supported by Zambia's sale of a $1.25 billion Eurobond on July 23.\nAt 1100 GMT on Thursday, commercial banks Quote: d the kwacha at 7.6350 per dollar versus a close of 7.5500 a week ago but forex traders said the local currency looked bullish.\n\"The kwacha has new found vigour, buoyed by positive sentiment from the Eurobond. The market continues to unwind long dollar positions,\" the local unit of South Africa's First National Bank (FNB) said in a note.
