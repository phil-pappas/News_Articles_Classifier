Photo: Reuters\n ï»¿ Lu Tao can't sleep. He gets bouts of panic at night. And he's too afraid to tell his parents why.\nThe 23-year-old university student in Hangzhou, a city on China's eastern seaboard, has a stock-market problem. He borrowed 200,000 yuan ($43,515) from mum and dad, piled the money into mainland shares without their permission, and got caught in the biggest sell-off in two decades.\nAt first, Lu considered liquidating his holdings and owning up to the losses. But now that China's government has arrived to rescue the market, he's decided to bear the sleepless nights, keep his parents in the dark and stay invested.\n\"I won't exit,\" he says. \"I still see value and I believe government policies will safeguard it.\"\nAdvertisement Lu's unwavering faith in Chinese policy makers illustrates the growing risk of moral hazard in the world's second-largest stock market, an unintended side effect of government efforts to halt a $3.9 trillion ($5.3 billion) selloff. While the support measures have helped spark a 13 per cent rally in the Shanghai Composite Index over the past three days, the risk is that investors come to view the market as a one-way bet - fuelling bubbles that authorities may struggle to control.\n\"You don't want to give the market the impression that whenever it comes down, you'll be there,\" said Tai Hui, the Hong Kong-based chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, which oversees about $US1.7 trillion.\nPricey valuations The moral hazard problem is particularly acute in China because authorities stepped in at a time when stock valuations were still expensive, said Francis Cheung, a strategist at CLSA in Hong Kong. At 60, the median price-to-earnings ratio on mainland bourses is higher than in any of the world's 10 largest markets. The ratio was 68 at the peak of China's equity bubble in 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nThe Shanghai Composite slipped 0.4 per cent at 9.37am local time on Tuesday.\n\"The government is in a dilemma,\" Cheung said by email. \"They promoted the market on its way up, and now that it has crashed, there are investor expectations that the government will rescue them.\"\nPolicy makers have gone to unprecedented lengths to prop up stocks. They banned large shareholders from selling stakes, ordered state-run institutions to buy equities, allowed the central bank to finance stock purchases and let more than half of companies on mainland exchanges halt trading.\nRescue plan Bulls are using the measures to justify investing in shares. Chen Xiaofei, an investment adviser at Changjiang Securities Co in Shanghai, tells margin-trading clients - some sitting on losses of as much as 60 per cent - to stick with their positions because state support will lead to a rally.\n\"In China, once the government is acting, there's no difficulty we cannot get over,\" Chen said.\nOf course, China isn't the only country with a history of intervention in markets. Hong Kong authorities bought $US15 billion of shares to prop up prices during the Asian financial crisis in 1998, while the US Securities and Exchange Commission temporarily banned short selling on some stocks during the global financial crisis seven years ago.\nIn China's market, not everyone is willing to wager on the rescue effort. Meng Zhang, a university student studying human resources in the US, liquidated her holdings of mainland equities as the Shanghai Composite started to fall in June. She has no plans to re-enter the market, saying real estate is a better bet.\nStill confident \"There is no logic in the stock market,\" Meng said. \"There's too much risk.\"\nStill, pessimists may be the minority among China's 90 million individual investors, who drive more than 80 per cent of trades on mainland bourses. Fifty-four per cent of those surveyed by CLSA predict shares will rise in the next three months, while 66 per cent say they expect the government to support the market. About 77 per cent say they'll maintain or boost holdings over the next month, CLSA wrote in a July 6 report.\n\"The bailout effort by the government is not cost-free,\" Larry Hu, the head of China economics at Macquarie Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong, wrote in an e-mail. \"It might encourage more aggressive risk-taking.\"\nStaying invested in Chinese shares has been tough on Peipeng Xing, a client manager at a bank in Beijing. As he watched a year's worth of stock-market gains get erased in two weeks, the 23-year-old says he lost focus at work and was under so much stress at one point that his throat began to swell up.\nEven after all that, Xing still has faith that stocks will rally.\n\"The government's series of measures will eventually take effect,\" he said. \"I'm still confident in the market's future.\"\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:12:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
