PUBLISHED: 17:54, Tue, Jul 14, 2015 | UPDATED: 18:06, Tue, Jul 14, 2015 PH ritish label Alie Street launched in March \nThe dress brand, launched in March and recently on show at Wimbledon where star tennis mum Judy Murray wore one of its navy lace numbers, has just added bridal wear to its rails. \nWedding gowns cost from £150 to £550, with every silky flounce and satin panel produced in Britain. \nBut with a business model like that, even adding in the lower costs and bigger sales opportunities possible with e-commerce, can founder Tiffany London measure up to what might seem a rag trade mission impossible? \nLondon has excellent form. Tiffany Rose, her special occasion maternity line, all British made too, began with a £600 credit card investment in 2003 after she saw a gap in the market when her pregnant sister struggled to find a dress for a wedding. \nThe chance to dress women so they feel confident and comfortable was born. Now the label, known for its affordability, luxurious fabrics, comfort and flattering silhouettes for serious curves, has celebrity fans such as opera singer Katherine Jenkins, Strictly presenter Tess Daly and former Spice Girl Emma Bunton. \nIt sells in 80 countries, both online and through boutiques bringing in £3.4 million sales in 2014, 75 per cent for export. \nLondon, 43, who comes from an events management background and parents who were entrepreneurs, has stuck to her game plan, a mix of control and fast response flexibility, by extending her headquarters in Surrey where 19 are employed in the design studio and despatch warehouse.

But with help from e-commerce, over time mind sets have changed too witnessed in the rebirth of the British clothing manufacturing industry, she says. \n“Our focus is on style and fit, sensuous textures, unique colour palettes and artistic patterns. Designing for the pregnant body we learned the importance of fabric selection and garment construction. \n“The lower operating costs and wider reach online made it possible for someone tenacious like me to try, to have the means to test the market and respond to feedback. \n“That evolved into providing genuine helpful customer service, express worldwide delivery and fuss-free returns. \n“Alie Street, the sister company, came about through demand from our customers. The collections are not influenced by trends, but a genuine understanding of dressing the female body. Our focus is on style and fit, sensuous textures, unique colour palettes and artistic patterns Tiffany London \n“Our customers are late 20s and 30s plus, professional women who want style, quality and practicality. Events and occasions play a bigger part now in people’s lives, there is a red carpet everywhere. Our bridal and cocktail dresses are best sellers. \n“Germany is big for us, several television presenters wear our dresses, they like the classic look. We are also doing well in France, where they favour our more vintage styles.” \nBut London, a mother with young children, whose husband Christian also works in the company handling the tech side, is also very conscious Alie Street is a move into the mainstream. \n“It is a much more saturated market than maternity,” she agrees. “We have funded it from Tiffany Rose’s success. We have always grown organically. However we do recognise this is a competitive space that’s why we moved quickly to launch the bridal collection.” \nLondon is also realising her ambition to create a manufacturing eco-system by building up a production network of five producers around the country. \nIt wasn’t easy finding them, she says, because of the small batch orders and production techniques required. “We ensure steady workflows but must have makers with the capability and machines to work with delicate silks, satins and lace.” \nAnother entrepreneur Kate Hills, who set up online hub Make it British five years ago promoting UK manufacturing and British-made brands, was a major support, says London, helping her source new factories and fabric suppliers. \n“I firmly believe that manufacturing in the UK is thriving, cost-effective and sustainable,” says Hills. “Our role is to help firms to find factories in the UK that can make their products. The demand from designers and brands looking for local manufacturers has increased significantly over the last few years as everyone is looking for a quicker route to market and to invest less upfront in stock.” \nLondon is also playing another part in fuelling the enterprise boom. “I believe in staff retention and being in business for the long haul,” she explains, “so when one of my designers said they wanted to leave to set up a manufacturing business, I invested £10,000 to get her started. I am now her principle customer, we are both winners.” \nwww.aliestreet.com, www.tiffanyrose.com, www.makeitbritish.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T00:29:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
