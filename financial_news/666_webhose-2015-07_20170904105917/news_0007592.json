Vismedia by Peter Ker Aspiring coal miner and federal MP Clive Palmer believes Australia should take a firmer approach to China's controversial new coal-testing regime and respond in kind with new tariffs on iron ore exports.\nThe comments come as the Australian and Canadian governments continue to push China for leeway on the new testing policy, which has resulted in at least one shipment of Australian coal being turned away at the Chinese border.\nCoal has traditionally been tested for ash and sulphur levels, but Chinese customs, which presides over the second-largest market for Australian coal, has started testing coal arrivals recently for fluorine, phosphorus, mercury, arsenic and other trace elements.\nUnder the stricter testing regime an Anglo American shipment of coal from Australia was rejected at the Chinese border, which has alarmed miners and governments in coal-exporting nations like Australia, Canada and South Africa.\nRumours that Canada might lodge a complaint over the issue with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) have swept the coal mining industry in recent weeks, and when asked if it was considering such a push, a spokesman for Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development did not rule out a formal complaint.\n\"Canada is seeking clarification of these new regulations and will continue to monitor their implementation in close collaboration with the Canadian embassy in Beijing, as well as Canadian coal exporters,\" the spokesman said. \"It is our hope that China will continue its efforts to implement this measure with full transparency and work constructively with exporters to find ways to reduce testing delays.\"\nA WTO spokesman confirmed that no such complaint had been lodged, but noted: \"Sometimes governments make statements before taking a complaint to the WTO.\"\nNot aware of complaint The Australian government was not aware of a WTO complaint over the issue, and Trade Minister Andrew Robb has been tackling the matter in talks with Chinese Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng.\nBut Mr Palmer, whose private company Waratah Coal is seeking to develop a new coal mine in Queensland's Galilee Basin, said Australia could be taking a firmer stance on the issue.\n\"They turn back some of our coal exports to give us a reminder of their market position,\" he said.\n\"If Australia retaliated and put taxes on iron ore it would a different situation. We are not using what we have got to Australia's advantage.\"\nThe friction over coal comes despite June's signing of a free-trade agreement between Australia and China, which required the immediate removal of tariffs on coking coal and the removal of tariffs on thermal coal before June 2017.\nUncertainty over the testing regime has prompted Australian miners to divert many coal shipments to other markets like Japan and Korea, where acceptance is more predictable.\nAs a result, Chinese imports of coal in the first five months of 2015 were 38.2 per cent lower than in the first five months of 2014, and that import slump came despite Australian coking coal production rising over the past 12 months and Australian thermal coal production falling by less than 1 per cent.\nDesigned to reduce imports Many pundits believe the tests are designed to reduce imports in a bid to support struggling Chinese coal miners, many of whom have already been given tax breaks at provincial level.\nCiti's Shanghai-based commodities analyst Ivan Szpakowski said the tests were typically not being conducted on Chinese coal, despite the law applying to all coal.\n\"It has been difficult for industry participants to know which cargoes will pass the trace element testing and which ones will not,\" he said.\n\"Unlike some of the other countries that do these tests, like Japan, the Chinese are only willing to use the readings from their own testing agencies and they won't accept any third-party verification.\"\nDespite the international push to make the testing regime simpler for coal producers, Mr Szpakowski said China might make the trace element limits even stricter.\n\"They may be rolling out a second wave, so that is something to watch for,\" he said.\nAustralia and Canada are already third parties in a WTO complaint the US has lodged against China in 2015 over assistance given to Chinese exporters.\nThe same nations are involved in a WTO complaint over Chinese limits on exports of tungsten, molybdenum and rare earths.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T14:50:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
