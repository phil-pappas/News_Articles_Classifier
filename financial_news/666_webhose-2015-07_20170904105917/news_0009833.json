We recently drove to visit my brother in-law who lives an hour away. He asked me if he and his wife could catch a ride with us when we drove back home to New York City. My wife and I own a Nissan Sentra, with a maximum seating of two people in the front and three in the back. When I reminded him of this, he suggested that I put one of my children on a lap of one of the adults in the back seat. I explained that if there was a car accident the child on the lap would not be sufficiently protected.\nHe then asked if I was okay with his wife sitting on his lap in either the passenger or the back seat. I told him that they were adults and, if they felt like doing that, it was okay with me. However, I did request that if it caused me to get a ticket, he pay me back the cost of the ticket. Afterwards, it struck me that if I was to get a ticket for transporting my brother in-law and his wife in this fashion, I could also end up getting points added to my insurance. That could cost me extra money. Am I possibly in for more than just a ticket if spotted by the police?\nHamilton, NYC\nDear Hamilton,\nI’m gob-smacked that someone would ask this, especially with children in the car.\nI’ve read several tragic stories of people overcrowding their car and getting into fatal accidents. This crash in the U.K. last month injured eight people in a five-person Volkswagen Golf; six teenagers were killed and two were injured when a Honda Passport SUV — which normally seats five people — flipped over in northeastern Ohio. And there are many more examples from Texas to Florida, where an overcrowded church van crashed last March, killing eight of the 18 people in it. The Dodge Ram Wagon B3500 Maxi in that crash was designed to seat only 15.\nAn overcrowded car can be a hazard in itself. If you did have to stop suddenly or had a car accident, the unbelted person sitting on the lap of another would have no protection and be more likely to cause injury to others in the car. Cramming too many people into a car is a distraction to the driver and it reduces his field of vision. It also creates unequal distribution of weight that could increase a car’s chances of rolling over. And it hurts the steering and/or puts undue pressure on the vehicle, such as dragging the exhaust or brackets over speed bumps or on a hill, which could also cost you more money to repair.\nRead: Elderly drivers are NOT the most dangerous on the road\nShockingly, some people still don’t wear their seatbelts. Last year, seat belt use rates in the U.S. ranged from a low of 68.9% in South Dakota to a high of nearly 98% in Oregon, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; 19 states, including Georgia, California, Alabama, and Minnesota, rate the highest for wearing the belt. Seat belt use is as low as 69% in South Dakota, 70% in New Hampshire (a state with license plates that say “Live Free Or Die”), 74% in Arkansas and 76% in Massachusetts. Overall, 87% of American drivers wore a seatbelt last year versus 82% in 2007.\nBut your question was related to finances, not losing your life, so let me address that too, although the latter should still be the foremost in your mind. You’re right about one thing: You could get a traffic ticket and points on your license if you are carrying too many passengers, and you might even end up in traffic court. Although your brother-in-law actually asked to car-share with his wife sitting on his lap for a relatively short journey, you are leaving yourself open to litigation from him and his wife, if you did have an accident. If that did happen, good luck filing an insurance claim with a car that was overloaded.\nThe next time he asks you this, tell him to take the train.\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, regifting, or any tricky money issues relating to family and friends?
