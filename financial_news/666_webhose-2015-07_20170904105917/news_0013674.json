There's no doubt about that. Whether with the euro or temporarily without it: only the Greeks can answer this question. And it is clear that we will not leave the people in the lurch,\" he said. \nBut it is far from clear how a temporary exit from the 19-nation euro currency bloc might work. Some economists have raised the idea of a temporary suspension, whereby Greece would revert to a national currency for a number of years until its economy stabilized. \n\"TERRORISM\" \nGreece's European partners say the euro zone is better placed to minimize the impact on its vulnerable southern flank from a Greek exit than several years ago when the debt crisis exploded. But Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said Europe stood to lose more than Greece. \n\"If Greece crashes, a trillion euros (the equivalent of Spain's GDP) will be lost. It's too much money and I don't believe Europe could allow it,\" he told Spanish newspaper El Mundo. \nVaroufakis reiterated he would resign if Greeks vote 'Yes', and accused creditors of trying to terrorize voters by capping a liquidity line to Greek banks. \n\"What they're doing with Greece has a name: terrorism,\" he told El Mundo. \"Why have they forced us to close the banks? To frighten people.\" \nIn an article in the Greek daily Kathimerini, Varoufakis wrote: \"The EU will have no legal grounds to throw Greece out of the euro, and then the real negotiation will start with creditors.\" \nGreece accounts for barely 2 percent of the euro zone’s economic output, but its exit would represent a massive blow to the prestige of the grand project to bind Europe's nations into an unbreakable union. \n\"Even if we can cope with such a development in terms of financial policy, a Grexit would be a disastrous signal to countries outside the European Union,\" German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \n\"Europe's reputation and credibility would be damaged in parts of the world.\" \nIt would also spell even greater hardship for Greece, stricken by economic crisis that has left one in four workers without a job, hammered pensions and pay and fueled political instability. \nThe Greek bakery chain Venetis said it had decided to provide free bread to pensioners, the jobless and homeless for as long as banks remain closed. \"It's our turn to support those in need,\" Managing Director Panagiotis Monemvasiotis told Reuters. \nGermany’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper, citing a \"senior negotiator\" among Greece's creditors, said the Athens government had money \"for perhaps a week, but certainly not much longer.\" \nCritics accuse Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, a 40-year-old former student protest leader, of gambling Greece's future by calling a plebiscite with eight days' notice after negotiations with the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund hit a wall. \nThey point out that the offer Greeks will vote on is no longer on the table and the question is worded in cryptic legalese, leading the Council of Europe, a major European rights watchdog, to say the plebiscite falls short of international standards of fairness. \nEchoing a defiant Tsipras at Friday's 'No' rally, 60-year-old teacher Giorgos Sarafianos said the referendum was a question of \"dignity\". \n\"The only message that can be sent tomorrow is that if we want to be part of the European community, it should not be with our heads bowed,\" he said. \n(Additional reporting by Michele Kambas in ATHENS, Paul Day in MADRID and Madeline Chambers in BERLIN; Writing by Matt Robinson; Editing by Janet Lawrence) Currency", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T19:29:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
