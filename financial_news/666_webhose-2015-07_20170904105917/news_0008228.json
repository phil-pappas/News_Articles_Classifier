The euro finished Wednesday’s session above $1.1050, its best performance since June 29, as investors held out hope that Greek leaders will strike an 11th-hour deal with the country’s international creditors, averting a default on money owed to the European Central Bank and a possible exit from the eurozone.\nThe euro EURUSD, -0.3431% recently traded at $1.1069, up from $10.08 late Tuesday in New York.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Greek negotiators have requested a three-year bailout program from the European Stability Mechanism, promising to implement proposed tax and pension reforms at the beginning of next week, if the deal is accepted.\nGreece faces a Sunday deadline to work out a deal with its creditors. Christian Noyer, a member of the European Central Bank’s Governing Council, said the ECB will cut off the emergency liquidity that has been keeping the country’s banking system on life support. Such a move would potentially force Greece off the euro, and back to its previous currency, the drachma, economists have speculated.\nThe country is scheduled to repay 3.5 billion euro ($3.85 billion) in bailout loans to the ECB on July 20.\nTrading in the euro will likely remain muted for the rest of the week, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, as the market waits for eurozone finance ministers to debate the proposal over the weekend.\n”But for the third weekend in a row the euro may see a gap open regardless of whether a deal is done or not as speculators will move the currency either way,” Schlossberg said.\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.23% a measure of the dollar’s strength against a basket of six currencies, was down 0.24% to 96.6370.\nBut the dollar traded unevenly against its main rivals. The British pound weakened as the U.K.’s ruling Conservative party released a budget proposal that includes more cuts to government spending.\nThe pound GBPUSD, +0.1693% was down 0.22% against the dollar to $1.5374, from $1.5462 late Tuesday in New York.\nMeanwhile, the yen was the best-performing currency against the dollar on Wednesday. Investors consider the Japanese currency a safe-haven when global market risk is high, and it has recently benefited from an implosion in Chinese stocks and the uncertainty surrounding Greece’s future in the eurozone.\nThe dollar USDJPY, +0.51% traded at 120.79 yen, its lowest level against the Japanese currency in about six weeks. One dollar was worth ¥122.52 late Tuesday in New York.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T12:13:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
