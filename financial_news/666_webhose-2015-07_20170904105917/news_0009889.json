As a result, Samsung's S6 series shipments sell-in remained healthy and out-shipped iPhone 6 series by 2:1,\" the report said. \nIntex took the third position, capturing slightly under 10 percent of the smartphone market, riding on the demand of sub-$100 smartphones. Lenovo and Lava grabbed the fourth and fifth spots, respectively. \nLenovo was also the second largest LTE smartphone vendor during the quarter. While Xiaomi smartphone shipments increased sequentially during the quarter, Apple's iPhone shipments remained strong during the quarter as vendor expanded its distribution reach through both -- online and offline channel -- by adding more partners. \n\"The Cupertino-based vendor also crossed 1 million unit shipments in the seven months of its fiscal since October 2014. An achievement that it took almost 12 months to manage in its last financial year,\" the analytics firm said. \n\"Microsoft also found its place among top five overall mobile phone brands during the quarter but Lumia shipments declined sequentially,\" it added. \nAmong other trends mapped by Counterpoint, almost 30 percent of the total smartphones sold during the quarter were through the online channels and 'exclusive' online only smartphone sales contributed to more than 20 percent of the total smartphone sales. \nAlso, one in four smartphones sold during the quarter was LTE (long-term evolution) capable and one in five phones shipped during the quarter were \"Made in India\". \nAs per the report, the overall India mobile phone market registered a year-on-year decline of two percent and a quarter-on-quarter increase of four percent. \nHowever, the smartphone segment registered a year-on-year increase of 34 percent and quarter-on-quarter increase of 25 percent. Feature phones saw a sharp decline with shipment volumes down to 19 percent year-on-year and 9 percent quarter-on-quarter. \nIANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T21:52:04.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
