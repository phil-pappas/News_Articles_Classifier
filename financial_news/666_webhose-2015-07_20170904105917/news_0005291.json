Chris Pearce by Lucille Keen Cement group Boral will be given access to evidence obtained by competition watchdog from legal action against Victoria's militant construction union after convincing a judge that it needed the documents for its own lawsuit against the union.\nBoral sought transcripts of 28 individual interviews conducted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to use in its damages case against the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union over what it claims has been a secondary boycott in which the union has black banned the company since February, 2013.\nThe interviews with contractors and building companies are for a separate ACCC case in the Federal Court against the CFMEU that claims the union engaged in \"undue harassment or coercion of Boral in relation to the supply of concrete\".\nBoral had argued it was entitled to see the transcripts because they have already been handed over to the union and its lawyers and it wants to use the evidence to support a claim for $23 million-plus costs that will be heard in the Victorian Supreme Court in August.\nThe ACCC wanted to suppress the material until its trial against the union, which has been pushed back to March.\nThe Victorian Supreme Court Justice Kevin Bell ruled on Wednesday that the ACCC had until Monday at 4pm to hand over the documents to Boral.\nIn his reasons Justice Bell said he accepted that ordering the transcripts be handed over to Boral might not be \"helpful\" to the ACCC. However, it would be \"unjust to deprive Boral of the order for discovery that it seeks\".\nA spokesman for Boral said it was an important win. \"The order by the Court requires the CFMEU to provide Boral with access to the transcripts from examinations of relevant witnesses conducted by the ACCC,\" the spokesman said.\n \"The ACCC had already provided the CFMEU with access to that information, and today's order gives Boral the same level of access to the information.\"\nACCC Chairman Rod Sims said the Commission said Boral's application raised important policy implications regarding the ACCC's compulsory information gathering powers and the ability for the ACCC to effectively conduct its own prosecutions.\n\"The ACCC is carefully considering the reasons for His Honour's judgment,\" Mr Sims said.\nThe allegations that Boral continue to be the victim of the secondary boycott were investigated by the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption last year.\nIn his interim report, commissioner Dyson Heydon made recommendations that a number of senior officials at the Victorian branch of the CFMEU, including state secretary John Setka, be investigated for criminal charges of blackmail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:54:59.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
