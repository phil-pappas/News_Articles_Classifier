World Surf League by Trevor Sykes On December 29, 2013, the champion Formula One driver Michael Schumacher nearly killed himself in a skiing accident in the French Alps when he fell heavily and hit his head on a rock.\nA passing skier videoed Schumacher on his smartphone. That video was sold worldwide for €150,000 ($220,000), of which the skier collected more than a third. That skier also made famous a new media industry called crowd-sourcing.\nCrowd-sourcing is a phenomenon in which the TV viewers have become the photographers. There is even a listed company called Newzulu (NWZ) , which is planning to harness crowd-sourcing through a global network.\nNewzulu executive chairman Alex Hartman points out that TV networks have helicopters and outside broadcast (OB) vans which can race to an emergency such as a car crash or a shark attack but by the time they arrive the ambulances have treated the victims and the shark has swum away.\nHowever, the spread of smartphones means there is an excellent chance that some passerby has snapped the accident and his or her video will be the dramatic highlight of the evening news. Newzulu wants to make a business out of those passersby.\nInstant paparazzi Anyone who owns a smartphone can go to the Newzulu website, download its app and they're ready to be instant paparazzi. Newzulu claims 150,000 contributors, although how many of them will be lucky enough to be on the spot for more than one accident is questionable. If they video a shark attack, they can transmit the images immediately to Newzulu, who will quickly verify that the film has not been staged then sell it into a wide network of newsagencies. Newzulu will pay the contributor half the net proceeds, after the newsagency's fee (normally about 30 per cent).\nCrowd-sourcing turns traditional media upside-down. Instead of journalists and photographers disseminating news and images to a docile public, the public provide the news and images to the newspapers and TV stations. Thanks to modern phones and iPads, this is now possible and Newzulu is leading the charge to see if it can be profitable.\n Newzulu has been a public company for just under a year since backlisting into the old dotcom Pieworks. In that time the company has been frantically negotiating partnership deals. It started with Agence France Press and has since included distribution deals with Tribune Publishing ( Los Angeles Times , Chicago Tribune and a TV network), Nippon News, the Czech newsagency CTK, the Japanese newsagency Afio and Getty Images, the world's leading visual communications company.\nOther strategic collaborations include Bang Showbiz (celebrity and entertainment news), Canadian Press, Flipps (which has a cloud-based mobile application enabling it to deliver video content to 250 million connected TVs) and Scoopshot (a leading mobile platform for photo and video crowd-sourcing).\nNewzulu also acquired for $C5 million the Toronto-based content marketing company Filemobile, whose clients include USA Today , Fox News, The Wall Street Journal , Hearst TV, The Weather Network and Scientific American .\nThis hectic activity has burned cash. Newzulu raised $11.5 million from a rights issue early this year but had only $4.7 million left in the till at the end of March. Receipts from customers until then had been a mere $593,000.\nThe money has been spent building a global business with branches in Paris, London, New York, Los Angeles, Toronto and Sydney. The cost has been reflected in its share price, which has dropped from 20¢ in October to about 7¢. Newzulu already has 532 million shares on issue and is planning a further raising of maybe $6 million.\nThe family of Newzulu director James Bodel has so far pumped $7 million into the company while Hartman and his associates have provided more than $5 million. Hartman believes the business will be cashflow positive in 12 to 18 months.\nAs Newzulu is still in the throes of building its global crowd-sourcing – and the business model has yet to be demonstrated as profitable – it can't be tipped as a good investment yet. But Hartman and his crew are giving the concept a full-blooded go. They won't die wondering.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T10:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T23:09:30.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
