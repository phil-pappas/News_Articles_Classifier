The proposal is controversial among local communities, however, and faces fierce opposition because of worries residents will be blighted by higher air pollution and increased noise. \nFive members of David Cameron’s cabinet are thought to be against Heathrow expansion, as well as vocal Conservatives Boris Johnson and Zac Goldsmith. But Graham Brady, the chairman of the Tories’ influential 1922 Committee, has suggested that other MPs are overwhelmingly in favour of the runway . \nThe government should set out “a clear timetable for an early parliamentary vote to take place by summer 2016”, the letter says, so that Britain can catch-up with rival airports at Paris, Frankfurt and Dubai. \n“We are becoming less competitive as a global aviation hub at a time when our competitors have plans to build over fifty new runways globally.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T23:15:10.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
