(AP) - A Vermont woman who triggered an Amber Alert after she took her biological son to New Hampshire now faces charges that she made incessant phone calls to her daughter and son's foster parents.\nThe Bennington Banner reports that 51-year-old Manchester resident Patricia Kane pleaded not guilty Monday to obstructing justice and disturbing the peace. She was released and told not to contact her daughter or the foster parents.\nThe Amber Alert was issued after her 12-year-old son was dropped off at his foster home by a school bus but never made it inside. Authorities found him with Kane and her 17-year-old daughter at a hotel in Lyme, New Hampshire.\nKane was sentenced to a year in jail and ordered not to come within 500 feet of her son.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
