The shares are down 28 percent this year, compared with a 9.3 percent gain in the Topix stock benchmark.\nAsset sales may include part of its stake in atomic power plant maker Westinghouse Electric, the Nikkei newspaper reported Thursday without saying where it got the information. Toshiba had said as early as 2012 that it is considering a sale of as much as 36 percent of that business.\nThere is no change to the plan to sell part of the Westinghouse stake, spokesman Hirokazu Tsukimoto said Thursday, in response to a Nikkei report.\nToshiba on May 8 withdrew its earnings forecasts and canceled the year-end dividend citing irregularities related to “percentage of completion” estimates used on infrastructure projects. The company is also investigating its visual products, PC and chip businesses.\nWritedowns of past profit will rise to more than 100 billion yen, a person familiar with the matter said July 4. That’s almost double the previous estimate by the company, which has said it expects to complete a third-party probe of its accounting by the middle of this month.\nSuspended Ratings At least eight analysts have suspended their ratings on the company’s shares amid uncertainty about the probe’s scope. The company initially said it was examining accounting at units for nuclear, hydroelectric, wind-power equipment, air-traffic control and railway systems, then widened the probe to include personal computers and other businesses.\nThe company intentionally delayed booking losses, the Nikkei reported Thursday, without saying where it got the information. Toshiba is not aware of a deliberate delay in accounting for losses, Tsukimoto, the company spokesman, said Thursday.\nToshiba also plans to overhaul appliance operations, looking for Southeast Asia partners and cutting subsidiaries, the Nikkei reported. It may also announce new steps for its PC business and changes to chip operations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T08:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T04:39:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
