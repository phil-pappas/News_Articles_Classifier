There will be a large number of hotel openings ahead of the Games boosting room supply although we expect expansion in the hotel sector to moderate after this point.\nBrazil's tourist market is one of the largest in the region benefiting from the country's size which enables it to offer a variety of attractions including beaches city breaks Amazon adventures and mountain exploration.
