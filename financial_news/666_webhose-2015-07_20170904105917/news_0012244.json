Tamara Voninski Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires The Australian sharemarket has returned to fair value after a confessions season that, while busy, was not historically bad, so clarity from the Greek situation should result in opportunities for re-rating, Deutsche Bank says.\nThe price-earnings ratio of the market has fallen to 15.25-times, compared with a high of 16.5-times when the S&P/ASX 200 reached a post-GFC high of 5983. This is a return to fair value, which rests at about 15-times, Deutsche Bank analyst Tim Baker wrote in a research note.\nThe confessions season, while dramatic in its headline acts, including Woolworths, Metcash, SEEK, Flight Centre REA Group and Nine Entertainment, was likely not responsible for June ending at fresh lows of about 5390.\n\"The proportion of downgrades is a little higher, but the size of the downgrades is small versus history,\" Mr Baker said.\nConfession season doesn't look much worse than the past two years Deutsche Bank \"It's also worth remembering 'the dog that didn't bark' – earnings forecasts have held up in this confession season for a range of companies that had sizeable downgrades in recent years,\" he said.\nThat means the market fall looks more like volatility. Relative to historical dips, the worst could be over for the market's post-April slide, Mr Baker said.\n\"The market has spent 45 days in this dip, versus the average 25 days, so could have run its course.\"\nHowever, BetaShares chief economist David Bassanese said the global equity market was in a pause, and reflected a technical need for consolidating the strong gains from mid-2014 to April.\n \"Helping provide the fundamental basis for this inevitable pause has stretched price-to-earnings valuations (i.e. prices ran ahead of earnings), and simmering fears about when the US Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates,\" Mr Bassanese said.\n\"The recent flare-up in Greece has added to the weakness over the past month.\"\nA softer equity market was still looking more attractive than bonds, which were set for volatility when the US did lift interest rates, he said.\nSchroder Investment Management head of fixed income Simon Doyle was more bearish, and said \"the tough environment envisaged for investors in 2015 is unfolding\".\n\"The pick-up in volatility in June has not fundamentally changed the investment outlook nor turned the dial significantly on our return forecasts. With one or two notable exceptions, we expect low returns over our forecast (three-year horizon),\" he said.\nBut he added: \"Just as June highlighted – especially the last week of June – market prices can change quickly.\" The last week of June saw a 2.7 per cent fall on the ASX 200 from a bank-led recovery in June to about 5700.\nMr Doyle said Australian equities were preferred over US and Chinese equities, because of the improved valuations based on their underperformance.\nDeutsche Bank's Mr Baker has identified a list of stocks that present opportunities in the softer market, with these criteria: having underperformed the broader market by at least 3 per cent since April, had their P/E ratios de-rated and downgraded earnings per share by less than 3 per cent.\nThose include Fairfax, Ansell, Westpac, Resmed, FlexiGroup, Treasury Wine Estates, Perpetual, IOOF, Coca-Cola Amatil, Orora and Mirvac.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-07-06T07:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T04:08:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
