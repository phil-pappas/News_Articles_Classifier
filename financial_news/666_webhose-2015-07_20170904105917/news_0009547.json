So, the DCW will be closed tomorrow. I am extremely sad about this. Tomorrow was a big day for us. We were planning to institute an inquiry into the Anand Parbat murder case. In fact, I was also planning to inquire into the number of eve teasing cases that have been registered in Delhi and ask for their status reports,” Maliwal told ANI here.\n“My vision for DCW has been to stop the kitty party culture that has been going on. Phone lines don’t work, internet doesn’t work, office timings are not maintained. There is no monitoring mechanism. Everything is in a shabby situation. I am sad that the vision I had for the women of Delhi may not roll out at the speed that I was expecting. This is definitely a roadblock, but I have always worked for women security and will continue to do so. Nothing can inhibit me from doing so,” she added.\nThe LG, who has been locked in a tussle with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal over the appointment and transfer of senior bureaucrats, declared the appointment of Maliwal, wife of AAP leader Naveen Jaihind, as “ultra vires” of the rules.\nThe Congress had also said that AAP, which used to criticise nepotism and favouritism, is now following the same path to promote few members of the party.\n 23, 2015 9:09 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T14:39:59.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
