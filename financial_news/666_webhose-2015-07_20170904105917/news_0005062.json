Ms Davies said the market was very competitive, particularly for owner occupiers, as lending standards tighten. \"Standards are tightening up on lending to investors, therefore it stands to reason that there's increased competition to get the owner occupiers.\" Mr Arnold said the special shorter-term rates were a way for lenders to attract new business but noted a lot of providers still had variable rates around five per cent. \"When rates come down it's easy just to take whatever cut your lender gives you because it's saving money in your pocket or years off your loan. \"But by switching from an average rate to one of the lowest rates you're looking at the equivalent of about three Reserve Bank cuts.\" MORTGAGE RATES COME DOWN * RateCity says average variable rate now 4.78 pct, from 4.84 per cent before RBA's May cut * Canstar says average five-year fixed rate 4.77 pct, 45 basis point decline since December; cash rate down 50bps * Canstar says average: - standard variable rate 4.91 pct - basic variable 4.66 pct - package variable 4.44 pct Source: RateCity, Canstar.
