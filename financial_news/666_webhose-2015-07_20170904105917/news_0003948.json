John MANGAN Share on twitter by Misa Han On Monday, NSW Premier Mike Baird announced plans to increase the rate of GST to 15 per cent to pay for healthcare . How will the plan affect your household budget and what can you do to minimise its impact?\n1. Expect to pay more GST Households should be prepared to pay an average of $2,900 more a year, or change their spending habits. Modelling by NATSEM at the University of Canberra shows the average household would be hit by extra $2,915 GST a year , or 9.3 per cent of their income, if they don't change their spending habits.\nBecause the tax is regressive, it will hit the poor the hardest.\nThe bottom 20 per cent of households on average incomes of $41,000 would spend 11 per cent of their income on GST or $4500 a year; The middle 20 per cent of households on average incomes of $85,000 would spend 10 per cent of their income on GST or $8700 a year; The top 20 per cent of households on average incomes of $181,000 would spend 8 per cent of their income on GST or $14,000 a year. 2. Fresh food, health, education and childcare not affected Baird's plan involves increasing the GST to 15 per cent without broadening the base of the tax. This means the GST change will not affect household spending on GST-free items such as fresh food, health, education, childcare or condoms . Spend more on fresh food and less on restaurant meals, takeaway food and snacks if you want to avoid the full impact of the GST.\n3. Compensation for low income households Mr Baird confirmed on Monday households with combined incomes under $100,000 will receive compensation \"in order to be fair\". Social Services Minister Scott Morrison is also expecting to pay more on welfare payments if the GST rate goes up.\n4. More expensive new homes Bad news for home buyers: the real estate sector says lifting the GST will add another $50,000 to every new home . This is because the sale of a new home attracts a GST component, which existing homes are not subject to.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan", "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/mike-baird-raise-the-gst-to-15-per-cent-to-pay-for-healthcare/story-e6frg6n6-1227448117813", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/gst_increase_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-21T10:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:04:15.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
