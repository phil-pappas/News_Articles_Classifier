Unlike competitors such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo does not vet proposed projects.\nThis viewpoint sets the company apart in the space just as the Securities and Exchange Commission gradually rolls out regulations for the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, including a provision to allow startups raise up to $50 million from non-accredited investors . These regulations are aimed at equity crowdfunding – a space Indiegogo is considering – with the goal of allowing average individuals to safely invest in private companies.\nBased in San Francisco,the site was recently host to global campaigns, such as the Greek Bailout campaign, relief efforts after Nepal’s earthquake, as well as a new way to harvest honey, among others.\nRubin, then a strategy consultant, and his co-founders, Danae Ringelmann and Eric Schell, came up with the idea for the company after Ringelmann, an investment banker, said she wanted to democratize finance.\nAfter initially being discouraged by the regulations around profit-based models, the trio looked to the peer-to-peer lending offered by Prosper and the beginning of YouTube, which Rubin said was “democratizing content.” Their goal was to become a “ProspeTube” platform.\nRubin said he and the founders delayed taking any venture capital funding, choosing to run off their personal savings and wait until they had a test case to present to investors. Then the 2008 financial crisis hit, and the plan fell through.\n“We got turned down by 93 VCs until 2010,” Rubin said.\nIndiegogo is the first business created by any of the founders, and venture capitalists cited their inexperience, general market conditions and the new model of funding as reasons not to invest, said Rubin.\nA no judgment policy “We fundamentally believe that everybody deserves one opportunity to see whether or not the world or the crowd wants to fund them.” - Slava Rubin, Indiegogo CEO. Indiegogo offers two funding models: a fixed one, where campaign creators have to meet a set goal to receive any of the funds; or a flexible one, where the creators take whatever was raised by the end of the campaign.\nStarting Wednesday, Indiegogo is charging a 5% fee for campaigns that reach the set goals using either model. The money is returned to backers when fixed funding campaigns don’t reach the funding goal and the campaigns are not charged a fee by Indiegogo.\nIn December, the company launched a separate Indiegogo Life page for personal campaigns, that charges no fee and allows them to run indefinitely.\nIndiegogo does not evaluate or measure the feasibility of campaigns before they’re posted.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T01:36:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
