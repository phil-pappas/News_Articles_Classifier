The utility has a 225 billion-rand cash-flow shortfall and has been carrying out scheduled blackouts every other day this year as demand exceeds supply from aging power stations.\nThe PIC, which manages government workers’ pension money, becomes Vodacom’s largest shareholder after Newbury, England-based Vodafone.
