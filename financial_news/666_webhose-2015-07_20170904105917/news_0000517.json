Hayes’s lawyers say the practice was widespread. He faces eight counts of fraud, each carrying up to 10 years in prison.\nHayes complained that the case against him failed to take into account the effect his “requests for favors” actually had on the subsequent submissions by traders at other firms. Traders made submissions against his interests more often than they helped him.\nHayes made more than 2,000 requests for moves in Libor, prosecutors have said.\n“Why did you ask them then?” prosecutor Mukul Chawla asked Thursday.\nWhen Chawla suggested that Hayes had benefited financially from his actions, the former trader responded that he been refused trading data he’d requested from his former employers that would allow him to answer him.\n“I feel outraged that I am being asked questions I can’t adequately rebut because I haven’t been given the data I need,” Hayes said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T15:35:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
