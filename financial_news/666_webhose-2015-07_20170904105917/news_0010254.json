It declined to disclose the number of service providers currently available.\nCustomers can select a variety of services such as plumbing and TV installation and see recommended local contractors and pricing. Now customers will also be able to request referrals for specialized and more complex projects such as installing air conditioning, Amazon said.\nThe company charges a 10 to 20 percent referral fee to contractors and provides customer support and refunds if there is any dissatisfaction with the service.\nAmazon said it screens service providers and individual contractors thoroughly and less than 3 percent of applicants normally get through the vetting process.
