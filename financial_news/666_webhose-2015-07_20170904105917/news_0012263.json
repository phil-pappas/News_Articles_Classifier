Elliott, which holds 7.1 percent of builder C&T, has mounted legal challenges to the merger and is urging shareholders to vote against it. \n\"We are pleased to see that independent specialist advisors agree with our position that the proposed merger is without merit,\" Elliott said in a statement. \nWhile a court in Seoul on Wednesday dismissed Elliott's request for an injunction to stop the shareholder vote, Glass Lewis's report could encourage more institutional investors to reject the offer. \nC&T shareholders such as Aberdeen Asset Management, APG Asset Management and Ilsung Pharmaceutical Co have publicly criticised the deal. \n\"We believe SCT (Samsung C&T) investors should reject the arrangement and encourage the board to more thoroughly consider alternatives available to the company,\" the advisory firm said. \nAnother major proxy advisor, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc, is expected to issue its own recommendations by the end of this week. \nSamsung C&T needs at least two-thirds of the votes cast on July 17 to proceed with the deal. \nThe deal would allow the heirs of Samsung Group [SAGR.UL] patriarch Lee Kun-hee, who remains hospitalised since a May 2014 heart attack, to consolidate stakes in affiliates like smartphone maker Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and keep control of the vast business empire. \nA Samsung C&T spokesman said the proposed merger was in accordance with the law and that the company wanted to boost shareholder value. \nCheil, the Samsung Group's de facto holding company, and Samsung C&T have been lobbying shareholders to vote in support of the merger, promising greater post-merger shareholder returns and an improved governance structure to protect investor interests. \nCheil is being advised by Morgan Stanley (MS.N), while Samsung C&T is being advised by Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX). \n(Additional reporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Tony Munroe and Stephen Coates)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T05:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T07:28:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
