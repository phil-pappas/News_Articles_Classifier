There is some vulnerability in the index heading into the FOMC decision this afternoon after yesterday’s break of a minor trendline. However, we would need to see last week’s low around 11,975 give way to trigger a double top on the daily and prime the market for a more serious correction. Traction over 12,050 would alleviate our budding concerns of a correction and set the stage for a re-test of the April high.
