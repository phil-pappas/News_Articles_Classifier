Michele Mossop by Angela Macdonald-Smith DUET Group is paying a \"full\" price for remote power project developer Energy Developments Ltd but the $1.4 billion deal will improve its ability to cover distributions from cash flow, making the stock more attractive, according to Deutsche Bank analysts.\nThe takeover, announced to the market on Monday, is priced at $8 per share, valuing EDL at 8.8 times 2015 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.\nWhile that ratio is higher than the 10.5 times Ebitda that DUET trades at, including debt, it is a 4 per cent premium to Deutsche Bank's target price for EDL.\nBut the takeover is set to immediately increase cash flows for DUET, which raised its guidance for distributions.\n\"The key takeaway from our perspective is the acquisition will be cash flow accretive for DUET and thus will improve DUET's ability to cash-cover distributions, which we have previously pointed out as a key impediment to the DUET investment case,\" Deutsche Bank energy analyst John Hirjee said in a note to clients.\nBut he said that DUET had brought forward the benefit of the cash flow increases with the boost to the dividend, so the energy and infrastructure owner would still unlike be able to cover all its 2015-16 distribution with cash.\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia analyst William Allott said the acquisition price \"doesn't seem unreasonable\", but said DUET probably didn't underpay either given the deal is facilitating an exit for private equity firm Pacific Equity Partners.\nMr Allott said he wasn't overly surprised DUET had made an acquisition but voiced some surprise it was shifting away from energy infrastructure into distributed power generation \"especially given we see the synergies at this point in time as limited.\"\n \"In our view, the negatives arising from this deal are that it removes the takeover premium that we believe was supporting DUET's share price, and introduces a higher level of risk into the portfolio,\" Mr Allott said.\nBoth Moody's and Standard & Poor's kept their ratings on DUET's operating companies unchanged as a result of the deal, which is being financed by a $1.67 billion equity raising. DUET owns the United Energy electricity distribution business in Victoria, the Multinet Gas distribution business and a stake in the Dampier-Bunbury long-distance gas transmission pipeline in Western Australia.\n\"Our central scenario is that DUET's solid track record of providing support to the operating assets' financial profiles when required will continue,\" said Moody's analyst Mary Anne Low.\n\"Our view reflects our understanding that the acquisition will not materially increase DUET's debt or future investment requirements, and therefore DUET should not exhibit an increased propensity to distribute cash from the operating assets.\"\nThe equity raising involves a $550 million placement to cornerstone investors including UniSuper, at $2.02 per security, and a 1-for-2.69 entitlement offer at the same price to raise $1.122 billion. DUET shares, which closed on Friday at $2.38, have been halted for the institutional part of the equity raising and are due to resume trading on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, EDL's second-biggest shareholder, Investors Mutual, praised PEP for its success in running the company as a co-investment between private and public equity after failing to gain full ownership in a $2.50 a share cash takeover bid in 2009. PEP owns about 68 per cent of EDL.\n\"They've delivered good returns for themselves but also for those investors who stayed in and said 'no' to the initial bid it's been a good outcome,\" said Simon Conn, senior portfolio manager for small caps at Investors Mutual.\n\"EDL was the first one where we saw co-investment by private equity and the public and for us it has worked quite well,\" Mr Conn said.\n\"It speaks quite highly of the PEP guys that they have managed to handle any conflicts well and the independent directors who were on the board of EDL, they've done a good job as well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T10:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:11:37.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
