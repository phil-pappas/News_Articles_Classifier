Luis Ascui Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan A Canberra contractor allegedly made corrupt payments of $135,000 in cash to a construction union organiser to get work on various building projects in the ACT.\nElias Taleb told the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption on Monday that he made the payments throughout 2012 and 2013 to Halafihi \"Fihi\" Kivalu, an organiser with the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union.\nMr Taleb, 35, said he met with Mr Kivalu in 2012 after Mr Taleb's company, Class I Form, had tendered for work on a project to build 38 residential units in Yarralumla in Canberra.\nMr Taleb alleged that Mr Kivalu told him that \"to get me the job, he would have to pay people off\".\n\"Fihi said words to the effect 'it will be 50 grand for this job, and if you don't pay, someone else will, and they will get the job',\" Mr Taleb alleged in a witness statement tendered to the commission.\nMr Taleb said he agreed to pay the $50,000 in instalments. A day or two later, he got a telephone call from Mr Kivalu, saying \"congratulations, you got the job\". Twenty minutes later, he was contacted by the developer confirming he had the work.\nHe said he met with Mr Kivalu on June 12, 2012 and gave him an envelope containing $10,000. `He was happy,\" Mr Taleb said. \"He said to me words to the effect, `I'm proud of you. I was scared at first, but, you know, you're doing well'.\"\nMr Taleb said he made a second payment of $10,000 in cash to Mr Kivalu in August, 2012, followed by two further payments of $20,000 and $10,000 in cash.\n \"I knew that if I didn't pay the money or I was ever late with a payment, the CFMEU would be on the job straight away,\" Mr Taleb said.\n\"The CFMEU would be on the job shutting it down every day until I made the payment or gave them an indication of payment.\"\nHe said he subsequently tendered for work on 77 retirement village units in Griffith but the head contractor, Denham Constructions, said the CFMEU told the company not to use Mr Taleb's company.\nHe said he telephoned Mr Kivalu, asking \"What the hell is this?\". He said Mr Kivalu responded: \"Well, we keep the same deal going like what we did on the Yarralumla job. But will need more this time, like $100k.\"\nMr Taleb said he agreed to pay $50,000 in instalments, and, within an hour, he received a telephone call from Denham Constructions telling him he had the job.\nMr Taleb said Denham was late making some payments to him so he held off paying the union. He said union officials turned up to the project, trying to shut the job down.\nIn August 2013, Mr Taleb said he told Mr Kivalu he could not make the final payment until Denham paid the last instalment. \"I recall Fihi wanting to go to Tonga and he wanted some cash,\" Mr Taleb said.\nText messages between Mr Taleb and Mr Kivalu were tendered to the commission, including one message from Mr Kivalu on September 5, 2013, complaining about the late payment.\n\"Elias this is ridiculous,\" the message, in part, read. \"I shouldn't have to wait for a retention to sort out our business brother. We have to look at changing the way we do business. I should be the first to be sorted.\"\nMr Taleb said he agreed to a further demand of $20,000 from Mr Kivalu to work on a third project and $15,000 for a fourth job.\nCounsel assisting the commission, Jeremy Stoljar, told the hearing on Monday that a second employer would give evidence that he paid $40,000 to Mr Kivalu as recently as last year.\nMr Stoljar said Mr Kivalu stopped working at the CFMEU at the end of last year. He has been summoned to appear before the commission and would be invited to respond to the allegations against him.\nMr Stoljar said the commission will conduct hearings in Canberra over the next three weeks that would focus largely on the ACT branch of the CFMEU.\n\"The evidence the commission will receive paints a disturbing picture of the conduct of the CFMEU in the ACT: alleged corrupt payments, standover and intimidation tactics, and the apparent establishment and promotion of cartels for key trades,\" he said.\n\"The evidence will also raise significant questions about the governance of the ACT branch of the CFMEU under the stewardship of its branch secretary, including whether the supervision and conduct of branch officials has been adequate and whether the branch has received falsified membership forms and the bulk payment of purported membership dues by employers.\"\nMr Stoljar said the commission had heard evidence of employees being joined up as members of a union – the Australian Workers Union – without the knowledge or consent of those members.\n\"One of the themes of many of the case studies to be heard in the coming weeks is the CFMEU's demand for members, regardless of the willingness or otherwise of some employees to join the union,\" he said.\n\"Evidence will be received of the pressure on employers to pay membership dues in bulk, regardless of the lack of consent by individual employees to joining the union,\" Mr Stoljar said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-07-13T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T10:42:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
