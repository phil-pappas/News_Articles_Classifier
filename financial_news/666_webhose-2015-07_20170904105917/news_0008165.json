The company stated that it has spent 844bz of every rial locally with the aim to establish Local Development Investment (LDI) strategy. 'LDI is beyond the short-term goal of immediate returns such as buying locally and training Omanis.\n'It means investing in the strategic vision of Omran and growing with it by ensuring a stronger local supply chain working with local skills and talent and consequently improving the quality of our end product' the company said in a statement. As part of its commitment Omran has awarded 58 per cent of all consultancy contracts 97 per cent of all construction contracts and 86 per cent of all contracts to local companies since 2009.\n'We look at local development as a strategic investment. Even if it comes with a slight increase in immediate cost it will pay dividends in the long run by improving the overall level of skills and services available in the local market and build a legacy for future generations of Omanis to benefit from' said Laima al Ansi director of procurement Omran.\nSome of the measures that Omran has taken to establish LDI strategy include developing Omani workforce in executive managerial and specialist areas sponsoring academic and specialised training of Omani talent and encouraging its partners to do the same.\nAdditionally it has been improving the local market by introducing new quality contractors supporting SMEs through work and training price preference to local market and attracting foreign investment that contributes to LDI.\nSome of the leading examples of its LDI strategy include Alila Jabal Akhdar and Atana hotels. For Alila Omran awarded hundred percent of the construction contract (RO14.56mn) to local contractor Dawood Contracting.\nAnd above 85 per cent of the expenditure during construction was on products and services from local companies. 'Aside from the main and sub-contractors 20 other local companies were contracted from Jebel Akhdar. Locally produced handicraft and natural products are being used and sold in the spa and gift shop while tours and excursions organised by the hotel provide direct support to local businesses' the company stated.\nFor Atana Musandam hotel the RO12mn construction contract was awarded to local firm while six local companies were instrumental in the design of the project. Also 100 per cent of the brand creation was conducted by Omani SMEs and local talent. Local sourcing was done for toiletries for the two hotels in addition to chocolates being sourced from Tamarah lounge music by Salalah al Zadjali and laundry handbags made by members of the Omani Women's Association Khasab branch.\n'A majority of the materials were sourced locally and wherever possible renewable materials were used. The artefacts and handicrafts selected for the project were traditional Omani products while most of the furniture was custom-designed and locally manufactured' stated the company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T18:00:56.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
