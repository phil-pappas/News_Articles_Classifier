This does not apply in any way to nuclear power,\" Faymann said in a statement. \n\"Nuclear power plants are dangerous, expensive and -- compared with ... wind, hydro and solar energy -- neither economically nor ecologically competitive,\" he added. \nThe Commission approved the British plan to guarantee the price of power from its first new nuclear project in decades last October, despite strong opposition from some Commissioners. \nGreenpeace and nine German and Austrian utilities selling renewable energy have also said they are launching legal action against state aid for Hinkley Point. \nIn a majority of cases, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg has found in favour of the Commission in complex cases. \nJeremy Wates, the head of European Environmental Bureau, an umbrella group for environmental bodies across the EU, described the European Commission's decision as \"deeply misguided\". \n\"We expect the courts to follow the law and oppose this kind of subsidy, twice the current price of electricity, which will be costly for consumers,\" he said in a statement. \nThe British government played down the legal threat. \n\"The UK is confident that the European Commission's State aid decision on Hinkley Point C is legally robust and has no reason to believe that Austria has submitted a challenge of any merit,\" said a spokeswoman for Britain's Department of Energy and Climate Change said.
