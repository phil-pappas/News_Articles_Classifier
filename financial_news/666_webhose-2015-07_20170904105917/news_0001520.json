The world’s fourth most-populous nation is now strengthening its defenses as contagion risk looms from Greece to China.\nPresident Joko Widodo’s administration gave the Financial Services Authority the power to buy local and foreign-currency government bonds in late June, seeking to contain spikes in borrowing costs during market volatility. The decision will diversify the investor base for the debt, the finance ministry said in Jakarta on Thursday.\nThe pressure is on for Indonesia to insulate itself against the risk of capital flight from emerging markets, as China’s stock rout wipes out more than $3 trillion in less than a month, Greece edges closer to leaving the euro and the U.S. prepares to raise interest rates. At stake is the government’s ability to sell bonds and fund a spending program crucial for reviving Southeast Asia’s biggest economy.\n“We’ll see volatility in all markets, it’s unavoidable, so the most important thing is to strengthen the financial market,” said Leo Rinaldy, an economist at PT Mandiri Sekuritas in Jakarta. “In the medium and longer term, what Indonesia needs to do is to strengthen its economic fundamentals. Good fiscal spending, infrastructure execution and policy clarity are necessary.”\nThe rupiah has lost about 7 percent this year, the most among Asian emerging-market currencies after the Malaysian ringgit. It traded at 13,329 a dollar as of 1:42 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks show. That’s near a 17-year low of 13,390 reached on June 9.\nAsian Crisis The last time the Indonesian rupiah was this weak in 1998, governments across Asia were seeking international bailouts to pay off foreign creditors. Indonesia fell into a recession , inflation soared and long-time dictator Suharto was ousted from power amid public protests.\nIn 2013, the anticipated reduction of unprecedented U.S. monetary stimulus caused the rupiah to weaken 21 percent against the dollar, the biggest drop since 2000. With a persistent current-account deficit and foreign ownership of local-currency government bonds at almost 40 percent, Indonesia remains vulnerable when investors choose to pull out of riskier assets.\nThe financial services authority, known as the OJK in Indonesia, oversees the capital markets and financial institutions. The agency will use excess funds from fees it collects from banks for the bond purchases, Robert Pakpahan, director general at the budget financing and risk management office at the Finance Ministry, said Thursday, as it tripled the minimum private placement amount for domestic bonds to 300 billion rupiah ($23 million).\nThe ministry enacted a regulation on June 24 that allows the OJK to buy rupiah and foreign-currency notes directly from the ministry through private placement. The intention is to open up avenues for the government to raise funds even during market volatility, according to the ministry.", "external_links": ["http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=1991&ey=2020&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=536&s=NGDP_RPCH&grp=0&a=&pr1.x=73&pr1.y=9\\"], "published": "2015-07-09T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:46:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
