Daniel Munoz by Jonathan Shapiro Markets were booming and the broking dollars were flowing thick and fast back in 2006. It was then that Citi's head of research Bruce Rolph made a hire that he'll admit wasn't based on hard economics.\nRolph put his name on a research paper alongside an external consultant named Elaine Prior, who was well known to his local clients as Macquarie's former top-rated BHP Billiton analyst. Prior had returned from a sabbatical in Hobart where she completed a degree in Antarctic studies and climate change, and offered to use her new-found knowledge to write a report on its impact on ASX companies.\nRolph liked the idea, and with former US vice-president Al Gore telling the world an Inconvenient Truth, and then prime minister John Howard establishing a taskforce to examine climate change, the report was a hit with clients. Rolph soon offered Prior a full-time role that would ultimately make her the world's first ESG (environment, sustainability and governance) analyst.\nBut paying for an analyst in a sector that didn't even exist in the all-important client surveys, and one that would potentially be telling inconvenient truths about corporate clients, didn't make business sense.\nThe research units at the banks are an integral part of a broker's businesses, but they're still a cost. Brokers and research analysts effectively get paid by how well their research is rated by their fund managers, who reward them with trades. Quality is paramount. But Prior's work didn't fit any of the 26 research buckets, which ranged from telcos to interest rates. When the financial crisis hit and the money dried up, Rolph had to make some tough calls.\nHe went with his gut. Now he empathically describes the decision to hire Prior as the best of his career, and not just because he feels her extensive and original research is helping investors and companies allocate capital better for society. The hire is also paying financial dividends.\nESG an important research sector ESG is now mainstream and has become one of the most important research sectors for managers of superannuation funds, who are facing more pressure from their investors to understand the impact and governance of the companies they invest in – whether it's worker safety, the use of child labour or the extent of their carbon emissions. Many of the largest funds in the world – accounting for $US59 trillion ($78 trillion) of assets – have formally committed to the United Nation's Principles for Responsible Investment. In Australia, 33 asset owners and 73 fund managers have signed up.\n \"The large funds are trying to look at this over the longer term, and aren't always looking at 'what do I buy or sell next'. The chances are they will always be an owner of these large companies, so they're asking what can we do to strengthen the overall performance of these companies and the economy,\" the media-shy Prior tells Fairfax Media in a rare interview.\nPrior is now a pioneer in an increasingly crucial research function. She has been recognised five times as the top ESG analyst in a field where she faces increased competition from rival brokers such as Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Macquarie, who have all come to appreciate the merits of this line of research. It's evidence that the commitment of large funds to invest responsibly is creating a virtuous cycle, where it pays for brokers to do the work to increase awareness and lift the game of industry.\n\"When people ask what an ESG analyst can add, I think it's a more critical view than perhaps is traditionally taken. It's not dramatically different but taken a little more from a distance,\" Prior says.\nHer work may appear to push an agenda, but both Prior and Citi stress her analysis isn't activism. It's about fundamental forensic analysis of how social and environmental issues affect the bottom line.\n\"We're trying to help our clients understand where things may change and how that will impact the valuation of companies. We try to flag the big picture and what it might mean for companies, but at the same time we publish research because investors around the world want to know what is happening in terms of regulation.\"\nAs an ex-resources analyst, Prior spent a decade wandering around mining sites and oil and gas operations – she worked at energy giant Shell before becoming an analyst. She'd witnessed the costs of detrimental environmental and social projects long before ESG was a term. Now that ESG is mainstream and information travels quickly, it's even more important for miners and their investors to be aware of contentious projects and their impacts.\n\"Large mining companies are well aware of this but wherever one wants to dig things up in the world, there are inevitably impacts, so quite often there will be groups that disagree.\"\nPrior's work covers a range of topics from cimate change to water use, bribery and corruption. Her paper on child slavery won the \"best research analyst of the year\" title.\nFuture of fossil fuels One area where she's finding the most interest from clients is the future of fossil fuels and the potential for stranded assets. While activist groups have put pressure on pension funds to sell out of fossil fuel-intensive companies for enviromental reasons, the case to divest is an economic one. Alternative sources of energy create the risk that fuel deposits worth billions of dollars will never be extracted and therefore be rendered worthless.\n\"There are different responses but a fundamental response is to understand the supply and demand outlook in various markerts and decide on that basis whether there is a valuation [risk]. Another approach gaining momentum is having detailed discussions as to how capital [is invested], particuarly in new projects that may be perceived to be at the riskier end of the fossil fuel spectrum.\n\"It may be that a fund takes a view from an ethical perspective, but that depends if the fund is marketed and branded that way. But large mainstream funds are seriously considering how they view the outlook for fossil fuels.\"\nThe issue of stranded assets is where ESG meets mainstream, she says. With $60 trillion of assets pledged to be invested for good, they'll be meeting more often.", "external_links": ["http://www.unpri.org/signatories/signatories/?country=Australia"], "published": "2015-07-06T11:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T12:06:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
