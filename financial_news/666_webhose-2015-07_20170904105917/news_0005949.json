Keeping interest rates low, he and others have argued, is the central bank's best hope for pulling inflation up.\nAt the same time, other Fed policymakers say that modest economic growth and a decline in unemployment will eventually boost inflation anyway, a view that is bolstered by the new paper.\n\"(T) his lengthy undershooting (in inflation) does not yet signal a statistically significant departure from the target after accounting for the ever-present volatility of monthly inflation readings,\" wrote San Francisco Fed research advisor Kevin Lansing in the regional Fed bank's latest Economic Letter. \"An economic forecast that predicts more-positive (or less-negative) gaps in production or employment over time would also predict an increase in the 12-month inflation rate.\"\nThe research comes as policymakers get ready for a policy-setting meeting next week. While they are not expected to lift rates then, some economists do expect policymakers to put financial markets on notice that recent economic data may be strong enough to allow rate hikes by September.\nSan Francisco Fed President John Williams said as much last week, when he noted that a September rate hike would be \"plausible.\"\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard went further earlier Monday, when he told Fox Business Network he sees better than even odds that his colleagues will approve a rate hike in September.
