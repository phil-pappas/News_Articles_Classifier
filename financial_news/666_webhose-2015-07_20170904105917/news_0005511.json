The death toll is expected to rise. It was the bloodiest such attack in North Atlantic Treaty Organisation member Turkey since at least 50 people were killed in the town of Reyhanli near the border in 2013.\nIslamic State Television footage showed bodies lying beneath trees outside a cultural centre in the mostly Kurdish town of Suruc in southeastern Turkey, about 10km from the Syrian town of Kobani, where Kurdish fighters have been battling IS.\nThe blast tore through a group of mostly university-aged students from an activist group as they gathered to make a statement to the local press about a trip they were planning to help rebuild Kobani. The Hurriyet daily said the attacker was an 18-year-old woman, but there was no confirmation.\nA Turkish government official said it was in retaliation for the government’s efforts to fight terrorism.\nThe explosion comes weeks after Turkey deployed additional troops and equipment along parts of its border with Syria, concerned about the risk of spillover as fighting between Kurdish forces, rebel groups, Syrian government troops and IS militants intensifies.\nTurkey’s leaders have said they do not plan any unilateral military incursion into Syria but have also said they will do whatever was necessary to defend the country’s borders.\n\"Terror has no religion, no country, no race,\" Mr Erdogan said.\nBritish ambassador Richard Moore said on his Twitter account: \"UK stands shoulder to shoulder with Turkey in condemning unequivocally all terrorism. I have kids that age.\"\nAnkara fears any disorder in the border area could re-ignite an armed Kurdish separatist rebellion by the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that has killed about 40,000 since 1984. Turkey’s Kurds have been enraged by what they see as Ankara’s failure to do more to stop IS.\nTurkey has been accused of tolerating or even aiding IS in the early stages of its existence as a useful ally against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom Mr Erdogan wants to see ousted.\nOfficials fiercely dismiss the criticism that Ankara is not doing enough to halt the flow of militants across the volatile 911km border, and say Turkey has deported more than 1,500 IS suspects and banned nearly 15,000 people from 98 countries from entering.\nAny unrest would also concern Western allies who seek greater controls on the porous border that serves as a frontline in the battle against IS and affiliates.\nVideo footage showed the blast coming from just behind the students as they gathered behind a banner declaring support for Kobani.\nKobani was the site of one of the biggest battles against IS last year and was secured by Syrian Kurdish fighters last month after repeated assaults.\nSyrian Kurdish forces, known as the YPG, drove the Islamic militants back from the town with the help of US air strikes, after months of fighting and siege.\nThe students from the Federation of Socialist Youth Associations had been planning a trip to Kobani to build a library, plant a forest and build a playground, Fatma Edemen, a member of the group wounded in the blast, said.\n\"I was behind a banner so I couldn’t see the attacker, but we understand it was a suicide attack. I was thrown to the ground but I did not faint. I jumped up and began running before I even realised I was hurt,\" Edemen, a 22-year-old journalism student at Ankara University, said by telephone.\nAn explosion also went off in Kobani shortly afterwards, but there were conflicting accounts of its cause. A monitoring group blamed a car bomb but the YPG said it was ordnance going off during an operation to clear unexploded explosives.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T02:07:31.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
