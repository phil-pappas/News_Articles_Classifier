Akoto, a Tax Consultant told the public that the CG wishes that companies pay exactly as they are required to and not more than that but that is possible only if companies keep proper records for verification. \nSpeaking on the need to file returns to the Authority, Mr Akoto noted that it enables the tax payer to claim personal reliefs; all allowable expenses/input VAT; capital allowances and tax over payment; and also allows them to apply for dispensations in an easier manner such as tax clearance certificates, tax credits and exemptions. \nMr Akoto said individuals and non-governmental organisations are not allowed to withhold tax payments to the CG with the exception of public institutions such as Government Agencies, Diplomatic Missions, Ministries, Educational Institutions, and State Corporations. \nMr Lawrence Adu Kusi, Chairman for the event said the Authority is mandated to mobilise revenue for national development but their objective cannot be achieved without the stakeholders, which include business minded people. \nHe said many people do not know that paying tax voluntarily does not only help in the development of the country but also gives the payer a number of privileges and opportunities. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:46:27.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
