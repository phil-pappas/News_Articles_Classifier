The stock is down 58 percent since the accounting scandal broke, wiping about $9.4 billion off the company's value. \nMobily's losses also put it in breach of loan covenants and it remains in talks with lenders to agree new terms on its outstanding borrowings. \nIn May the Capital Market Authority referred a case of suspected insider trading at Mobily to public prosecutors, stating more than one person was a suspect. \nMobily's shares fell 8 percent in the three trading sessions prior to its shock November announcement. \nThe company is due to reveal its second-quarter earnings on Sunday. \nParent firm Etisalat, which on Tuesday reported a 40 percent drop in its second-quarter profit that it partly blamed on Mobily, earlier this year decided to recognise its share of results from its Saudi affiliate with a lag of one quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T19:30:05.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
