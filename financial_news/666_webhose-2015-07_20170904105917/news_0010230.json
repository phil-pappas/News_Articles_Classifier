Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday the reduction in the fiscal target.\nThe government also announced an additional cut in spending of 8.6 billion reais this year.\nFinance Minister Joaquim Levy said the government was not abandoning fiscal discipline. The decision to reduce the target was caused by a recent drop in tax revenues, he said at a press conference.
