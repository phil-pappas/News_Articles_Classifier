It’s a decision that requires careful consideration as to what age to make the introduction, how to get them started and how to make sure that you, as the parent, are not taking on too much risk.\nWhile the combination of kids and credit cards makes many parents uneasy, introducing them in the right way can help kids begin establishing good credit at an early age and help them avoid costly credit blunders later in life.\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/ameriswede/2500097744/\nExperts say parents often struggle the most with when to get their kids started with plastic. Unfortunately there is no definitive answer. On average, Americans seem to think that 22 is the right age for a first credit card, according to a study by Creditcards.com . In many cases, though, it makes sense to start much earlier.\n“It can be very beneficial to help your child build a credit score before they need it,” says Gerri Detweiler , director of consumer education for Credit.com . “One of the factors that goes into a credit score is the age of your credit history. So if you started establishing credit at a younger age you have more time to build that experience.”\nShe adds, “The other good thing about starting younger is that you have the opportunity to watch how your child handles the card and handles credit and debt. That gets harder to do once they’re out of the house…so in that sense it can make a lot of sense to help them start when they’re 16, 17 or 18.”\nAccording to Beverly Harzog , a credit card expert and author of Confessions of a Credit Junkie: Everything You Need to Know to Avoid the Mistakes I Made “There isn’t a specific age that is the right age. It depends on how mature the child is and how much time you spend talking to them about money management, what credit is and paying bills.”\n“There is an emotional disconnect with using any kind of plastic,” she says, so it’s important for parents to spend time explaining the concept of credit. If the child seems ready at an earlier age it makes sense for them to start building up credit, which will help get them off to a good start as an adult. For other kids who don’t seem ready, she says, waiting until they’re 22 or 23 years old may be a better bet.\nPage 1 / 4 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.beverlyharzog.com/confessions-of-a-credit-junkie/", "http://blog.credit.com/author/gerri_detweiler/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/36-of-millennials-have-never-had-a-credit-card-300065329.html"], "published": "2015-07-15T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:47:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
