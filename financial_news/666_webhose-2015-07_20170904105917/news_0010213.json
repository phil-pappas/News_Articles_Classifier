Officials also suspended initial public offerings and gave a government agency access to more than $480 billion of borrowed funds to help finance equity purchases.\nThe unprecedented intervention raised concern that President Xi Jinping is backpedaling from his commitment to allow markets to play a larger role in the economy. The government shouldn’t have let trading stop, Gao said.\nIn the 12 months through mid-June, the Shanghai Composite Index more than doubled as state media and policy makers publicly encouraged investors to buy stocks. The rally was fueled by a five-fold surge in margin debt as investors borrowed money to finance the purchases.\nGao said policy makers’ endorsements of stock purchases helped drive prices to unsustainable levels. A lack of coordination between government agencies, including securities regulators and the China Banking Regulatory Commission, contributed the buildup of leverage, he said.\nTrading Suspensions “We encouraged people to come to the market. It’s more or less sponsored by the government,” Gao said. “That, to me, is a concern.”\nA founding member of the Chinese securities commission, Gao served as the general counsel and director of public offerings from 1992 to 1995 and then vice chairman from 2003 to 2007. Gao, who graduated from Duke University School of Law, now teaches at Tsinghua University in Beijing, after stepping down last year as the chief investment officer at China Investment Group, a $575 billion sovereign wealth fund.\nWhile the Shanghai gauge has rebounded 18 percent from its July 8 low, more than 500 companies remained suspended from trading as of Thursday, equivalent to 18 percent of total listings.\nThough the government is committed to reforms, there’s a risk that the market will take a long time to resume normal operations, Gao said.\n“Every time we shut down something, usually during a crisis, you do it in one minute, then it takes forever” to reopen it, Gao said. “Why? When you open it, everyone has to sign off, and if any of them has some doubt about it, then you cannot do that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T01:23:05.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
