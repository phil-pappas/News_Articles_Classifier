The current process takes up to six weeks. \nRetrofitting insulation is expected to cost $600 million, with benefit of $2.10 per dollar spent. Smoke alarms, while much cheaper in comparison at $7 million, will provide a $15.10 return on every dollar. \nDr Smith says the Property Federation, which represents a large number of landlords, is on board with the smoke alarms, but 'hopes to persuade\" them about the insulation. \nThey had reservations about compliance costs, he said. \nCabinet agreed to the changes on Monday and will be included in a Residential Tenancies Act Amendment Bill which will be introduced into Parliament on October. \nConsultation on the regulations on the insulation and smoke alarm changes will be done in a select committee process. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T04:36:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
