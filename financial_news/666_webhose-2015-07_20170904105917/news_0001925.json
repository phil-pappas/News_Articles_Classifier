The deal releases Peabody from \"certain guarantees in place for reclamation activities,\" it said.\nIn May 2014, Peabody agreed to sell the mine for $US70 million to Mr Tinkler. That deal collapsed in August after Mr Tinkler failed to make payments.\nNathan Tinkler in happier times. Photo: Tony Feder\nPeabody is looking to sell assets in the US and Australia as it tries to weather the coal industry's worst downturn in decades. The company announced the closing of Wilkie Creek in December 2013 because of falling prices for the power-plant fuel, which have extended their decline since then by about 29 per cent.\nAdvertisement \"We suspect anything and everything is for sale at the right price,\" Mark Levin, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets, said in a note Monday, referring to Peabody and the rest of the US coal industry. \"Unfortunately, the opportunity to get maximum value for these assets is limited.\"\nSekitan is a subsidiary of Exergen Pty Ltd., an Australian clean coal technology company. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2015, Peabody said.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T04:47:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
