The IRS gets a minor slap on the wrist, and all the American taxpayers get is what appears to be an insincere “I’m sorry” from the IRS.”\nWillis explains the gist of the IRS program, “The IRS routinely freezes and seizes bank accounts of people who habitually make a series of deposits in short time frames that add up to $10,000 or more. The Bank Secrecy Act obligates all financial institutions to flag accounts where this type of behavior occurs.” According to Willis, “Whether the account holder has ever been involved in tax evasion, drug smuggling and terrorist activities or not the accounts are flagged. Then, the IRS can freeze the accounts and seize the assets without ever charging the account holder with a crime.” “Small business owners” states Willis “have been ruined as a result of this Civil Assets Seizure Program (aka Bank Secrecy Act). So who’s the real criminal?”\nThe entire article can be read at: http://www.irsallstar.com/articles/after-years-of-criminal-behavior-the-irs-finally-gets-a-slap-on-the-wrist.php\nABOUT JOHN WILLIS\nMr. Willis believes strongly in supporting and representing the “underdog” and has devoted his entire professional life to protecting and defending those who need it most.
