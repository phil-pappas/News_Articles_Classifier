RWE climbed 6 percent, while rival E.ON advanced 3.3 percent.\nAny decision to go ahead with the plans would have threatened the survival of 17 out of 20 of RWE's brown coal-fired power stations and two out of three brown coal mines, RWE had said during months of wrangling.\nOil major BP also rose 4 percent after settling U.S. 2010 oil spill claims.\nThe STOXX Europe 600 Utility Index advanced 1.3 percent, outstripping the broader, pan-European STOXX 600 index , which was down 0.1 percent.\n\"Regulation has weighed on the utility stocks of late, so the decision in Germany should help them recover some of the ground they have lost,\" Cavendish Asset Management European equities fund manager, Caroline Vincent, said.\nGREECE UNCERTAINTY\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 0.1 percent while the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index declined 0.6 percent.\nTraders said uncertainty over Greece meant many investors were unwilling to buy. Greece defaulted on a loan to the International Monetary Fund this week and faces a referendum on Sunday that may decide its future in the euro zone.\nAnother reason for the pullback was a rebound in the euro, which rose against the U.S. dollar after weaker-than-expected U.S. employment data.\nThe euro's move weighed on European car stocks, which fell 1.1 percent, since a weak euro typically helps European automakers export more of their goods overseas.\nSome analysts said the longer-term outlook for European equities remained positive, given the backdrop of economic stimulus measures from the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\"Ongoing Greece uncertainty is creating shorter-term headwind but when we focus on the fundamentals we believe they are still supportive for European equities,\" HSBC strategist, Robert Parkes, said.\nToday's European research round-up (Additional reporting by Liisa Tuhkanen and Lionel Laurent; Editing by Louise Ireland)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T17:33:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
