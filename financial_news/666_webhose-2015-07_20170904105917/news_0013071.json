Andrew Meares by Ben Potter and John Kerin Trade Minister Andrew Robb has dismissed Labor calls for a review of intellectual property rights before the government signs up to the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership accusing the Opposition of \"playing politics\" with Australia's economic prosperity.\nMr Robb was responding to Opposition spokeswoman on trade Penny Wong and shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh who earlier called for the review saying intellectual property was emerging as a key issue in the Trans-Pacific Partnership talks and the government needed to review urgently the system and how it is handled in trade talks before signing.\n\"The Abbott government must now bring forward this Productivity Commission review to ensure it has the latest evidence and analysis on intellectual property rights when negotiating this decade's biggest trade deal,\" Ms Wong and Mr Leigh said.\nThe Australian Financial Review reported on Monday that the government was preparing to submit intellectual property holders' and users' rights to a commission inquiry , but was baulking at asking the commission to investigate how these issues were dealt with in trade deals.\nBut Mr Robb said the government would stick with continuing to \"negotiate IP in the TPP within the framework of Australia's existing arrangements\".\n\"The TPP brings transformational promise with more seamless trade and investment across 12 countries, which account for almost 40 per cent of global GDP,\" Mr Robb said.\n\"This agreement would translate into growth, jobs and higher living standards for all Australians, and it's incumbent upon Penny Wong and Labor to stop playing politics with Australia's future economic prosperity.\"\nThe Harper review of competition recommended the two separate reviews should be conducted over 12 months to ensure the system operated in the interests of Australians as early adopters and net importers of copyrights, patents and other intellectual property.\n A 12-month review would upset the timetable for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which governments are hoping to sign by the end of 2015.\nThe US government is pursuing further expansion of IP rights on behalf of pharmaceutical giants and other rights holders in the TPP, as well as \"investor state dispute settlement\" clauses of the kind used by Philip Morris to attack the Australian government's mandatory plain packaging tobacco warnings.\nCentral to negotiations \"Intellectual property issues are central to these negotiations, with key parties like the US government pursuing expanded IP rights for their major corporations,\" Ms Wong and Mr Leigh said.\n\"We need a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses in Australia's current regime before the Abbott government agrees to any significant changes.\n\"We also need to set some benchmarks for protecting Australia's national interest on intellectual property issues when our government goes to the negotiating table with other countries.\"\nLabor typically supports trade deals, and in 2014 backed a trade deal with Korea, even though it had concerns about the investor state dispute settlement clause, because of the benefits to farmers from increased access to Korean markets.\nBut Labor feels Trade Minister Andrew Robb hasn't adequately explained how the government plans to address concerns about intellectual property and investor state dispute settlement, in the face of a campaign that has been embraced by some mainstream business figures, including Reserve Bank of Australia board member Heather Ridout .\nThe TPP is a trade and investment deal being negotiated among a dozen Asia Pacific nations led by the US, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Canada, Vietnam and Taiwan.\nEven without China and India, the largest emerging economies, it would cover more than 40 per cent of the global economy.\nBut the deal has come under fire, not just from the usual protectionist groups but because of increasing disenchantment in policy circles and among some business folk.\nCritics say the proliferating \"spaghetti bowl\" of conflicting rules of origin in bilateral and regional trade deals and Washington's obsession with excluding China are thwarting rather than promoting free trade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:58:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
