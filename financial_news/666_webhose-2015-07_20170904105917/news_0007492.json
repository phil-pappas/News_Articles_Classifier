Sentiment towards the euro is weak and we think it is a sell on the rallies.\" \nThe U.S. currency gained around 25 percent against the euro and a basket of currencies between June of last year and mid-March, and more analysts still think it will rise than believe it has run its course. \nBut its inability to trade stronger than $1.08 per euro since April is beginning to trouble those betting on a run to parity against the single currency. \nBank of America Merrill Lynch's head of G10 FX strategy Athanasios Vamvakidis said he remained bullish on the dollar, given his expectation of a Fed rate rise in September. \n\"We have it at parity with the euro by the end of the year, but we do not see it going much below parity,\" he said. \"The long-term equilibrium rate with the euro is around $1.20-1.30, so it can go below that in times of policy divergence but not by so much.\" \nBy GMT 0804, the dollar was less than 0.1 percent higher against both the euro and a basket of currencies at $1.0927 and 97.376 respectively. \nAgainst the yen it eased 0.1 percent to 123.76 yen, down from a roughly six-week high of 124.48 yen on Tuesday. \nCommodity currencies, including the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollar, which have been hit by the dollar's rally in the past month, were still on the back foot. \nThe kiwi fell 0.2 percent to $0.6616, just off six-year lows reached last week, with attention shifting to a meeting of the Reserve Bank on Thursday morning that is expected to cut official interest rates at least a quarter point. \n\"The tables have turned a bit on NZDUSD traders with the sudden introduction of dollar weakness,\" said John Hardy, head of FX Strategy at Saxo Bank. \"So if the RBNZ under-delivers on the dovishness of its guidance amid further USD weakness, the risk grows dramatically of a sharp squeeze.\" (Editing by Larry King)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T14:50:31.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
