Photo: Mariah Carey, Instagram\nThe Queensland loss might indicate that Crown boss James Packer needs to divert his attention from Mariah Carey's assets to his casino business. Here are a few pressing issues.\n1. Macau It took investors a long time to learn how important Macau is to Crown. In October 2013, Packer crowed that the value of his investment had increased 10-fold and was now worth more than $6 billion to Crown.\nIt was finally getting to the point where Melco Crown cash was promising to flow back to Crown.\nAdvertisement It has been downhill ever since.\nThe corruption crackdown hit the high rollers and has sent revenues into freefall across the gambling enclave. Melco Crown shares have more than halved since last year's peak .\nNow the Chinese stock market meltdown is threatening to hit discretionary spending in the mass-market arena that helped cushion the high-roller purge in Macau for Melco Crown.\nThings could be getting a lot worse in the former Portuguese colony.\n2. Licence renewals One thing that has probably missed the attention of the average investor is that all six Macau casino operators face renewal of their licences by 2022. This include Melco Crown.\nAre there any suggestions that any of the six licences won't be renewed, or face onerous terms? No. But no one was expecting the harsh corruption crackdown that has sent revenues into reverse either.\n3. The Philippines The house does not always win\nIn February, Packer was basking in the glow of his new Philippine venture, having spent $70 million on the promo video by filmmaker Martin Scorsese, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro .\nThe publicly listed Melco Crown Philippines stock has plunged around 65 per cent since December, indicating that this particular \"bet on China\" - or more specifically Chinese high rollers, is not going to plan.\n4. Queensland It highlighted why Crown was so keen to play in a tourism hot spot like Queensland. It is the sort of place where a casino operator like Crown needs to play if it wants to cap the leakage of Chinese high rollers who are having to look further afield than Macau.\n\"This is going to be the next mining boom,\" said Echo boss Matt Bekier of its Queensland win .\nEcho's Asian partners are already announcing plans to channel VIP customers to the project when it is ready.\n5. Las Vegas VIP whale Kerry Packer did his dough in Vegas, but he had fun doing so , It was his way of letting off steam.\n\"Some of the happiest times I ever saw my dad was times when I was with him in the casinos and he had a good night,\" James said last year.\nJames has done a lot more dough trying to develop billions of dollars of casinos in Vegas and not had any fun in the process.\nAnd now he is going back for more . It is another bet on the global VIP gambling market, and more specifically, Chinese high rollers.\nCrown investors could be forgiven for having their fingers crossed on this latest roll of the dice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T15:12:57.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
