Cedi appreciation \nSome few days ago, fuel prices were reduced by 15 per cent at the various fuel stations. \nPlayers in the industry have attributed the decrease to the appreciation of the cedi against the major international trading currencies. \nThe Daily Graphic observed that the decrease varied at the various fuel stations, with marginal differences in the prices. \nPrices of fuel products have gone up by more than 25 per cent in the past four months. The price of crude oil on the international market fell below $51 a barrel last Tuesday, after hovering round $60. \nAs of Friday, July 10, 2015, the cedi was being sold at GH¢3.4596 for one dollar on the interbank market and purchased for GH¢3.4630. \nThe cedi has gained 4.27 per cent in value since February 2015. Fuel prices \nAt the Total fuel station on the 37 Military Hospital road, petrol, which was previously sold at GH¢3.538 per litre, is now being sold at GH¢3.490, while diesel, which was sold at GH¢3.144, is selling at GH¢3.106 \nThe supervisor of the station, Mr Daniel Quaye, told the Daily Graphic that the price of petrol per gallon, which was previously pegged at GH¢15.92, was now GH¢15.71. \nThe Ghana Oil Company Limited (GOIL) has dropped its prices to levels that could make them the lowest in the industry so far. \nAt the GOIL fuel station on the Osu Oxford Street, petrol, which was sold at GH¢3.460 per litre, is now selling at GH¢ 3.42, while a litre of diesel, which was sold at GH¢3.070, is selling at GH¢2.98. Sustain it \nThe Supervisor of the station, Mr Yooku Adu, told the Daily Graphic that the station currently made good sales as a result of the difference between the prices of fuel at GOIL filling stations and those of the other fuel stations. \nThe Shell fuel station on the Osu Oxford Street had reduced its petrol price from GH¢3.492 per litre to GH¢3.463, while diesel is currently selling at GH¢3.073, from the previous GH¢3.108 per litre. \nHowever, a private fuel station, Allied Oil, was still maintaining its old price after the 15 per cent reduction on July 15, this year. \nAt the Allied Oil station on the Legon road, petrol is currently being sold at GH¢3.450, while diesel is selling at GH¢3.065 \nAt the Engen fuel station at Adabraka, petrol, which was previously sold at GH¢3.960 per litre, is being sold at GH¢3.460, while diesel, which was sold at GH¢3.720, is selling at GH¢3.070. \nThe attendant at the station, Ms Joyce Okai, told the Daily Graphic that the price of petrol per gallon, which was previously pegged at GH¢15.57, was now GH¢13.815. \nMeanwhile, at the Glory Oil fuel station at Accra New Town, fuel prices were moderate, compared to what pertained at the other stations. \nPetrol, which was sold at GH¢3.992 per litre, is now selling at GH¢3.450, while a litre of diesel, which was sold at GH¢3.772, is selling at GH¢3.060. \nThe assistant supervisor at the station, Mr Cephas Kamasah, told the Daily Graphic that the station was making good sales, although the difference between the prices at the other stations was lower. Customers \nA customer, Chief Inspector Mintah, however, stated that some of the customers did not even know the percentage at which the prices of petroleum products had been reduced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T02:59:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
