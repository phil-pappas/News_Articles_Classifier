It said a new consumption tax introduced in April and fuel subsidy reforms are supportive of Malaysia’s finances, even as government debt guarantees increase. The company warned in March that the chance of a downgrade was more than 50 percent, helping send the ringgit to a decade low.\nThe FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index of stocks advanced 1.6 percent to 1,734.35 as of 10:21 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur. The currency rose 0.9 percent to 3.7413 a dollar and earlier climbed to a one-week high of 3.7287, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n“Fitch’s move to raise Malaysia’s outlook was a surprise,” said Wong Chee Seng, a foreign-exchange strategist at AmBank Group in Kuala Lumpur. “The ringgit’s strength reflects the realignment of trading positions as most people were factoring in a downgrade.”\nThe ringgit slumped to 3.7887 on Monday, close to the 3.8 level it was pegged at during the Asian financial crisis before being scrapped in July 2005. The 45 percent slump in Brent crude prices from last year’s peak has weighed on the currency, as have debt woes at state investment company 1Malaysia Development Bhd. and the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates.\nBonds Rise Prime Minister Najib Razak halted a decades-old fuel subsidy policy in December and started a 6 percent goods and services tax in April to boost state coffers. Falling oil prices prompted the government to lower 2015’s economic growth forecast in January to a range of 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent, from as much 6 percent.\n1MDB’s borrowings amounted to 41.9 billion ringgit ($11.2 billion) as of March 2014, partly because of purchases of power plants and land. As the company’s troubled finances threatened Malaysia’s rating, Najib faced calls from former premier Mahathir Mohamad to step down as leader because of the performance of 1MDB, whose advisory board he chairs.\n“Fitch continues to believe that the Malaysian sovereign is incurring additional contingent liabilities beyond explicit guarantees because of quasi-fiscal operations of state-owned entity 1MDB,” according to the Fitch statement . “Fitch thinks there is a high probability that sovereign support for 1MDB would be forthcoming if needed.”\nThe cost to insure the nation’s debt fell after the Fitch announcement, while bond prices rose. Five-year credit-default swaps dropped four basis points to 134, the biggest decline since March, and the yield on the 2020 notes retreated three basis points to 3.61 percent.\nStock Buying Fitch lowered Malaysia’s outlook to negative in 2013, citing weaker prospects for public finances. Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s also rank Malaysia at their fourth-lowest investment grades. Moody’s has a positive outlook, while S&P’s is stable.\n“The rating was expected and there’s no reason for Fitch to downgrade Malaysia’s rating based on what the government has done since the last review,” said Ang Kok Heng, the Kuala Lumpur-based chief investment officer of Phillip Capital Management Sdn., which manages $428 million. “We have been buying and we are still selectively buying,” he said, referring to the nation’s equities.\nFor Related Stories: Ringgit Forecasts Upgraded as Malaysia Rides Oil Rollercoaster Malaysia Already Seen Losing Single A Debt Rank in Default Swaps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T09:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T06:34:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
