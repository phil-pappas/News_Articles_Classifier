Not everyone is convinced of his stated motives. Dominic Lorrimer Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow So former ALP national secretary Bob Hogg reckons Bill Shorten should resign after his performance at Dyson Heydon 's royal commission.\nHogg says the Opposition Leader has been shown to have a conflict of interest when he was the secretary of the Australian Workers Union . Not everyone is convinced by Hogg's stated motivation.\n\"It's all about Maxine,\" is the view of a fair wad of the Labor Party.\nHogg is married to Maxine McKew , the former ABC television host who stunned the political establishment by beating John Howard in 2007.\nIt was a short political career. She lost Bennelong three years later to tennis commentator-turned-Liberal MP John Alexander .\nOn the night of her loss, McKew made it clear who she blamed for her cruel change of fortune.\nShe was furious about the toppling of Kevin Rudd .\nAnd as any waiter in any Chinese restaurant on Sussex Street worth their MSG-laced salt could tell you, McKew remains filthy at the power brokers who masterminded the kill: David Feeney , Don Farrell , Mark Arbib and man of the moment Bill Shorten .\n (Those same waiters could also tell you McKew's detractors reckon her crazy-brave decision to ban negative advertising in her 2010 campaign didn't help either. Nor did her legendary ban of doorknockers wearing \"Your Rights at Work\" T-shirts.)\nNow of course we're not accusing Hogg of a conflict of interest himself. His position could be entirely independent of his wife's experience.\nWe just thought we'd throw it in by way of context as the old party settles into yet another round of ripping each other apart.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/celebrity-showdown-in-former-pms-sacred-seat-20091216-ky6h.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/unions-royal-commission-bob-hoggs-call-for-bill-shorten-to-resign-as-labor-leader-backfires-20150709-gi8e7p.html", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/the-pulse-live/bill-shorten-appears-before-the-royal-commission-into-trade-union-corruption-day-2-live-20150709-gi891g"], "published": "2015-07-09T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:04:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
