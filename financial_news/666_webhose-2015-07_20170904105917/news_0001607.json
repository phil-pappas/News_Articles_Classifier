The trailer also features Godot as Wonder Woman, Amy Adams as Lois Lane and Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor.\nFor the first time, Metropolis from the Superman world and Gotham from the Batman comics will be neighboring cities, separated by a bay, Snyder said.\nAffleck described Metropolis as big and successful, while Gotham is downtrodden.\n\"The whole idea of wealth and power and how power engenders fear ... made it feel real and smart to me,\" Affleck said.\nTime Warner Inc's Warner Bros, the studio behind Christopher Nolan's highly successful \"Dark Knight\" Batman trilogy, is expanding the DC universe and connecting each film to the others, a strategy similar to Walt Disney Co's Marvel Studios'.\nSnyder will direct the \"Justice League\" movies based on the comic series that teams up superheroes including Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and the Green Lantern. The first film is due in 2017.\nBefore the \"Batman\" panel, director David Ayer introduced the cast of \"Suicide Squad,\" due out next summer. Fans also got a first look at the film highlighting a band of anti-heroes, such as Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, Will Smith's Deadshot and Jared Leto's Joker.\nModerated by actress Aisha Tyler, Warner Bros' panel also featured Guy Ritchie's slick 1960s spy caper \"Man From UNCLE\" and \"Pan,\" which traces the origins of Peter Pan.
