In the absence of convincing justification, they would be serious violations of EU rules prohibiting anti-competitive agreements. \n\"European consumers want to watch the pay-TV channels of their choice regardless of where they live or travel in the EU,\" said EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. \n\"Our investigation shows that they cannot do this today.\" \nThe Commission is seeking to overhaul the continent's digital market to boost growth and catch up with the United (Shenzhen: 000925.SZ - news ) States and Africa. Moves involve ending mobile roaming charges and reforming copyright rules to widen access to online audiovisual content. \nThe Commission has sent Sky UK and the studios a \"statement of objections\". They have the right to reply in writing or request a hearing before the Commission takes a final decision. \nThe charge follows an investigation launched in January 2014 into licensing agreements between major U.S. film studios and the largest European pay-TV broadcasters, such as Sky UK, Canal Plus, Sky Italia, Sky Deutschland (Other OTC: SKDTY - news ) and Spain's DTS (NasdaqGS: DTSI - news ) .
