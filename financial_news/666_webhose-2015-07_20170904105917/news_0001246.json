Brendan Esposito Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Relief may be on the way for the live export trade after Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce signed a new agreement opening the door for Australian feeder and slaughter cattle to be sold to China.\nAustralian Livestock Exporters' Council head Alison Penfold said the new agreement, once complete, will make Australia the first country to export feeder and slaughter cattle to China.\nThe move comes days after exporters were hit by a shock cut in the Indonesian import quota , from an expected 200,000 to just 50,000 head of cattle.\nAustralia already exports dairy cattle to China under a different health protocol, but this will allow feeder and slaughter cattle to feed China's ever expanding population, Penfold said.\nThe agreement with China is on animal health certification requirements for the cattle, which will then be sent to China's quarantine minister, Zhi Shuping, for his signature.\nMr Joyce said this would open another market for Australian slaughter cattle exports.\n\"Over the past five years we've had a significant trade in breeder cattle with China, primarily for dairy heifers. Now, I'm pleased to announce we are a step closer to the commencement in trade in live slaughter and feeder cattle to China,\" Mr Joyce said.\nAfter clearing this animal health hurdle, exporters can start to develop agreements with local importers and establish supply chains that meet the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System, Mr Joyce said.\n The ESCAS system was introduced in response to cruelty concerns in overseas abattoirs.\nMr Joyce said while he could have come to the agreement without the new free trade agreement with China, exporters would benefit from a provision eliminating the current 10 per cent tariff over four years.\nMs Penford said the move was in line with strong Chinese demand for Australian meat, but the first cattle on Chinese shores may still be months away.\n\"This could take some time so it is difficult to say just when we will see the first ships depart but obviously we hope in the next couple of months,\" she said.\nShadow Minister for Agriculture Joel Fitzgibbon said while the establishment of the new health protocol was \"welcome\" and would help exporters, the \"signing of agreement is only stage one and a number of hurdles to go\" before exports began.\nHe also said it was a reminder of how important the free trade agreement was for Australian agriculture.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-07-20T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T23:05:01.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
