Reuters by Alexandra Cain Most self-managed superannuation funds share one defining feature: they have plenty of cash and ASX-listed shares, but hold few other asset classes.\nThis diversification problem could in part be solved by a higher allocation to overseas investments. But often, SMSF members are unsure how to gain access to, and knowledge about, investments located in other parts of the world.\nAccording to the Australian Taxation Office's Self-managed super fund statistical report for December 2014, for SMSFs with a balance higher than $10 million, listed shares on average comprise 29.84 per cent of the fund, cash and term deposits make up 20.13 per cent, and non-residential real property accounts for 12.1 per cent.\nIn contrast, overseas shares make up just 1.04 per cent of total funds, and other overseas assets in combination only make up a paltry 1.05 per cent â€“ although some argue that understates the true exposure to foreign investment among SMSFs.\nGreg Einfeld, a director of self-managed super fund advisers Lime Super, says SMSFs tend to invest predominantly in Australian assets, including bank deposits and shares.\n\"The most significant difference between the asset allocation of professional fund managers and that of SMSF trustees is that SMSFs usually shun overseas shares,\" he says.\nBut Einfeld says it is beneficial to invest in overseas shares, for two reasons. \"Firstly, overseas shares provide additional diversification across countries relative to investing just in Australia. Secondly, the Australian sharemarket doesn't provide material exposure to certain growth industries such as pharmaceuticals and global IT businesses. You also can't invest in great businesses such as Google, Apple and Intel in Australia.\"\nMichael Miller, financial adviser, MLC Advice Canberra, agrees that one of the main arguments for investing in global assets is that a large number of sectors or industries aren't well represented on the Australian sharemarkets. So you need to go offshore to get exposure to these.\n Miller says investors can get exposure to international assets through investing in a type of fund that holds international investments, such as an ETF or a managed fund.\nAnother approach is to look for Australian listed investments that hold significant assets in, and derive their income from, markets outside Australia.\n\"The pros and cons of each are generally similar to that of other investments, where you need to consider the transaction and management costs of each and how they are appropriate for you,\" he says. \"For example, an ETF will often have lower management costs than a managed fund, but higher transaction costs. So if you are buying frequently, a managed fund might prove more effective, but if you are buying less frequently in larger sizes, an ETF could have a lower total cost.\"\nThe technical services director at administrator Multiport, Philip La Greca, says domestic managed funds and ETFs are the two preferred methods for SMSFs to invest overseas.\nBut he says the ATO does not break out that data, so it can give an impression that there is little international exposure among SMSFs despite its research indicating it was around 14.4 per cent in March this year.\nMany ETFs are also index-tracking investments, so investors who prefer active management may need to look at managed funds or possibly a listed investment company that invests overseas.\nNevertheless, Einfeld says ETFs provide the most convenient and lowest-cost way of accessing overseas shares. \"They can be purchased through online share trading platforms for as little as 0.2 per cent a year and give you a diversified portfolio of hundreds of large overseas businesses across many countries and industries.\"\nIn contrast, he explains, managed funds tend to have higher fees of between 1 and 2 per cent a year. \"The managers of the funds claim that they can deliver better performance than ETFs. It is important to keep in mind that just because a fund has performed well in the past, that doesn't mean it will always do so.\"\nAnother approach, says Einfeld, is to buy shares directly, which allows you to select the companies you like. \"You would need to set up an overseas share trading account and also bank accounts in multiple currencies. You also need to deal with tax rules in other countries, especially if you are buying shares in the US. For these reasons, most Australian investors get their international share exposure through managed funds and ETFs.\"\nIt's also important to understand the different risks that emerge when investing overseas.\nSays Einfeld: \"One particular risk of investing overseas is currency risk. If the Australian dollar rises relative to the currency you have invested in then your investment will fall in value, even if the share price doesn't change. It also works in reverse: you can do well if the Australian dollar falls. Currency risk can be mitigated through currency hedging. For this reason it is important to understand whether the fund you have invested in has currency hedges in place or not.\"\nFinally, as Einfeld notes, when investing in developing countries, investors should be aware that reporting frameworks might not be as robust as in Australia.\n\"Companies' reported profits might not have undergone the same rigorous accounting and audit standards as we are familiar with, which adds an additional layer of risk.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:59:30.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
