Although Revenues are lower than in 2014 as a result of our planned reduction in revenue from the machine sales division and our move we reduced overhead significantly and coupled with earnings from our new business financial services division have given the Company a much improved position.\nIt is important that our shareholders know about our last eighteen months but before we begin our update on the progress the Company has made we wanted to first thank all our shareholders for sticking with the Company during this transition to overall profitability.\nAs we all know it has been an extremely difficult 12 to 18 months but we feel that we are now closing in on the completion of various transactions that will change the future of this Company.\nFirst we are proud to say that our internal 12 point plan to profitability mentioned in press releases is close to completion and is described below:\n12 Point Plan:\nStep#1  We reinvigorated management and its employees so that a “new attitude” could emerge in M Line by taking away the “image” that the graveyard was not on the horizon and that this company despite all of its problems will be successful.\nStep #2  Our Cash flow needed more focus and improvement first by concentrating on regaining customer endorsement and support as well as by cutting overheads as much as possible. There is still work to be done to improve our cash flow but our plans are working and positive results are slowly coming through.\nStep # 3  We reduced our reliance on any one customer by adding new customers and expanding revenues from current customers.  We have also added new products and new industries that meet our manufacturing capabilities.\nStep #4  Get the Company’s primary customer to do a “product quality” review with the objective to say that our manufacturing quality was acceptable based on their standards not ours. Now we were able to focus on more orders and new primary customers which doubled in the first year. \nSo with the first four steps accomplished management then looked at our manufacturing facility as the next step in improving the Company.\nStep #5  The next step was to consider a move from our Tustin location.  The Tustin facility had a disorganized and uneconomical production flow line with utilization running at 35% of capacity and over-priced rent. We needed to relocate and we moved to a new facility in Anaheim in July 2014 saving some 2 in rent utilities and improved efficiencies annually.\nStep #6  M Line had to repair its identity and attract new capital in order to broaden its overhead break-even coverage. Management achieved this by starting the following actions:                                   \na/.  The Company contracted with a recognizable New York City investment banking firm to provide us with a 30 million funding commitment.  This funding was designed to be used to acquire other companies in the aerospace industry.   As noted in our previous press releases we have identified five candidates and are close to closing the first two of those candidates.  We continue to work closely with our investment bankers on this process.\nb/.  Replace our current lender with lower cost financing.  We have signed documentation for the first part of this funding which is due to commence as soon as we file our three outstanding 10-Qs.\nc/.  Complete the refinance with another asset based lender at a lower cost than our current lender.  This has not been completed yet but is in process.\nStep #7  Find acquisition candidates that add positive benefits to our current business. We found two key acquisitions which could not only complement our existing business but more than double our revenues expand our key customer base and significantly increase our EBITDA.  We know how important it is to show profitable growth so that we can gain the confidence of our shareholder base.\nStep #8  Set up better communication with our shareholders. Although we are trying to keep our shareholders informed it is difficult to issue news when the shares have a “stop” sign.  It also makes it difficult to close the acquisition transactions but we continue to work on completing our filings which will solve this issue.\nStep #9  Close the first 2 acquisition candidates.  We did get delayed but we are working on closing these transactions now.  We are also looking for additional targets.\nStep #10  Complete the audit of the 2014 10-K which has now been filed. Complete the reviews of the 10-Q’s as soon as possible which is currently in process.\nStep# 11  Prepare and complete timely the audit of our 2015 10-K\nStep #12  Translate the efforts from the past 18-months into true Shareholder Value!\nOver the last six months we have reduced overhead significantly.  Although our revenues have dropped mainly due to the move of our manufacturing facility and the changes at Elite Machine Tool overhead reductions have been significant. \nNew Products and Services:\na/.  New Products\nWe have added a new product line to our manufacturing facility and are now producing a “Vape Pipe” for a new customer.  We anticipate that revenues for this product will exceed 250000 per month by the end of September.  We together with our customer’s support designed the “Pipe” and are now manufacturing our first order of 1000 units.  We believe there is a very large market for these “Pipes” and we are already planning the next two generations of the product.  We anticipate our ability to produce a high quality product with our technological manufacturing capabilities can put us at the forefront of this growth industry.\nb/.  New Services\nDuring this last year we formed and started providing services in our new business financial services company.  We are expecting significant profits from this division over the next year.  We closed our first transaction last year and we are currently negotiating with three new prospective clients and hope to continue to expand this financial services division.  In the future we expect to include equipment financing for our customers as a part of this division’s activities which will then add to our anticipated sales growth objectives..  We have not added any staff to manage this division as the work is primarily managed by our CEO Bruce Barren and COO Tony Anish.\nOur Move:\nThe move to our new facility has been very beneficial to the Company.  Our corporate offices are located on the second level of the building with its own entrance.  The facility for Precision includes sufficient office space a large assembly area which is important for the assembly of our Vape Pipes and a manufacturing floor that has some room for expansion but is much more efficient space.  Overall the building is smaller but with a much more usuable “footprint”.\nRefinancing:\nThe refinancing of our Company is still not complete.  We have arranged financing for the take-out of approximately 50% of the amount due our current lender.  We expect the additional financing to be finalized very shortly.  This has been a long process.  It has been made more difficult as working with our current lender is complex however it has also been made more challenging due to the drop in revenues as a result of our move.  Currently we are working with a number of excellent sources and expect to close a transaction very shortly.\nConclusion:\nAt present we are working to complete the following:\n1/.  Finalize and file our three outstanding 10-Qs and get the “Stop Sign” removed from our SEC listing.\n2/.  Finalize the remaining finance necessary to pay off our current lender\n3/.  Continue with the closing of the first two acquisition targets previously disclosed. \na/.  Blue Star Machinery Inc. is a targeted acquisition that will enhance our machine sales division.  We had planned to close this acquisition much earlier but due to the delays with our financial reporting we were unable to close as originally planned.  We now expect to close as soon as the 10-Qs are filed.\nb/.  The Byran Company Inc. is a targeted acquisition that will increase and enhance our manufacturing capabilities.  Byran is a very well run machine tool shop providing design manufacturing and assembly services to the aerospace and medical industries.  This was always going to be our second acquisition but we now plan to move it forward as fast as possible and to close soon after the 10-Qs are filed.\nBruce Barren CEO and Tony Anish COO of M Line commented;  “We sincerely believe that the end result will be a stronger company with a stronger stock and much improved Shareholder Value.  We are looking forward to the next twelve months.  This has not been an easy year but we now see the “finish line” which will result in a more profitable group of companies with revenues in excess of 20 million and a strong EBITDA.”\nSincerely\n \n/s/ Bruce Barren                                                                                              /s/ Tony Anish\nBruce Barren                                                                                                   Anthony Anish\nCEO                                                                                                                COO\n\n\nAbout PRBuzz.com \nPRBuzz.com is a press release distribution service that distributes press releases to online news sites and blogs to help customers with search engine optimization and create buzz about their web site, news or business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T11:19:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
