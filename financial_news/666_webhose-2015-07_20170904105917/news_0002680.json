Total UK sales climbed 22.8pc to £418.8m. \nThe retailer opened a record 25 stores in the quarter, as it races towards its goal of having 850 sites in the UK. B&M currently has 450 UK stores, and expects to open 80 this year. \n“I am pleased to report that the group has delivered another strong spring trading period,” said Simon Arora, chief executive. \n“We have opened 25 stores in just 13 weeks, which is a record rate of openings, and testament to the hard work and dedication of our colleagues. As consumer spending improves, it is apparent that shoppers remain keen to spend with value retailers and we continue to win market share.\" \nB&M said its \"robust and balanced\" business model meant it had been able to withstand the \"deflationary backdrop\" of the grocery and fmcg market in the UK, as well as disappointing weather in May that hit sales of seasonal outdoor products. \nB&M, whose chair is former Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) boss Sir Terry Leahy, opened in Blackpool in 1978 and floated in June 2014 . It sells a wide range of goods from household items and garden furniture to toys, electricals and selected groceries, such as drinks, snacks and cupboard staples like cereal. \nIt is now building its presence in the German market, having acquired the 50-store Jawoll chain in March 2014. B&M said on Friday two new-format stores in Germany were trading in line with expectations and it hoped to open more this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T11:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T12:21:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
