They will still use the banks as deposit agencies but manage the funds themselves. \nWhen they take off fully, people who do not have bank accounts with the traditional banks can now walk to mobile money operators and their partner e-money organizations and actually do banking transactions like take loans and other things. \nThe banks and the telcos are, however, said to be in discussion on what kind of revenue share arrangement will prevail under the new situation, where the license holder is now the telco and not the bank. \nVodafoneMeanwhile, Vodafone is almost on the verge of launching what is expected to be a superior mobile money platform in Ghana, on the back of the new guidelines. \nFormer Vodafone Ghana CEO, Kyle Whitehill had said, in previous interviews with Adom News, that the mobile money services being offered in Ghana now do not quite cut it so Vodafone was taking time to provide a service that would be relevant to consumers in every way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T12:27:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
