The kiwi has lost 14 percent in that time, or more than the other three combined.\nThe currencies are under pressure as commodity-exporting nations cut interest rates to support growth after raw-materials prices plunged 45 percent from their 2011 highs. None, though, will ease as aggressively over the next year as New Zealand, according to market-implied policy rates. Its Reserve Bank will start by lowering rates for a second straight meeting on Thursday, economist forecasts compiled by Bloomberg show.\n“We’re basically negative across the commodity-currency complex, but we’re more negative on the New Zealand dollar,” said Ray Attrill, global co-head of currency strategy in Sydney at National Australia Bank Ltd., the most-accurate kiwi forecaster in Bloomberg’s rankings. “It’s number one on our hit list. I don’t think anything else comes close.”\nExtending Slide NAB sees New Zealand’s dollar slumping about 10 percent to 60 U.S. cents by March 2016, from 66.25 cents Tuesday in New York, as the central bank lowers its benchmark rate three more times this year, to 2.5 percent from 3.25 percent. All 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict the RBNZ will reduce the cash-rate this week, with 18 expecting a cut to 3 percent.\nThe kiwi reached a six-year low of 64.99 cents on July 16 and its plunge since mid-April has only been outpaced by the Angolan kwanza, Myanmar’s kyat and the Haitian gourde among about 150 currencies tracked worldwide by Bloomberg.\nCanada’s dollar has tumbled 5 percent over that period, Australia’s has dropped 4 percent and Norway’s krone is down more than 2 percent.\nEven at 3 percent, New Zealand’s benchmark rate would be at least a percentage point higher than any other major industrialized nation’s, making bigger cuts possible. The Bank of Canada lowered its main rate a quarter-point last week to 0.5 percent, while the Reserve Bank of Australia has trimmed its key rate twice this year to stand at 2 percent.\nBiggest Loser “The RBNZ has the most room to ease monetary policy, and therefore it follows that the kiwi has most to lose as interest-rate expectations adjust,” said Sue Trinh, senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong. “We can’t rule out a test of the 60-cent level on the basis of narrowing interest-rate differentials.”\nThose differences are key because while commodity exporters are easing policy -- which tends to weigh on their currencies -- the Fed is preparing to raise borrowing costs from the zero-to-0.25-percent range they’ve been in since 2008.\nThe RBNZ will reduce its benchmark by 68 basis points, or 0.68 percentage point, in the next 12 months, while Australia will cut by 15 basis points and Canada by 13 basis points, market-implied policy rates suggest.\nCommodities Rout Record-low U.S. rates combined with the cheap cash the Fed pumped into the world economy until 2013 helped boost demand for raw materials in the wake of the global financial crash, sending Bloomberg’s Commodity Index soaring about 70 percent in the two years from March 2009. Export-driven currencies have risen since then, too, leading their Group-of-10 counterparts and with the kiwi the biggest gainer.\nRaw materials have tumbled almost 9 percent in the past two months, sending the Bloomberg index to a 13-year low on July 20. Crude oil, key for both Canada and Norway, has slumped 15 percent in the period, while Australia’s biggest export earner - - iron ore -- is down 13 percent, and New Zealand mainstay dairy has dropped more than 20 percent.\n“The New Zealand dollar has the most downside because it has the highest starting point,” said Sam Tuck, a senior currency strategist in Auckland at ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd. “Given the sheer momentum of the New Zealand dollar’s decline, it would be a little bit imprudent to talk about when it might stop.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T02:12:25.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
