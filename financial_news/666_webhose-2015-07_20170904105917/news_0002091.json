First, it must be noted that the registration of the arbitral award was done by the High Court, which is a superior court to the Labour Court. The High Court has its own jurisdiction and rules which govern its own processes,\" said Mr Mawadze. \nHe said it was futile for the MDC-T to base their defence on a stay of execution that the party obtained from the Labour Court way after the award had been given by the High Court. \nMr Mawadze said the party needed to make a fresh application at the High Court. He said it was a criminal offence for party officials to remove any property cited in the writ of execution from premises where it was attached. \nProperty belonging to MDC-T leader Mr Morgan Tsvangirai was on Tuesday identified by the Messenger of Court for attachment after former employees obtained a writ of execution for unlawful dismissal. \nThe Messenger of Court descended on Mr Tsvangirai's house in the company of anti-riot police and identified several vehicles for attachment and execution. \nAccording to the writ of execution, the Deputy Sheriff was required and directed to attach and take into execution movable goods belonging to Mr Tsvangirai at his Highlands house in Kew Drive. \nThe writ directed that: \"If after due inquiry and diligent search you find that the movable goods belonging to the said respondent (Mr Tsvangirai) are insufficient to satisfy the amount due under this writ that you attach, take into possession a certain piece of land situated in the district of Salisbury called Stand 2 Strathaven Township of Strathaven measuring 4 689 square metres held under deed of transfer No. 992/7/200 dated 2 November 2000 and also attach and take into possession certain piece of land situated in the district of Goromonzi measuring 150 square metres called stand 16099 Seki Township held under Deed of transfer No. 10704/2002.\" \nMDC-T is experiencing serious financial difficulties after it was deserted by its funders in the wake the party's dismal performance in the July 31, 2013 harmonised elections won by ZANU-PF. \nAt one stage party officials appealed to members and supporters to donate a dollar each via Ecocash but the funds were reportedly abused. \nThe rival factions have also bickered over party properties.
