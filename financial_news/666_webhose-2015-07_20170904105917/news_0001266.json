It's pre the global financial crisis and the big punt occupying the minds of market traders is whether Macquarie Bank share will reach that $100 mark - by May it was inches away hovering at more than $98.\nNo one was paying too much attention to the fundamental drivers of Macquarie's aggressive growth, or the quality of its earnings. Rather than being seen as a risk the group's high levels of debt were viewed as an advantage. Leverage was king.\nWe are all familiar with the unfolding of this story. The financial crisis came along, Macquarie was exposed and it had its existential moment as the share prices plunged to $15.\nFast forward the clock eight years to 2015 and once again the traders (some of which were probably not around back in 2007) are punting on whether Macquarie shares can hit the magic $100.\nAdvertisement A repeat of this exuberance may be enough for some with longish memories to get a bit jittery around Macquarie as those deja vu feelings rise to the surface.\nBut there was a positive share price response to more bullish news from Thursday's annual meeting.\nWhere previously Macquarie had said the 2016 profit would be slightly up on last year, the new message dropped the 'slightly' and declared earnings are expected to be 'up'.\nThis week as Macquarie's share price moved through $85 and analysts tip that its earnings to March 2016 could again hit $1.8 billion (or go even higher) today's question has got to be - can a leopard change its spots or is Macquarie Mark II a significantly different beast?\nDoes it now have more of the DNA of a traditional bank and less of the features of a more returns-volatile investment bank.\nThe answer to the first question is yes. The Macquarie of old has undergone a very significant transformation. While it's earnings are not bulletproof, the risk associated with its earnings have lessened considerably.\nOf course it still has a big contribution from its markets facing businesses that are exposed to lots of market factors that are outside the control of management. Back in 2007 these types of businesses including Macquarie Capital, Macquarie Securities and Commodities and Financial Markets make up about 32 per cent of group earnings. Back in 2007 these divisions accounted for 55 per cent of profit.\nThe more stable annuities operations of Macquarie Asset Management have been ascending in importance over the same period. In 2007 this division accounted for 12 per cent of profit where today it has risen to 35 per cent.\nRather than further test my memory on the details of a company's make-up eight years on, this task taking the before and after shots is better left in the hands of one of Australia's better known bank analysts, Brian Johnson, who having eaten humble pie on his 2007 call for Macquarie to go higher than $100, has plenty of reasons to be careful this time around.\nIn a recent and somewhat (well sort of) self deprecating note Johnson, who described that Macquarie call eight years ago as 'not the crowning glory of his career, goes through the comparison.\nJohnson's first point is that back in 2007 the Macquarie profit was stuffed with $664 million of Asset Realisation Gains and an unsustainably low tax rate (of 19.6 per cent) inflating that year's earnings by 29 per cent by way of comparison the 2015 result has impairment and tax remediation charges that reduced the earnings by 16 per cent.\nIn addition he thinks that today Macquarie has a more sustainable pipeline of future performance fees on maturing unlisted Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Estate funds that were established ten years ago. He also points to a larger contribution from less volatile earnings but also a stronger balance sheet with higher capital and liquidity settings.\nWhile Macquarie has got some tail winds - and arguably stronger ones than any of the big four Australian trading banks, the answer to the question posed earlier as to whether it had more of a traditional trading bank DNA? The answer is no. Macquarie still walks like looks like and quacks like an investment bank. And in the current climate maybe that's better.\nFortescue pulls the right levers Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Metals has done an outstanding job of pulling all the levels it has at its disposal to retain cash flow positive. Its ability to rapidly reduce its cash costs, by 14 per cent and at an even more accelerated pace than expected should have impressed the market.\nFortescue boosted shipments by in the fourth quarter by 5 per cent on the previous quarter and 10 per cent on the previous corresponding quarter.\nAfter throwing all cost elements into the mix Fortescue appears to have chipped all up costs down to US$39.\nThat is the big element that Forrest can't control - no matter how hard he tries to make the future of the iron ore price and what influences it part of the national conversation.\nFMG is a price taker and one that is squeezing the lemon as hard as possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:32:47.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
