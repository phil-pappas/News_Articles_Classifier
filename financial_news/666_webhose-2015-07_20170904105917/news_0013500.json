Will Martin, a spokesman for the California Guard. \nThe Guard has previously used the drone to support firefighting efforts in 2013 at Yosemite National Park. \n\"For the purpose of collecting imagery, it's unrivaled,\" Martin said of drone technology. \nThe search for Edward Kavanaugh, 45, has intensified in the 12 days since he went missing. Kavanaugh was last seen July 17 driving a motorcycle on a trail through El Dorado County, about three hours east of the San Francisco Bay Area. He was with another driver before cruising off on his own. \nKavanaugh is a popular veteran teacher who works for San Francisco Unified School District. \nMartin said the drone has yet to provide any new leads in Kavanaugh's disappearance. \nOfficials have gathered more than 50 volunteers to help sweep El Dorado and neighboring counties by foot, car and helicopter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T05:19:40.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
