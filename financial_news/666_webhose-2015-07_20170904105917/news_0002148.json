The status quo has no requirement of independent monitoring, it is effectively left up to the companies themselves to report. For public confidence, it is important that it is independent.” \nHe said leaks could be dangerous “if the well integrity is breached and it gets into groundwater in substantial quantities… and people then drink it”. \n“You need to make sure you have belt and braces in place to make sure that can’t happen. That means monitoring the well integrity; making sure it has been properly constructed and it is constantly monitored to make the sure moment a breach is identified you stop. “ \nA spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said it already required independent inspections before fracking takes place. \nHe added: “The Health and Safety Executive has existing powers to carry out independent inspections whenever it has a reason to do so. It is in a company’s interest to have the best possible health and safety regime for their own operations.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T10:26:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
