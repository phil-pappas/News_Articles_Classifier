Shell discovered weeks ago that the Fennica icebreaker that holds the required equipment, called a capping stack, had a three foot (1 meter) gash in it. \n\"Without the required well control system in place, Shell will not be allowed to drill into oil-bearing zones,\" BSEE Director Brian Salemo said. \nShell last week sent the Fennica, which it is leasing, to Portland, Oregon, for repairs. Fixing the gash and sending it back could take weeks. \nThe company said then it did not expect to require the capping stack until August and that it could proceed with preliminary drilling. Shell did not immediately return a request for comment on Wednesday. \nEnvironmentalists have criticized Shell's drilling plans in the Arctic, which is home to sensitive populations of whales, walrus and polar bears.
