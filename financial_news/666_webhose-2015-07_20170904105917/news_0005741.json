If you don’t know, you’re not alone — almost half of surveyed couples couldn’t get the answer right — but that lack of knowledge may be a sign of deeper money problems in your relationship.\nOf the 43% of people who either didn’t know their spouse’s salary or gave the wrong figure, 10% got the amount wrong by $25,000 or more, according to a survey of 1,051 couples, a total of 2,102 people, all of whom were 25 years old or older and either married or in a long-term committed relationship and living together. The survey was conducted for Fidelity Investments by market-research firm GfK.\nAnd there are other signs that couples aren’t talking about money. One-third of couples disagreed on what they expect their retirement lifestyle to be like, and 36% gave different figures for the amount of their household’s investible assets.\nHere’s why those findings are worrisome: a lack of communication around money can portend deeper problems, said Kathleen Burns Kingsbury, a financial psychology consultant, author of “How to Give Financial Advice to Couples” and founder of KBK Wealth Connection in Waitsfield, Vt. (She wasn’t connected with the survey.)\nArguing about money is the top predictor of divorce, according to a 2013 study of 4,500 couples, which controlled for income, debt and net worth, by researchers at Kansas State University. Read about the study here .\nMoney conflicts “can be a symbol of something else wrong in the marriage,” Kingsbury said. “If couples learn to talk about money and to be honest with each other about it, it’s a really great way to build intimacy and trust in their relationship.”\nWhen a couple learns how to communicate around money, she said, “They can really enjoy it and it can free them up to understand why their partner spends so much on makeup, or why someone feels they have to darn their socks even though they’re a multimillionaire.”\nBetter communication — and the understanding that goes with it — can help the couple “not only be more financially successful, but it can also help them have a more successful marriage or couple-hood,” Kingsbury said. “The more you talk about money, the more you delve into it, it becomes so much less charged.”\n‘Breaking the money silence’ Despite the fact that 43% of people didn’t know their spouse’s salary, 72% of couples said they communicate “exceptionally or very well” about their money situation, according to the Fidelity survey.\nWhy do so many couples say they’re talking about money when the survey results suggest they’re not?\n“I think it relates to the uncomfortable feelings that a lot of people have about money,” Kingsbury said. “There’s that image of, if we’re a healthy couple we know the right answer is to communicate about money,” she said. “Some people have money shame. They don’t want to let anybody know ‘I don’t know what my husband makes’ or ‘I don’t know what my wife makes.’”\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://www.k-state.edu/media/newsreleases/jul13/predictingdivorce71113.html"], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T17:10:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
