Gillianne Tedder by Trevor Hoey Nickel producer Western Areas was by far the most volatile S&P/ASX 200 commodities stock last week with a sharp drop in the nickel price between Monday and Thursday to below $11,000 per tonne levels prompting a substantial sell-off.\nIt was unfortunate for the company given it had closed out the previous week with robust share price support after announcing it had retired a $125 million convertible bond leaving it debt free for the first time since 2004.\nThis should see Western Areas move to one of the highest dividend paying resource stocks over the coming years even if commodity prices remain in the vicinity of current levels.\nMorgan Stanley reviewed the company on Thursday of last week after its share price closed at $2.85, coinciding with the nickel price hitting a six-year low. The broker highlighted Western Areas even at current levels could achieve a 13 per cent net cash yield before dividends and non-operational capital expenditure.\nMorgan Stanley also underlined the group's record over the past three years in achieving return on invested capital of between 17 per cent and 20 per cent. The broker is forecasting earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to increase from $151 million to $200 million in 2015-16, representing earnings per share of 46Â¢.\nSince Western Areas share price increased fourfold from $3 to an all-time high of $12 between 2006 and 2008 it has rarely and only intermittently traded at sub $3 levels.\nWith the group looking more financially robust than has been the case in the past and production metrics weighing up better than many global peers it may be the stock for contrarian investors to target.\nWhile volatility within the Chinese economy will continue to rub off on Western Areas, any further share price deterioration could leave it open to an opportunistic takeover bid.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T11:01:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
