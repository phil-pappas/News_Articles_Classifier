AP by Lisa Murray Angus Grigg The past week has given a clear warning of the risks to China's 30-year economic miracle . Sharemarkets have collapsed then steadied. The iron ore price has dived. But for an insight into the width of problems now confronting China, travel deep in the country's interior to Jinhai Road.\nThis dusty street on the outskirts of Inner Mongolia's capital, Hohhot, is lined with more than 30 recently built or unfinished property developments. Our taxi driver tells us if we were to come here at night, there would be no lights on. \"No one is living here,\" she says. \"We have too many houses, who would want to buy any more.\"\nJust four years ago the narrative was very different. This isolated city on China's arid northern plains, famous for its dairy cows and coal mines, was the nerve-centre of the country's fastest growing provincial economy.\nEven here on China's frontier, the booming resources sector and property market saw growth average a stunning 17 per cent a year in the decade to 2011. But just like it was once the poster child for country's rapid development, the city now epitomises the rut in which China's economy has found itself.\nA man taking part in a local show at the Hohhot racetrack amid the towering evidence of the frontier city's building boom. Olivia Martin-McGuire While a rapid unravelling of the country's real estate sector now appears unlikely, as state-owned banks continue to rollover loans to developers, the Hohhot property market is faced with a long, slow grind out of trouble. This new reality is mirrored in numerous central and western cities across China and is one of the factors behind the so called \"flash crash\" in the iron ore price to below $US44 a tonne on Thursday – the price has since rallied back to $US49 a tonne.\nWhile the likes of Hohhot's property market were once a major source of demand for steel and therefore iron ore , that is no longer the case and is unlikely to be for many years to come. Property investment in the city was growing at an annual rate of 35 per cent in 2011. Now it's in reverse falling 8 per cent in the first quarter of this year.\nEqually, the Chinese property market is no longer the driver of growth it once was for the broader economy. In 2013 when the economy grew by 7.7 per cent the real estate sector contributed 1.8 percentage points to the overall growth number. Last year, as growth dipped to 7.4 per cent, that contribution had dropped to 1 percentage point.\nThis year property's contribution is sure to slide further as growth slows to 7 per cent and possibly below. The weak outlook should be confirmed on Wednesday when second quarter GDP numbers are released. For policymakers in Beijing the scenario was relatively manageable , until the government-inflated sharemarket boom came to a nasty halt this week. While the government engineered a face-saving rally on Thursday and Friday, after imposing emergence measures to boost stock purchases and limit selling, the sharemarket correction has further complicated the picture for the property market, iron ore and the broader economy.\n Attacks from two fronts It means Beijing is now fighting on two fronts – property and the sharemarket as it battles to avert a sharp structural slowdown in the economy. Kevin Yeoh, the managing director for Asia at J Capital Research in Hong Kong, has a unique perspective on the nexus between iron ore, the sharemarket and the real economy on show in Hohhot. He has previously managed a margin lending portfolio and has worked as fund manager investing across Chinese sharemarkets.\n\"The big difference between now and China's sharemarket crash in 2008 is margin lending,\" he says via phone. \"That is the really toxic aspect to this boom.\"\nYeoh's concern is that Chinese-listed companies have pledged their own stock as collateral for bank loans, which in many cases have been used to punt on the sharemarket or commodities. That means they are being hit with margin calls as their own stock prices and the broader market has declined. This is reason why some 1330 companies or half of all mainland-listed shares have been suspended from trading this week.\n\"The issue now is that they may need to sell quality collateral [assets] to cover their losses and repay the bank loans,\" he says. \"This is the daisy chain effect which can then reach into the real economy.\"\nBut it's not just listed companies borrowing money to buy shares. Yeoh believes trading companies, real estate developers and manufactures have also been borrowing money to buy shares in an effort to bolster sluggish returns in the core business. \"They may need to sell real estate or commodities to cover their loans,\" he says.\nYet the real estate development and and related industries which are the core of many of these same companies are now struggling. Activity or the lack of it at the Xinyuan Properties sales office on the edge of Hohhot tells the story. One worker has kicked off her grey high heels and is sleeping on the couch. Her colleague Li Na explains the property market has declined steadily since 2012. \"Last year, I could sell 40 apartments a month,\" says Li, who has a Liza Minnelli haircut and sparkly painted fingernails. \"Now I would be lucky to sell five or six.\"\nDown the road at the sales office for local developer Shengtang it's equally slow, despite the positive spin from the group's head of sales Tong Xiangli. Her company has completed 50 high-rise towers, as part of a development which is slated to eventually have a further 20 towers. She insists the units all sold well in pre-sales. But asked why no one appeared to be living in the area, she said more than half of the units sold were investment properties, places that people \"might use some day\".\nThat means there are no new developments under way in the city. \"Every spring there are four or five big new developments,\" she says. \"But this year there are none.\"\nSeven years of supply That's because Hohhot has one of the highest property inventories in China. There is 20 million square metres to be sold, according to Li Zongkun, vice- ﻿ president marketing at local conglomerate Elion Goldway. The problem for this city of 3 million people is that last year, sales were less than 2 million square metres.\nMr Li reckons it will take some \"seven years to digest this supply\".\n\"The government had little control on development and too many players came into the market and tried to develop properties,\" says Li. Still, he is optimistic. \"Now the government is taking measures to control new supply and the priority is to sell off the inventory. I think the market will stabilise this year.\"\nEven if it does, with such a big supply overhang, there is unlikely to be much construction in Hohhot. While the property markets in Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai are showing some signs of picking up, places like Hohhot have a long road ahead. These weak markets are feeding through into weak steel demand and helping to drive a plunge in the iron ore price.\n\"Apart from the financial crisis, real estate investment has never been this low,\" David Wong, chief economist at developer Shui On Land, said at a recent presentation in Shanghai. \"In 2008 there was an inventory of 100 million square metres now that has increased six times to 600 million square metres.\"\n\"We are in the middle of a major correction,\" he said. \"As long as the inventory remains high, it will be very difficult for developers to want to invest. That means any recovery in the property market is likely to be L-shaped rather than V-shaped, he insists. \"The T1 cities will rebound very quickly because of the continuing influx of labour and capital. But there is a wide disparity across China. Pockets of the economy are very close to recession.\"\nThe 'R' word That's a word rarely even contemplated in China over the past two decades and while there is no suggestion of an economy-wide recession the outlook for iron ore is challenging. Xu Xiangchun, the chief information officer at research group Mysteel, said the worst is not over for Australian iron ore producers due to weak demand from the property sector and government infrastructure projects.\n\"We haven't seen the bottom yet,\" he says. \"The iron ore price will see a continuous fall this year and next. We might see some rebounds in between but the general trend is down.\"\nXu points to weak demand from the property sector and government infrastructure projects as the main reason, but the sharemarket is looming as a possible third factor. Leverage is the issue. The 10 per cent fall in the iron ore price on Wednesday night to $US44 a tonne was partly attributed to traders dumping cargos in a frantic effort to raise cash to cover margin loans.\nWestpac strategist Robert Rennie said the link was too coincidental to be ruled out. \"I do think there is something of a connection between the collapse in the iron ore price and the sudden fall of Chinese equities,\" he says via phone from Sydney. \"I do think it could be related to traders running into trouble with their margin financing.\"\nOfficial figures show outstanding margin loans have fallen 30 per cent to 1.4 trillion yuan since mid-June, which suggests a rapid de-leveraging is taking place.\nBut this does not take into account unofficial or off-market loans. \"That is the real killer, as we don't know what the off-market leverage might be,\" says Yeoh from J Capital. Estimates suggest between 500 billion yuan ($108 billion) and 2 trillion yuan of additional margin lending has been extended through this so-called \"grey channel\". This will take longer to work through the system and partly explains the emergency actions taken by China's central government this week to stem falls on the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets. Much of the government's efforts have targeted margin finance.\nOn Wednesday the People's Bank of China, the central bank, said it would extend 260 billion yuan of funding to brokers providing margin lending. Then on Thursday the country's banking regulator said it would tolerate banks being more lenient on calling in margin loans. It also encouraged banks to roll over maturing margin loans and accept lower collateral. In a series of statements during the week government bodies indicated the sharemarket risks were controllable if they could prevent a further wave of selling triggered by margin loans gone bad.\nIf they are right then the overall effect of the sharemarket correction should be relatively small on the real economy. UBS figures show that equities only account for 20 per cent of the financial wealth held by Chinese households. This drops to around 12 per cent if property is included.\nBut the risks cannot be discounted entirely. \"The government may be concerned that large and widespread investment losses could lead to a notable negative wealth effect which could weaken consumption, as well as grievances against the authorities,\" said UBS China economist Wang Tao. This is what investors will be looking out for over the coming months, as the Chinese government scrambles to stop any contagion into the real economy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T12:06:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
