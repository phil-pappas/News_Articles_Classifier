Given this will not now proceed in the near term, I have decided to take a career break and become reacquainted with my family,” Mr Jones said. \n“I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Santander, for whose management I have the highest regard, and wish it every success for the future.” \nHe will leave the bank in October, to be replaced by finance director Antonio Roman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T22:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T22:47:36.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
