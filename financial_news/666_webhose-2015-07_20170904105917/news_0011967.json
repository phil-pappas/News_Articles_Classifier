In Canada, they now hold 37 per cent of management roles and 57 per cent of professional positions compared to 1941 when they made up only 20 per cent of the Canadian workforce.\n\"The progress women have made in recent years is undeniable,\" says Caroline Dabu, vice-president and head of BMO Wealth Planning Group. \"However, challenges still exist, especially for women trying to balance personal needs and professional goals with the demands of caring for loved ones. Women face struggles that have not only emotional consequences but also financial repercussions.\"\nThe report found that women own or share ownership in almost half of all small businesses in Canada. The recent 2015 federal budget contained tax and other measures for small businesses, including women entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs create high paying jobs by developing new goods and services and innovative business models.\nThe budget contained a program to increase mentorship among women entrepreneurs and connect them with the tools they need to succeed in business. The program encourages women-led companies to participate in trade missions to widen exposure to international markets and over the coming year the Minister of Status of Women will be consulting on how to increase the number of women entering into and succeeding in business.\nThe Business Development Bank of Canada also has earmarked $700 million over the next three years in financing for women-owned businesses. The funding will provide up to 400 additional loans to businesses which are majority-owned by women.\nBesides earning less than men and acting more as care givers women are more affected by rising health care costs than men because they tend to live longer and tend to be more proactive about their health than men.\nBMO offers some suggestions to help women achieve financial security.\nOne is to have a risk management plan. Ensure you have funds that are easily accessible and sufficient to deal with any crises that might arise. Living benefits, critical illness insurance, long-term disability and health insurance are important lines of defence against unforeseen health issues.\nTake advantage of tax-beneficial savings options such as the Tax Free Savings Account (TFSA) to help you reach your goals. Executives and business owners can invest in company-sponsored defined benefits and defined contribution pension plans and self-employed professionals can use Independent Pension Plans (IPPs) to save for their retirement.\nAnd plan for your legacy -- speak with your family and loved ones to ensure your financial assets are passed on and consider teaching your children about financial management and responsibility and introduce them to your financial planning professional when the time is right.\n\"Women often face financial challenges unique to their gender,\" says Dabu. \"For this reason it becomes all the more critical for them to work with a financial professional who understands their situation and develop a comprehensive wealth plan that addresses their specific situation and financial objectives, whether it be having a child, sending their kids to university or being able to sustain their lifestyle through retirement.\"\nTalbot Boggs is a Toronto-based business communications professional who has worked with national news organizations, magazines and corporations in the finance, retail, manufacturing and other industrial sectors.\nCopyright 2015 Talbot Boggs\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T17:28:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
