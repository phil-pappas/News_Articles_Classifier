Reuters by Lisa Murray Typically when a country announces an economic growth figure better than analysts are expecting, its stock market rallies.\nBut after China said on Wednesday second-quarter growth came in slightly higher than most forecasts, its main stock market shed 3 per cent.\nThere are a number of explanations. The first being investors don't believe the numbers.\nThis has some credence given the regular concerns raised about Chinese statistics. Even Premier Li Keqiang -- before he took up his current role -- said China's GDP data was \"man-made.\"\nAnother explanation is investors looked beyond the headline figure and were concerned about the slowdown in property investment, or the unsustainable boost to GDP from additional brokerage activity fuelled the market's ill-fated rally to mid-June.\nBut perhaps, the most plausible explanation is that China's stock market is not driven by what's going on in the real economy.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index hurtled toward a seven-year high on June 12 amid growing evidence of a slowdown. And so any good news, like a better-than-expected quarterly GDP number, is unlikely to impact trading activity.\nSince then, the market has been distorted by an unprecedented level of government intervention after its recent slump spooked policymakers into unleashing a series of emergency support measures.\n So what is going on in the economy?\nThe National Statistics Bureau surprised most analysts on Wednesday, when it reported growth of 7 per cent in the second quarter from a year ago. This was unchanged from the first quarter, matching the slowest pace since the first three months of 2009.\nBack then the global financial crisis pushed growth down to 6.1 per cent, a healthy rate compared to most developed countries but slow for China.\nThe latest growth rate was slightly higher than most analysts had been expecting, which may have been due to the extra brokerage activity or the small downward revision to the second-quarter figures in 2014.\nLooking underneath the headline figure, it is clear China's growth is slowing. Its property market, an important engine of growth, is struggling under the weight of millions of apartments still to be sold. That inventory needs to work its way through the system before new investment can ramp up again in the real estate sector.\nThe area of land purchased for real estate development in the second quarter – a key indicator of future construction and steel demand – fell by 33.8 per cent from the same quarter last year. Property investment growth, meanwhile, slowed to 4.6 per cent in the first half from a year ago and the stockpile of floor space to be sold increased by 20.8 per cent to 657.4 million square meters.\nThis is concerning for Australia's iron ore producers as residential property construction accounts for roughly one-fifth of Chinese iron ore demand.\nThe sluggish real estate sector is also having flow-on effects for other parts of the economy.\nHowever, it is important to keep China's slowdown in perspective. Unlike the wild swings of the stock market, the economy is moving to its \"new normal\" pace in a relatively orderly fashion. The property market is showing some signs of stabilisation and China is rebalancing its economy away from a reliance on big investment spending to one driven by consumption.\nRetail sales were up by a stronger-than-expected 10.6 per cent in June from a year ago. Online retail sales rose 39.1 per cent and consumption now contributes more than investment to growth. In the first half, it contributed 60 per cent to GDP, 5.7 percentage points higher than a year ago.\nThe focus after Wednesday's better-than-expected headline growth rate will probably be on whether the numbers can be trusted.\nBut the general trend is for a slowing economy and the key test for policymakers remains their commitment to the reform agenda. Will Beijing continue to open up the country's capital markets and encourage a bigger role for the private sector or will it use the recent volatility in equities trading to justify more government intervention?\nEither way, don't look for any reliable signs of China's economic health from the stock market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T12:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:59:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
