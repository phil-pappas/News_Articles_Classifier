The FTSE 100 ended the session up by 15.80 points at 6,753.75 while the FTSE 250 was still lower by 66.48 points to 17,567.33 by the end of trading, albeit well above its intraday lows of 17,562. \nMid-morning comments from BoE Governor Mark Carney led to a spike in the pound and in longer-term Gilt yields that took the shine off the second tier index, as the back up in market interest rates hit shares of housebuilders. \nTestifying to the Treasury Select Committee Dr.Carney said that, \"the point at which interest rates may begin to rise is moving closer given the performance of the economy.\" By the end of trading Gilts were trading nearly unchanged although they failed to rally alongside US Treasury notes. \nAnalysts differed somewhat in their reactions to the Governor's comments. \n\"We judge these comments as supporting our view that the Bank is likely to deliver the first rate hike earlier than the current market pricing of May 2016. Our forecast is for a February 2016 move,\" economists at BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) said in a research report e-mailed to clients. \nFor his part, Fabrice Montagne at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) had this to say: \"In particular, Carney's initial comments did not seem to be particularly bullish to us, hence our surprise about this morning's market reaction. Interest rate expectations not only erased losses due to the weak inflation number earlier this morning, but bounced beyond pre-session levels, bringing forward the date of the first full hike from mid-year to May 2016.\" Subdued core inflation in the UK The BoE chief's remarks hit the wires just after the latest CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) figures from ONS revealed that core inflation in the UK slipped a tad in June, to a 0.8% year-on-year pace after a reading of 0.9% in May - the joint lowest print since March 2001. \nNevertheless, \"this weakness continues to largely reflect cheaper goods imports. Inflation in the services sector, while below its average of 3.5% over the last decade, was a much stronger 2.2%,\" Samuel Tombs, Senior UK economist at Capital Economics pointed out. \nThe headline consumer price index was flat versus a year ago, after a rise of just 0.1% in May, as expected by economists. \n\"We believe it is most likely that consumer price inflation will hover around zero through the summer and then start heading gradually but decisively up from September. There is obviously the risk that there could be another very brief dip into deflation if oil prices extend their current softening,\" Dr.Howard Archer, chief UK+European economist at IHS Global Insight explained to clients. \nAll eyes on Athens Acting as a backdrop, all eyes were on the parliament in Athens and whether it approves the list of reforms asked of it by creditors. \nThat came amid an urgent need for fresh funds by Greece to meet a 20 July payment of â‚¬3.5bn falling due to the European Central Bank and to recapitalise the country's banks and restore the flow of credit in the economy. \n\"Capital (Other OTC: CGHC - news ) control implementation can be swift, but its full removal is a lengthy process,\" Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS - news ) told clients, adding that a normally functioning banking sector could be expected immediately. \nDefence sector finds a bid Shares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in defence and aerospace engineer Meggitt (Other OTC: MEGGF - news ) rose on Tuesday following a report in the Financial Times that a merger with Cobham (Other OTC: CBHMY - news ) might be on the cards. Atif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers, said he sees the rationale of a tie-up between the two as a defence play. \nAnalysts at Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) upgraded their rating for Sky (Other OTC: BSYBF - news ) from 'hold' to 'buy' and raised estimates for 2017 by 20% more than consensus. In a note to clients, Deutsche Bank said the FTSE 250 firm was the best positioned in Europe to capitalise on growth areas related to online video. \nShares in housebuilders such as Taylor Wimpey (Other OTC: TWODF - news ) , Barratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) and Persimmon were all knocked lower by Carney's remarks. \nAstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN - news ) 's Iressa drug, which is used in the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. \nIressa is approved in 91 countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive NSCLC, which is the most common type of lung cancer. \nMiner BHP Billiton reported that director Sir John Buchanan died on Monday, having served on the board from 2003 up until the time of his death. Buchanan, who was the senior independent director of Anglo-Australian giant, \"provided wise counsel to his fellow directors and to management, and made an invaluable contribution to BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) ,\" said chairman Jac Nasser. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,187.20 +0.24% FTSE 100 (NasdaqGS: Z - news ) 6,753.75 +0.23% FTSE 250 17,642.40 -0.38% FTSE 100 - Risers Sky (LSE: SKY.L - news ) (SKY) 1,122.00p +4.08% Meggitt (MGGT) 489.00p +3.93% Tesco (TSCO) 216.45p +1.86% Reed Elsevier (Other OTC: RUKEF - news ) (REL) 1,104.00p +1.75% Sainsbury (J) (SBRY) 267.70p +1.75% Morrison (Wm) Supermarkets (MRW) 180.60p +1.46% Ashtead Group (LSE: AHT.L - news ) (AHT) 1,069.00p +1.42% Direct Line Insurance Group (DLG) 350.30p +1.24% SSE (SSE) 1,626.00p +1.12% Royal Dutch Shell 'A' (RDSA) 1,838.00p +1.10% FTSE 100 - Fallers TUI AG Reg Shs (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) (TUI (Other OTC: TUIFF - news ) ) 1,066.00p -1.93% GKN (GKN) 318.50p -1.85% Johnson Matthey (Other OTC: JMPLY - news ) (JMAT) 2,995.00p -1.80% Weir Group (Other OTC: WEIGF - news ) (WEIR) 1,596.00p -1.66% Persimmon (PSN) 1,983.00p -1.54% Pearson (PSON) 1,231.00p -1.52% Taylor Wimpey (TW.) 189.00p -1.51% Aberdeen Asset Management (Other OTC: ABDNF - news ) (ADN) 403.20p -1.44% BHP Billiton (BLT) 1,236.00p -1.36% Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO.L - news ) (ANTO) 658.00p -1.35% FTSE 250 - Risers International Personal Finance (IPF) 381.00p +8.05% Evraz (EVR) 123.20p +4.76% Lonmin (LMI) 77.35p +4.53% Bank of Georgia Holdings (BGEO) 1,974.00p +4.11% Pace (PIC) 376.40p +2.39% Wood Group (John) (WG.) 620.00p +2.14% Greggs (GRG) 1,154.00p +2.12% Laird (LRD) 368.70p +2.10% Petrofac Ltd (Other OTC: POFCY - news ) .
