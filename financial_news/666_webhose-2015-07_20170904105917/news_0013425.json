(Nasdaq: REPH ), a revenue generating specialty pharmaceutical company developing multiple non-opioid therapeutics for the treatment of acute post operative pain, today announced that it has entered into a definitive purchase agreement with institutional investors to issue and sell an aggregate of 1,379,311 shares of common stock in a private placement resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $16 million. The purchase price for the common stock will be $11.60 per share. The private placement is expected to close on or about July 7, 2015 and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. \nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds of the financing to further fund the clinical development of Recro Pharma's lead candidates, IV/IM meloxicam and Dex-IN, in addition to general corporate purposes. \nThe securities to be issued and sold in the private placement have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. Recro has agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC covering the resale of the shares of common stock issued in the private placement. \nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state or jurisdiction. \nAbout Recro Pharma, Inc. \nRecro Pharma is a revenue generating specialty pharmaceutical company developing multiple non-opioid therapeutics for the treatment of acute post operative pain. Recro Pharma is currently developing IV/IM meloxicam, a proprietary, Phase III-ready, long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor, and Dex-IN, a proprietary intranasal formulation of dexmedetomidine currently being tested in Phase II, for the treatment of acute post operative pain. As Recro Pharma's product candidates are not in the opioid class of drugs, the Company believes its candidates would avoid many of the side effects associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, such as addiction, constipation and respiratory distress, while maintaining analgesic effect. \nRecro Pharma also owns and operates an 87,000 square foot, DEA-licensed facility that manufactures five commercial products and receives royalties associated with the sales of these products. \nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements \nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
