One of these factors is the “sleep at night factor” associated with investing in property, rather than other asset classes, which has made the market a safer bet for investors.\n“As our dollar continues on a downward trend, I anticipate increased interest from expat and offshore buyers,” Mr McGrath said.\n“[Problems] in Greece and the Eurozone have brought volatility back into the sharemarket, and I suspect this will continue to have a favourable impact on the demand for residential property.\n“Sydney … has proven to be one of the most resilient property markets in the world with long term fundamentals that underpin the market.”\n12 Wentworth Rd, Vaucluse is on the market for sale. McGrath’s network sold more than a $1 billion in real estate in Sydney’s eastern suburbs.

More than 3000 of these sales were above $1 million and just short of a 1000 were above $2 million.
