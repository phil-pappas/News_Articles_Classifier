That's what we are gearing up to,\" Chhina said on a panel at a conference in Calgary.\nThat was echoed by Ryan Kubik, chief executive of Canadian Oil Sands Ltd, who owns the largest share of the Syncrude project, which expects 2015 operating costs to be C$39.48 a barrel, down from C$45.69 at the start of the year.\nKubik said the company had modified shift schedules to reduce overtime costs, renegotiated contracts with suppliers, cut the number of contractors on site and restructured incentive and retention programmes to reduce wage rates.\nMEG Energy Corp is concentrating on growing production through brownfield expansions of its oil sands facilities, rather than building new \"greenfield\" projects.\n\"We have a number of greenfield endeavours that are on the books and are permitted, at this point in time we do not plan on moving ahead with those. We actually feel through brownfield expansion we can average 10,000-20,000 barrels per day per phase,\" said John Rogers, MEG's vice president of investor relations.\nThe potential for hefty cost reduction is not just limited to oil sands, said Corey Code, treasurer at conventional oil and natural gas producer Encana Corp, who was also speaking on the panel.\n\"It does provide a bit of a window of opportunity for you to attack cost structures, that was not necessarily there when oil was at $100,\" Code said.\n(Reporting by Nia Williams; Editing by Richard Chang )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T21:43:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
