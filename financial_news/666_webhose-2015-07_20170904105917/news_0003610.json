It did not identify the individuals or say if they still worked at the business. \nThe investigation will cover 2012 \"and relevant prior periods as a result of the identification of issues within the claims and accounting functions announced by RSA Insurance Group plc at the end of 2013,\" the FRC said in a statement. \nRSA has blamed a handful of executives at the Irish division for accounting irregularities that led to the group to overstating its profits in Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) and required it to tap shareholders for cash to plug the hole in its finances. \nThe British insurer was forced to inject 200 million pounds ($310 million) into its Irish unit. \nPhilip Smith, former chief executive of RSA's Irish business who resigned in late 2013, weeks after the insurer informed the market about the irregularities, last month won a 1.25 million euro ($1.4 million) compensation payment for a constructive dismissal case. \nRSA is appealing the award. \nThe FRC said it would cooperate with the Irish authorities as necessary, declining to elaborate. \n($1 = 0.6449 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T13:08:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
