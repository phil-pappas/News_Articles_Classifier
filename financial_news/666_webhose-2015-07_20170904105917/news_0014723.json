Starwood was little changed at $82.87 in New York trading.\nThe talks are tentative and Starwood may chose another partner or follow another strategy, the FT reported, citing two people familiar with the discussions.\n“Starwood doesn’t comment on market rumors or speculation,” said Carrie Bloom, a spokeswoman for the company. Zoe Bird, a spokeswoman for InterContinental, declined to comment.\nIn April, Starwood said it was exploring strategic and financial alternatives to increase shareholder value, fueling speculation it may bid for InterContinental.\nStarwood, which owns the Sheraton and W brands, has been moving to cut real estate holdings to focus on property management and franchising. It’s slimmed down after several disposals, including its Sheraton on the Park in Sydney sale to China’s Sunshine Insurance Group in November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T17:45:33.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
