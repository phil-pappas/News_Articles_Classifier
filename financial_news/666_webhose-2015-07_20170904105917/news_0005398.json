The trip was a fast-paced four-day tour of some of Colombia's largest cities including Bogota Medellin Barranquilla and Cartagena. \n\nThe day in Bogota included a meeting with PROCOLOMBIA's Juan Carlos Gonzalez Investment Promotion V.P *interviews at the Ministry of Finance with \n\nMauricio Cardenas Santamaria Minister of Finance and Public Credit **Milena Lopez Rocha Director General de Credito Publico y Tesoro Nacional Republica de Colombia and presentations from Invest in Bogota. \n\nFinance Minister Mauricio Cardenas was preparing to introduce his budget plan the following day that included austerity measures influenced by falling oil prices. \n\nWith Ministers waiting outside the door he shared insight on Colombia's present position and its future. \n\nIn an interview he told us *\"We run this economy with the main objective of making sure the business sector has an adequate environment to operate. Of all the indicators that we have had in the past few years the one that reflects that emphasis is the \"Doing Business Report\" where we now rank number one in Latin America. This means we run this economy with a deliberate effort to make sure the business sector has incentive and is encouraged to invest.\" \n\n\"How do we do that We are the opposite of fiscal populism we avoid large deficits large public debt. We want to keep an economy with moderate very fiscal deficit very responsible fiscal policies and very tight discipline.\" \n\n\"How do we do that We have a Fiscal R Rule that is a strait-jacket that forces us to have a low deficit and to reduce that deficit and to reduce that deficit year-after-year. We follow that rule very strictly. That means whenever it is necessary when there is a loss in revenues like we are having now with declining oil prices we have to cut the budget.\" \n\n\"But we think that sends the right signal to markets. It sends the signal of confidence and credibility in our micro-economic frame.\" \n\nMilena Lopez Rocha Director General de Credito Publico y Tesoro Nacional Republica de Colombia explains the Fiscal Rule (see video) and how the Government is dealing with decrease in revenue from falling oil prices. \n\nShe told us \"Fiscal Rule is legislation by which there is a limit to the fiscal deficit that the country can incur at any given point in time. It basically has three components. The first one is structural fiscal deficit which is around 2.2%. It is the fiscal deficit the country is allowed to have when the economy is operating at full capacity. There is an incremental margin that it can increase if economic growth is below its potential rate which is called the economic cycle. The third is the energy cycle which allows an increase in deficit in order to absorb the shock from oil prices.\" \n\n*Video: Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watchv=8dwsmChflkI \n\n[embedded content]\n**Video: Milena Lopez Rocha Director General de Credito Publico y Tesoro Nacional Republica de Colombia explains Fiscal Rule. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watchv=hYu2936MOyU \n\n[embedded content]\nPROCOLOMBIA's Juan Carlos Gonzalez Investment Promotion V.P shared insight into Colombia's Free Trade Zone incentives including the ability to sell to Colombia and export from Colombia with an attractive 15% corporate tax rate. \"There is no difference with Colombian companies or foreign companies operating out of Free Trade Zones to either sell to the local market or to export\" he said. \n\nHe also noted \"You can find a Free Trade Zone almost anywhere in the Country.\" \n\nHe explained what is key about Colombia is its ability to \"manage and solve problems.\" \n\nWhen asked if they look to other countries as models he told us \"We look at Chile as to what they did in the health sector and with pension funds. We also use Spain's handling of infrastructure and telecom as a good example.\" \n\nInvest in Bogota a public-private partnership between Bogota's Chamber of Commerce and the city's Government told us in a meeting that Bogota has the \"best business environment in Latin America.\" Bogota represents 16% of the population of Colombia and 24% of its GDP. Juan Carlos Jimenez and Carolina Hernandez gave us a compelling presentation of why companies should consider establishing a base and/or invest in Bogota. \n\nSome of its claims to fame; it has an urban/rural ecosystem that is working together the largest music festival in the world the most important consumer market in Colombia 1 students graduating annually friendly business environments and access to banks legal airlines and a metro population of over 10 Million people. \n\nThe city is also very pro-environment with a large allotment of parks and green spaces and a plan to roll-out green/electric taxis and cars. We were told \"The Mayor wants Bogota to become a hub for hybrid/electric manufacturing and assembly.\" \n\nThe city is also betting big on infrastructure saying \"infrastructure development will make the economy grow into the future.\" \n\nThe day in Bogota left us with an impression of entrepreneurial optimism blended with a very practical and responsible fiscal approach; a recipe for success. And speaking of recipes; Colombian food is fantastic. Lunch at Casa Vieja restaurant with suggestions from PROCOLOMBIA's Juan Pablo Gaviria was just perfection. \n\nPhoto: Mauricio Cardenas Santamaria Minister of Finance and Public Credit (right) and representative of PROCOLOMBIA Juan Pablo Gaviria \n\nPhoto: In front of President's home Bogota Colombia \n\nPhoto: Bogota Colombia \n\nPhoto: Bogota Colombia \n\nAbout PROCOLOMBIA: \n\nPROCOLOMBIA is the government promotion agency in charge of promoting trade investment tourism and country brand.
