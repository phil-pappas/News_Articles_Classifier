Angela Milne by Brian Toohey To the horror of many tax gurus, stamp duty on housing looks like surviving the latest round of reforms and harming labour mobility. But the biggest obstacle to someone moving from a low cost region to a new job in Sydney or Melbourne is the huge differentials in house prices. Scrapping stamp duty is unlikely to have much effect in these circumstances. Nor is it clear that sellers would have a big incentive to drop prices if stamp duty were abolished in a hot market like Sydney – the Domain Group's latest report shows median prices rose by 22.9 per cent in 12 months.\nYet is it widely claimed that stamp duty on homes is one the most economically inefficient taxes. The premiers have no reason to see it that way – not when it raises about $16 billion a year. Increased revenue from stamp duty let the NSW Coalition premier Mike Baird announce a surplus in his pre-election budget. Baird is not proposing to cut stamp duty as part of his call to increase the GST rate from 10 per cent to 15 per cent . He says limited scope to cut rising health costs means more revenue is needed after the Abbott government froze its \"real\" grants from 2017.\nStamp duty has the advantage of being simple to collect and hard to avoid. It is also much more fiscally efficient at raising net revenue than the GST, where a large chunk is returned as compensation. Suggestions that future compensation should follow the carbon tax model only harm the case for a higher GST. That model cost more than the carbon tax raised. Urged on by university economists, the Gillard government lifted the tax-free threshold to $18,200, then perversely recovered part of the hefty revenue cost by increasing the 15 per cent marginal rate to 19 per cent and the 30 per cent rate to 32.5 per cent.\nStamp duty suffers from being tied to volatile house sales, but the key objection is that it is economically inefficient. One reason is; the cost can prevent people from buying a home they like. But this applies to anything people might want that has a higher price due to recommended consumption taxes or excises. A potentially stronger criticism is that stamp duties might discourage people from moving to a job in a new town or city. Convincing empirical evidence about the size of this effect is not readily available.\nEven if sellers cut prices in a rising market, it is hard to see how the abolition of stamp duty would make much difference to job hunters when house price differentials are huge. Hobart's medium price of $326,000, for example, contrasts with over $1 million in Sydney. Conversely, the savings in moving from Sydney to a job in Adelaide where the medium home price is $479,000 would be so large that stamp duty would not be a major consideration.\nMany jobs are also filled by well-qualified people who don't change cities. Others willingly shift to a better paying job in a high priced city by renting out their existing house, then renting in the new location until they see how it goes.\nNo state premier will lift the rate of stamp duty, nor will they cut it by reducing exemptions. Better options, such as removing the concessional treatment of capital gains or expanding land tax, do not have much political or public appeal.\nWhat about calls for tax cuts if Baird's proposal goes ahead? The problem looming over the whole debate is that the federal deficit will get worse if growth slows, as the RBA appears to contemplate . Getting serious about tackling superannuation tax concessions could cut the deficit and fund initial cuts to income taxes. Better still, making all contributions voluntary would cut the deficit further and boost consumer spending and growth when the nation faces a savings glut.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:04:39.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
