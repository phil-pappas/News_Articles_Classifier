Therefore, it is important that credit agencies function in a standard way. To an extent, this was achieved when the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005 (Cicra), came. The legislation was enacted by the government of India to regulate the credit information companies (CICs). Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd was the first to come, followed by others—Equifax Credit Information Services Pvt. Ltd, Experian Credit Information Co. of India Pvt. Ltd and CRIF High Mark Credit Information Services Pvt. Ltd. The Act covers various aspects such as details on eligibility criterion to become a CIC, and the role and responsibilities of such companies. Data security and penalties for any such lapses have also been chalked out. But there are many important issues that it does not cover. Here’s a look at some of them. No power for borrowers: The Act lays down in detail who should run a CIC, the constitution, eligibility and the powers of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However there is not much for borrowers. Silent on state government entities, public sector units (PSUs) and public corporations: It has a definition of who a borrower is in section 2(b) stating “any person” or “client” including companies, individuals, partnership firms, Hindu Undivided Families but stays clear of state government entities, PSUs and public corporations. Should you be a guarantor? Similarly, section 2(c) of the Act provides that the client of the bank includes a guarantor, in addition to a person who seeks or has sought financial assistance including loans, advances and hire purchase. Hence it is important to learn that the role of a guarantor is crucial. If the borrower defaults, then you as the guarantor will suffer too as you will be in the “defaulter” basket. Duties yes, but no rights: Sadly, the Act doesn’t talk of rights of a borrower. Currently the borrower or for that matter a customer in the banking, financial services and insurance space has no rights once he signs on the dotted line. The forms are cumbersome and there are neither explanation given or asked. Horror stories of mis-selling, innocent (read ignorant) consumers being duped are galore. As an individual borrower, it becomes our duty to fight institutions such as banks, insurance companies or asset management companies. Arbitration: Section 18 of the Act provides that if any dispute arises among credit information companies, credit institutions, borrowers and clients on matters relating to business of credit information and for which no remedy has been provided under this Act, such disputes shall be settled by conciliation or arbitration as provided in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The arbitrator should be appointed by RBI and the matter has to be resolved by the arbitrator within three months. There have been numerous cases wherein credit card companies debited annual fees (without educating the customer about it) or insurance premiums without customers’ permission. There are also instances wherein “free” cards were sent to the customer and she never used it. Subsequently when banks started calling for fees, consumers were shocked. The recourse is to fight the bank at the banking ombudsman level or in consumer courts. As a retail credit card user, who wants to rectify past errors, the question of going to an arbitrator or RBI is robotics. She decides to pay up even if she is innocent. Cicra provides that banks will take due care to ensure the data relating to the credit information maintained by them is accurate and complete while providing it to credit bureaus. Though section 23 provides for fines for negligent reporting by banks, there is no reported instance of any such fines being levied. Most banks are responsible, however there are many who are actually not equipped to handle the data and need help. Way forward Cicra was a landmark Act at that time. A decade later, the dynamics have changed. The credit bureaus have many more members, the data is cleaner and more individuals are applying for credit reports. The use of the credit report is increasing. Given these developments, law makers need to revisit this Act. For example, banks are supposed to submit updated data once in 30 days to at least one credit bureau, however, when this doesn’t happen the borrower is at the mercy of old data even if she has rectified her issues. The new unified redressal agency is a positive change, provided it is autonomous and efficient. The days of “consumer protection” should move to “consumer rights”. The Act deals with the critical areas of accuracy and security of credit information thereby facilitating the provision of information to users or members of credit information companies and at the same time, provides for maintenance of privacy of the consumer. Section 20 of the Act enumerates privacy principles which shall be applicable on the credit information company, credit institution and the specified user. The principle has been made applicable for the purposes of processing, recording, preserving and protecting information or data. The significance of the privacy of the consumer or the borrower with regard to the credit information is gauged by the fact that a penalty of Rs. 1 crore has been specified in sub-section (2) of section 23 which may be imposed on the credit information company, credit institution or any specified user. The success of a credit information company depends on the credit market in a country or the penetration of credit in the market. Therefore, with large amount of money supply in the market by way of loans and advances by banks and financial institutions, it becomes imperative to have a system for tracking down the existing as well as prospective borrowers. Thus, the Act can be a facilitator in creating a strong credit culture in our country, thus improving the prospects of loan recovery and outstanding amounts from borrowers, be it individuals or corporations. This can be said to be a step in the right direction as it would lead to lesser non-performing assets and improve banks’ balance sheets.
