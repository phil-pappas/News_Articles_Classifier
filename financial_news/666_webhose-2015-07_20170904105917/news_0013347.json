Brendon Thorne by Tim Binsted Medibank Private has made good on a promise to use its market dominance to \"flex its muscle\" over hospital operators, by terminating its contract with private operator Calvary Health Care.\nThe nation's biggest private health insurer, which the federal government sold in a $5.7 billion float last November, said that after three months of talks with Calvary the hospital group would not agree to its \"quality and affordability criteria\".\nMedibank chief executive George Savvides said last September, in the lead up to the initial public offering, that privatisation would allow Medibank to take a harder line in contract negotiations . The show of strength by the market leader would form part of a strategies to control growth in the amount it pays to hospital operators for care, he said.\nSurge in outlays In the past decade Medibank's hospital benefits outlays have surged from $1.5 billion to $2.9 billion .\nOver the last five years the insurer's average hospital benefit outlay has risen 6.7 per cent, which has pushed up the cost of premiums for customers by an average of 5.9 per cent. Rising hospital costs threaten Medibank's profitability, while also turning away hip pocket-conscious customers, which informs its rare, although not unprecedented move, to cut off Calvary as a supplier.\nMedibank medical adviser Ian Boyd said the health insurer is \"disappointed\" by Calvary's stance. In a statement Medibank said Calvary had asked for an \"increase in the rates Medibank pays for services provided to its members to a rate which Medibank considers to be unsustainable.\" However, Dr Boyd also said the breakdown in talks is \"not just an arm wrestle on price.\"\n\"Medibank can't just keep passing on big premium increases because customers will vote with their feet. We do everything we can to improve affordability and experience in hospital,\" Dr Boyd told Fairfax Media. \"We want the best possible outcome for the member/patient and to make sure we don't pay for events in hospital that aren't warranted or are avoidable.\"\n Medibank is a big player, covering some 2.9 million members. But since the November float its share price has been under pressure.\nMargin pressure Rising numbers of policyholders abandoning their coverage and concern over margin pressure from hospital operators prompted Morgan Stanley analyst Daniel Toohey to cut his price target on Medibank to just $1.85 in May.\nInstitutions paid $2.15 a share in the float while mum and dad investors paid $2. The stock closed at $2.07 on Wednesday.\nMedibank also said Calvary was \"unable to agree to a range of quality criteria Medibank requires of its contracted hospital providers.\"\nA Calvary spokesperson said the group is \"surprised and dismayed at Medibank Private's action to initiate termination proceedings against it\".\n\"To our knowledge, we were of the strong view that both parties were continuing to negotiate in good faith with a desire by each side to renew our contract,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"Calvary remains committed to a mediation process… We ask Medibank Private to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible.\"\nCalvary operates 11 private hospitals across NSW, the ACT, South Australia and Tasmania.\nIn the past month 21,000 Medibank policyholders were treated in Calvary hospitals.\nMedibank and ahm policyholders (ahm is Medibank's discount offering) treated at Calvary hospitals will be covered under the terms of their existing contracts until August 31.\nAfter this time Medibank will still meet a \"significant portion\" of costs but those 21,000 customers may face out of pocket charges from Calvary, which will be able to charge its own rates.\n\"Some members will potentially suffer as a result and that is unfortunate,\" Dr Boyd said.\nMedibank has also pledged to honour contracts beyond the August 31 cutoff for pregnant policyholders and those with chronic conditions such as psychiatry, chemotherapy, dialysis or rehabilitation.\nPressure mounting Dr Boyd said given the rising hospital outlays paid by Medibank \"it is clear the maths just don't add up.\"\n\"Sustainability is important,\" he said. \"If affordability becomes of private health insurance becomes a big enough issue there will be more pressure on the public system.\"\nWith pressure mounting on Medibank's profits and share price, the heavyweight insurer is fighting back and refusing to keep jacking up premiums and risk losing customers.\nCustomers are already dumping policies they view as expensive and downgrading their cover as health care costs rise significantly faster than wages and broader inflation.\nMedibank said it wants to keep talking with Calvary and regulators to find a solution.\n\"We are very willing to keep working with Calvary… other hospital groups have signed up and agreed to get on board with our affordability and quality approach,\" Dr Boyd said.\nMedibank refused to comment on the details of the contract negotiations, citing commercial-in-confidence.\nHowever, a key sticking point appears to have arisen around what Medibank views as avoidable readmission and avoidable adverse events such as falls in hospital.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/national/fat-health-premiums-cast-cloud-over-medibank-20150531-ghciwh.html"], "published": "2015-07-01T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T05:44:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
