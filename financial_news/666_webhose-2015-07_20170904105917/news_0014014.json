Strong trading volumes in recent months triggered by heightened fears that Greece could leave the euro zone helped boost profits at Euronext. \nStrong trading volumes in recent months triggered by heightened fears that Greece could leave the euro zone helped boost profits at Euronext, the pan-European exchange operator told CNBC on Thursday. \nEuronext said third-party quarterly revenue for the second quarter rose about 12 percent, driven by strong performance in its cash trading business as trading volumes increased amid economic uncertainty. \nThe uncertainty arising from a possible Greek exit from the euro zone and a U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike likely this year fueled trading on the exchange, which is the largest exchange in continental Europe for trading. \n\"We've seen on the back of the Grexit discussion strong volumes on our exchanges and we have been benefiting from that volatility and uncertainty in the market,\" Jos Dijsselhof, Interim CEO and COO of Euronext, told CNBC's \" Squawk Box Europe. \" \n\"We've seen a positive impact from that but we are happy to see that (the crisis) ended in way that is controlled and managed within the euro zone.\" \nShares in Euronext, the operator of bourses in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, London and Lisbon, have almost doubled in value since their stock market listing last June. \nEuronext (Euronext Paris: ENX-FR) shares closed up over 4 percent on Thursday. \nAsked about the outlook for new listings in Europe, Dijsselhof said he was upbeat on the outlook. \n\"We expect our listing business to do better than last year in terms of new IPOs (initial public offerings), follow-on listings and capital raisings,\" he said.
