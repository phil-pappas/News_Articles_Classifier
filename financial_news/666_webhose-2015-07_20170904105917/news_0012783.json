Her latest, Maxi and the Magical Money Tree , is in bookstoresnow and is a children’s novel about a girl who discovers a money tree at home and deals with issues such as greed and how much happiness more money brings. “I always ask myself what does it mean to be rich,” Hall says.\nSMALL STEPS\nHall says both fitness and money are incremental and goal-driven. “You have to expect highs and lows,” she says. “You don’t wake up having accomplished zero and try to be a hero with a 10km run. You don’t want to binge exercise and you don’t want to take big risks with money either when starting out. Invest in good advice — it’s priceless.”\nConsumer finance specialist Lisa Montgomery says many people hate the B-word — budgeting — but there are other ways to ensure your money is not secretly slipping away.\nShe says taking control of money is not painful but many people find it hard to find the time. Winter — when you’re at home more — is a great time to start.\nAvoid huge and daunting financial goals, Montgomery warns. Instead, treat it like weight loss with small weekly or monthly targets.\nBiggest Loser trainer Tiffiny Hall says invest in good advice — it’s priceless.

Montgomery says you should be paying something around 4.5 per cent at the moment, and should also compare your other rates on credit cards and personal loans.\nBudgetWorx founder Nettina Baressi says anyone with a mortgage and cash sitting in a transaction account should use an offset facility for their home loan. “Speak to your bank — this can save you thousands of dollars in interest,” she says.\nYou don’t want to binge exercise and you don’t want to take big risks with money, says Hall.

You can choose how your super is invested, so does your mix of assets reflect your life stage?\nYounger people can opt for higher-growth, higher-risk investments in super because they have many years left before they can touch it. As retirement nears, it’s usually time to turn down the risk a little.\nBaressi says July is the perfect time to start using salary sacrifice, a great way to build superannuation wealth and save tax. “Speak to your employer to see what is available,” she says.\nDON’T OVER-COMMIT\n“Your resolution is just to visit your financial situation — not fix it,” says Montgomery. “Just knowing will actually save you money.”\nBaressi from BudgetWorx says good money management needs the right mindset. “Now really is a good time to reflect on the past year and where you may have gone wrong, and set some new goals for the future,” she says.\nWrite down your goals, so you have something to measure against, and revisit them every month of the new financial year to see how you are tracking.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/fitter-finances-will-pay-off-in-the-new-year/story-e6frfmcr-1227427273216?sv=efa9af01015f7d1bda60341cfdc5602d", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/fitter-finances-will-pay-off-in-the-new-year/story-e6frfmcr-1227427273216?sv=efa9af01015f7d1bda60341cfdc5602d&title=Don%26%238217%3Bt+be+the+Biggest+Financial+Loser", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/home-loans#itm_t=story&itm_l=tiffiny-hall", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Don%26%238217%3Bt+be+the+Biggest+Financial+Loser&c=THE+Biggest+Loser+trainer+Tiffiny+Hall+says+there+are+strong+parallels+between+fitness+and+finance+goals+%26%238212%3B+and+now+is+a+perfect+time+for+you+to+shape+up.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/fitter-finances-will-pay-off-in-the-new-year/story-e6frfmcr-1227427273216?sv=efa9af01015f7d1bda60341cfdc5602d", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/topic-stream/3870/tools#itm_t=story&itm_l=tiffiny-hall", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/fitter-finances-will-pay-off-in-the-new-year/story-e6frfmcr-1227427273216?sv=efa9af01015f7d1bda60341cfdc5602d&h=Don%26%238217%3Bt+be+the+Biggest+Financial+Loser", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/term-deposits#itm_t=story&itm_l=tiffiny-hall", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/fitter-finances-will-pay-off-in-the-new-year/story-e6frfmcr-1227427273216?sv=efa9af01015f7d1bda60341cfdc5602d", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/banking#itm_t=story&itm_l=tiffiny-hall", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/fitter-finances-will-pay-off-in-the-new-year/story-e6frfmcr-1227427273216?sv=efa9af01015f7d1bda60341cfdc5602d&title=Don%26%238217%3Bt+be+the+Biggest+Financial+Loser", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/savings#itm_t=story&itm_l=tiffiny-hall"], "published": "2015-07-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T01:20:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
