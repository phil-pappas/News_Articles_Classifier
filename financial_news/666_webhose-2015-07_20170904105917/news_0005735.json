Rob Homer by Primrose Riordan and Andrew Clark China has a $3 trillion stock market meltdown and Europe is struggling with the possible expulsion of the birthplace of democracy from its single currency zone.\nMeanwhile, in Australia the focus has been on whether a cabinet minister can appear on a television program, or not.\nAn 11th hour offer to change the chain of command at Q&A has ended that standoff between the Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull. who promptly pulled out of his appearance on Monday's show. Mr Abbott will consider lifting the ban on frontbenchers appearing on Q&A if the program is moved from ABC's television department to it's news department, leaked documents revealed on Friday.\nMr Turnbull then pulled out of his appearance to comply with the ban and has instead signed up to be interviewed by Leigh Sales on 7.30 . The ABC board chairman James Spigelman proposed moving the program to news and current affairs as an option in a letter to Mr Abbott on Thursday, which he said would be considered by the board.\nMr Abbott responded saying he would lift the ban if the move is made.\n\"In discussion with the ABC the Communications Minister was given to expect that Q&A would be moved to news and current affairs - which would be appropriate given such a program.\n\"Frontbenchers look forward to resuming their participation once this move takes place,\" Mr Abbott said in the letter.\nThe meeting, however, is scheduled for August 6, leaving the ban in place for another four episodes.\n \"The chairman has indicated that the matter will be discussed, as was always the case, at the board meeting on August 6,\" an ABC spokesman said.\nIt is understood the ban will stay in place if the board decides not to change the division the program sits in, unless another \"meaningful\" proposal is made by the ABC to the Prime Minister.\nThe move brings to an end, or at least kicks down the road a bit, the ongoing tensions between Mr Abbott and Mr Turnbull.\nThe tensions rose on Tuesday night when Turnbull gave an address at the Sydney Institute saying IS, or Daesh, should not be equated with \"Hitler's Germany, Tojo's Japan or Stalin's Russia\".\n\"We should be careful not to say or do things which can be seen to add credibility to those delusions,\" Turnbull told his Sydney Institute audience.\nThat speech proverbially poured cold water on Abbott-style apocalyptic warnings. Last month the PM warned that IS fanatics were \"coming after us,\" pursuing \"every person and every government\".\nThen at the last minute, Mr Abbott vetoed the planned appearance of deputy National Party leader, Barnaby Joyce, on the previous edition of Q&A , a program Abbott equates with a \"lefty lynch mob\".\nFor the Turnbull camp, the issue at hand – the earlier appearance on Q&A by terrorist suspect and convicted criminal Zaky Mallah – has been dealt with by a brief inquiry by the Department of Communications and publication of broad terms of reference for an internal ABC probe. Indeed he was still one of the guests for Monday's Q&A broadcast up until Friday afternoon.\nQ&A , now running in its seventh year, often features politicians from the Liberal, National, Labor and Greens parties, and rates well for its 9.30pm Monday evening time slot.\nMr Turnbull has been the most frequently appearing Liberal Party frontbencher on Q&A , although, paradoxically, Mr Abbott was also a regular guest in its earlier years.\nThe internal Liberal Party tensions the issue has generated can be detected in the hostile reaction by Party members to ABC Q&A probe investigator Ray Martin's comments that it was \"so silly\" to ban colleagues from Q&A pending the review.\nThis followed Mr Abbott's comment that internal ABC reviews of programs following complaints often ended in a \"whitewash\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T11:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:09:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
