Analysts expect the preliminary estimate of UK second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) from the Office for National Statistics to show a 0.7% quarter-on-quarter increase following a 0.4% rise in the first three months of the year. \nOn an annual comparison, GDP is projected to have risen 2.6% after a 2.9% in the first quarter. \n\"The first estimate can be uncertain, given the lack of released sector-wise data and it is subject to revisions in future release,\" said UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) analysts. \n\"On our estimates, the economy should show stronger growth than it did in Q1 (UBSe Q2 0.7% q/q, 0.4%q/q). Growth of this order is sufficiently strong to keep in play policy tightening later this year. \nGiven the uncertainty in the data and the possibility for revision, we would not look on a published growth rate in the range 0.6 to 0.8% as being meaningfully different.\" In the earnings session, oil giant BP reports its second quarter interims. Investors will be looking to see how the company balances the drop in oil prices after reports it could putting projects on ice in order to cut costs. \nAutomotive and aerospace components supplier GKN (LSE: GKN.L - news ) also reports quarterly results with Numis expected a slight increase in pre-tax profit to £298m from £294m the previous year. \n\"The automotive markets of Europe, North America and China remain positive driving growth for the Driveline and Powder Met businesses. However, there are issues to note such as a shift back to SUVS in North America which is less positive for Driveline and increasing pressures in China,\" said analyst David Larkham. \nTuesday 28 July INTERIMS BP, Burford Capital (Other OTC: BRFRF - news ) , Circassia Pharmaceuticals, Domino's Pizza Group, Drax Group (LSE: DRX.L - news ) , Elementis (LSE: ELM.L - news ) , GKN, Greencoat UK Wind (LSE: UKW.L - news ) , Hutchison China Meditech Ltd (LSE: HCM.L - news ) , Informa (Other OTC: IFJPY - news ) , ITV (LSE: ITV.L - news ) , Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group, Man Group (LSE: EMG.L - news ) , Orange Polska S.A.
