Peter Braig by John Kehoe President Barack Obama's top trade negotiator has signalled the United States is reluctant to allow Australian cane growers to sell more of their sugar in the US, saying the administration will not undermine American farmers during the final stages of negotiations for a proposed Pacific Rim free-trade pact.\nThe warning from US Trade Representative Mike Froman is a potential blow to broader agricultural trade liberalisation under the Trans-Pacific Partnership involving 12 countries.\nQueensland sugar growers are still smarting after being shafted in the 2004 US-Australia free trade agreement signed by then prime minister John Howard and president George W Bush.\nPressed in Washington about granting a better deal for Australian sugar, Mr Froman said the US was \"talking to all parties\".\n\"This is obviously an area of great sensitivity to our market here and whatever we do in that area won't undermine the sugar program,\" Mr Froman said.\nHe confirmed the US was seeking to strengthen intellectual property protections for American inventors, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector.\nTrade and Investment Minister Andrew Robb has made market access for Australian farmers, including into the US, Canada, Japan and Mexico, a key bargaining point in the TPP.\nBut politically connected US sugar growers are lobbying furiously against facing more competition from foreign growers.\n The TPP is a proposed major trade and investment accord, covering more than 40 per cent of the world's economy. It aims to set sweeping new rules for trade and investment in relations to tariffs, quotas, intellectual property, labour, the environment and state-owned enterprises.\nMr Obama overcame raucous opposition from unions and his own leftist Democratic party in June to secure authority from the US Congress to conclude the TPP details with the 11 other Pacific Rim countries.\nMr Froman said the US and Japan – the pact's two major participants – still had differences to overcome on market access for farmers and car markers.\n\"Canada market access in the agriculture area remains a very important outstanding issue,\" he said.\nTrade sources close to the talks say Canada has been holding out on opening up its agricultural market to foreign competition, especially the highly protected dairy sector that Australia, New Zealand and the US want to sell more produce into.\nAustralian cane growers can sell a relatively paltry 87,000 tonnes of sugar in the US. American producers are guaranteed of supplying at least 85 per cent of domestic sugar demand under the government's sugar program.\nPolitically influential growers, including in the key swing state of Florida, hold enormous lobbying sway over US politicians , who are preparing for elections in November 2016.\nMr Robb said negotiations on sugar have been \"tough and are still on the table for resolution\".\n\"I'll continue to push hard in the coming weeks for new levels of meaningful access for the Australian sugar industry, not only with the United States but with other partners as well,\" Mr Robb said.\nThe US had a domestic sugar production shortfall of about 400,000 tonnes last year, allowing for existing imports from other countries.\nLast month, Australian trade negotiators were pushing to be permitted to fill around half, or 200,000 tonnes, of the sugar deficit. But the US has been resisting that moderate demand .\nThe Australian Canegrowers group said Mexican growers could not meet the projected increase in US sugar import demand, so sugar should be fully included in the TPP.\n\"There is no reason why unsubsidised Australian sugar should have lesser access to the US than Mexican sugar, which has been found to be subsidised and dumped into the US,\" Canegrowers economics head Warren Males said.\nThe US recently slapped an anti-dumping import ban on Mexican sugar.\nMeanwhile, leaked draft chapters of the TPP text imply the US will win extra international IP rights for their drug producers.\nResponding to criticisms that the US was lobbying on behalf of \"big pharma\" to push up the price of medicine and block affordable access to the poor, Mr Froman said \"we want to incentivise the development of life-saving treatments\", but \"ensure there is access to affordable medicines in developing countries\".\nTrade ministers are hoping to finalise the TPP in the second half of this year, but must still overcome differences on the most politically sensitive areas, such as agriculture and intellectual property.\n\"We're in the final stages of negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\" Mr Froman said.\n\"We're down to a reasonable number of outstanding issues, but by definition those issues tend to be the most difficult, whether it's about market access or rules about intellectual property.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T01:02:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
