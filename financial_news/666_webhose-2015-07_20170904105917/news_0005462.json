Advertising Print This Post Photo: Bloomberg \nBank of America Merrill Lynch’s (BAML) has reinforced its foreign exchange (FX) technology team with the addition of Neil Boston, according to an FXweek report. \nMr. Boston is joining BAML from Citi, having worked in a number of senior level roles over the past seven years. This includes positions as its Head of FX Technology, Director and Chief Technical Architect of its Options Technology team, as well as its Managing Director, among other roles dating back to 2008. \nHe will draw upon his past experience to help oversee his new role in BAML’s FX technology team – his appointment is effective immediately. \nBAML has made a number of recent moves this year, notwithstanding a number of personnel shakeups across its FX operations. Recently, the group parted ways with Beat Nussbaumer, ending a two-month stint as its London-based Managing Director of FX . The move was particularly abrupt given his hiring by the company as recently as March 30, 2015. \nAdditionally, BAML witnessed the ascension of Dean Tonkin to the role of Head of Futures, and FX Prime Brokerage earlier this year. He originally joined BAML back in the middle of 2012, where he worked as its managing director up until his recent promotion. Got a news tip?
