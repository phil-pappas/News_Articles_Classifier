The Italian company, Hacking Team, sells surveillance tools to government agencies and various law enforcement programs. Hacking Team programs are similar to malware used by cyber criminals. \nHacking Team’s premiere spy product is RCS, Remote Control Service, also known as “Galileo .” Once invading a target computer, Galileo is able to siphon data and listen in on communications including Skype, emails, instant messages, and can even switch on a target’s web camera and microphone. Hacking Team says its tools enable investigators to obtain information even if targets encrypt their communications to protect them. \nPart of the fury has focused on the fact that Hacking Team has always emphasized that it w ould never sell its tools to repressive regimes and countries directly or through independent agents. This statement was clearly stated in its 2014 customer policy which said that “doesn’t sell to countries if there are ‘credible concerns’ that its products will be used to facilitate human rights violations.” Marco Valleri, Hacking Team co-founder said in an interview, “Europe and the U.S. both have blacklists of countries that are not so friendly. We are allowed to sell only to friendly countries.” \nThe hacked invoices indicate otherwise. As early as 2014, a report by the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto indicated that Hacking Team’s products were used in Ethiopia, Sudan, Oman, Egypt and elsewhere. Additionally, they found that the company’s software was detected in attempts to hack Ethiopian journalists in the U.S., in an attack on a Moroccan media outlet, and against a human rights activist from the United Arab Emirates. The documents leaked July 6 include invoices and ledgers that appear to record sales to Russia, Azerbaijan, Ethiopia, Singapore, Oman, Uzbekistan, Bahrain, Nigeria, Honduras, Kazakhstan, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, among others. . \nThere were two 2012 invoices to Sudan’s National Intelligence and Security Services, and communications from the U.N. panel overseeing sanctions.The U.N. representatives said that such software may be considered military equipment and thus prohibited. However Hacking Team took a different position. \nMr. Rabe said that in the past Hacking Team “took the position that our software is not equivalent to fighter planes, rockets, or bombs.” Since January, he said, the company has been regulated by new international protocols for technology that can have both civil and military uses. \nJay Foley of ID Theft Info Source was irate upon reading that the company’s lax attitude about the impact of its product. “Wars are being fought today using cyber technology and have been for a number of years. Malware has the ability to bring a country to its knees, to cripple or destroy the info-structure of any country, government agency, or industry. Imagine banks, electricity or water systems, and even Wall Street going black and unable to provide services. Cyber technology has the potential to be a ‘cyber nuclear bomb’ and anyone in the industry that doesn’t understand that should be ousted immediately.” \nIn total 36 countries were identified as buying Hacking Team products including Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland and Spain. Other entries are Australia, the US, Russia, Switzerland, Mexico and Panama. In Luxembourg , the tax authority was implicated, which strangely does not have the legal right to buy surveillance software or carry out surveillance activities. The Luxembourg government has yet to comment. \nSeveral government agencies in the U.S. have subscribed to Hacking Team. Hacked emails show that various tools are being used to fight the drug war in Columbia and perhaps in Bogota. The FBI has used various cyber tools to fight cyber crime for years including part of Hacking Team products. Various law enforcement agencies have worked together to arrest hacking groups and those that use malware for credit/debit card theft. It is imperative that agents have the ability to break into hacker groups to monitor activity and to look into the deep web for indications of criminal intent. \nThis recent hacking has provided an opening for a forum to make sure cyber technology such as the type Hacking Team sells is used responsibility and that there specific procedures and regulations including approvals for use. “We think they get court orders, and we have even seen a few, but the applications don’t really describe how the software works, or how they will get it onto the target’s device,” Christopher Soghoian, Principal Technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union , told WIRED in an encrypted chat. \n“Congress has never explicitly granted law enforcement agencies the power to hack. And there have never been any congressional hearings on the topic,” Soghoian continued. “We need to have a national debate about whether we want law enforcement agencies to be able to hack into the computers of targets. This is too dangerous a tool for them to start using by themselves.” Suggested Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T04:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T10:28:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
