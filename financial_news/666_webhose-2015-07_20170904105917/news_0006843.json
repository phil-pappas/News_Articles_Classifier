The July figures showed activity was at its weakest point in 15 months. This threw further doubt over Australia's export commodity prices. But falling commodity prices, a strong greenback and China's slowdown more broadly have been putting pressure on the local currency for some time. IS IT A GOOD THING? The Reserve Bank wants the Aussie to drop even further to kickstart the economy. The RBA cut the cash rate to a historic low of two per cent in May and has left it there ever since in a bid to get it down. But so far the dollar has been stubbornly resistant. OR A BAD THING? On the other hand, a weaker Aussie dollar makes imported goods and services more expensive, so consumers will have to save longer to afford overseas holidays, smartphones and designer handbags. The rising costs of imports will also add to inflation, which will make the RBA more reluctant to cut rates and more willing to raise them. WHAT'S NEXT? Analyst expect further drops in the coming months as the strong US dollar trend weighs on the Aussie, with some tipping it to go as low as 70 US cents later this year. A widely anticipated US Federal Reserve rate hike would further reduce the appeal of the Aussie compared to the greenback.
