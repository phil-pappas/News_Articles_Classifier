Fiona Morris Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Mercedes Ruehl Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation (CIC) has won Investa Property Group's portfolio of nine office towers with a knockout bid of more than $2.45 billion, making it the biggest direct real estate transaction in Australia's history.\nAs foreshadowed by The Australian Financial Review , CIC's acquisition will show an extremely sharp initial yield of 5 per cent, which could trigger a re-rating of the office sector.\nAn agreement was struck early Monday evening. The deal marks the finish of one part of the long-running sale of the $9 billion Investa Property Group. Handled by UBS and Morgan Stanley, it is the biggest sell-side property transaction globally so far in 2015.\nMorgan Stanley Real Estate Investing said Investa Office will retain the management of the portfolio, known as the Investa Property Trust, a move predicted by this newspaper last week.\n\"As part of its acquisition of IPT, CIC International will enter into an investment management agreement with Investa Office (\"IOMH\"), thereby ensuring continuity of management services for the portfolio,\" it said in a statement.\nFor many bidders the office portfolio, which is more than 90 per cent exposed to Sydney and Melbourne, was the main game. The more than 30 per cent slide by the Australian dollar and the record low interest rate environment helped drive up the price but also made it more compelling for offshore investors transacting in US dollars.\nIn addition there were major office sales struck on yields well below 6 per cent over the past five months, including Blackstone's stake in 161 Castlereagh Street and Qatar Investment Authority's slice of Barangaroo.\nDocuments obtained by the Financial Review in March reveal the portfolio has a passing, fully let income of about $145 million. It includes stakes in premium buildings such as 120 Collins Street in Melbourne and 126 Phillip Street in Sydney. Fully let, the acquisition shows a 5.7 per cent cap rate. Foreign Investment Review Board approval is still needed.\n CIC narrowly fended off fierce competition from runners-up DEXUS Property Group and partner Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. One of the largest sovereign funds in the world, CIC was set up to manage the Chinese government's offshore investments and has about $US220 billion ($301 billion) in overseas assets. CIC has also invested with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing in the past. It is reportedly also one of the backers in the latest fund, MSREF VIII.\nStarted in February, the Investa sale has taken many twists . What is left up for grabs now is the management of the broader Investa group. The two final contenders, LaSalle Investment Management and Mirvac Group, are still locked in negotiations. An internalisation scenario with Investa also remains a possibility.\nMorgan Stanley Real Estate Investing \"continues to progress the sale process for Investa Office\" it said.\nUBS and Morgan Stanley declined to comment when contacted. CIC was contacted for comment.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/114522070827507984683/posts", "https://twitter.com/mjruehl"], "published": "2015-07-27T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:08:12.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
