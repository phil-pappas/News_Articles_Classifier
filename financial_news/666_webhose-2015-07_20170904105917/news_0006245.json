Reuters by John McDuling Facebook is now worth $US250 billion ($337 billion) after its shares hit a fresh record high overnight in the US.\nMark Zuckerberg's near ubiquitous social network is the fastest company to achieve this milestone .\nThe company went public barely three years ago, and as detailed in the Hollywood film Social Network, was founded in a Harvard dorm room in just 2004.\nThis is a stunning achievement.\nMarket value of Facebook v BHP v CBA Incredibly, the valuation means Facebook is now worth more than the two biggest companies listed on the Australian sharemarket, miner BHP Billiton and financial services behemoth Commonwealth Bank, combined.\nThe two Australian corporate giants are both worth about $139 billion, or $US104 billion, based on Monday's closing prices. That leaves enough room to throw in another giant Australian company such as Woolworths (worth $34 billion, or $US25 billion) and still have some change left over.\nThe rise of Facebook over the past three years tells you a lot about the global economy and markets over that period.\nThe world has changed dramatically since May 2012. Back then, the Australian dollar was hovering around parity with the greenback and the national economy was enjoying a once-in-a-century, China-driven resources boom.\n At the time of Facebook's IPO, which valued the company at around $US100 billion, BHP was valued north of $US160 billion (it would surpass $US200 billion later that year) while CBA was worth about $80 billion.\nFacebook's inexorable rise also reflects some important dynamics in tech, including the advent of the mobile web in both developed and emerging economies.\nAfter some early wobbles as a public company, Facebook has gone on to amass an enormous user base - almost 1 billion people around the planet log into the service every day. It now dominates the booming market for mobile advertising alongside Google.\nZuckerberg has pulled off some ambitious acquisitions, paying $US19 billion for WhatsApp, a messaging app used by millions but with only a handful employees, and a virtual-reality headset maker, Occulus Rift. Some might quibble with the lofty valuation being ascribed to Facebook (and a lot of public and privately held company tech companies) but it looks well placed to dominate the next phase of the internet.\nIt's staggering to think that one of the world's most important companies, one that can justifiably claim to have changed the world, was founded barely a decade ago.\nBy contrast, BHP's history stretches back more than 130 years, while Commonwealth Bank was founded more than a century ago in 1912.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/facebook-sets-speed-record-for-us250b-market-cap-20150713-gibjkm.html"], "published": "2015-07-14T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T05:13:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
