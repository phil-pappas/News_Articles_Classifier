As Europe waits for the outcome of the crucial vote, patience is wearing thin in Germany, the country's biggest creditor.\nPT1M37S 620 349 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings Germany and the rest of the euro region are bracing for more Greek political upheaval followed by tortuous negotiations, even if the country votes for more austerity in Sunday's referendum.\nThere's no quick fix to the crisis because European Union rules make talks on financial aid difficult to restart, according to an official in Chancellor Angela Merkel's government. Adding to the murky landscape are polls showing the outcome of the referendum on austerity was too close to call.\nFrom Berlin to Brussels, policy makers are studying scenarios that suggest the ballot is only another chapter in a prolonged saga rather than the endgame. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is campaigning for citizens to vote \"no,\" while the rest of the 19-nation bloc says a clear \"yes\" could get Greece back on the path to reform.\nMen walk by an anti-EU graffiti in Athens, Greece. The word painted in German over the European Union flag reads, \"No\". Photo: Reuters/Alkis Konstantinidis\n\"We desperately want to stay in the euro,\" said Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis. \"We are going to win on Sunday.\"\nIf they don't, Tsipras said he'll respect the people's will and fly to Brussels the day after to sign a deal. His 54-year-old finance chief said he'd rather cut off an arm than capitulate to an accord that fails to restructure Greece's debt.\nPoll numbers Said he'd rather chop an arm off than accept Europe's debt deal: Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis Photo: Virginia Mayo/AP\nA GPO poll cited by euro2day.gr said 47 per cent leaned toward a \"yes\" vote, an endorsement of austerity and the international bailout. The \"no\" camp, the government's position rejecting those terms, was 43 per cent. The margin of error in the survey of 1000 people was 3.1 percentage points.\n\"It is too tight to call,\" said Nikos Papastergiadis, director of the University of Melbourne's research unit in public cultures. \"There are people turning out in large numbers for the 'yes' and the 'no' sides.\"\nA \"yes\" vote vote could lead to the fall of the government, with Varoufakis saying Thursday he wouldn't remain finance minister, if the Greeks vote in favour of the creditors' plan. Tsipras has also indicated he might throw in the towel on a yes vote.\n\"The bizarre twists of events since the referendum was called has clearly caused the rest of the euro area to now seek regime change in Athens,\" said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at Peterson Institute in Washington.\nLost trust A changing of the guard in Athens to restore lost trust would probably speed up the process, according to several German officials and lawmakers. That alone won't be enough.\nTwo days after Greece missed a payment to the International Monetary Fund, the Washington-based global lender of last resort said the country needs at least another €36 billion ($53 billion) from the euro region over the next three years and easier terms to make the debt sustainable.\nThe IMF report is \"a confession of the failure of bailout,\" Greek government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis said in an e-mail.\nWhile communications haven't broken down, months of conflicting signals by Greece's government have left the German chancellery unsure of Tsipras's intentions, according to an official involved in policy making in Berlin.\nTsipras for his part remains defiant, saying in an interview with ANT1 TV that the country has been facing \"unprecedented blackmail\" by creditors for five months. While he was willing to sign a deal, any agreement would have to make the country's debt -- currently about 1.7 times the size of the economy -- sustainable, he said.\nWrong gamble If Tsipras called the plebiscite and walked away from aid talks with the aim of winning more concessions from Greece's creditors, he miscalculated, the German official said.\nThe question becomes whether Germany, as a founding member of the EU and the biggest contributor to Greece's bailout, is prepared to see Greece go. While Merkel is leaving the door open to talks after the referendum, she says Greece no longer poses a threat to Europe's future.\nSo far, the market reaction to the possibility of a Greek exit has been limited. European stocks declined Thursday for the third time in four days, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index falling 0.4 per cent.\n\"We would buy Greek government bonds,\" Danny Gabay and Yiannis Koutelidakis, of Fathom Consulting, wrote in a note to clients. \"Yields are too low for a Grexit, but too high if a comprehensive deal is done.\"\nGreek bonds rose Thursday, with the yield on the 10-year benchmark bond falling 25 basis points to 14.73 per cent.\nCalmly waiting \"We can calmly wait\" for any Greek aid request, Merkel said in a speech to parliament Wednesday. \"Overcoming Europe's sovereign debt crisis requires time and staying power.\"\nTime is a luxury Greece doesn't have. With the country under capital controls and depositors barred from withdrawing more than €60 ($87) a day from ATMs, liquidity reserves will probably only last until Monday, according to people familiar with the matter.\nScenes of the long lines of pensioners collecting reduced retirement benefits capture the sense of despair.\n\"The people who are struggling, standing in queues at banks & ATMs, know that we're fighting for a viable and dignified solution,\" Tsipras posted on Twitter.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T16:19:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
