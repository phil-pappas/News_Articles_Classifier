The company reported total revenue of $19.54 billion for 2014. \n\"Basically, they are focusing their government healthcare business away from less profitable initiatives that they were pursuing. I see it as a positive,\" Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross said. \n\"From a long-term stand point, it (Medicaid) is a profitable business,\" Cross said. \nXerox, which has been shifting its focus to IT services from making printers and copiers, adjusted its earnings estimate for the quarter ended June to reflect the charge. \nThe company said it now expects earnings from continuing operations of 9-11 cents per share, below its prior guidance of 17-19 cents per share. \nShares of Xerox, which is expected to report second-quarter results on July 24, were up 1.6 percent at $10.79 in afternoon trading. \n(Reporting By Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Maju Samuel)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T14:02:31.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
