David McCowen by Fleur Anderson The earliest tax returns from small business owners will be scrutinised by the Australian Taxation Office and Treasury to gauge the success and cost of the Abbott government's small businesss tax cuts, as well as ensuring the entrepreneurial spirit does not extend to rorting.\nSmall business minister Bruce Billson said while anecdotal evidence was encouraging since the introduction of the $20,000 instant asset write-off on May 12, the government would be looking for hard evidence on which to base future budget decision.\n\"We've seen in businesses that service and supply other small businesses that they have seen a strong uptick in activity,\" Mr Billson told AFR Weekend .\n\"We won't see the tangible numbers until people start lodging their tax returns and we can see what the actual change in behaviour will be.\"\n\"That is what we are closely looking at.\"\nThe instant asset write-off, which allows profitable businesses to immediately deduct the cost of asset purchases from their taxable income, will only be available until 30 June 2017 and is expected to cost taxpayers $1.75 billion over its lifetime.\nBut some economists and tax experts have queried the cost and predicted demand could be more expensive than the government predicts.\nThe Commonwealth Bank last week released its business intentions survey for May that suggested the two weeks in which the tax break was available contributed to the a 0.8 per cent increase in economy-wide spending â€“ the strongest gain in 15 months.\n Spending on business services rose by 1.9 per cent in trend terms in May, which was the biggest monthly lift in three years and could reflect stimulus measures contained in the May federal budget.\nThe next survey will be released in mid-July and will show the first full month that businesses could access the tax break. Government and Treasury is expected to closely monitor the CBA survey because it is based on real-time data from merchants EFTPOS machines and can track business, as well as consumer, spending in a more timely manner than the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nMeanwhile accountants have been put on alert to discourage small business clients from making creative use of the instant asset write-off after strong warnings from the Australian Taxation Office that it will tolerate no rorting on the tax break.\nThe latest tax myth circulating in the small business community is that business owners are able to dodge tax by selling their cars used for personal use to their businesses for less than $20,000 and then use the \"purchase\" to reduce their business's taxable income without having to actually fork out any cash for a real asset purchase.\nHowever, the Institute of Certified Bookkeepers told its members that transactions like this will not fool the tax office.\n\"Government and ATO have restated loudly that rorts will not be allowed. Selling your asset back to yourself or between your entities will not be allowed,\" the Institute said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:55:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
