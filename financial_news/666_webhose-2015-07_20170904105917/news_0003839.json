New research from The Entrepreneurs Network and law firm Bircham Dyson Bell showed that around half of MPs haven't heard of many of the policies that have been introduced to help drive small business growth. Of the 100 politicians from the House of Commons polled, 55pc had never heard of Catapult Centres, the organisations set up by Innovate UK, the Government's innovation arm, to promote research and development; 48pc had never heard of Innovate UK itself. Some 58pc admitted they had not heard of the Angel CoFund, the Government's £100m seed investment arm, while the 2013 Patent Box legislation, which helps entrepreneurs profit from their intellectual property, was a mystery to 53pc of MPs. Access to finance has been cited as one of the most pressing issues for a growing business, yet half of MPs have never heard of the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS), which was introduced back in 2012 to encourage investors to back early-stage and risky companies by offering tax breaks. The Business Growth Service, which provides tailored advice and support through the Government's Business is Great online portal, was slightly better known - just 38pc of MPs had never heard of it. How To Be An MP is the most borrowed book in Parliament The annual Parliamentary Snapshot research exposed the worrying lack of knowledge among MPs about the initiatives in place to help entrepreneurs, which casts significant doubt on their abilities to improve or extend such policies. \"There is a discrepancy between the strength of MPs' opinions about what would benefit entrepreneurship in the UK and their understanding of the current policies in place,\" the report pointed out. The majority of Conservative MPs polled (86pc) were in favour of lowering personal taxation and business taxation but 56pc either hadn't heard of SEIS, which offers investors tax relief on 50pc of their investments up to £100,000, or didn't know enough about it to decide whether it was effective. Some 55pc of these same Conservatives were against the Enterprise Investment Scheme, which governs tax relief on slightly larger investments (people can invest up to £1m in any tax year and receive 30pc tax relief). Labour MPs were similarly caught out by the poll: 63pc were in favour of spending more on Government grants and loans, and 61pc wanted more Government support services. However, 61pc had never heard of Innovate UK, which supports entrepreneurs by running competitions worth up to £536m in Government funding, or didn't know enough about the scheme to decide if it was effective. Some 76pc of Labour MPs and 41pc of Conservative MPs have never heard of Entrepreneurs Relief , which allows business owners to enjoy a 10pc tax rate on capital gains up to a lifetime limit of £10m when selling their company. \"I'm not at all surprised by this research,\" said Emma Jones, founder of entrepreneur network Enterprise Nation. \"This is one of the reasons we've called for a dedicated small business unit within the Department for Business. \"Is small business high enough on these MPs' priority list? Post-election, it seems not. The new small business minister [Anna Soubry] hasn’t even run a business before. If the MPs don’t know about these policies, then their constituents might not either.\" Ms Soubry declined to comment. The \"unknown\" entrepreneurial initiatives (top 10) Rank Initiative Never heard of it (%) Don't know if it's effective (%) Total (%) 1 Catapult Centres 55 16 71 2 Innovate UK 48 21 69 3 Angel CoFund 58 10 68 4 Patent Box 53 12 65 5 SEIS 49 14 63 6 Business Growth Service 38 19 57 7 Entrepreneurs' Relief 44 12 56 8 Annual Investment Allowance 33 21 54 9 Enterprise Investment Scheme 35 17 52 10 Tech City UK 36 16 52 “This year’s Parliamentary Snapshot identifies a particular blind spot on SEIS and EIS, two of the UK’s most successful policies for helping small, risk-taking companies to grow,\" said Simon Rogerson, chief executive of Octopus Investments, a founding supporter of The Entrepreneurs Network. \"Entrepreneurs need policies in place that really work, so clearly there is a need to help MPs understand how well these established initiatives perform for both investors and the businesses funded by them. \"High growth small businesses are extremely valuable to the UK in terms of job creation, wealth generation and economic growth. We must help MPs bridge the knowledge gap highlighted by this report, so that they support policies that will help secure the UK’s strong reputation for fostering entrepreneurship.”‬ MPs voted Business Rate Relief as the most popular entrepreneurial initiative, followed by Startup Loans, which allows start-ups to borrow up to £25,000 to fund early-stage growth.
