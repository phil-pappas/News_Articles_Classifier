Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby All eyes may be on the Art Gallery of NSW and its newly crowned Archibald king Nigel Milsom, but the National Gallery of Victoria is blitzing it when it comes to visitor numbers.\nThe NGV has pushed its annual numbers of visitor higher by 200,000 in each of the past three years by holding more exhibitions and offering a wider mix that targets children and non-traditional gallery-goers.\n\"It's a simple idea, but it's taken off,\" NGV director Tony Ellwood tells AFR Weekend . \"We're seeing young adults – the 20-year-olds who traditionally have been the hardest market to serve – thick on the ground.\"\nThe growth that ensured almost 2.3 million people visited the NGV in the year to June – 12 per cent up on the year before – means the gallery will stay open seven days a week from October, rather than the current six days.\nThough the art gallery, Australia's oldest, has continued its big Winter Masterpieces exhibitions, it has started offering less traditional experiences in the quieter summer months, combining contemporary art genres such as dance and live music.\nGovernment grants still make up most of its funds, but exhibitions, retail and public programs are the top revenue raisers for the institution founded in 1861. The number of children rose 20 per cent to 283,000, with 86,000 of those seeing the interactive exhibition Express Yourself! Romance Was Born for Kids .\nThis month the NGV opens its next Winter Masterpieces exhibition, showing 400 works from the personal collection of Catherine the Great. In December it has an Andy Warhol/Ai Weiwei summer exhibition.\nBack in Sydney, Milsom says his Archibald Prize-winning portrait of Charles Waterstreet, which beat 46 other entries, depicts the Sydney barrister as a giant. \"Part-man part-mythical creature, with hands that appear otherworldly,\" Milsom says.\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-07-17T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:03:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
