What did you think of the Budget? \nA.  Although my wife Alex and I went abroad on holiday last Tuesday, I didn’t escape the Budget. Almost before the Chancellor sat down, I was receiving emails about apprenticeships and the living wage. \nI expect management teams across the country will have produced plenty of spreadsheets to quantify the extra wage cost and will already have worked out what needs to be done. \nThey will be plotting to reduce the number of people on the payroll, cut part-time hours, increase prices and only recruit people under 25. Budgets usually create some unintended consequences this one will probably produce more than most. \nIn the mid-1970s, when inflation rose above 26pc, the Government set a maximum pay award of £6 a week, which quickly became the standard increase for everybody. With most shop workers earning below £13 a week, retailers faced a 50pc increase in their wage bill. Prices went up, staff levels were cut and most shops switched to self-service. \nThe training levy in the 1960s encouraged us to spend more money on training so we did. Whenever possible, training became part of every manager’s job title, every management meeting became a training conference and a good slice of our travel expenses went against the training budget. \nIt is probably too early to guess what unintended consequences will flow from the latest Budget, as we have yet to discover what devils are hiding in the detail. As we, at Timpson, are creating 500 apprenticeships each year, I shouldn’t be bothered about the new apprenticeship levy, but I am. The perfect training for cobblers and key- cutters never seems to see eye to eye with government guidelines. \nI fear that to be one of the winners we will have to put some unnecessary processes into our training schemes and draft in help from a training provider who knows nothing about us. \nI hope that this new apprenticeship scheme has precious little process and relies on common sense, but after a recent experience, I am not confident. We are still reeling from an extra £100,000 levied on the Timpson scheme (despite our company’s low gearing) by the Pension Protection Fund, which decided not to take levels of company debt into account when determining a company’s credit rating! \nOver the years, I’ve seen a lot of Budgets, been to Budget seminars and heard several tales of doom from those who feel hard-hit by the latest measures. But one thing has never changed the long-term winners will always be the companies with great colleagues who provide an excellent service to their customers. \nQ. Have you ever used psychometric profiling to work out whether a candidate is right for a job? Is that method more reliable than “gut feeling”? \nA. With a low turnover of senior colleagues and a firm policy of promoting people from within our company, most of my management recruitment has been done as a trustee for other organisations. I’m a wimp. Whenever a recruitment consultant suggests psychometric testing I agree. It covers my back if the successful candidate fails to be a success. But I wonder whether psychometric testing does any good. If the testing is so perceptive perhaps it would be better to leave the final decision to the psychologists, but some reports are sufficiently vague to leave you no wiser. Each candidate has enough pluses to support their appointment, but if your pick goes pear-shaped the consultant will find some pointers in the analysis that predicted the possibility of failure. \nIn reality, most recruitment panels search through the psychometric report to find evidence that backs their gut instinct. They will change their mind only if the psychologist says: “Anyone employing this person is taking an enormous risk…” which makes you wonder quite how the eccentric candidate is managing to succeed in his or her current job. Perhaps, before using psychometric testing, we should be analysed ourselves. I have little doubt that I would be declared so unemployable that even I wouldn’t give myself a job. At Timpson, almost all our recruitment is for apprentices, but whatever the level we always rely on our own method of assessment. First (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) , our interviewer fills in a form full of different characters Mr Dull, Mrs (LSE: MRS.L - news ) Quick, Miss Scruffy, Mr Helpful, Miss Happy and many more. Under every character is an empty box the task is to tick the boxes that best describe the candidate. \nIt works the form forces us to pick people for their personality. But, to make sure, every successful candidate spends at least one trial day working alongside some Timpson colleagues who give us a valuable second opinion. \nOur system, which is far cheaper than psychometric testing, has helped us to fill our shops full of people with personality. \nJohn Timpson is the chairman of key-cutting business Timpson, which supports the charity After Adoption", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T01:45:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
