Photo: Getty Images\nMasterCard is close to rolling out a security feature that is needed for Apple to launch its mobile payment system, Apple Pay, in Australia, according to the company's local boss.\nMasterCard's Australian country manager Andrew Cartwright said the final launch date of its \"tokenisation\" service depended on the banks, but he expected it would be released in the \"very near term\".\nTokenisation is a security feature that replaces credit card information with a randomly generated, single-use number for each transaction, protecting cards from fraud if the number is stolen or compromised.\nUS technology giant Apple uses the system for its mobile payment system Apple Pay, which was released in the US in October last year and in the UK last month.\nApple Pay is a mobile wallet that lets users make transactions in stores through an iPhone 6 or Apple Watch, similar to the way MasterCard or Visa cardholders can pay with Paywave and PayPass.\nThese tap-and-go payments already account for 60 to 70 per cent of all transactions in Australia, and Mr Cartwright said tokenisation would open the door for the rapid adoption of mobile wallets among Australian shoppers.\n\"Australia is the leading country globally in terms of contactless payments, so this market would be a very logical market for mobile phone payments,\" He said.\n\"Commonwealth Bank and Westpac have already launched the ability to pay on a Samsung device, so in terms of the future, cards will invariably go into the phone and tokenisation will bring added security.\"\nMr Cartwright predicted plastic cards would become far less common in Australia as shoppers \"invariably\" moved to mobile wallets.\nTokenisation will also be added to MasterCard's online payment system MasterPass, which was launched in Australia as a competitor to PayPal last year.\nCommonwealth Bank and Westpac both already offer \"cardless cash\" and let customers withdraw money from ATMs through their smartphone apps, but Mr Cartwright said he was not worried Mastercard could be cut out as a middleman between banks and their customers.\n\"With [MasterCard's] global authorisation networks, and then the inter-bank settlement of all of the money, there will still be a demand for that regardless of how the payment is transacted,\" he said.\n\"What we're actually seeing in Australia is consumers use less cash, and that means there is more electronic payments and that is a positive.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T14:33:22.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
