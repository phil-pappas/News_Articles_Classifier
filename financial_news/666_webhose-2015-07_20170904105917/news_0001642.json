Lisa Maree Williams by Jacob Greber Lucille Keen The great bulk of corporate Australia believes the Abbott government should get on with the job of speeding up budget repair, according to a survey that challenges some prominent business groups who argue the economy is too weak to weather the pain.\nCompared to a year ago, the proportion of chief financial officers who believe Canberra should narrow the deficit more quickly has jumped to almost 74 per cent from 54 per cent.\nWhile many CFOs have been buoyed by some of the Federal government's budget decisions, including the small business tax package and the resolution of the Coalition leadership doubts, many executives still have mixed feelings about the budget, said Deloitte partner Stephen Gustafsonto.\n\"The budget's focus on small to medium enterprises, while generally well-received in the electorate, could also explain the more tepid expectations among CFOs of the budget's impact on company growth at the top end of town,\" he said.\nWhen asked how the small business package would affect business investment, and therefore the economy as a whole, no respondents felt the effect would be negative, while 56 per cent said the positive impact on business investment would be very small, the quarterly Deloitte CFO survey shows.\nSource of uncertainty The findings suggest the decision to slow and delay the pace of budget repair in the May budget remains a source of uncertainty for businesses. It also throws into question whether the small business tax package will do enough to spur hiring among the big companies that dominate the economy.\nThe survey, to be published on Thursday, comes a day after the latest indicator of consumer sentiment collapsed following the turmoil in Europe and China.\n Westpac's monthly index of consumer sentiment fell 3.2 per cent from June to 92.2 , the 15th month out of the last 17 in which pessimists have outnumbered optimists.\nBill Evans, the bank's chief economist, said he expected the index to recover once European fears settle down.\n\"However, such volatility will not disguise the fact that underlying consumer confidence in Australia remains consistently low,\" Mr Evans said.\nIndex tracking on homes The index tracking whether now was the best time to buy a home has plunged 15.4 per cent to the lowest level in five years. NSW posted the biggest fall, down 19 per cent, to levels last seen in early 2008 when mortgage interest rates were peaking and the global financial crisis began to unfold.\n\"It is likely that this sentiment is being driven by affordability concerns and may be signalling a downturn in the Sydney property market,\" Mr Evans said.\nMr Evans said next month's Reserve Bank board meeting will be a \"live event\" for another potential rate cut. However, he said a reduction was very unlikely.\nIn contrast to consumers, business sentiment has improved in recent months.\nThe lowest dollar in six years and record-low interest rates are spurring confidence across Australia's C-suite, just as the spectre of crises in Europe and China send consumer confidence to a seven-month low.\nAlmost one in four chief financial officers surveyed by Deloitte are more optimistic than they were three months ago.\nDeloitte's quarterly CFO survey shows around a quarter are more optimistic than they were three months ago.\nSome 38 per cent expect their company's headcount to increase in the next 12 months, with 68 per cent expecting revenue to increase over that period.\nOrganic expansion Expansion and the pursuit of new products and markets remained at the top of the CFOs business strategy priority list, with 84 per cent expecting an increase in organic expansion over the next 12 months, up from 66 per cent in the previous quarter.\nPrevious negativity from federal government policy and leadership uncertainty has also turned around compared to the same time last year according to the Deloitte report, which was conducted in the last fortnight of June.\nStill, on the budget, only 22 per cent of those surveyed by Deloitte judged the rate of fiscal repair outlined for the next four years as \"appropriate\", compared to 54 per cent in the wake of the 2014 budget, large slabs of which floundered in the face of community and Senate opposition.\nThe findings appear to contrast the views of groups such as the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which have backed the government's plan to adopt a more moderate short-term pace of repair.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey in May delayed the return to surplus into early next decade, having a year earlier pledged to balance the budget by 2019-2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T00:07:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
