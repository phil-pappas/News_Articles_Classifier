But there’s plenty they can do to correct mistakes, especially because most of them have enough time — Gen Xers are those born between the ‘60s and the early ‘80s, and Gen Y folks and millennials, born between the early ‘80s and the early 2000s.\nSo we asked some financial-planning experts what mistakes people in these age groups are making, particularly in regard to their retirement planning, and what they can do about it.\n1. They don’t get professional help Andrew Sivertsen, a certified financial planner with The Planning Center in Moline, Ill., said biggest retirement mistake is not the fault of Gen X and Gen Y, but the fault of the financial planning/investment advice profession. “These demographics are greatly underserved, yet most major financial decisions happen before we’re 40,” he said.\nRetired adviser brews success (3:49) Here's how retired adviser Lyle LaMothe started his family's craft brewery, Broken Bow Brewery. The advisory consultant also explains the similarities between brewing and advising.\nSo what’s the problem with the profession? According to Sivertsen, the profession has built its compensation structures around commissions or assets-under-management (AUM) models that make it difficult to serve this demographic because of their lack of assets.\nConsider: many well-established advisers require that clients have $1 million in assets for which they would charge 1% to manage that money. But what do Gen X and Gen Y have in assets? Not that much. Americans under age 35 had on average a net worth of just $10,400, according to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances. So, no money, no advice.\nOne solution: Advisory firms could adopt retainer models or monthly subscription models that can make it more affordable for this demographic to find advice, said Sivertsen.\nGen X/Yers might also consider using robo advisers which tend to have lower initial investment minimums and lower fees. The trade-off is that you might not get the same sort of financial-planning advice that you might get from a human, but at least you’re getting investment advice. The other option would be to find a financial planner who charges by the hour. You can find such adviser in the database at the Garrett Financial Planning Network .\n2. They lack savings Sivertsen said the biggest looming threat to Gen Xers, however, is not access to affordable investment advice. Rather, it’s their lack of savings for retirement. And it’s a threat made even worse if you consider the possibility that Social Security might not be available in its current state for their retirement. Social Security benefits are expected to be payable in full on a timely basis until 2037, when the trust fund reserves are projected to become exhausted. And, at the point where the reserves are used up, continuing taxes are expected to be enough to pay just 76% of scheduled benefits.\nWhat to do? “Some of the possible solutions include increasing savings and possibly decreasing education savings for kids,” said Sivertsen. “They may need to have other conversations with their children about how to deal with the cost of education.”\nOthers agree. “The single most common mistake those groups make is failing to save at all,” said Jamie Cox, a managing partner with Harris Financial Group Richmond, Va.\nBut one of the more interesting mistakes, he said, is the tendency for these groups to prioritize saving for their kid’s college rather than their own retirement. “They fear insufficient means to fulfill a college dream for a child more than having a major lifestyle reduction in retirement,” Cox said. “There is no single financial gift a parent can give to a child that matters more than being financially sound in retirement.”\nGen Y, meanwhile, has a different threat. Sivertsen believes that most are already not planning for Social Security and saving more to compensate. Their bigger threat, he said, is not investing in themselves and their human capital. “Partly due to the recession, and partly due to wanderlust to see the world, many have been unemployed or underemployed,” he said. “By delaying settling down into higher income careers, many will have to save more later on to catch up.” Read Invest in yourself to maximize your return on (human) capital .\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://garrettplanningnetwork.com/"], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T15:29:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
