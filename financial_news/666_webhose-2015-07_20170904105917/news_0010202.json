Early in his career, he identified that nursing homes, small clinics and hospitals in tier 2 and 3 cities faced a distinct disadvantage in the market while procuring consumables and equipment for their business. They neither had the choice nor the price advantage enjoyed by the biggies. Thus Medicall was born. Medicall 2014 involved approximately 630 companies from across the globe who participated in the exhibition. Most of the exhibitors substantially increased the size of their stall and showcased more products during the 3 day exhibition. It was a true bazaar for hospital equipment and supplies, ranging from surgical gloves to the most sophisticated medical equipment used worldwide. In its 13th edition, Medicall has become a truly international show, with over 750 exhibitors from more than 20 countries and professional visitors exceeding 20,000. Medicall shows are held at Chennai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Colombo. Come August, the medical fraternity embarks on its annual pilgrimage to Chennai, the Mecca of the medical legion. A perfect getaway to meet one's peers, to compare and choose equipment and best of all to refresh the knowledge base in the intellectually stimulating BrainStorm Medicall. A favourite with many International product companies, Medicall has these come repeatedly to widen their dealer and distributor base. Diversity is a given in this expo. The show stoppers of Medicall are its seminars and workshops. Much care is put into this section to ensure they are not didactic and unidirectional but highly interactive and responsive.
