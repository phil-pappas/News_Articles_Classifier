Behind the scenes, however, the countdown to higher rates has continued and Janet Yellen’s testimony to Congress last week was a stark reminder that the easy money era is coming to an end . \nThe Fed chairman chooses her words carefully but there is little ambiguity in her message now. The cost of borrowing will shortly rise in America and the UK won’t be far behind, if Mark Carney’s more cautious, but directionally similar, comments are taken at face value. \nSo how will markets react when the Fed and Bank of England finally pull the trigger? The Taper Tantrum of May 2013, when Ben Bernanke stated the blindingly obvious that emergency stimulus could not carry on forever, points to volatility ahead. But history suggests that rising rates are not necessarily bad news for investors. \nGoing back 40 years or so, both the period leading up to the first rate hike in a tightening cycle and the immediate aftermath have typically been associated with decent returns. \nSince 1976, eight rate hikes have seen the S&P 500 rise by an average of 18pc in the year before the turn compared with less than 12pc for all one-year periods. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) in the year after the first rise, shares have outperformed the average, up nearly 15pc. \nThe conventional wisdom is that rising rates are bad for markets because they raise the cost of borrowing and subdue economic activity. But you also have to ask why interest rates are rising. If central banks are responding to a pick-up in activity, rather than belatedly trying to suppress an inflationary spiral, then the improving backdrop can encourage share prices to rise. \nYou also have to look at the broader picture. The US may be the world’s leading economy but it still only accounts for around a quarter of global output. If the rest of the world remains stuck in an easing phase (as Europe, Japan and China are) then the net effect can still be accommodating. \nSo there may be less to fear about rising rates than we think. And some sectors, in particular, have a track record of outperforming as yields push higher. Financials tend to be first out of the blocks. In part this is simply a reflection of a strengthening economy, which reduces non-performing loans. It is also a product of fatter profit margins as banks increase the spread between the rate they pay depositors and the rate they charge borrowers. \nOther sectors you might expect to do well after Yellen and Carney bite the bullet are consumer stocks. Companies that benefit from a healthier housing market as well as those selling discretionary items like cars, kitchens and meals out can pick up the baton from the more defensive staples like food, utilities and household products. Finally, industrial stocks selling to other companies automotive parts, building products and the like can be beneficiaries as activity grows. \nIf this is how you think things will pan out, then you will probably be taking profits in the safe, reliable stocks that have done so well during the recent grudging bull market. These high-yielding defensive companies, like Unilever (NYSE: UL - news ) and Diageo (LSE: DGE.L - news ) , have seen their shares rise as investors chased stocks that behave like bonds, ports in the storm with a decent income to boot. \nI’m not convinced this is how things will work out this time. The most dangerous words in investment are “it’s different this time” but it really is. \nRate rising cycles have rarely, if ever, started from a position of such high debts, which could keep a lid on the recovery for years. Rates normally start to rise when profits are low and just starting to bounce back, whereas the earnings recovery was achieved years ago in this cycle and profit margins are already high. Global (Shenzhen: 300465.SZ - news ) demand outside the US remains tepid at best. \nThe net result of all this is likely to be a very shallow trajectory for interest rates once lift-off is achieved. The next peak in interest rates will be a lot lower than the last one. Defensive, income-paying stocks have served investors well and I expect them to continue doing so for a good while yet. The clock is ticking but the alarm hasn’t rung. \nTom Stevenson is an investment director at Fidelity Worldwide Investment. The views expressed are his own.
