I do not want to offend them. And all these tourists, it is for Thailand!\" \nBangkok's ruling generals have been busy courting Beijing as they build new diplomatic allies after last year's coup was widely condemned by Western nations, including longtime friend the United States. \nLate last year the two Asian nations forged new agricultural ties, and Beijing was also granted a major railway contract to construct two new lines criss-crossing Thailand. \nWith the recent easing of visa rules between the kingdom and China, where the growing ranks of the middle-classes are increasingly holidaying abroad, even more Chinese tourists are expected to arrive in Thailand this year. \nUnsurprisingly, Thai authorities appear keen to downplay any incidents of strife. \n\"Chinese tourists do not create problems for us. They are nice tourists,\" said Srisuda Wanapinyosak, an executive director at the Tourism Authority of Thailand. \n\"But sometimes there might be cultural misunderstandings as we have different cultures,\" she admitted before running through the tips laid out for the Chinese in the new manuals. \nBack at the White Temple, Cai Zheng Hua and his wife from Fujian, a province in southeast China, are enjoying their long-awaited honeymoon. \nHe says that while some of his compatriots may \"not have enough education to know how to behave\", they are very much in a \"small minority\". \nFor most visitors Thailand is a \"dream\" and \"very fashionable\", said the holidaymaker, raving about the architecture at the site.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T08:51:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
