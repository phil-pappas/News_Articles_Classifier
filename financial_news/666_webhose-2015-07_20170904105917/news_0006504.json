I’m from South Wentworthville, what am I doing here? And I’m being paid for it!”\nBut for me, all the glossy glamour gigs are swathed in camaraderie with the crew and a TV version of courage under fire that will be the enduring highlight of 20 years at Channel 7. They underpin just about anything I’ve ever done with the network. We’ve shared some very funny moments together over the years during rolling coverage of big news events — the broadcast equivalent of Armageddon — while it seems on the telly at home that everything is going to plan.\nIt’s the crew that makes working in TV so special. Source: Supplied\nAudiences possibly have more insight now than ever before, that behind the person you see on camera is a huge team. Ben Roberts Smith VC summed it up best to me recently while we worked in Gallipoli on the ANZAC Centenary.\nBen remarked that “working in TV has been the closest thing to me to working in the army. It depends on a crack team. In the army, if our cooks don’t cook well, we don’t march well. If the armourers don’t do their job properly, we’re in real strife. It’s the same in TV, you need all the cogs in the wheel firing.”\nChris Bath with Ben Roberts Smith VC in Gallipoli. “You need all the cogs in the wheel firing”. Source: Supplied\nThere have been so many instances where I can recall that being a serious challenge. In East Timor in 1999, we were broadcasting outdoors live from Dili in 96 per cent humidity. No accommodation, so we stayed in shipping containers.\nNo electricity, just a generator.\nIt was a huge technical challenge for the crew, made bigger when the monsoonal heavens opened minutes before we went to air, but they pulled it off, all the while cracking gags about my interesting makeup skills and the carnage the weather wreaked on my hair and what the boss would say about it. (For the record, he wasn’t happy Jan but calmed down when I explained the choice was a blow dryer or a generator blow up.)\nThere were no tantrums and no grandstanding, just a lot of hard work and persistence by a bunch of dedicated professionals who take their jobs very seriously but not themselves.\nChris Bath reporting from East Timor in 1999.

Most of us had been conscious for the best part of two days.\nIt was another gig with high humidity, live broadcasts from tricky locations and our rooftop 6pm bulletin was to be the crowning glory of it all.\nBut with minutes to air, we had no lead story. Peering over the balcony, I watched an editor sprint, lead story tape in hand from the hotel next door where we’d been cutting, then wildly gesticulate to guards with no sense of urgency at a security checkpoint towards the five storeys next door still to conquer so we could get that tape to air in time.\nIn the corner of the rooftop, our OB technician was arguing somewhat robustly with the satellite provider, Sydney was in my ear saying “two minutes to air” and the debonair Englishman we’d just poached from Channel 9 to be our new senior foreign correspondent, was clearly rethinking his decision.\nI looked at him, with full confidence in the crew, and said: “Don’t worry mate. We’ll make it. We’re a bit like the cast of Seinfeld here. We’re a bunch of weirdos that somehow make a whole. And it works.” And it did. And we’ve spent hours laughing about it since.\nThrough all the panic reporting from Bali the crew remained calm and just got it done. Source: Supplied\nThe team hard at work in Bali. Source: Supplied\nWhen the Schapelle Corby verdict was handed down in 2005, like every other network, we covered it live. We had crews in Indonesia, a translator converting Bahasa from the court live to English for us, while I anchored from our Sydney studios. It was a complicated technical nightmare. And the worst happened. We lost contact with Indonesia.\nAs I was still talking live to camera, the announcement from the director in my earpiece went like this: “OK Bathie. We have a problem. Just keep talking.” 30 seconds later came the next announcement, and I wish I could capture the calm, ironic tone for you: “So luv. We have lost Bali audio. We have pics but no sound. Trying to get it back up. Don’t know when. Keep talking. Good luck.”\nTrapped by an open microphone in these instances on air, you cannot respond, except for a slight widening of the eyes or a subtle hairy eyebrow raise down the barrel of the camera. So you bunker down and trust the crew, those “cogs in the wheel” Ben talks about and get on with it. About half an hour and several wisecracks in my earpiece later about finding another rabbit to pull out of my hat, and just about when every permutation of the Corby story was exhausted, the earpiece lit up with “Ditch the rabbits Bathie. All systems go. Houston we have no problem. Blast off ...” And thus our Indonesian audio returned.\nIn 20 years at Seven, on so many different programs, there have been many moments like this. I reckon it’s built on trust. Trust in every crew member’s professionalism, and their trust in yours. For instance, when throwing your mouth into reverse:\nDirector in earpiece: “Live pics from the chopper coming in now.”\nBathie: “We have live pictures from the Seven News chopper above ... Brisbane ...(Earpiece: “Sorry lost it”) ... coming in soon but first let’s ...(Earpiece: KIM SKUBRIS SKUBRIS)\n... go to Kim Skubris who’s near one of the worst flooded suburbs ...” You get the idea.\nSomehow, through all the anarchy it all comes together beautifully. Source: Instagram\nI love the anarchy of it all but it’s the behind the scenes camaraderie and trust that gets you through. Even on an average day in the studio or out shooting a story for Sunday Night or when doing a Cha-cha-cha on Dancing With The Stars (definitely a highlight), the crew camaraderie remains. Like anyone I have days when I don’t want be at work, let alone sitting in front of a camera. The crew can sense it and keep you going. For that I will always be thankful.\nTV is a high pressure industry, a first world adrenaline rush that I will always love and I’m not done yet (kids and a Sydney mortgage will do that to you). But whatever’s next, wherever’s next and even if this is as Kerry Stokes dubbed it “a sojourn” from Seven, I will always be grateful for the almost 20 years of opportunities, the lifelong friendships I’ve made and the lessons learned there.\nTake a bow Chris. You will be sorely missed. Source: News Limited\n ‘OK Bathie. We have a problem.
