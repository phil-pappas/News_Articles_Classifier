The first document is titled 'Reforms for the Completion of the Current Programme and Beyond' and the second 'Preliminary Debt Sustainability Analysis'.\" \nEurozone officials have firmly said that the \"deal\" referred to expired on Tuesday. \nSome voters who initially backed the government have swapped sides ahead of Sunday's ballot. \n\"I was going to vote 'No' because I think the Greek people are being treated with contempt. But Tsipras has made the situation so much worse, it's his fault the banks are closed,\" said Athens shop assistant Suzanna Alizoti. \n- Despair - \nGreek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis has promised that banks would reopen next Tuesday, and the Union of Greek Banks said Friday it had enough liquidity until then. \nBut the current cash rationing has led many to despair, especially pensioners, who have been allowed a one-off over-the-counter withdrawal of 120 euros if they don't have a bank card. \nIn Greece's second-biggest city of Thessaloniki, one 77-year-old man unable to withdraw his 120 euros crumpled to the ground, scattering his papers. A bank manager quickly resolved the problem. \n\"I am a sensitive person,\" the man, George Chatzifotiadi, explained later to AFP. \"I cannot stand to see my country in this situation.\" \nHe added: \"Europe and Greece have made mistakes. We must find a solution.\" \nIn Athens, another pensioner, Kostas, was regularly withdrawing his and wife's daily euro limits from ATMs for fear they might be seized by the government or converted to drachmas. \"My money is safer at home,\" he said. \nMany cash machines were running short of denominations, allowing only the withdrawal of a 50-euro note. \n- Government future - \nVaroufakis has said he would step down as finance minister if a 'Yes' vote carried the day, and the rest of the government \"may very well\" do the same. \nBut Tsipras has been ambiguous, saying only he would respect the referendum's result and take the necessary steps \"set out in the constitution\". \nEurope's main stock markets slipped lower Friday as all eyes were riveted on Greece's referendum and what that might mean to investors at the beginning of next week. \n\"The vote seems tight,\" said VTB Capital economist Neil MacKinnon. \n\"A 'Yes' vote results in the resignation of the Greek government though it is not clear that this would necessarily result in a more creditor-compliant Greek administration that would sign up to the creditors' proposals quickly.\" \nBut if the 'No' vote wins, \"much would depend on the reaction of the ECB and whether it was willing to continue to sanction Emergency Liquidity Assistance to Greek banks,\" without which \"capital controls in the country would probably have to remain in place or even be stepped up,\" said analyst John Higgins of Capital Economics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T21:57:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
