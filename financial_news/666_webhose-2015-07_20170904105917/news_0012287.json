Michel O'Sullivan Perhaps unsurprisingly, the stand-out asset class has been Aussie housing, which was up 2.4 per cent in June including rents, but before costs, and smoked everything else. Now this column forecast exceptional housing returns over 2013, 2014 and 2015 driven by capital gains and I am personally \"limit-long\" Bronte property.\nOur central case has been that house prices will continue inflating at multiples of the rate of income growth until the Reserve Bank of Australia finds the gumption to normalise insanely cheap borrowing costs. Contrary to most economists, we did not expect house prices to benignly track incomes in 2013, nor did we think the boom would run out of steam in 2014 or 2015 due to affordability constraints.\nThis week UBS reported that the ratio of Australian house prices to disposable family incomes, which is a valuation measure, hit an all-time record of 5.4 times, which is above the 5.3 and 5.2 times peaks touched in 2007 and 2010, after which prices fell by 6 per cent and 8 per cent respectively. A minimum 10 per cent to 20 per cent correction in house prices is inevitable but will not happen until rates start rising, which is some way off. So I am in no rush to let go of my property or repay my mortgage just yet, although those that need to take profits should not hesitate to do so!\nMarket-neutral equity hedge funds The next best-performing asset class has been \"market-neutral\" equity hedge funds, which provided a strong 1.1 per cent return in June. These are products that simultaneously go \"long\" and \"short\" stocks and seek to strip out overall market movements (called beta), leaving investors with just the asset-selection skill and trading gains (alpha). By short-selling individual companies and/or equity index futures contracts, these players can, in theory, profit when prices decline.\nMy family has capital allocated across a global equities hedge fund, an Australian market-neutral product and a domestic multi-manager that is diversified across more than eight different Aussie equities long-short solutions.\nIt's worthwhile contextualising here the performance of these alpha-generators against beta portfolios, which are represented in my table by the Australian and global sharemarkets. Even after including dividends, Aussie equities were hammered in June, inflicting a 5.4 per cent loss on investors before fees. Global equities did somewhat better, suffering a 2.3 per cent haircut over the month.\nIn contrast, our global equities long-short manager, VGI Partners, delivered an impressive 1.4 per cent net return, which was superior to both the market-neutral numbers cited earlier and the average global equities hedge fund. The latter was down 0.8 per cent in the month according to Hedge Fund Research. Our two hedged Australian equities solutions – Perpetual's Pure Equity Alpha Fund (up 1.3 per cent) and NWQ Capital Management (about flat) – offered even healthier outperformance relative to the local sharemarket.\nCash, fixed-income Sitting between housing and long-only equity beta in the performance stakes has been cash and fixed-income. Interestingly, the maxim claimed by many investment experts – that liquid sovereign government bonds, such as the AAA-rated securities issued by the Commonwealth and fixed-rate bonds more generally – are a terrific hedge against adversity, proved woefully wrong.\nIn June, AAA-rated Aussie government bonds lost 1.1 per cent, which was closely followed by the domestic fixed-rate bond index (down 0.9 per cent). Only ASX hybrids, most of which are unrated or sub-investment grade \"junk\", did worse with a minus 1.7 per cent return. Three fixed-income funds I like – Kapstream, Macquarie Income Opportunities and Perennial Tactical Income – mitigated these losses with negative monthly returns, all about minus 0.2 per cent.\nThe one bright spot in supposedly \"defensive\" fixed-income land was cash and investment-grade floating rate notes (FRNs), which were up slightly, or about flat after fees. Cash (deposits and bank bills) and FRNs are very similar, with some FRNs (e.g. covered bonds) ranking higher in the capital structure than deposits and others (e.g. subordinated bonds) sitting relatively lower.\nA key difference is the questionable convention that we assume deposits are completely risk-free (they are not and carry credit risk) and do not need to be \"marked-to-market\". The apparent safety of cash is, therefore, partly an illusion – as Greek depositors are discovering.\nThe benefit of FRNs is they get repriced every day based on their perceived risk and thus provide a more realistic representation of the true standing of your investment compared with a deposit that is carried at face value. I guess some prefer to pretend cash has zero volatility, but the truth is that the credit risk underlying your deposits is real and changes every day.\nThis is borne out by the fact that CBA's AAA-rated, floating-rate \"covered bond\", which is technically safer than an investment in a CBA deposit above the $250,000 government guarantee, can be subject to striking price fluctuations. Back in the 2012 eurozone crisis, investors required this CBA bond to compensate them with a 1.75 per cent interest margin above the bank bill rate, which is 3.9 per cent in today's terms (given a 2.15 per cent bank bill rate). In July 2015 the same CBA bond paid only about 0.35 per cent above bills, or 2.5 per cent in total.\nThe 1.4 percentage point decline in required returns between 2012 and 2015 translates into a 2 percentage point appreciation in the value of the CBA bond. Some of the return compression has been because the bond is repaid in 2017 and the two years until maturity today is much less than the five years that remained outstanding in 2012. Yet most of the spread contraction has been attributable to an improvement in sentiment around CBA's credit risk. We know this because when Suncorp recently did a similar AAA-rated covered bond issue, investors only asked for a 0.7 per cent interest margin above bank bills.\nWhile the present crisis is more worrying for the Greeks than the 2012 episode, markets are judging that the contagion risks are, for the time being, better contained. One reason for this optimism is that private banks no longer hold Greek bonds, which have been transferred to the balance sheets of governments and public authorities such as the IMF.\nNotwithstanding this, the portfolio impacts of the latest European imbroglio have been demonstrably dire. With the exception of housing, which is pro-cyclical and unlikely to protect you in the next recession, the analysis above suggests your most effective catastrophe hedges, or suppliers of capital stability, will be found in cash, FRNs and market-neutral equities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:08:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
