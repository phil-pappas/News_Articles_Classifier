The number is the smallest since the government started releasing the figures in May, and compares with a high of 1.64 million in the week ended May 29.\nThe drop reflects waning confidence among retail investors, who make up about 80 percent of the Chinese market. The Shanghai Composite Index has plunged 10 percent so far this week as concern grew that unprecedented government intervention will fail to shore up equities.\nThis week’s losses come after the Shanghai gauge rebounded 16 percent from its July 8 low through Friday, as officials went to extreme lengths to halt a rout that erased $4 trillion from the nation’s stock market. Officials have allowed more than 1,400 companies to halt trading, banned major shareholders from selling stakes and armed a state-run financing vehicle with more than $480 billion to support the market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T16:49:06.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
