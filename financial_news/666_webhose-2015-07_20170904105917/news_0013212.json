Patrick Eccelsine by Neil deGrasse Tyson My professional life is all about getting everyone to learn about how science works, why it works and how science decides what is true in this world and how it decides what is not. I don’t see what I do as a battle or as a contest of ideas. I’m an educator and I offer evidence and argument in support of what scientific methods and tools have found out about the natural world.\nMany people have not had a full or detailed training in what science is and how it works. Science throughout the school system is seen as a body of information that’s just handed to you, and then you learn it or you don’t learn it and you move on to the next subject.\nCherry-picking science ideas In science it’s not so much what you know; it’s how do you learn what is true, how do you judge what is not true. These are hard-earned tools that have completely shaped what we now call modern civilisation. The same people who hold a smartphone to their ear and speak to someone 7000 kilometres away embrace that aspect of science but reject others.\nSuch people are cherry-picking the science they agree with versus the science they don’t. I don’t fight people about it; I offer them what science is and how it works.\nIf you have a belief system, fine, but to try to assert that it is true no matter what, and create legislation based on it … that’s pretty much the end of an informed democracy.\nReaching the public The problem is that the scientific culture does not reward people for writing popular books or appearing on television. You are rewarded for the time you spend in a laboratory. The science communication I do is primarily because I’m asked, not because I wake up and say to myself, “How many different ways can I reach the public today?”\n I’m far more passive than it might appear. I’ve had people come up to me after seeing me on the internet and say, “Who’s your agent?” But it’s like, “No, the universe is my agent.”\nWhat I’m trying to do is reduce the amount of time I spend in the public eye and increase the time I spend doing research. I tabled my astrophysics research over the past several years primarily because of the weight of Cosmos [the remake of Carl Sagan’s 1980 TV series] on my calendar. I judged it a worthwhile investment of my time because I felt I could do that uniquely, given that I knew Carl Sagan.\nI would love nothing more than to step away from [being a science communicator] and hand over all the area I was working on to everybody else. That’s how you would know it’s a true movement and not just a cult.\nNeil deGrasse Tyson will tour Australia from August 16.
