Michele Mossop Share on twitter by Jacob Greber The stereotype of Baby Boomers blowing their super on luxurious offshore holidays or epic round-Australia caravan trips to qualify for the pension has been exploded as a myth by the Productivity Commission.\nIn a report into retirement policy released on Tuesday, the commission also finds raising the age at which people can access their super to 65 would boost federal coffers mid-century by about $7 billion a year in today's money.\nDelaying by two years the age at which people dip into their super would also leave them with a balance at least 10 per cent larger when they retire.\nWhile only 30 per cent of people opt to take their benefits early as a lump sum, most of those use the cash to pay down debt or buy durable goods such as cars or fridges that will be used through their retirement.\nThe commission found almost no evidence that retirees and their financial planners were aggressively restructuring their affairs to tap into pensions.\n\"Most folks are actually quite prudent,\" said Productivity Commissioner Karen Chester, who oversaw the commission's report, Superannuation Policy for Post-Retirement .\n\"Some commentators have suggested that super lump sums have been problematic, but when you look at the data more than 70 per cent have been taken as an income stream,\" Ms Chester said.\nBalances expanded This was likely to increase in coming years as super balances expanded, thanks to younger generations having more of their working lives to accumulate savings, she said.\nFor those on more modest lump sums, typically less than $50,000, there was little benefit in buying an annuity or other form of fixed-income investment, she said.\n\"There is little or no evidence of squander and that which is spent is spent on things to help retirees in retirement.\"\nThe findings add to an emerging debate over whether governments should narrow the gap between the retirement age – which is rising to 67 years – and the age at which people can access their super accounts, also known as the preservation age, which is moving to 60 by 2025. If the pension age is increased to 70 as planned the gap will widen from seven years to 10.\nRetirement savings are set to be a key battleground at the next federal election, with Labor pledging to wind back concessions on superannuation for those with large balances.\nDespite opposition from his own ranks , Prime Minister Tony Abbott has vowed to make no changes to super and has accused Labor repeatedly of seeking to \"raid\" people's savings.\nWhile the commission's report steers clear of the current political debate over concessions, it recommends any changes to super be made as part of a \"holistic\" review of retirement policy, including the treatment of the family home.\nAs narrow as possible Ms Chester urged governments to keep the gap between the preservation and pension age as narrow as possible.\n\"You don't want folks to unnecessarily exhaust their super before they get to the pension, and the bigger the gap the more incentive for that to happen,\" she told The Australian Financial Review .\nHowever, she said it was important governments recognised one of the surprise findings of the commission's research – the unexpectedly large number of people who retired through no fault or choice of their own.\nMore than half of men and one-third of women aged between 60 and 64 are forced out of work because of their ill health, the loss of a job, or the ill-health of a spouse. Those more likely to stay in work are also wealthier, with better-paid jobs and larger super balances, and are therefore more likely to invest in income streams over consumption.\n\"The ultimate goal [of retirement policy] is to lift mature-age workforce participation,\" she said. \"Some people will work longer, have more savings for retirement and there will be fiscal gains.\n\"But [the gains] are not as great as we might have otherwise thought.\"\n\"A lot of that relates to the diversity among older Australians. For those that don't have a choice and you lift the preservation age, you need to work out what's an appropriate arrangement for access to early super balances.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-07-06T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T22:09:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
