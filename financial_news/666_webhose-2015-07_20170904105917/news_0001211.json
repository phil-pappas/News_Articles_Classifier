The breast cancer market is also facing increased competition from new products such as Pfizer's Ibrance. \nFor now, Afinitor is continuing to grow strongly, with sales in the second quarter rising 19 percent in constant currency terms to $423 million, making it an important plank of Novartis's big cancer drug portfolio. \nConsensus forecasts point to sales peaking at $2.06 billion in 2018, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis. \n(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by David Goodman) Health Care Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T11:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T12:31:27.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
