I don't exaggerate. We're talking a lot of cash, we're talking millions of dollars. \"\nHenry confirmed to CBD that these stories were local, but added a caveat.\nAdvertisement \"I should emphasise that these stories were few in number, anecdotal, unconfirmed. Straws in the wind.\"\nPity. Wouldn't we have loved to have a few name tags on the cases in question.\nAs a director of NAB, and its chairman elect, Henry will certainly be in a better position to confirm these stories this time around - if things get bad.\nAnd remember, he is not a fan of the Euro experiment.\n\"Personally, I've never seen how the euro would work. I've never seen how it could be expected to work without a genuine fiscal union,\" Henry said the last time Greece was causing financial heartburn in 2012.\nNot that he is expecting the Greeks to cause any financial indigestion Down Under.\nHenry is still backing his comments from the last time Greece hit the news in 2012.\nHe said at the time if the \"worst thing happens\" in Europe, the dollar might climb because Australia was likely to be seen as a safe haven for global investors.\nCBD is sure Henry would be happy to explain that to any nervous nellies Down Under that show up with empty suitcases at his bank should the moussaka hit the fan.\nShare Recall Takeover target, Recall Holdings, is having trouble keeping up with the share buying spree by its chief, Doug Pertz .\nLast Tuesday, the company announced Pertz had recently added 25,000 shares to his pile of stock at $7.15 each.\nWe later found out that, on that very day, he dived back in and picked up another 40,000 shares at around $6.90 each.\nRecall then had to come back to the market on Thursday with the information that Pertz actually began his spree on June 23, acquiring 64,500 shares at around $7.20.\nAt this rate he will be able to get the takeover across the line all on his lonesome.\nPity none of his shares qualify for the $8.50 cash offer. This only goes to investors with less than 5000 shares who held stock at the time US suitor, Iron Mountain, made its announcement.\nThe rest of the investors, like Pertz, will be receiving Iron Mountain stock for the most part - and share prices have not lived up to the company name in recent months.\nTake two Ups, downs, pluses, minuses.\nIt all gets so confusing some times which is why we rely on financial professionals to take care of the details.\nBut sometimes even the professionals get a little confused.\nThe Watermark Market Neutral Fund Ltd, updated the market on its monthly performance on Friday.\n\"In the interests of keeping the market fully informed of monthly performance on a timely basis, we will release preliminary estimates of gross portfolio performance at the beginning of each month. This should only be seen as a guide of underlying fund performance,\" it said.\n\"We estimate that the gross portfolio of Watermark Market Neutral Fund Limited decreased in value by approximately 3.44 per cent in June 2015 (before fees and taxes).\"\nIt did say that this was a \"preliminary\" estimate right?\nJust as well. About five minutes later Watermark issued an update.\n\"We estimate that the gross portfolio of Watermark Market Neutral Fund Limited increased in value by approximately 3.44 per cent in June 2015 (before fees and taxes).\"\nLet's hope that no investors reacted hysterically before their losses inverted to a sizeable gain within minutes.\nNothing to trouble the regulators right boys?\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T01:13:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
