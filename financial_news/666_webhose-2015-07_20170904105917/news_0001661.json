His mother (my sister) gave roughly the same amount in gifts to my son. Over the last year or so, she stopped working for various reasons and now gives my son roughly half as much than I am giving her son as they are relying on a single income. Should I reciprocate and reduce the dollar amount of the gift to my nephew as well? My nephew who is now a teenager will definitely notice a decrease if I do and will most likely be a little bit disappointed. What do you think I should do?\nAlex in California\nDear Alex,\nIt’s a tricky situation when you give money on a regular basis because — for the most part — you have to start as you began, giving the same if not more than the first time you tucked that bill inside an envelope. Whether you’re giving a gift to a nephew or even your church, it’s easy to keep the status quo, but it’s much harder to give less than you used to. People will ask questions. Teenagers, in particular, may take it personally and ask, “Is it something I’ve done?”\nMost people get more back than the value of the gift. Some 83% of people said gift-giving makes them feel “joyful” and 78% said it makes them feel “generous,” according to a recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center. However, nearly half (46%) of respondents said gift-giving makes them feel like they’re being stretched thin financially and 36% are stressed out with the commitments of gift-giving, and 23% find it wasteful. (The rest didn’t know how it made them feel.)\nRead: When a husband hides the family finances behind passwords\nWho hasn’t gone shopping for a gift only to come home with a gift for oneself? (OK, maybe that’s just me.) That could be a mistake: Spending more of your income on others predicted greater happiness, according to this study in the January 2008 edition of the journal Science, the weekly publication for the American Association for the Advancement of Science. This was carried out before the recession but, given that we’re over the worst of it, it’s worth keeping in mind.\nThis is an opportunity to explain to your son that your sister needs to tighten her purse strings, say she loves your son the same and money is not an indicator of that love. Add an important P.S. If you lost your job or suffered a loss in income, your family would have to make the same hard decisions. You don’t have to cut back and you don’t want to draw attention to this or hurt your sister’s feelings or those of her son by cutting the value of his gifts, so keep sending the $100.\nBetter yet, think of a gift for your nephew — a gift card for a bookstore or clothing store, for example — that would help take pressure off your sister’s finances.\nAlso see: Is it OK to ask wedding guests to give cash — not gifts?\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, regifting, or any tricky money issues relating to family and friends?
