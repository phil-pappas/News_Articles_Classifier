( SZYM ), a renewable oil and specialty ingredients company, announced today results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015. \n“We are making good progress against our core deliverables, the commercialization of high value products across food, personal care and industrial markets, and the delivery of key milestones at the Moema JV production facility in Brazil,” said Jonathan Wolfson, CEO of Solazyme. “While there is a lot of work ahead, I am proud of the Solazyme team, and what they have accomplished so far this year. I am excited about what is to come.” \n“We are maintaining financial discipline in our operations and focusing our sales efforts on strategic revenue streams,” said Tyler Painter, COO and CFO of Solazyme. “On the commercial side, our product portfolio is well aligned with trends across our targeted end markets, and we are seeing a growing number of projects and customers today.” \nBusiness Review Foods - AlgaVia™ and AlgaWise™: We have a growing number of application projects in process with a variety of food and beverage manufacturers and are starting to see conversions from projects to customers. Most recently, a division of a major multinational food company launched a series of baking mixes using the AlgaVia protein and an exciting new beverage company is launching a meal replacement drink made with an AlgaWise oil. Personal Care - AlgaPūr™ and Algenist ® : We transitioned Natura Cosméticos, one of Latin America’s largest cosmetics and personal care product companies, from a development partner into a customer of AlgaPūr™ microalgae oil. We also partnered with BASF for the launch of the world’s first commercial microalgae-derived surfactant for use in home and personal care applications, utilizing AlgaPūr™. We continue to grow and expand our Algenist brand, which is now distributed in more than 2,500 stores in 22 countries and has reached 37 SKUs. Industrials - Encapso™ and Soladiesel ® : We continue to expand our Encapso™ work with Flotek in South America, including multiple successful wells in Colombia. In North America, Encapso is experiencing longer than anticipated sales cycles due to lower petroleum prices and substantially reduced rig counts. In our renewable fuels business, we were named one of three suppliers of blended fuel to UPS in support of its renewable fuels program, and we also successfully completed a two-year renewable diesel evaluation with Volkswagen of America. Moema: During the second quarter of 2015, key power and steam redundancy projects were successfully completed which, along with other ongoing work at the facility, has led to significant improvements in power and steam reliability and allowed us to establish fully integrated operations on a more consistent basis. We are currently focused on optimizing and enhancing fully integrated operations from fermentation to oil production and improving overall performance. \nFinancial Results \nTotal revenue for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 was $11.7 million compared with $15.9 million in the second quarter of 2014. The year over year decline in revenues was due to expected decreases in funded program revenue as well as in product revenue due to the timing of certain Algenist sales activities and slower than anticipated adoption rates for Encapso. GAAP net loss was $37.2 million for the second quarter of 2015, compared to net loss of $42.9 million in the prior year period. On a non-GAAP basis, the net loss was $31.7 million for the second quarter of 2015, compared with net loss of $32.9 million in the prior year quarter. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included below. \nConference Call \nSolazyme will hold a conference call for investors on July 30, 2015 at 1:30 p.m. PT (4:30 p.m. ET).

These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information, which is not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measure, see “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net-Loss and Net-Loss Per Share” included in the tables to this press release. \nThese non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of Solazyme’s current financial performance and Solazyme’s prospects for the future. Specifically, Solazyme believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. \nFor its internal budgeting process, Solazyme’s management uses financial measures that do not include stock-based compensation expense or special expenses such as non-cash gains or losses related to derivative liabilities and warrant revaluations. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, Solazyme’s management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of Solazyme. Solazyme excludes stock-based compensation expenses and special non-cash charges from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that management does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. \nForward Looking Statements \nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 about Solazyme, including statements that involve risks and uncertainties concerning: its commercialization and production plans; the commissioning of equipment and the ramping up of facilities; meeting commercialization and technology targets; successful product trials and market acceptance of its products; and Solazyme’s ability to maintain its relationships with its partners. When used in this press release, the words “will”, “expects”, “intends” and other similar expressions and any other statements that are not historical facts are intended to identify those assertions as forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any such statement may be influenced by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the control of Solazyme, that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those projected, described, expressed or implied in this press release due to a number of risks and uncertainties. Potential risks and uncertainties include, among others: Solazyme’s limited operating history; its limited history in commercializing products; implementation risk in deploying new technologies; its limited experience in constructing, ramping up and operating commercial manufacturing facilities; its ability to sell its products at a profit; delays related to construction, start-up and ramp-up of production facilities; its ability to manage operational costs at production facilities; its ability to enter into and maintain strategic collaborations; successful product trials by its customers and market acceptance of its products by end-users; its ability to obtain requisite regulatory approvals; and its access, on favorable terms, to any required financing. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what impact they will have on the results of operations or financial condition of Solazyme. \nIn addition, please refer to the documents that Solazyme, Inc. files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as updated from time to time, for a discussion of these and other risks.
