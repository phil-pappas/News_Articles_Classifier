James Alcock Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Union records detailing payments by employers to the Australian Workers' Union's Victorian branch for four years under the leadership of Bill Shorten have been lost.\nAs Mr Shorten prepared to appear before the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption on Wednesday, The Australian Financial Review had been told that the union had not kept records of invoices sent to employers before 2003.\nA number of employers allegedly paid the union dues of employees to the AWU under Mr Shorten, who was Victorian secretary from 1998 to 2006 and national secretary from 2001 to 2007.\nEvidence before the commission shows the AWU's Victorian branch in 2005 received $38,228 from builder Winslow Constructors to pay the union dues of 105 members.\nDocuments seen by the Financial Review also show the Victorian branch invoiced Winslow in March 2004 for $30,515 to pay the union dues of an unspecified number of workers.\nBut Winslow has told the commission the practice started in the 1990s before Shorten's time. However, sources said no invoices are held by the union that cover the period from 1998 to 2002 when Mr Shorten was state secretary.\nIt is understood the union transferred invoices to a new computer system in about 2003 and did not shift the old financial statements.\nPractice 'widespread' Former building industry union official Don Henderson, who worked at the AWU between 1997 and 2000, has alleged the practice of companies paying the union dues of employees was widespread under Mr Shorten.\nMr Henderson said he knew at least 10 companies that paid the union dues of employees directly to the AWU, but he insisted it was done with the knowledge of employees, who wanted to be union members.\nCurrent secretary Ben Davis has told the commission he stopped the practice because it weakened the union's bargaining power. He said he cancelled an AWU invoice sent to Winslow in June last year that sought $82,368 for union dues.\nSources said the union believed it was only obligated legally to keep records for seven years.\nFollowing the commission issuing notices to the union to produce a range of documents, it is understood the AWU has submitted membership lists of the Victorian branch from 1998 to 2005.\nIt has also handed over minutes of the state branch executive and minutes of the union's national executive from 1998 to 2006.\nQuestioned about the Winslow payments, Mr Shorten admitted on the ABC's Insiders program in June that it was \"entirely possible\" that employers paid the union dues of members during his time at the AWU.\nMr Shorten is also expected to be questioned on Wednesday about $300,000 in payments by Thiess John Holland, the joint-venture builder of Melbourne's EastLink project, to the union from 2005.\nThe payments by Thiess John Holland are documented in union invoices, Australian Electoral Commission returns and the bank statements of the union's Victorian branch.\nBased on union invoices, Thiess John Holland made $72,500 in payments in 2005-06 to the union's Victorian branch when Mr Shorten was state secretary, while the amount invoiced by the branch under his successor Cesar Melhem over 2006 and 2007 was at least $207,000.\nMr Shorten will only be cross-examined by counsel assisting the commission, Jeremy Stoljar, during his initial appearance on Wednesday. There is a prospect he will be required to appear on Thursday.\nIf his lawyers, or lawyers for other parties, wish to cross-examine him, they will have to formally apply for permission. If it is granted, Mr Shorten would be required to make a further appearance. However, it is likely this would not occur until August or September.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-07-06T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T13:03:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
