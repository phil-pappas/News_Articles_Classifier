Photo: Craig Abraham\nAs if markets bobbing about weren't enough, the word is they'll be giving less as well.\nSubscribe to Money’s weekly newsletter , delivered to your inbox every Wednesday That's whether they're shares, bonds or commodities.\nThe persistence of very low inflation and global interest rates, without denying their undoubted virtues, changes the game.\nAdvertisement This is most obvious when it comes to bonds, which are a mainstay of super funds. They also set the price of annuities which are guaranteed income streams, a bit like term deposits.\nBut do ultra-low rates mean sharemarkets are in a bubble which could pop without warning like Shanghai's 25 per cent drop in a few days? Nobody could say our own sharemarket is a bubble, but then as Shanghai showed, tidal events swamp all.\nBecause deposit rates barely stretch past a decimal place in most of the developed world the sharemarket looks a no-brainer. It pays more just in dividends, let alone the promise of capital gains.\nBut that only encourages it to go overboard, especially when central banks in Europe and Japan are pumping extra near free money into their economies which spreads far and wide as speculators get in on the act. Why wouldn't they take the money and invest it somewhere with a decent return?\nThe point is, interest rates and inflation are low for a reason. They're the result of below par economic growth which is going to catch up with, or I should say pull down, investment returns including your super and perhaps extending even to property.\nHang on, doesn't low inflation make lower returns more palatable? I'm not so sure. The trouble is, it's dragged down the yields on bonds by more, undermining all other rates – accounting for some 30 or 40 per cent of the returns in an average super fund.\nNot that I'm saying bring back inflation, just that it's artificially low because of weak growth. With its acutely sensitive inflation-detecting radar, the bond market can't see any sign of it for years which can only mean low growth.\nTake the results of a survey by financial consultant RiceWarner which surveyed investment advisers and fund managers about the next 10 years.\nI wish it hadn't asked. They think markets will be more volatile – though it must be said they always say that, probably because it's a good all-round defence if things go wrong – with lower returns than they were seeing three years ago.\nThe sharemarket will average 7.7 per cent growth a year compared with 9 per cent before. The interesting thing is that the earlier forecast has, at least so far, proved to be wildly pessimistic yet they've still downgraded it for the next 10 years. Their anticipated return on bonds and cash has been almost halved.\nOh dear, if they're right, that means all those online calculators showing you won't have enough in super in 10 years are overly optimistic. Typically, they assume an annual return of 7 per cent on a balanced fund, which is split around 40/60 between bonds and shares, when 5 per cent might be more realistic.\nThis, I should emphasise, comes about because they think interest rates will be lower for longer due to lacklustre growth which also constrains profits. Granted, anybody prepared to forecast what markets will be doing in 10 years is braver than you and I.\nStill, forewarned is forearmed. Since we're living longer but will apparently be earning less in super, it's hard to know whether to laugh or cry.\nGuess it's a case of save more or work longer. But it also means there'll be no more flicking the super switch to conservative on R-day by swapping shares for term deposits. That won't do.\nResearch shows retirees \"are four to five times more risk averse than in the accumulation phase,\" says CBA's general manger retirement, Nicolette Rubinsztein. But going for safety can backfire because your money will run out sooner.\nThat's why financial planners suggest the bucket strategy, not to be confused with the bucket list. This separates cash or an annuity into a pretend bucket at the ready for expenses and meeting the minimum drawdown pension rules. Growth assets such as shares to be invested for a longer term go in the other one.\nIt's crucial the second bucket keeps at least the same level of risk as you had before you retired and were building up your super.\nSo long as the first bucket is full, insulating you from inevitable market bad hair days, you're not putting your super into jeopardy. Instead you'll be making it do its job.\n@moneyPOTTS", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@moneyPOTTS", "https://membercentre.fairfax.com.au/NewsletterSubscription.aspx"], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T15:15:48.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
