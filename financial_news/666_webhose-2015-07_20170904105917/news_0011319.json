Daniel Munoz Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle Malcolm Turnbull has warned against over-stating the terrorist threat, said labelling those who question national security laws as \"friends of terrorists\" was \"stupid\" and said tough policies can be popular but still be a mistake.\nIn a speech in Sydney on Tuesday night, the Communications Minister launched a thinly veiled critique of the government's approach to national security, which comes in the wake of a major internal cabinet brawl over citizenship laws.\nWhile insisting in the speech that the government had got the balance between security and individual liberty right, and repeatedly endorsing positions taken by Prime Minister Tony Abbott , Mr Turnbull used references to conservative heroes such as Robert Menzies and Winston Churchill in a speech on Magna Carta and the rule of law to question whether the government's political approach – and its preparedness to roll back the rule of law – may be excessive.\nBalancing security and individual liberty is a balance \"our government has, I believe, got right\", he said.\n\"But in order to ensure we continue to do so, this conversation is one that should proceed in a considered manner, respectful of the views and experience of others.\"\nHe Quote: d Liberal Party founder and former prime minister Robert Menzies from the darkest days of World War II in 1942, saying: \"if the day is to come when the courts are to be closed to the aggrieved citizen, when the King's writ is not to run because popular uproar wills it so, when the appeal to the law is to be an occasion of scoffing, then that day will cast a black shadow across British freedom …\n\"The law's greatest benefits are for the minority man – the individual.\"\nSecurity-liberty balance 'controversial' Prior to the government reaching a final agreement on laws to strip dual citizens of their citizenship , Mr Abbott argued against legal redress for such cases on the basis that those involved might \"get off\".\nMr Turnbull said on Tuesday night the balance between security and liberty \"will always be controversial and that is a good thing.\n\"We need to recognise that getting the balance right is not easy (not least because the balance may shift over time) and we are more likely to do so if there is a thoughtful and well-informed public debate – weighing up the reality of the national security threat, the effectiveness of particular proposed measures and then asking whether those measures do infringe on our traditional freedoms and if so, whether the infringement is justifiable,\" he said.\n\"It is important to remember that people and societies with an equal determination to defeat terrorism can have different views on what is the right balance and, indeed, what the right measures are.\n\"Denouncing those who question the effectiveness of new national security measures as 'friends of terrorists' is as stupid as describing those who advocate them as 'proto-fascists'.\n\"This debate is not an easy left/right divide\", he said. \"One of the most consistent and cogent critics of our government's legislation on many national security topics including data retention and citizenship, has been the Institute of Public Affairs.\n\"Their recent catalogue of the hundreds of Commonwealth laws that qualify or overrule traditional legal rights is sobering reading.\"\nPowerful arguments Mr Turnbull said there are powerful arguments \"that existing laws need to be constantly reviewed and updated to ensure they are still relevant and effective as new technologies emerge and old ways of intelligence gathering become outdated\".\nBut respect for the rule of law is at the heart of what it means be a conservative. The approach, \"that 'an old law is a good law', has been very influential in the government's approach to the Citizenship Act changes\", he said.\n\"Instead of proceeding with a proposal that would give the Minister the discretion to revoke Australian citizenship if he believed the person affected had engaged in terrorist activities, the proposed amendments build on the existing provisions in section 34 and 35 of the Act. The upshot of this is that section 35 will be modernised so that it applies to people fighting for a non-state actor like Da'esh as much as it applies to a person who fights in the army of a country at war with Australia.\"\nMr Turnbull questioned whether it was possible to eradicate \"terrorism\" – \"as opposed to defeating a particular terrorist organisation like Da'esh .\n\"There will always be people and groups who choose to use violence to pursue political goals. One of the strengths of our liberal democracy, governed by the rule of law, is that there are many peaceful avenues to pursue political goals,\" he said.\nMr Turnbull said that just as it is important \"not to underestimate, or be complacent about, the national security threat from Da'esh, it is equally important not to overestimate that threat\", arguing that this actually played into the hands of terrorists.\n'Twisted, archaic interpretation' \"We should be careful not to say or do things that can be seen to add credibility to the 'delusions' of terrorists. As the Prime Minister has observed, a jihadist needs only a victim, a knife and a phone to create an act of terror that will be viewed around the world,\" he said.\n\"Da'esh's recruiting formula, often slickly produced, includes the well-known combination of sex and violence – especially the latter. It works for Hollywood, so why wouldn't it work for Da'esh, especially when a twisted and archaic interpretation of Islam is used to legitimise it?\n\"We need to be very careful we don't get sucked into their strategy and ourselves become amplifiers of their wickedness and significance.\"\nMr Turnbull said it was \"more important that counter-terrorism measures be the right ones, the effective ones, than that they simply be \"tough\".\n\"Tough policies can be popular, they may even be justified at the time they are conceived, but they can still be a mistake.\n\"I suppose there is nothing tougher than invading a country, overthrowing its government and occupying its territory. But with the benefit of hindsight, few today contend that the 2003 invasion of Iraq, popular with the US public and the Congress at the time, was not a tragic error.\n\"The Islamic terrorist seeks to provoke the state to overreact because it creates a more receptive environment for the extremists' recruiting efforts based as so much of it is on perceptions of resentment, oppression and humiliation.\n\"I hope we will always believe, as a core political value, that no one should be punished without a fair trial and that a true democracy constrains the majority even as it empowers it.\n\"We should always shudder a little, perhaps a lot, when cynics sneer at courts and laws as just troublesome obstacles standing in the way of justice.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/latingle", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559"], "published": "2015-07-07T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T18:09:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
