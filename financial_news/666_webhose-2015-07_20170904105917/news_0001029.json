The offer opened on July 03 and scheduled to close on August 21 – that’s about 7 weeks or some 50 days and so with the interim injunction, this will fall short by some 10 days at least for now. \nBut in an exclusive interview with Joy Business Editor, Emmanuel Agyei, the Director General of the SEC, Adu Anane Antwi explained the deadline can be extended. \n“If the court realises that the offer should go ahead, they will just ask them to continue and if the managers require some extension they could write to the SEC to ask for extension of time - which is normal. \n“Even if there was no court injunction and you think that your process, still needed some time to be able to get more investors to be brought on board, you can still come to the SEC to ask for an extension period,” he noted. \nThe SEC is the regulatory institution for the capital market that approved ADB’s Initial Public Offering after the due diligence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T12:24:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
