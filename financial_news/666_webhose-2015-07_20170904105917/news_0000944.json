Then we mixed them up 10 different ways into portfolios to suit every investor. Follow @Kiplinger \nChoosing a good exchange-traded fund is a little like shopping for blue paint at a home-improvement store: The choices are dizzying. Search for an ETF with “S&P 500” in its name, for example, and you’ll find 65 funds. But only three track Standard & Poor’s famous large-company stock index in the traditional way. That is, they hold shares in all 500 firms in proportion to their market capitalization. See Also: ETFs That Are Too Hot to Handle \nETFs hold baskets of securities like mutual funds, but they trade like stocks. The vast majority track an index. Some benchmarks are well known, some are obscure, and some were created solely to launch an ETF. The first ETF, SPDR S&P 500 (symbol SPY ), opened in 1993. Today, 1,740 ETFs, with assets of $2.1 trillion, trade in the U.S. \nBut as the roster of choices has expanded, the decision-making process has become increasingly complex. Not only is there an ETF for every corner of every market, you now have to consider whether you want a passively managed ETF, an actively managed one, or one that falls somewhere in between. The last group includes a category called “smart-beta ETFs”—funds that use quantitative strategies to beat traditional indexes. \nEnter the Kiplinger ETF 20, the list of our favorite ETFs . To find our winners, we analyzed dozens of funds. After deciding which index or swath of the market to track, we zeroed in on fees; the lower a fund’s expense ratio, the better. But that was just a start in the quest for low costs. We also sought funds with certain traits, such as above-average trading volume and minimal “bid” and “asked” spreads, that help hold down the costs of buying and selling ETFs (beyond standard brokerage commissions). We also kept an eye on “tracking error,” the amount by which an ETF fails to match its index. \nBut the 20 finalists are not meant to represent a complete portfolio. Rather, you should decide what you need, then use our picks to assemble a portfolio that is right for you.
