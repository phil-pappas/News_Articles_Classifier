Arsineh Houspian by Jemima Whyte and Sally Rose Patrick Farrell oversees $26 billion worth of investments across all types of assets classes. But on June 22 when sharemarket darling SEEK jolted the ASX with a rare profit downgrade, the chief investment officer at one of the country's biggest super funds moved fast.\n\"We were on the blower to upline managers that held it [the stock] to discuss what was going to happen,\" Farrell says. \"What was their overall view and thesis? Were there trading opportunities?\"\nOn the ball? Engaged? Protecting the superannuation returns of his 350,000 members?\nPerhaps not.\nFarrell's response to SEEK's downgrade goes to the centre of a debate that's firing up behind closed doors – are the very funds that were set up to invest for the long term becoming too focused on the short term? Is this in turn making Australian listed companies too timid? Is that why the ASX is shrinking? Much has been made about dividend-hungry retail investors – the so-called 'wealthy selfies' of the booming self-managed super sector – crimping animal spirits by encouraging companies to pay out all of their cash today rather than reinvest it for tomorrow. But are our big super funds – who know better– also part of the problem?\nConsider the situation with SEEK. In the past five years, the online job search website has doubled its share price, smashing the performance of the broader market. It's now pushing into Asia – a strategy with risk but also its best chance of future reward. The average age of members in the BT super fund that Farrell oversees is about 36, which means they have an average 31 years to go before accessing their super. Farrell has got an obligation to think long term. Certainly, that means being on top of things. But is it a good thing that he jumps onto the phone to call fund managers questioning what they'll do when one great long-time performing stock issues a profit downgrade?\nFarrell says there is a problem – and it's far bigger than just him. \"It's an unfortunate nature of where we are at,\" he says. Super funds are reporting their returns more regularly to members. More and more corporations are trying to report to the market every three months. The better access to information is great on one level, he says. But it can stop people from looking ahead.\n\"We don't put pressure on our managers to deliver quarter after quarter – we are looking for performance over a long-term cycle. But I don't deny for a second that it is a problem happening across the broader market.\"\n Super challenge Allocating super is a challenge – perhaps even more so in the current environment where interest rates are low, asset prices are being inflated by excess capital and the global growth outlook is crimped.\nFinding good places to invest money in Australia is getting harder. The value of the local sharemarket, as a proportion of gross domestic product, has been on a downward trajectory since 2011. Capital returns and delistings are outpacing equity raisings and floats. Inbound mergers and acquisitions is two times greater than outbound M&A.\nSimply put, investors aren't rewarding companies for chasing long-term growth – and it seems more and more Australian companies are choosing not to pursue it and return capital instead. The ASX, as a store of Australian's wealth, is shrinking in importance.\nDavid Neal presides over one of the very few funds that is seen to be successfully investing for the long term – the federal government's Future Fund. And his point is this: the layers of people involved – quite rightly – in making and monitoring long-term investment decisions make it inevitable that short-term results are questioned and sometimes acted on. That's how the system is set up.\n\"All those layers all put pressure on the systems...you've got five or six in the chain, and all have to be able to persuade the person above them there's nothing to worry about [if a fund has a bad quarter],\" he says. \"The incentive at each point is to control your risk.\"\nExtend that idea and fund managers are told not to deviate too far from the benchmark, which in turn leads to making sure that no stock they invest should do badly over the quarter, which in turns leads to more conservative company management.\nNeal's argument comes as the debate around why Australian companies aren't reinvesting escalates.\nAs recently as last month Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens urged companies to invest for growth and stimulate the economy. But is it an unrealistic ask?\nLen Ainsworth, who has successfully built two ASX 200 companies, says owning the majority of Ainsworth Gaming means he has the luxury of not worrying too much about what investors think of the group's international strategy.\n\"I didn't ask 'em - we just go our merry way,\" he tells AFR Weekend .\n\"I have the considerable advantage of the family having more than 60 per cent of the company - so that helps.\"\nLast month Mike Wilkins, chief executive of IAG – another company taking a longer term bet by expanding offshore – described his board as \"brave\" for risking short-term investor displeasure. Some local investors might think the strategy is risky but it's a risk the world's most famous value investor is happy to take. Soon after Wilkins' comments Warren Buffett bought a $500 million stake in his business.\nThe Future Fund's Neal says it's too simplistic to assume companies aren't investing long-term because of pressure being applied by institutional investors to keep performance up in the short-term.\n\"It's a global phenomenon – reinvestment is low, capex is low and perhaps it's the ability to find strongly returning investments rather than feeling the pressure of short-termism. As a long-term investor, I would rather that a corporation that can't find a good returning investment give the money back and I would find one somewhere else.\"\nBut somewhere along the line there's a disconnect. Super funds say they are focused on long-term returns. But fund managers argue that few are prepared to ride out any patches of poor performance.\nMore accurately, it's a risk few managers are willing to take.\nFunds dictate play Super funds can make or break a funds' management business, and it's fairly standard for contracts to allow termination with a few days' notice. And increasingly, the super funds are calling the shots internally, rather than rely solely on the advice of consultants. Even more worryingly for the funds management industry, more and more are bringing investment management in-house.\nIn the past year, at least six Australian fund managers lost their super clients, according to a survey of the 20 largest super funds by AFR Weekend . Five funds declined to participate – AustralianSuper, MLC Business Super, ANZ SmartChoice, Plum Super Personal and CareSuper.\nOver the past three years, it's been more drastic – with more than 31 mandates terminated.\nThe mandates were lost for a number of reasons – staff departures, performance, fees, change in portfolio construction or the size of the fund relative to the portfolio. It's a reminder of how super funds wield their power.\nIn one case, health and community services industry fund HESTA terminated two mandates for failing to reduce fees \"enough\". Industry sources say base fees for managing an ASX200 portfolio have fallen to around 0.35 of a percentage point from around 0.7 of a percentage point five years ago, although that excludes performance incentives.\nBut it means the pressure on fund managers to perform is becoming more intense. And while super funds stress they don't terminate mandates lightly, the way they monitor an investment manager's performance is becoming more frequent and granular.\nMost have formal meetings with funds at least quarterly, AFR Weekend' s survey shows. Others, like Mercer, say they receive monthly updates but also have the capability to monitor performance at any time through internal systems. HOSTPLUS says it has outsourced manager research and management to JANA, an asset consultant, which meets managers every six weeks. HOSTPLUS chief investment officer Sam Sicilia​ says he speaks with JANA \"multiple times a day\".\nSicilia says he intentionally tries to keep away from direct contact with companies and managers, pointing out HOSTPLUS has a million members with an average age of 37, meaning the investment horizon he is focused on is 30 years.\n\"One place short-termism is coming from is the fund-manager league tables. It's not good to look them up every month. If you have one eye on short-term results then naturally activities are going to be skewed towards short-term results,\" he says, adding executive remunerations are not aligned for long-term returns, and often, nor is fund manager performance.\nConstruction industry fund CBus is taking a different approach. It plans to engage more directly with listed companies.\n\"We recognise that our fund is big enough that actions can influence the market outcome,\" says CBus head of investment strategy Kristian Fok.\n\"We will try to use our size to our advantage, we will be focused on things where we can look for longer-term strategies. We have been doing that in the unlisted space for a while. Now we are looking at doing it in the listed space.\nBut in a market awash with liquidity, the Future Fund's Neal points out that managers – particularly those who deal with unlisted assets like infrastructure – aren't as quick to agree to the fund's terms as they were during the GFC. So maybe the shift in the balance of power is not all one way.\n\"It was a lot easier to negotiate on alignment and long-termism when capital was harder to come by,\" he says.\nIt's a massive debate not affects not only your super but the Australian economy. One thing is sure: whether super funds are truly committed to delivering investors long-term returns can't be measured in the short term.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T06:00:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
