Carla Gottgens by Tess Ingram The success of Atlas Iron's $180 million equity raising will be revealed to the market early this week but regardless of how much it ultimately raises, the miner's short term fate remains closely tied to iron ore prices.\nThe Pilbara miner's raising formally closed on Friday evening and, having secured commitments of $74 million as of Wednesday, is expected to fall short of its target.\nAtlas undertook the critical raising amid extreme volatility in the iron ore price, which fell from around $US60 a tonne on the day the company received shareholder approval to raise the equity, to as low as $US44.59 a tonne about half way through its efforts.\nWhile now recovered to about $US51 a tonne, the volatility is expected to have hampered investor enthusiasm for the up to 3.6 billion new Atlas shares on offer at 5¢ a share, with one free 7.5¢ option attached to each new share.\nLead manager on the raising Hartleys said on Wednesday it had secured commitments of $30 million from existing shareholders and the general public on top of around $44 million from Atlas's contractors.\nWhat the miner raises beyond this is expected to be announced on Monday or Tuesday after additional retail commitments are tallied and funds from institutional investors included.\nThe outcome of the raising will provide a strong indication of investor support for the local iron ore sector as quarterly reports released this month look set to expose the continuing strain on the cash reserves of the sector's smaller producers.\nBefore kicking off its raising, Atlas had just $58.7 million cash remaining, while fellow Pilbara junior BC Iron reported cash reserves of $107 million at the end of March and has since repaid $US30.8 million debt. BC is expected to release its June quarterly this week.\n Analysts and fund managers have questioned whether producers will find market support for attempts to restore the shrinking cash buffers needed to cover losses at lower prices.\nPlatypus Asset Management senior resources analyst Anna Kassianos told The Australian Financial Review last week investor support was unlikely to improve unless iron ore prices picked up.\n\"They are all burning through cash and so they need to do something,\" she said.\n\"Either they find support or they go under. But I just don't think sufficient levels of support will be there.\"\nAtlas managing director David Flanagan told shareholders in June the miner just needed the funds from the contractor issue to get the company back up and running, but \"every extra dollar we get that we can put in our bank is like a bullet and that builds resilience and strength in our business\".\nWhile the outcome of the raising isn't do or die for Atlas, the miner's short-term viability remains largely tied to iron ore prices, especially in regards to its ability to deal with its towering debt pile.\nThe iron ore price crashed to $US47 a tonne in early April, pushing Atlas to suspend operations at its three Pilbara mines, a move it has since reversed after striking an innovative profit sharing agreement with contractors including MACA, Qube and McAleese.\nThe miner is targeting a breakeven price, where it is neither making or losing cash, of $US50 a tonne by December. It says it is currently breaking even at an iron ore price of around $US53 a tonne.\nWhile this is substantially lower than its costs before it struck the agreement, it remains tensely close to current prices.\nMr Flanagan has said the company has the potential to remain viable for three months if prices plummeted below $US45 a tonne, a level not out of the question with a number of analysts, including from Citi, expecting the price to slump below $US40 a tonne by year's end.\nAtlas's $US269 million Term Loan B debt facility due in December 2017 also looms heavy.\n\"Atlas estimates there will be a shortfall between the amount owing at the maturity date of the Term Loan B and the forecast cash balance at that date,\" the company said in its recent prospectus.\n\"However, based on forecasts and assumptions, the directors believe the shortfall can be refinanced or rescheduled prior to the maturity date.\"\nIn it assumptions, Atlas included securing $47 million from its contractors, including BGC Contracting, but did not count on any other funds from the raising.\n\"The ability to repay the Term Loan B at maturity will improve in the event of a successful capital raising or alternative debt funding but will ultimately depend on prevailing market conditions, particularly Australian dollar iron ore prices between now and the maturity date,\" the prospectus said.\nRegardless of the success of the raising, it is clear the fight is far from over for Atlas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T04:10:00.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
