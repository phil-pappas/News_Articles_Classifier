L.P. KKR made the first move in the direction of First Data Corporation going public with the latter filing an official document with the Securities & Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for an initial public offering (“IPO”) yesterday. The Georgia-based global payment processing company, which remains one of KKR’s pre-crisis biggest buyout deals, will raise around $100 million through its first offerings.The filing stated that affiliates of KKR will continue to control a majority of the voting power of First Data’s stock after the IPO. Also, First Data will have two classes of stock with the Class A common shares and Class B shares. However, no underwriters in context to the IPO were listed in the filing.Notably, private equity firm KKR acquired First Data for $29.0 billion in 2007, in one of the world’s biggest leveraged buyout deals. Nonetheless, ever since the recession, the big payment processor has been struggling against waning consumer spending and a heavy debt burden.Despite the challenges, KKR managed to keep the company afloat with the help of a $3.5 billion equity capital infusion and leadership of the new CEO, Frank Bisignano. KKR has been improving the company’s balance sheet in anticipation of an IPO this year.Though sluggish revenue growth remains one of the major concerns for First Data, the IPO money will aid it in paying off some of its remaining debt of around $20 billion. This will provide the company, which posted a profit for the first time in the last 29 quarters this year, a cleaner slate to further rejuvenate and maintain profitability.According to the filing, First Data processed 74 billion transactions amounting to over $1.7 trillion in 2014. Also, the company, which was spun-off from American Express in 1992, generated $11.2 billion of revenue in 2014, a rise of 3.2% from the prior year.Leadership in payment technology along with extensive network consisting of millions of merchant renewals gives First Data a competitive edge in the growing payment processing industry. The company is among the new innovators involved with Apple Inc.’s AAPL Apple Pay, which is a great opportunity for the company to further strengthen its position in the industry.With focus on innovation and expertise in technology, commerce, security, operations and control, First Data can be expected to bring about a turnaround after going public, giving KKR the opportunity to cash in on its investment in the company.Though the IPO of First Data lacks the glam and glitz of the Alibaba IPO, if First Data’s growth tale post-IPO turns out impressive, it will bolster KKR’s position in comparison to private equity firms like The Blackstone Group L.P. BX and The Carlyle Group LP CG.Currently, KKR carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
