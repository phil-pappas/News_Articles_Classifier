Amit Dave Share on twitter by Angela Macdonald-Smith The ambitions of several junior explorers to capture a share of the surging demand for natural gas on the east coast may seem lofty, but buyers look to be prepared to back them in their quest.\nCentral Petroleum, Strike Energy, Cooper Energy, Senex Energy and Real Energy have all been out in the past few days talking up their prospects of tapping into the opportunity.\nWhether any will get a look-in remains highly uncertain. That's not just because of the early stage of their respective development projects, but also given a marked divergence in views on how real the much-hyped shortfall in supplies, driven by the emergence of the Queensland LNG export industry, actually is.\nEarlier this month in an assessment of the east coast market, Citigroup found that no new supplies would be required until next decade, given the Queensland LNG ventures are likely to build out their coal seam gas resources to keep their plants filled.\nContinued growth in reserves in the Cooper Basin was also likely, keeping the market well supplied until 2024, Citi found.\nBut others disagree, or at least are not willing to bank on it, as evidenced by the string of gas buyers signing up to deals that support emerging projects. Orica, Orora, Austral Bricks, Incitec Pivot and miner MMG are among those that have gone on the front foot and linked with explorers in a bid to mitigate their supply and price risk.\nScott Brown, managing director of minnow Real Energy, which signed a letter of intent in May for a deal to supply fertilisers maker Incitec Pivot, says he's aware of several industrial gas buyers with supply contracts expiring in the next 12-18 months that are having trouble locking in new contracts.\nWith some buyers paying $10 a gigajoule or more, prices for domestic gas are little affected by the slump in crude oil prices that has driven down LNG export prices, Brown says.\n In contrast to the push a few years ago for producers to link domestic supply contracts with oil prices, the outlook now is for domestic gas to be priced on its own supply-demand dynamics, with more favourable prices as a result.\n\"It won't be oil linked; it will be a straight price per gigajoule,\" Brown says.\nAn analysis released on Thursday by ANZ Bank also finds that the east coast gas market will follow its own supply-demand dynamics over the next few years, before falling more in sync with the Asian export market.\nANZ is forecasting that wholesale prices in Brisbane, for example, are likely to triple from historic levels of $3 to $4 a gigajoule to about $12 by 2018 in its most likely Scenario 1, where surging demand from LNG ventures pushes prices above international rates to encourage development of new resources.\nEven in its least likely Scenario 3, where weak LNG exports and frail local consumption result in oversupply, wholesale prices rise to $9 to $10.\nAsian LNG prices, however, which have sunk to $US7 to $US8 ($9.46 to $12.16) with the collapse in oil prices, are seen recovering only modestly, to $US8 to $US10, over the next four or five years.\nThat points to a potential scenario where Australia's Asian LNG customers are paying scarcely more for their gas than local users, despite the costs of liquefaction and shipping.\nBut in the local market it gives the juniors a prize to aim for and they are being encouraged by manufacturers, keen to see more choice of supply.\n\"At the moment if you want to buy gas in eastern Australia there are very few companies you can go to talk to about it,\" UBS analyst Nik Burns says. \"What gas buyers want is competition.\"\namacdonald-smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter: @angelamacd", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/angelamacd", "https://twitter.com/angelamacd"], "published": "2015-07-23T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:41:41.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
