The terror attack during the morning rush-hour on July 7, 2005, was the most lethal in the country’s history, killing 52 people and injuring more than 700. Events took place in London’s capital in memory of the attack, paying tribute to victims, survivors, the bereaved and those who helped in the aftermath of the explosions.\nRead on for more on the anniversary and the attacks.\nGetty Images Slide 2 of 9 George Psaradakis was driving the double-decker London bus targeted in that attack.

The bomb was set off on the top deck of the bus, blowing the roof off. Victims included people who had just been evacuated from Tube stations, as the underground attacks had happened an hour earlier, at around 8:50 a.m. local time. The explosion killed 14 and left hundreds injured.\nOn Tuesday, people making their way to work were urged to get off their Tube or bus early and walk together, to commemorate those affected.\nGetty Images Slide 4 of 9 Bombs were detonated on three London Underground trains, including this Circle Line train at Aldgate Tube station, where seven died and 171 were injured. Another went off near Edgware Road station, also on the Circle Line, with another seven dead and 163 hurt. The last explosion killed 26 and injured more than 340 on a Piccadilly Line train traveling between King’s Cross and Russell Square stations.\nGetty Images Slide 5 of 9 Gill Hicks, a survivor of the bombings, had an emotional reunion with police constable Andrew Maxwell at a multifaith religious event held Monday at King’s Cross ahead of the anniversary. Maxwell helped save her life after the 7/7 attack on the Piccadilly Line Tube train.\nGetty Images Slide 6 of 9 Bearers hold candles inscribed with the names of the bombing locations at a commemoration service at St. Paul’s Cathedral on Tuesday morning. Red, white and pink flower petals were showered down from the roof of the cathedral to remember the 52 murder victims.\nReuters Slide 7 of 9 Visitors to the Wimbledon tennis tournament stood and took part in the one-minute silence at 11.30 a.m. to mark the 10th anniversary of the suicide attacks. Buses that could safely do so halted their journeys, and announcements on the London Underground were stopped.\nGetty Images Slide 8 of 9 Britain’s prime minister, David Cameron, placed a wreath at the memorial in Hyde Park to those killed in the attacks. The memorial contains 52 metal pillars representing the dead, grouped to reflect the four locations of the bombings.\nAfter the attacks, the U.K. stepped up its counterterrorism measures, and a high number of police monitored the remembrance events on Tuesday and in the run-up to the anniversary.\n“Ten years on from the 7/7 London attacks, the threat from terrorism continues to be as real as it is deadly — the murder of 30 innocent Britons whilst holidaying in Tunisia is a brutal reminder of that fact,” Cameron said before the anniversary events, The Wall Street Journal reported
