Indeed the rules require that foreign institutional investors have a recognized investment track record and assets under management of at least 5 billion among other conditions. \nThis means that institutions deemed to be qualified to invest in the stock market possess the highest international levels of governance advanced investment practices and longer term investment horizons; characteristics which are expected to enhance the stability and institutionalization of the Saudi market. \nAs the largest market in the GCC with a total market capitalization of approximately 550 billion the Saudi stock market is drawing interest from a large number of potential foreign investors. \nAdel Al-Ghamdi CEO of the Saudi Stock Exchange commented on progress made so far: 'This is an important first step in a longer journey. Over the medium to long term this journey will benefit all our stakeholders from investors and listed companies to authorized persons and qualified foreign investors.: \nHe said: ''As the market landscape improves not only can the Saudi Stock Exchange look to take its rightful position in global markets but also act as a means to develop promote and fuel the vibrant Saudi economy and its future prospects as a whole.' \nThe CEO said: 'Saudi Arabia is home to some world-leading businesses and many that have the potential to become world leading the participation of experienced international investors can play a role in helping these businesses reach their full potential.' \nSaudi Arabia represents nearly 50 percent of the 1.6 trillion Gulf economy and is the 19th largest economy in the world. For international investors the opening of the Saudi Stock Exchange represents an opportunity to gain access to one of the largest emerging and growing market exchanges in the world. \nThe Saudi Stock Exchange is also one of the most diversified exchanges in the region with its listed companies ranging from petrochemicals and retail through to financial services construction and telecommunications providing potential investors with opportunities in a wide variety of sectors. \nFor Saudi Arabia itself increased market sophistication will contribute to economic diversification and help to further economic growth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T09:48:52.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
