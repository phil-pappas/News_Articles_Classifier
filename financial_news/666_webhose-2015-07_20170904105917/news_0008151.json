The opening of an arbitration case looks imminent,\" the source said. \"The Fund will be seeking to recoup its investment in Corporate Commercial Bank at least at book value as of the date the bank was put under special supervision.\" \nBulgaria's finance ministry declined comment beyond noting arbitration cases are regulated by complicated procedures which were strictly confidential. \nThe Omani Fund also declined comment. \nA final decision to file the claim could be taken in coming weeks and will be on the grounds that the Balkan country breached key principles for equal treatment and protection of investors in the way it handled Corpbank's collapse, the source said. \nA consortium of investors including the Omani fund had submitted proposals for rescuing Corpbank in October, but a month later the central bank stripped the lender of its licence and ended any chance of a turnaround. \nIn a recent report, a Bulgarian parliament commission accused the lender's main shareholder, Tsvetan Vassilev, of running Corpbank as a pyramid scheme under the lax supervision of the central bank and the intelligence service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T00:26:52.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
