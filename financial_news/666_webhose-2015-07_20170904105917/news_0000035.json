Under the deal, the city will not cap Uber's growth during those four months. \nThe agreement contrasts with the legislation the council was set to vote on Thursday that called for a 1 per cent cap on the California-based company's growth within the city during a year-long study. Uber has steadfastly opposed any cap, and the company and City Hall had traded increasing nasty barbs over the past week. \nBut the hostilities were set aside to announce the surprise arrangement, which also includes commitments from Uber to make more of its vehicles handicap-accessible and to turn over data to the city on the location and duration of its rides. \nCity officials said the deal was reminiscent of what the de Blasio administration offered Uber early in the negotiating process. They said a cap could still be imposed if Uber reneges on the agreement. \nA call to Uber for comment was not immediately returned. \nUber, a $US40 billion ($A53.93 billion) company, has become a dominant force on the streets of New York, dispatching 25,000 cars compared to 13,000 of the city's iconic yellow taxis. \nThe de Blasio administration had pushed for a cap, citing concern over increased congestion on Manhattan's clogged streets. When talks broke down last week, sniping between City Hall and Uber reached a frenzy with expensive TV ad campaigns that have blanketed the airwaves. \nThough most observers believe the City Council legislation would have passed, the de Blasio administration's position appeared to weaken as Uber unleashed its ad campaign, depicting the mayor as too influenced by the yellow taxi industry, which ranks among his biggest donors. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Uber strikes deal with NYC AAP \nA deal has been struck between New York City and Uber on the eve of a council vote that could have placed a cap â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T00:52:08.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
