The list recognizes the top 300 independent Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs) from across the U.S.\nThis is the second annual FT300 list, produced independently by FT in collaboration with Ignites Research, a subsidiary of FT that provides business intelligence on the investment management industry. According to FT, the list provides a quantifiable and objective way to establish a group of “truly exceptional adviser firms.”\nMore than 2,000 elite RIA firms were invited to apply for consideration. To qualify for the list, advisers had to have at least $300 million in assets under management (AUM) and be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additionally, at least 25% of the firm’s assets had to be from individual investors.\nThe firms were graded across six main criteria: AUM; AUM growth rate; years in existence; advanced industry credentials; online accessibility; and compliance records. A numeric score was then calculated for each adviser. Of those considered, 300 firms were selected for the list. There was no attempt to rank the advisers from 1 to 300—the list is presented as an “elite group of 300 RIA firms” organized by state.\nVisit FT's website for the 2015 FT300 list .\nAbout The Financial Times\nFT, one of the world’s leading business news organizations, is recognized internationally for its authority, integrity and accuracy.
