Greece has been in financial limbo since the government missed a payment to the International Monetary Fund and allowed its second rescue package to lapse on June 30.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 1.3 percent at 8:26 a.m. in London, while futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index erased a drop to rise 0.4 percent.\nThe conditions that Tsipras accepted comprised a laundry list of unfinished business from Greece’s two previous bailouts and a new demand for the government to transfer 50 billion euros of state assets to a holding company that will seek to either sell or generate cash from them. His creditors rejected Tsipras’s pleas for a cut in the nominal value of Greek debt.\nMerkel said interest-payment grace periods and longer maturities will “be discussed once there is a successful evaluation of the new Greek program.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T10:57:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
