He has emphasised that euro membership is meant to be \"irreversible\" with no legal avenue to boot a country out. \n\"This is not an mandate of rupture with Europe, but a mandate that bolsters our negotiating strength to achieve a viable deal,\" he said. \nTsipras claimed the creditors -- the ECB, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) -- would finally have to talk about restructuring the massive, 240-billion-euro ($267 billion) debt Greece owes them. \n\"This time, the debt will be on the negotiating table,\" he said. \n- Voters celebrate - \nPunching the air, kissing and cheering, the 'No' camp in Athens exulted as the news came through that voters had rejected international creditors' demands. \n\"This is a victory for the Greek people, a chance for Europe,\" said Giorgos, 25, who had rushed along with his girlfriend to join some 6,000 people celebrating their triumph. \n\"Spain, and then Portugal, should follow this path. We're for a Europe of the people,\" he said, brushing off concerns the result could see the debt-laden country plunge further into the financial mire. \n\"This is Europe's chance to become what it should have been in the beginning,\" said 37-year-old Dima Rousso. \nWhile many of those who voted 'No' were youths hit by record jobless rates, there were also elderly people in the crowds, wrapped in Greek flags and dancing in time with the victory chants. \nBut the mood of jubilation was not shared by all 'No' voters, with some saying they had been confronted with an impossible choice. \n\"A 'No' victory doesn't mean there's any more hope for Greece than before,\" said Nika Spenzes, 33 and unemployed, who was walking in the opposite direction of the party. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) 'Yes' voters were ambivalent about their camp's apparent defeat. \nParis, a 41-year-old dentist, said she was resigned rather than sad because, with the dire state of Greece's finances and Tsipras in power, there was \"no real hope either way.\" \n- On the brink - \nGreece is teetering on the brink of financial collapse. If it doesn't receive cash and loans soon from European institutions, it could still be forced to resort to government IOUs or a return to drachmas to keep its economy running. \nLast Tuesday, the country defaulted on a 1.5-billion-euro repayment to the IMF, becoming the first developed country to fall into arrears to the institution. As a result, it is cut off from further IMF financing until it settles the amount. \nThe same day, the last bailout for Greece ran out, despite Tsipras's appeals for it to be extended until the referendum was over. \nGreece was officially declared in default on Friday by the European Financial Stability Facility, which holds 144.6 billion euros ($160 billion) of Greek loans. \nGreek banks are now reportedly almost illiquid after a bank run by panicked customers in the lead-up to the referendum, which Tsipras abruptly called on June 27 to break an impasse with the creditors. \nA weeklong closure of the banks and capital controls that included restricting daily ATM withdrawals to just 60 euros ($67) and blocking money transfers abroad slowed the outflow. \nBut if the ECB doesn't inject emergency euros into Greece's banks in the next one or two days, more businesses will go belly up and ordinary Greeks will suffer. Already, there have been heartbreaking scenes of pensioners in despair at not getting access to their accounts. \nGovernment spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis said late Sunday that the Bank of Greece was asking for ECB to provide money under its Emergency Liquidity Assistance mechanism. \nReacting to the referendum outcome, analysts at Barclays Research said a Grexit was now \"the most likely scenario\", while Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) said the decisive 'No' meant the \"probability of unpredictable outcomes to the Greek crisis has again materially increased\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T04:52:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
