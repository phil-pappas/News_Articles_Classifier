Mr Arnold says there are still special term deposit rates out there but it is becoming harder to find a decent rate. \"Term deposits will always be perceived as a nice safe place to park your cash. It's just the risk return equation, the return side of it has changed over the last year.\" Term deposits are at their lowest levels in 39 months, while current deposits with banks have increased. CommSec chief economist Craig James says Australians are preferring to leave money in ordinary cheque or savings accounts with little or no return. But he notes the data for ordinary accounts includes online savings accounts, which has been competitive in terms of interest rates. \"You can get the same level of interest rates or even higher on some online accounts than what you can in terms of term deposits,\" Mr James says. \"The cash rate's at two per cent, you can get online savings accounts up to around about 3/3.5 per cent. Term deposits, well you're going to have to lock your money away for at least nine months to be able to get the same sort of returns.\" Mr James says it is a lot easier now for people, including retirees, to shop around using comparison websites. \"Those who are either embracing technology themselves or doing it through their children researching it are seeing that there are other types of accounts that you can put your money in and maximise your interest flows, and it may be an at-call account rather than a term deposit.\" Canstar commentator Justine Davies says the maximum rate available on a six-month term deposit - the most popular investment term in its database - is just 3.05 per cent, and 3.10 per cent for the next most-popular investment term of 12 months. Ms Davies says investors may want to compare their at-call options, with some bonus saver accounts on Canstar's database offering up to almost three per cent interest and some base rates up to 2.75 per cent. \"That said, our research has shown that term deposits have produced a higher average return than online savings accounts over the last two years,\" Ms Davies says.
