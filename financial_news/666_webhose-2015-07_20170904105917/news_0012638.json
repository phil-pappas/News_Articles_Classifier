That recall aimed to address issues relating to emission standards and other regulatory specifications. \nGM India said in a statement on Monday that it would recall Chevrolet Spark and Beat hatchbacks and Enjoy multi-purpose vehicles manufactured between 2007 and 2014 that are fitted with the accessory, a gadget which allows owners to open their cars without a traditional, mechanical key. \n\"The remote keyless entry accessory meets all the relevant regulatory standards; however, GM India has been made aware of some isolated cases where certain Chevrolet Spark, Beat and Enjoy vehicles were fitted with a faulty accessory,\" the company said in a statement. \nAn official at the company added that GM had found a potential wiring fault that could make the accessory malfunction and lock customers out. \nGM India has asked customers facing problems with their remote keyless entry accessory to go to their Chevrolet dealer. \n(Reporting by Aditi Shah; Editing by Christopher Cushing) \n--", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:58:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
