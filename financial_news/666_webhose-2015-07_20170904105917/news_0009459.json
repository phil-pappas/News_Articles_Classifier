At the time he said he was struggling to pay his bills and staff, and had also sold his Audi to recover some funds. \nIt is reported that company owes $1.42 million to unsecured creditors. \nMr Bowden told the Herald he was \"shocked\" the Torbay property did not sell for at least its CV price. \nEarlier this year he said he had poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into a lab in Auckland where he was working on developing synthetic highs that complied with Government regulations. \nThe 43-year-old is known for his flamboyance and musical alter-ego, Starboy. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T04:52:59.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
