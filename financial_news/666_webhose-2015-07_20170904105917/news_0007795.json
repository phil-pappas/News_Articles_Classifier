The Commercial Observer reported Ford bought the property, located between West 55 th and West 56 th streets, in 1997 for $73 million. \nDarcy Stacom and Bill Shanahan of CBRE marketed the property for Ford. They declined to comment on the deal. \nWorking on behalf of The Georgetown Co., CBRE Capital Markets Debt & Structured Finance arranged $180 million in financing for the acquisition. The 18-month, non-recourse acquisition and pre-development bridge loan was provided by JP Morgan Investment Management. The loan includes three six-month extension options and gives The Georgetown Co. and its partners time to complete redevelopment plans, according to a CBRE prepared statement. The bridge loan also offers the flexibility to prepay and refinance with a larger construction loan, according to CBRE. \nThe property, which had housed dealerships and a service center for Jaguar and Land Rover, was vacant at closing. Using the existing building, 787 11 th Ave. will be redeveloped into a Class A commercial property with office and retail space, including automotive users, CBRE noted in the prepared statement. \nJason Gaccione, Shawn Rosenthal and Michael Sherman of CBRE’s Midtown Manhattan office and Russell Schildkraut of Ackman-Ziff arranged the financing for the borrower.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T04:41:16.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
