The notable exception were the guffaws that greeted Iain Duncan Smith’s triumphant fist-pumping about the new living wage. Osborne’s best attempt at a joke came as he thanked Boris Johnson for drawing his attention to a dilapidated RAF bunker in his new constituency of Uxbridge. \n“Let its renovation stand as a monument… to the days when aeroplanes flew freely over the skies of west London.” The cost of protecting the Battle of Britain bunker will come to about £1m a bargain at twice the price to have a dig at the outgoing Mayor of London, an entrenched opponent of Heathrow. \nThe barb exposed one of the biggest absences from the Budget speech: grand pronouncements on infrastructure. After the Airports Commission’s report recommending a new runway at Heathrow, the issue is potentially explosive for the Conservatives and a stubborn problem within Mr Osborne’s Budget statements. \nBoris at an anti-Heathrow rally \nThe National Infrastructure Plan , intended to line up £375bn-worth of spending, has never lived up to its promise, as potential backers from the private sector proved elusive. While the Northern Powerhouse is banging a similar drum for ambitious planning, the spending plans so far have been modest. \nThe idea of regional Oyster-style transport cards, for years a distant footnote in Coalition Budgets, was yesterday given another airing as a Northern Powerhouse policy. Transport for the North will be started with a three-year budget of £30m which is, coincidentally, almost exactly the amount of money it takes to run Transport for London for a day. \n“In the last 25 years, France has built more than two and a half thousand miles of motorway and we’ve built just 300,” said Mr Osborne. \nThere is a Plan for Productivity due to be published on Friday, however, so there is still time for a grand plan. \n= Small businesses = \nBusinesses large and small alike should benefit from lower corporation tax, but after an election campaign trail littered with photos of candidates supporting small companies, they were curiously absent in the Budget. \nOne of the few mentions of small businesses in the Budget document was to do with improving their compliance with tax laws. Late payments to small suppliers, a major bugbear throughout supply chains was not addressed. Nor was a manifesto pledge to create 50,000 start-up loans. \nAn overhaul of tax on dividends, replacing a tax credit with a £5,000 tax-free limit, can also be seen as a slight. “This will hit directors of small limited companies particularly hard - many of them are likely to view this as a direct attack,” said Matthew Hodgson, partner at UHY Hacker Young. \n“A lot of small businesses are structured as limited companies- this means directors can opt to take rewards through dividend payments, thereby minimising personal tax liability. The new measures mean the option to make savings in this way is largely removed.” \nThe CBI also pointed out that the higher living wage could also place a greater burden on small businesses, some of whom rely on tax credits to pay their employees. \n= Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) = \nScotching hopes that he would finally set out the details of the bank’s return to private hands, Mr Osborne gave only a fleeting reference to Royal Bank of Scotland in his speech, having flagged the sale in last month’s Mansion House dinner. The Budget has pencilled in a £2bn windfall for the taxpayer from selling some of the state’s 80pc holding in the rescued bank this year, then £5.8bn in the subsequent four years. \nDespite the lack of detail, 2015-16 has been marked down as the year in which the government breaks the record for raising money through privatisations, generating £31bn from Royal Mail (LSE: RMG.L - news ) , Lloyds and other state-owned entities. \n= The Home Nations = \nWith devolution bills for Scotland and Wales winding their ways through the chambers, Mr Osborne made few new promises to the Home Nations yesterday. \n“The Scottish Government will soon have to answer the question; 'you’ve got the powers, when are you going to use them?’” he said. \n= Tobacco levy = \nIt was in both the Labour and Conservative manifestos, but the levy on tobacco companies has been shelved. A consultation had shown that a duty hike will have the same effect with less hassle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T01:13:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
