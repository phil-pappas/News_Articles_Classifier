He gained further qualifications from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Johns Hopkins University in the United States. \nWhile his intellect and international diplomacy skills are without question, some wonder whether he is able to sway support to his side on the biggest stage after failed bids for the South Korean presidency in 2002 and Seoul mayor last year. \nWhile domestically Chung has failed so far to achieve his political ambitions, his legacy as a champion of South Korean football is assured. He was instrumental in bringing the 2002 World Cup to South Korea when it won co-hosting rights with Japan. \nUnder his 17-year watch as head of the Korea Football Association (KFA), South Korea soared up the world rankings, with Chung helping turn an annual budget from $3 million to about $100 million. \nHe helped establish the Paju Training Center and hired Guus Hiddink ahead of the 2002 World Cup, watching with pride as the Dutchman steered the Koreans to fourth place on an emotional wave of home support. \nHe stood down as head of the KFA in 2009 but remains a powerful figure at the association now headed by his younger cousin, Chung Mong-gyu. \nChung describes himself as a serious football fan and keen sportsman, winning medals in national equestrian competitions. He broke his right knee playing football and his left shoulder skiing. \nThe fight for the FIFA presidency may leave him with more scars.
