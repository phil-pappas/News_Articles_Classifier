[.SS] \nNonetheless, there are fewer signs of corporate debt benefiting. Chinese companies, like retail investors, have until recently been plowing money into the stock market, leaving them exposed to the market crash. \nYields on 5-year AAA rated corporate debt have only fallen seven bps since the beginning of July, compared with double- digit falls for policy bank and LGFV debt. \n“Chinese securities companies themselves have a lot of financial asset holdings and when there is a sell-off there will be a big impact on their balance sheets,\" said Hong Kong based Kingston Lam, Hong Kong-based credit analyst with Credit Agricole. \n\"If they are using up cash to buy back shares, it will be a further negative,” said Lam. \nPERFECT STORM \nThis could be the perfect opportunity for non-investment grade issuers as high yield bonds bear the brunt of the sell-off in offshore credit markets on Wednesday. For instance, Agile Property bonds due 2020 are down 3 points at 96/97.5 cents on the dollar and the rise in yields would mean the company would have to pay a higher coupon at its next issue. \nAnd, falling on-shore yields -- particularly if the central bank intervenes more aggressively -- may encourage some issuers that traditionally tap global markets to look homewards. \nFor instance, on Tuesday Evergrande Real Estate Group (3333.HK) raised 15 billion yuan ($2.42 billion) in its second visit to the domestic bond market in less than a month. \n\"Select Chinese high-yield issuers may be able to refinance expensive offshore debt with far more affordable onshore borrowings,\" said Herman van den Wall Bake, Deutsche Bank’s Head of Fixed Income Capital Markets, Asia ex-Japan. \n\"The knock-on effect could be a drop in supply of offshore high yield bond issues. For an issuer it makes perfect corporate finance sense to replace a 12 percent coupon with a 6 percent coupon, even if the tenor is a few years shorter.\" \nSimilar announcements have also been made by China Vanke , Guangzhou R&F (2777.HK) Longfor Properties and Times Property (1233.HK) which have all declared in the past month plans to sell domestic shares. \nResurgent interest in official debt could also help with the massive pile of local government debt which Chinese provinces need to refinance this year, and which has kept yields on longer-dated Chinese treasuries elevated this year. \n(Reporting by Umesh Desai and Nathaniel Taplin; Editing by Kim Coghill)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T08:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T09:10:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
