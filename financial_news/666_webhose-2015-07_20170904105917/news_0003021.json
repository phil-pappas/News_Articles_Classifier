Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Managers who design jobs with a high level of autonomy promote a stronger sense of control among workers, new research based on Australian data has found.\nResearch by the London School of Economics and the University of Western Australia has found that an individual's sense of control over their lives, known an an internal locus of control, is not only shaped by their environment but can be enhanced.\nHowever, the utilisation of skills by employees does not enhance their sense of control, as workers can be required or coerced to use them to do their job.\nThe study's authors found that those workers with a higher internal sense of control tended to increase their job autonomy and job satisfaction over time, which, further increased their sense of control.\nThe research, which analysed data from three Household Income and Labor Dynamics In Australia surveys, was conducted by Chiahuei Wu from the London School of Economics and Mark Griffin and Sharon Parker from the University of Western Australia.\nBoosting happiness They argue the research had implications for managers about how to promote a sense of control among their employees, thus improving their attitude to work.\n``Specifically, our study suggests that designing work with high levels of job autonomy will promote a stronger sense of (of) internal locus of control among individuals, with potential positive spin off consequences for many other aspects of individuals' lives, in and outside of work,\" they found.\n Dr Wu said on Wednesday that a major concern for employers was ``whether it will pay off if higher autonomy was offered to employees\".\n``Job autonomy should not be conceptualised as an all-or-none concept but a continuous concept that can be applied to different aspects of work,\" he said.\n``For example, every job has some level of autonomy that allows employees to make decisions and use their personal initiative or judgment in carrying out the work, such as deciding what, when and how to complete work.\n``As such, rather than considering who deserves autonomy, managers can view themselves as mentors to evaluate what levels of autonomy they can increase to a specific employee based on her/his tasks and capability in exerting the granted autonomy, and apply this approach to gradually cultivate employees' sense of control along the managers' discretion.\"\nBeating the fear factor Dr Wu said that from an employees' perspective, having more autonomy was not always appreciated, \"especially when employees do not possess enough capability for discretion and when they perceive more risk in taking responsibility\".\n``To employees, enhancing sense of control can bring various positive outcomes in life such as being heather, happier and more satisfied with the life,\" he said.\n``It also makes an individual have confidence to explore new experiences in life...building a higher sense of control from work experiences can enrich their life outside of work.\n``To employers, granting autonomy at work and enhancing the sense of control of employees can make employees become proactive agents to manage complex and novel environments in the current business world.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-07-28T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:07:44.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
