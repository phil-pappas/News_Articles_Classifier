Chris Hyde Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow Queensland Treasurer Curtis Pitt said economic recovery will drive the budget back to surplus rather than new taxes or charges in Tuesday's budget.\nAs the North Queensland MP prepares to hand down his and the Palaszczuk government's first budget on Tuesday, Mr Pitt has promised a no-frills document which will deliver on Labor's election commitments but not much else.\nThere will not be increased borrowing to fund \"flashy\" infrastructure projects, according to Mr Pitt, saying the budget will need to return to surplus for that to happen. But he wouldn't say when, only it would be some time over the next four years.\n\"It's about being realistic about our commitments but actually having a government that is actually focused on jobs and growth. People expect the government to do what they say it will do,\" Mr Pitt said in an interview with The Australian Financial Review .\n\"The Liberal National Party presented the choice of either increases taxes, cutting services or selling assets. They almost never talked about growing the Queensland economy. We know that's an important element of what we will be doing.\"\nMr Pitt acknowledged the July 14 budget will be the first major test for the minority government - which critics argue will struggle to go the full three-year term - as well as himself.\n\"There is no question there is a very steep learning curve but one that I've really enjoyed,\" said the MP who only entered state parliament in 2009 following the retirement of his father and Beattie and Bligh government minister Warren Pitt.\n\"This is a great opportunity. It's better to be giving the budget speech, rather than the budget in reply speech.\"\n No 'flashy' spending Mr Pitt, who served as a minister in the last year of the Bligh government, said it will be a tough task to turn around the state's finances as the economy struggles following the end of the mining boom and persistently high unemployment.\nThis is even more the case as the Palaszczuk Labor government has already restricted the levers it can pull to attempt to turn around the state's finances, after already having ruled out any tax increases or charges as well as scrapping the former Newman government's $37 billion asset sales program.\nMr Pitt last month said the economic slowdown would wipe $3 billion off the budget bottom line.\n\"Aboslutely, it's a test,\" he said from his office at state parliament. \"But it has to be done more than on hope. We will be working closely with Treasury to look at ways to meet debt reduction and fill service shortfalls, but ensure going forward we are going to provide something for economic recovery.\"\nMr Pitt said the Palasczcuk government would not return to the blow-out in government expenses which characterised former Labor administrations. A return to an efficiency dividend is expected in next week's budget.\n\"It's absolutely critical. We will be ensuring government expenses are kept in check,\" he said.\nNo increase to debt The Treasurer said Labor would not be increasing total debt which was due to reach $80 billion by 2017-18 to fund big-ticket infrastructure programs.\n\"We said we would demonstrate fiscal discipline and that's what we said we'd do. We aren't looking to borrow. That's not what this goverment is about. We need healthy surpluses to fund capital projects,\" he said.\n\"We will be making sure we focus on the right kind of infrastructure programs to get the best use of value for taxpayer's dollars. We will be looking at the local projects in local towns rather than the big-bang flashy projects.\"\nThe winner of the multi-billion dollar Queen's Wharf integrated resort and casino project in Brisbane - the only big-ticket item left on the government's books - will be announced shortly, according to Mr Pitt, but not in next week's budget.\nWith next to no money in the kitty, the Labor government will be turning to the private sector to help develop innovative funding models to help projects in the future.\nThe Palaszczuk government looks set to escalate its fight with the federal government over infrastructure funding after being left out of the $5 billion asset recycling fund because of its position on asset sales.\nFunding will be directed to skills and training, with $750 million already announced for vocational education and training.\nTreasury review Next Tuesday, the first-time Treasurer will also be releasing another election commitment - Treasury's review of the state's finances - which he says will be looking at the \"challenges and opportunities\" facing the former boom state which has slipped back to the pack following the slump in international coal prices.\nSome critics lampooned the idea of Treasury doing a review of the state's finances when it already does that in the annual budget papers, but Mr Pitt said it would still be a useful process.\n\"It will be looking at what the challenges and opportunities are for Queensland,\" Mr Pitt said. \"When you look at those terms you need to know what's happened in the last decade - and how governments have spent their money - as well as the opportunities for new ways of doing things.\"\nMr Pitt said the hard work has been done on the budget papers - with all the crucial budget numbers locked away - and the next six days will be spent fine-tuning his budget speech and the key messages the Palaszczuk government will want voters to take from the budget.\nThere is a brief reprieve for the rugby league tragic when he attends the State of Origin decider at Lang Park in Brisbane on Wednesday night as well as quick flight home to see his wife and three kids before his government's political judgement day.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-07-08T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T04:45:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
