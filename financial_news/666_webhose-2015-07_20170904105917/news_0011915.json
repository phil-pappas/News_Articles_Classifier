The study by commercial real estate firm CBRE Group (NYSE: CBG) found 9.4 percent of the Phoenix area’s commercial and office buildings can be classified as green. The national average is 13.1 percent The numbers are little better when looking at total square footage. CBRE’s latest green building study pegs 31.4 percent of the commercial and office square footage in the Phoenix area is energy efficient and/or environmentally sustainable. That ranks the Valley 18th among 30 major U.S. cities and commercial real estate markets in a green building report by CBRE Group (NYSE: CBG). That’s up from 28 percent a year ago when Phoenix ranked 21st on the CBRE list. But the Valley has a ways to go to get to the top of list More than 70 percent of the commercial square footage in Minneapolis and San Francisco and 63 percent of the space is green, according to the report. The national average is 38.7 percent. Still, Phoenix has a higher percentage of green office and commercial square footage than San Diego, Boston, San Jose and northern New Jersey. A big challenge facing U.S. cities such as Phoenix in boosting their green and sustainable real estate are older and smaller buildings. Nationally, only 4.6 percent of buildings under 100,000 square feet are green, according to CBRE . Sprawling suburban Maricopa County has plenty of smaller and older buildings. Atlanta had the highest percentage of green buildings in the U.S. at 29 percent. The CBRE report also said real estate makes up 45 percent of U.S. energy consumption — 25 percent in residential and 20 perent in commercial space. Here’s how Phoenix compares to other U.S. cities and the nation as a whole.
