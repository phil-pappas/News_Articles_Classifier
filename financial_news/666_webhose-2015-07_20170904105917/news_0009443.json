The company plans to buy back $US2 billion ($A2.73 billion) in stock this year and another $US2 billion next year with proceeds from its spinoff of its Chemours business.\nThe Wilmington, Delaware-based company now expects 2015 adjusted earnings to total about $US3.10 per share, compared with a previous forecast for $US4 per share. Company officials said most of that decrease came from removing results from its now-separated Chemours business. Analysts had expected $US3.50 per share, according to FactSet. But a company representative noted that those estimates still include Chemours results. In the second quarter, DuPont Co. earned $US940 million, compared with $US1.07 billion in the same quarter last year. Adjusted results totalled $US1.18 per share in the most recent quarter. That came in a penny below the average expectation on Wall Street, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue fell 11 per cent to $US8.6 billion. That also missed average expectations of $US9.28 billion. Operating earnings fell 7 per cent to $US778 million for the company's agriculture segment, which was hit by lower soybean sales. Lower prices for titanium dioxide helped drop operating earnings for the company's performance chemicals segment 55 per cent to $US113 million. DuPont shares closed at $US56.73 on Monday and have decreased 23 per cent since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has stayed nearly flat. The stock has dropped 13 per cent in the last 12 months.
