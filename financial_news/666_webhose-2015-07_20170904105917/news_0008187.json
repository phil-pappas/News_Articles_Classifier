'Disclosures are the essence of capital markets. All market participants rely on disclosures provided by listed companies. Unless they get the right information at the appropriate time it would be difficult for investors to make trading decisions' H E Abdullah al Salmi told Muscat Daily.\n'Companies are required to disclose on time any development or information that has the potential to affect share prices. This helps prevent the information from being used by parties who have first-hand access to these details.'\nElaborating on what details firms need to disclose to the market H E Salmi said companies are not required to disclose business secrets rather material information which can impact their share prices. 'It is the right of investors to know what is happening with a company they have invested in. But I think we still have a long way to go on disclosures and creating awareness among listed firms and the public at large.'\nThe CMA had suspended trading in Galfar Engineering and Contracting Co shares on June 3 and had asked for additional information regarding the company's proposed settlement with Muscat Municipality relating to the Muscat Expressway and Central Corridor projects. The market regulator had also suspended Renaissance Services shares on June 25 as it sought more information regarding a contract between a Renaissance subsidiary and BP on camp facilities management at the Khazzan project.\n'It is better to suspend trading until a company provides clear information rather than to allow trading to go on with people in the dark on what basis they are trading' H E Salmi said.\n'We have to make it clear that disclosures are the sole responsibility of companies. They are obliged to disclose the information they have. Our regulations are clear on what kind of information is to be disclosed and when' the CMA chief added.\nRegarding the announcement of quarterly financial results the CMA earlier this year had made it mandatory for all listed companies to disclose initial results within 15 days of the completion of a quarter.\nOn whether firms have been complying with the new regulation H E Salmi said 'We have seen a very good response from companies and we are happy about that. They are announcing initial numbers within 15 days of the end of each quarter.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T17:16:30.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
