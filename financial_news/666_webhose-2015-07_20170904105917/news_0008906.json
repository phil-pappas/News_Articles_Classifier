It also owns major hotels overseas, including the Plaza in New York and Grosvenor House in London. \nSahara did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n(Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee and Devidutta Tripathy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:09:28.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
