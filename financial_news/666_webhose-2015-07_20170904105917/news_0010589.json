The state from January to April got 9.7 billion cedis instead of the 8.7 billion it was expecting. \nThe good revenue numbers was influenced by strong collections from domestic taxes on goods and services, VAT, income and property. \nAccording to the revised estimates for 2015, government is hoping to spend about 37.6 billion cedis, while on the revenue side it is hoping to mobilize 29.7 billion cedis. \nClick here for CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS - 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T15:31:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
