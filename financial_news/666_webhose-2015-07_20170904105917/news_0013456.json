James Morgan by Jamie Freed Qantas long-haul pilots have overwhelmingly agreed to a crucial enterprise bargaining agreement that will help clear the way for the airline to place a major order of Boeing 787-9 aircraft later this year.\nThe Australian and International Pilots association said 82 per cent of members had voted in favour of the deal, with 87.5 per cent of the membership base participating in the vote, which includes an 18-month wage freeze in line with other recent Qantas employee deals.\n\"This [agreement] satisfies a business case for Qantas International to consider purchasing 787s in the very near future, with a possible entry into service as early as 2017,\" AIPA president Nathan Safe said. \"It shows the company and the pilots are capable of working together for a long-term plan.\"\nQantas chief pilot Dick Tobiano said the deal was \"good news for the business\" as well as the pilots. The agreement includes productivity gains for the airline from changes to rostering.\nQantas has options over 20 guaranteed delivery slots and purchase rights covering another 30 aircraft, with the option due for exercise later this year for a delivery slot in 2017. There has been speculation the order could be placed alongside its full-year results on August 20. However, sources said that was unlikely given the deadline to exercise the first option did not occur until later in the year and the airline wanted the maximum amount of time to analyse market conditions and route economics.\nQantas has been preparing for the 787-9 order for months. In January, The Australian Financial Review reported an internal team had prepared a robust business case for exercising its options and purchase rights over the long-range, twin-engine aircraft type. They are a longer version of the 787-8s operated by Qantas's low-cost arm, Jetstar.\nHowever, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce has said the carrier would need to sign an agreement with long-haul pilots that allowed the aircraft to operate economically as one of three preconditions before the planes could be ordered. The other conditions including the international division exceeding its cost of capital and Qantas reducing its debt burden by $1 billion in the financial year to June 30.\nDebt reduction achievement The first condition was met in the first half of the financial year, and Citi analyst Anthony Moulder said he believed Qantas's decision this month to pay $90 million in bonuses to staff meant the planned $1 billion debt reduction had been achieved according to plan.\n\"I think there will be a place for the 787 come the end of 2017,\" he said. \"It allows them to look at what port or ports they need to fly into Asia. Asia is still not as well served by Qantas International.\"\nQantas is already looking at the potential to deploy its A330-200 fleet on international routes after cancelling one daily return Melbourne-Perth flight and downgrading six weekly Sydney-Perth flights to smaller 737s from October. Some of the capacity will be redeployed on the Sydney-Brisbane route but given the range of the A330s, more Asian flights could also be on the cards.\nQantas International chief executive Gareth Evans in June said any new aircraft would be used to both replace ageing 747 aircraft and provide growth for the international division . The airline has yet to reveal the potential interior configuration, such as the classes available, the number of seats and whether it will offer 8-abreast seating in economy or the more squeezed 9-abreast configuration offered on Jetstar's 787-8s.\nThe long-haul pilots deal is the 18th deal signed by a Qantas employee group that included an 18-month wage freeze. The formal approval process will commence before the Fair Work Commission with an expected start in mid-August.\nMore than three quarters of Sunstate pilots, who fly for regional operator QantasLink, on Wednesday approved an enterprise bargaining agreement including the 18-month wage freeze. The deal covers about 240 pilots.\nHowever, Qantas Domestic flight attendants have recently rejected two separate EBAs. Flight Attendants Association of Australia national secretary Jo-Ann Davidson said the union did not believe the rejections were a result of the 18-month pay freeze, but instead involved discontent over other factors of the deal. The deal rejected last week involved more than 1600 flight attendants.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/aviation/qantas-international-still-on-upward-trajectory-says-head-gareth-evans-20150608-ghioql.html"], "published": "2015-07-30T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:11:02.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
