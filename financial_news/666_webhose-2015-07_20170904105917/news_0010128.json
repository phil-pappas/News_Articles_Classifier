The apex court bench headed by Chief Justice H.L. Dattu issued notice on a plea by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) that had sought the political parties must be exposed to public scrutiny under the RTI as they play an important role in the affairs of the country. Appearing for the ADR, counsel Prashant Bhushan told the court that political parties play an important role in the formation of government, taking political decisions, including enactment of laws, having far-reaching bearing on the society and the country. He said political parties get state funding by way of tax exemptions on their funds which they get from various sources. Bhushan said the political parties should disclose the source of their funding, including those making contributions up to Rs.20,000, which under the present system they are not compelled to disclose and forms a major part of their funding.
