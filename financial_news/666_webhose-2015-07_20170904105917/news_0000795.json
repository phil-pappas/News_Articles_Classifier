Last year, the firm paid KPMG £9.1m in fees, including £3.2m for non-audit work. \n“We thank KPMG for their strong contribution as the company's auditors over many years and for the current year,” said Peter Smith, chairman of the audit committee. \nAuditors expect more than 20 FTSE 100 companies to announce a new auditor this year, beating last year’s tally of 14. Sainsbury’s, Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) and Barclays (Swiss: BARC.SW - news ) are among the blue chips who have switched providers in 2015, reacting to UK reforms requiring a tender every 10 years, and forthcoming EU rules forcing a rotation to a new auditor once a decade. \nThe FTSE 100 still prefers the 'big four' auditors \nFor the most complex global firms, such as the big banks, the lead time for an audit award can stretch to 18 months, including time to reshuffle advisers in other areas such as tax and transactions to ensure there are no conflicts of interest with the auditor. \n“New EU audit reforms have increased the number of audits that are coming up for tender, while our global scale, innovative approach to the audit, and deep sector insights ensure that we are well-positioned to serve these companies,” said Hywel Ball, head of audit at EY. \nThe overhauls are supposed to inject more competition into the audit market and disrupt long-standing relationships that the reformers say risk complacency. \nHowever, since the reforms began to roll out in 2012, no FTSE 100 company has switched to a company other than EY, KPMG, Deloitte and PwC. Only Randgold Resources, which has used BDO since 2007, and Sports Direct, which uses Grant Thornton, take their audit services from outside of the Big Four. A number of big firms employ smaller accountancy groups to carry out non-audit work. \nInterserve (LSE: IRV.L - news ) , the FTSE 250 outsourcing company, last year said it would switch to Grant Thornton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T17:05:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
