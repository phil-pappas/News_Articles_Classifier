PUBLISHED: 12:27, Wed, Jul 1, 2015 | UPDATED: 14:38, Wed, Jul 1, 2015 REUTERS Grexit the drink is expected to be on sale soon \nOn a label mock-up a miserable-looking German Chancellor Angela Merkel cartoon looks scornfully on the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsiras and his comrade in power Finance Minister Yannis Varoufakis. Off the back of bittersweet relations between the German and Greek leaders, entrepreneur Uwe Dahlhoff said he hopes to find a market for the tipple. In a pop at the sparring leaders of the eurozone debt crisis, the schnapps will soon be on sale from a debt-busting price of 59 euro cents. It comes as relations between Greece and Germany reach an all-time low and ahead of an anticipated Greek exit - 'Grexit' - from the eurozone. REUTERS German entrepeneur Uwe Dahlhoff with bottles of \"Grexit\" vodka \nThe label's slogan can also be translated to the English equivalent of \"When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.\"But Mr Dahlhoff from Hamm, Western German said that the launch of the drink is not designed to cause offence. He said: \"The discussion around the Grexit is obviously very serious. But I would like to keep out of it politically, I can't say anything much about it.\"All I can say is that bringing the product out as a satire is supposed to make people think twice about it all, or to think about it all at all, and to look at how serious the situation really is.\"Initially the drink is expected to be sold only in Germany, but the Mr Dahlhoff said that if he can find a distributor in Greece he would like to expand.He added: \"Lots of people understand than it is supposed to be satirical but naturally there are people who can't take a joke.\" On Sunday Greece is to vote in a historic referendum that will affect its future in the euro. Polls suggest that more Greeks will vote against an EU-backed austerity package in a move that is likely to see it booted out of the union.
