With our complete readiness to launch MNP, we aim to empower customers to retain this identity as they move anywhere in the country,\" said Ajai Puri, director, market operations, Bharti Airtel. \n\"To facilitate a seamless transition, we will also allow our customers to enjoy free incoming on roaming while their number portability request is being processed,\" he added. \n\"MNP service allows the customers to carry their existing numbers across India and also choose the operators of their choice. Vodafone has benefited from the intra-circle MNP rolled out in 2011. We look forward to a similar response this time,\" Vivek Mathur, chief commercial officer, Vodafone India, said. \nVodafone India has a pan-India base of over 184 million customers serviced through a network of more than 130,000 sites, of which over 35,000 are 3G sites. \n\"RCOM (Reliance Communications) is ready to roll out mobile number portability nationally from July 3, 2015 onwards, and this will allow our customers to retain their mobile numbers in any part of the country and continue to enjoy our best-in-class network and services,\" a Reliance Communications spokesperson said. \n\"Reliance Communications will also be offering attractive and aggressive plans for both its pre-paid and post-paid customers, as well as customers porting in from other networks, to ensure that this is a seamless and easy transition,\" the spokesperson added. \nSimilarly, MTS India said the company was fully geared up to comply with the deadline. \n\"The move will enable MTS India to quickly and efficiently process all number portability requests. The implementation of MNP is bound to set new benchmarks in customer service standards within the Indian telecom sector,\" an MTS India spokesperson said. \nIdea Cellular claimed it was the MNP leader with over 14 million net gain of customers so far, through intra-circle MNP services. \n\"As a result of Idea's growing network presence, focus on customer-centricity, and a strong brand-connect with the audience, our MNP leadership has grown consistently ever since our services were launched in 2011,\" said Sashi Shankar, chief marketing officer, Idea Cellular. \n\"We are confident that the strong brand stickiness and growing preference will continue to benefit us as we now extend this service on a pan-India basis, enabling users switching cities to retain their numbers,\" he added. \nIANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T18:18:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
