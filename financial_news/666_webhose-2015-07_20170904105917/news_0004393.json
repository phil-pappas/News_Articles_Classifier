Spanish 10-year bonds rose for a seventh day, the longest run of gains since August, as traders looked beyond political turmoil in Greece.\n“The key explanatory factor is really the huge reinvestment needs of investors this month,” said Michael Leister, a senior rates strategist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “In July we have more than 100 billion euros in redemptions and coupon payments and these will have to be recycled. With market liquidity still being a bit patchy, the price impact of this recycling seems to be stronger than usual.”\nItaly’s 10-year bond yield fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage points, to 1.99 percent at 11:20 a.m. London time. The 1.5 percent security due in June 2025 climbed 0.675, or 6.75 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 95.725.\nSpanish 10-year yields fell eight basis points to 2.01 percent, adding to a 28 basis-point decline over the previous six days.\nThe average yield on euro-area sovereign securities declined to the lowest since June 4 on Tuesday as investors sought new homes for their cash. The yield was at 0.97 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show, after touching its 2015 high of 1.08 percent as recently as June 15.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T14:05:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
