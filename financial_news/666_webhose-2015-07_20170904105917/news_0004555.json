The first was in 2011, when MV Maersk Cape Coast was christened after the famous and historical Ghanaian city. \nMaersk Line is the leading shipping line in Ghana with more than 20 years of experience. The Line's global network has more than 500 ships, 46,000 ports of call and representation in more than 125 countries. \nThe carrier currently operates two fixed weekly services into and out of Tema from the Far East, Middle East, Europe, Africa and the America's. The carrier also has a fortnightly service into and out of Takoradi. \nMaersk Line has the widest coverage in the market with offices in Tema, Takoradi and Kumasi. The Line's goal is to help Ghanaian business grow by exploiting the opportunities global trade has to offer. \nThe gesture is to show the carrier's long term commitment and to facilitate the economic growth and development of the country through global trade. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T04:51:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
