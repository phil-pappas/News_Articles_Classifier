Virginia Star Share on twitter by Misa Han Interactive | Explore the Law Partnership Survey database The clock still ticks in six-minute intervals for six to seven hours a day in the legal profession as clients cling onto the hourly rate model, triggering mental health concerns in the legal profession.\nIn the June AFR Law Partnership Survey, most law firms had billable targets of between six and seven hours. Clayton Utz, King & Wood Mallesons, Gilbert + Tobin and Baker & McKenzie all have a seven billable hour target, while Lander & Rogers, Maddocks, M+K Lawyers and Mills Oakley Lawyers have 6.5 hours. Some firms have reduced target hours for partners, special counsels and graduates.\nOnly Johnson Winter & Slattery said they did not have a billable hour target.\nMany law firms offer alternative fee arrangements including fixed fees, retainers, volume discounts, all-you-can-eat arrangements, volume discounts, secondments and legal outsourcing. Clients are moving away from the hourly billing model to these alternative options. Allens' survey of ASX100 companies, banks and government agencies found only 59 per cent of corporate clients spent the vast majority of their legal budget on hourly billing in 2013, down from 77 per cent in 2010 .\nMany clients prefer traditional billing But law firms say clients still prefer the transparency of six-minute intervals.\nKing & Wood Mallesons managing partner in Australia Sue Kench said the firm adopts a range of modernised billing methods, but it has not spelled the death knell of hourly billing or the dreaded six-minute timesheets for lawyers.\n \"Some clients actually still like the hourly rate model,\" Ms Kench said.\n\"It's a case of having a diversified book. Even if you provide that price certainty externally you still need to manage that cost internally.\"\nHerbert Smith Freehills said while it provides a range of alternative fee options, clients still preferred the traditional billing model.\n\"We do still find that a significant number of our clients are most comfortable with traditional fee arrangements,\" the firm said in the partnership survey.\nLander & Rogers agreed: \"We have wholeheartedly embraced the structuring of different pricing models after listening to the feedback from our major commercial clients,\" the firm said in the survey. \"It is notable however, that many commercial clients still enjoy the transparency of hourly rate pricing.\"\nTargets cause stress The prevalence of billable hours in the legal profession has caused mental health concerns.\nBernadette Healy, counsellor for the Victorian Bar, says while billable hours were not a problem for all lawyers, having many such hours could be unsustainable in the long run, particularly if the work was done in isolation.\n\"When you get to a situation where a high proportion of the day is billable, of course that is quite extreme. It's not sustainable for most people to work in this way without some quite large cost. It's not reasonable to expect people to cope with the kind of pressure they're under for indefinite periods of time.\n\"Isolation is a risk factor as well. If they have to do a large proportion of billable hours completely alone that can be stressful.\"\nPsychologist Dr Peter Cotton said billable targets could be stressful, particularly for young lawyers, and it could be a contributing factor in anxiety and depression.\n\"Historically it was a significant stressor affecting often young lawyers moving into private practice. People worry about meeting their targets.\n\"It can affect some people more than others, for example people who are very perfectionist and who are reluctant to admit or recognise they may be struggling.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan"], "published": "2015-07-02T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:06:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
