Nic Walker by Bani McSpedden First, a little history. Breitling can trace its beginnings to 1884 , but in 1979 the eponymous founders found themselves in a bind. They'd jettisoned employees and were on the verge of bankruptcy, their business another victim of the oxygen-stealing arrival of quartz watches. Industrious, innovative, they were five years short of lasting a century. Enter the Schneider family headed by Ernest Schneider, an engineer, soldier and pilot who had inherited a small watchmaking firm from his father-in-law. He purchased Breitling and set about applying his knowledge of electronics to the business. In doing so he guided it to impressive heights, literally, cementing its niche as watch supplier to the aeronautics industry. He remained chairman of the company until his passing in May this year, but the company remains firmly in family hands under Ernest's son, Theodore, who's effectively been at the helm for two decades now.\nWhich brings us to the present day and the new man in Australia, Mathieu Brunisholz. The connection? The 36-year-old is Ernest's grandson and Theodore's nephew. Here since February, Brunisholz has been unusually busy, not only at his desk, bringing distribution in-house for starters, but also on the family front. That's meant settling in with his wife and three boys, a five-year-old and three-year-old twins. He's even found time to tackle the waves.\nHe talked to Bani McSpedden about how he came to be here.\nWhat brought you into the watch business?\nMy grandfather bought Breitling in the year I was born. They were in a bad way. I've been involved from then, really – there was always discussion about Breitling, it was the family business. My uncle took over in 1995, officially in 1998. I always had a strong relationship with him and I spent a lot of time with him. I would be working in the factory in summer from when I was 11 or 12, well not really working, pretend working, in the shipping department, different things. I liked being with my uncle, being part of this big Breitling family. I would stay in my uncle's house and go with him to the office.\nIt was clear from the beginning I wanted to join the family business, so I did business school, then an internship with Bentley motor cars in England, then with a Swiss bank. My first job back with Breitling was in accounts, setting up a new software system. Then in 2004 I became involved in marketing and merchandising. I was developing material with designers and suppliers, and by 2010 working on the boutique concept with a team of five or six people. Today we have 40 boutiques around the world.\nAnd now you're here. How did that happen?\nI got married, had three kids, and I wanted to do something different. I was in charge of a couple of different things – the Indian market, some things in the factory, presentations, training. But I was not spending enough time with the family, so I had a break, six months working from home, a bit more quiet. Then I had a discussion with my uncle about getting more experience about the markets we were in. I knew Breitling very well from the inside, in Switzerland, but I wanted to understand if we were doing things in the right way in other markets. There were a few opportunities, India for example, but it wasn't appealing from the family point of view - highly polluted cities and a very different culture. Then we had a challenge in Australia where we wanted to take over distribution and establish a subsidiary. So I talked to my uncle about it and thought it was a great opportunity; I just jumped on it!\n Why Australia - had you visited here before?\nI'd visited twice when working on our visual communications. It's such a nice place and the business challenge was interesting. I wanted to be more involved in finance and managing the staff. It's a great job, my best job ever in Breitling. I'm doing everything from marketing to accounting – with a great staff, but supervising; it's like having your own business. I've got trust from Switzerland so I can do a lot of things here. Obviously they want to know what's going on, but I know them, they know me…\nWe strongly believe this is an important market. Australian people appreciate our values, strong watches, sporty watches you can very easily wear. One of our strongest values is to be a welcoming brand, open to everyone. We're not a posh, luxury, arrogant brand that thinks it's superior to the customer. That's why our visual presentation is colourful, open. There's a bright future here. I really like the country and I think Sydney is a fantastic place. Apart from the business side of it, the lifestyle and personal appeal is very big, a lovely place to live, one of the nicest cities in the world.\nHow do you see the watch market here?\nThe interesting thing about Australia is that it's in the middle of nowhere. Your closest neighbour is Asia, but you aren't like those countries. And you're not like Europe in terms of watch knowledge. But the Asian population here is very educated about watches. Breitling is not strong in Asia, but we're doing very well with Asians here. Australia's not a market where everyone just goes for the same thing like in China where they all want a Rolex or an Omega. Here you're buying the watch that suits you, rather than the one to impress others.\nOn a personal level how have you found your move?\nThe big difference here is the weather. In Switzerland there are so many days where you cannot be outside. For my family it's been great. I've been enjoying the sea, the beach; the kids do body boarding, swim, and I'm learning surfing. It's very Australian, something you have to do – or try at least. I love the connection with the sea. We do a lot on the weekends – I've introduced them to tennis, bicycling, football, and they are learning a third language, English. I've never actually lived in a big city, but in tiny cities like Grenchen that are boring. It's very different. There are not many countries as appealing to me as Australia; I will be here a minimum of four years.", "external_links": ["https://www.breitling.com/en/since1884/"], "published": "2015-07-25T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T10:04:24.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
