The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen was off 0.7pc, while the Shanghai Composite slipped 1pc. \nSentiment has been soothed a little by pledges from Chinese regulators to buy shares to stabilise stocks if needed and hints of more policy easing from the central bank. \nOn Monday, the FTSE 100 closed more than 60 points below where it finished last year (Paul Grover) \nThe steadier tone was enough to lift Australia's main index 0.9pc, while MSCI (NYSE: MSCI - news ) 's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.4pc. \nJapan's Nikkei eased 0.3pc, hit by sharp falls in Fanuc Corp and Tokyo Electron. \nOn Wall Street, the Dow had ended on Tuesday with gains of 1.09pc, while the S&P 500 rose 1.24pc and the Nasdaq 0.98pc. \nNot faring so well was Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) , which sank 11pc in extended trade after the microblogging company said its monthly average users grew at the slowest pace since it went public in 2013. \nFed decision \nThe Fed ends a two-day policy meeting later on Wednesday with markets divided on whether it will take a hawkish or dovish stance, while some suspect it might chose to do neither. No move on rates is expected this week. \nIn recent congressional testimony, Fed chair Janet Yellen neither ruled out a September hike nor guided the market toward thinking it was a done deal. \n\"We think the upcoming FOMC statement will reflect this non-committal approach,\" said Tom Porcelli, chief US economist at RBC Capital Markets. \n\"In other words, there will be no explicit tweak to the guidance signalling a hike is imminent.\" \nAt most, the Fed might sound a little more positive on the economy and describe risks to the outlook as balanced rather than \"nearly\" balanced, Porcelli added. \nIn currency markets, investors seemed to decide it was safer not to be actively short of the US dollar ahead of the policy statement at 19:00 BST. \nThat kept the dollar steady at 123.45 yen, from a low of 123.04 on Tuesday, while the euro softened to $1.1052. \nAgainst a basket of currencies, the dollar was off 0.1pc at 96.716. \nIn energy markets, oil prices were subdued ahead of official data on US stockpiles. \nBrent futures were down 24 cents at $53.06 a barrel and near their lowest since February. US crude futures slipped 22 cents to $47.76 a barrel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T10:50:48.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
