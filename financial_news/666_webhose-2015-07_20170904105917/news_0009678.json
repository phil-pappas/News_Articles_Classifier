One of the unsuccessful bidders was vying for the property on behalf of the club.\nAuctioneer Rob Trovato of Auction Services said the final result was “crazy” with bidding beginning at $950,000 and then coming think and fast.\n“My poor scribe was running out of paper there were that many bids,” he said.\n“But the buyer actually came in really late around the $2.72 million mark,” Mr Trovato said.\nZoned R4 for high-density development, Mr Eltakchi of LJ Hooker Granville/Guildford said the vast possibilities for redevelopment fuelled the bidding fire.\n“Even at that high price they still could see some cream in it for them. Obviously all these developers see something in it that maybe the rest of us didn’t,” he said.\nMr Trovato added that the sale was an example of “land banking” — a phenomenon that is growing in suburban Sydney.\n“These developers just buy and wait for the neighbours to sell so they can build something more substantial,” he said.\n“Although that Williams St block is big enough to allow multidensity redevelopment, the 15m frontage doesn’t,” he said.\nAuctioneer Rob Trovato taking bids at 33 William Stt, Granville.

This changes everything,” he said.\nOriginally published as Home smashes reserve by $1.53m ", "external_links": ["http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/granville-home-smashes-the-reserve-price-by-153-million/story-fnd91nhy-1227456584460?sv=97b163be726e9df581cec0db92952dd5&title=Home+smashes+reserve+by+%241.53m", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/granville-home-smashes-the-reserve-price-by-153-million/story-fnd91nhy-1227456584460?sv=97b163be726e9df581cec0db92952dd5", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/granville-home-smashes-the-reserve-price-by-153-million/story-fnd91nhy-1227456584460?sv=97b163be726e9df581cec0db92952dd5&title=Home+smashes+reserve+by+%241.53m", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/granville-home-smashes-the-reserve-price-by-153-million/story-fnd91nhy-1227456584460?sv=97b163be726e9df581cec0db92952dd5&h=Home+smashes+reserve+by+%241.53m", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Home+smashes+reserve+by+%241.53m&c=A+keen+developer+has+paid+a+huge+%242.781+million+under+the+hammer+for+a+humble+home+in+Granville+%26%238212%3B+just+to+knock+it+down.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/granville-home-smashes-the-reserve-price-by-153-million/story-fnd91nhy-1227456584460?sv=97b163be726e9df581cec0db92952dd5", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/realestate/news/granville-home-smashes-the-reserve-price-by-153-million/story-fni0cly6-1227456584460", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/granville-home-smashes-the-reserve-price-by-153-million/story-fnd91nhy-1227456584460?sv=97b163be726e9df581cec0db92952dd5"], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T15:03:11.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
