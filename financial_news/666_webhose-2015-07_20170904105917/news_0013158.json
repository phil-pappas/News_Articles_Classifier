The cap will be reduced to 23,000 pounds for those in London, in line with pre-election promises, but he did not set out the lower ceiling that would apply elsewhere.\nHe said those on high incomes in subsidised local authority housing would have to start paying closer to the market rental rates.\nThe Sunday Times reported that Osborne plans to launch a £650 million raid on the BBC to help cover the country’s benefits bill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T14:42:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
