It had similar trials before, but this time something is different. \nThere were never so many investors using borrowed money to trade, and whether they will be able to withstand continued depreciation in the value of their investment will determine the trend of the market in the next few days. \nOver the past two weeks, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has fallen by about 20 percent from a seven-year high of 5,178 points on June 12. It fell again by 3.34 percent on June 29, closing at 4,053 points, despite a cut to banks' reserve-requirement ratio and interest rates on June 28. \nBehind the seemingly unstoppable decline is a vicious circle set in motion by an unprecedented surge in leveraged buys since November. On June 18, the amount of margin trading and short-selling, the latter accounting for only a tiny fraction of the total, reached 2.27 trillion yuan – the highest level since these forms of trading were permitted in 2010. \nThe problem with margin trading is that investors could be forced to empty their holdings if the share price of a stock falls and the part of money they borrowed for an investment is at risk. This kind of selloff may cause the share price to slip further, triggering sales by other investors who must act to protect the money they borrowed. \nThe securities regulator is well aware of the risk. Since April, it has repeatedly required brokerage firms to tighten requirements on margin trading. The results of several stress tests show that securities firms in general have their margin trading business under control. \nThere is less certainty in the huge amount of leveraged purchases that took place largely outside the regulator's gaze. Conservative estimates put the amount of leveraged buys through mostly trust and investment companies at roughly 2 trillion yuan, on par with the level of margin trading through brokerage firms, but the risk they bring is much greater because investors tend to borrow more and buy stocks whose prices fluctuate wider. \nBorrowing through these non-official channels for stock investments was not invented last year, but it certainly looks different this time because of the extensive involvement of capital from banks' wealth management programs. \nBy the end of 2014, many commercial lenders, including China Everbright Bank, China Minsheng Bank and China Merchants Bank, had invested client money in \"umbrella trusts,\" which allow stock investors to use money that is not in their own account. Even some insurance companies have lent through these arrangements to stock investors. Improved trading and investment management computer systems made it easier to pair borrowers with lenders quickly and anonymously. \nA regulation that prohibits banks from buying stocks has been ignored, though ostensibly it was not violated because these umbrella trusts were used. \nExperts have called on the banking regulator to plug the hole and cut off the flow of bank deposits to the stock market, but one banker said this will not work. \n\"Money is like water and water flows from high ground to lower land,\" he said. \"As long as the market condition has not been fundamentally reversed, banks' capital will flow to the stock market through various channels. I don't think the banking regulator could stop it just because it wanted to.\" \nThis may well be true, but critics say the market could have avoided such drastic fluctuations if the regulators had acted sooner. \nThe incentive for securities firms to facilitate or turn a blind eye to investors' borrowing from outside lenders is obvious: it boosts their transactions and thus commission income, and is not limited by the firm's own capital. This explains why many securities firms responded slowly when the regulator said they must stop aiding outside investor-lender matches. To enforce its requirement, in late May the regulator told all brokers to shut down a digital service widely used by umbrella trusts. \nAn executive of a securities firm said the crackdown affected the firm's legitimate clients as well, and he said it would not have been required if the regulator had taken the problem more seriously late last year when the market was beginning to roar. \nCritics also blame the fragmented structure of financial regulations. The banking regulator, for example, cares less about banks channeling wealth management capital into the stock market because it was not as much of a risk to a bank's balance sheet as to the stability of the stock market. It has not taken any substantive actions to control the risk. \n\"Some leverage in stock investment is reasonable,\" a fund manager said. \"The problem we have is too much aggressive borrowing and not enough monitoring and clear regulation. \n\"The regulators might as well just lift all restrictions and allow various institutions to conduct margin trading operations, so they could all take place within their sight.\" \n(Rewritten by Wang Yuqian) Closer Look: Margin Trading Is New Wrinkle for Wobbly Bourse The A-share market has been tested before, but this time heavy borrowing ignored by regulators for too long is complicating matters By staff reporter Jiang Fei SHARE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T15:09:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
