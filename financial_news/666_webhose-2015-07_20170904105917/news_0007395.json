After years of saving he recently got a foothold on the property ladder. But his £160,000 two-bed flat is not in the capital, where he works as a conference manager, and he doesn’t get to live in it.\n“I wanted to buy a flat in London as I have lived here my whole life but, even with my parents help, I just can’t afford to,” he says.\nInstead, he bought his first property with a buy-to-let mortgage in Nottingham.\nHotwani is is one of a growing breed of amateur investors who have driven the huge boom in the buy-to-let sector in recent times for reasons that are not always conventional.\nIn the 10 years from 2005 the number of outstanding buy-to-let mortgages as a percentage of the whole mortgage market has almost doubled from 7.7% to 15% now.\nRelated: Osborne drops tax bombshell that will wipe out bulk of buy-to-let profits\nAmong this army, the proportion of part-time or “amateur” landlords – those who supplement their day job with rental income – has reached its highest-ever level according to recent figures from the National Landlord Association. It says that part-time landlords make up more than 70% of the sector.\n“In recent times a number of portfolio landlords have become locked out of the market as lenders have restricted the number of properties they will lend on,” says Brian Murphy of Mortgage Advice Bureau. “In addition, for those new landlord borrowers, or those termed ‘amateur landlords’, who have perhaps two or three properties in the sector, is at its best since the onset of the financial crisis, with lower interest rates, higher loan-to values and ever more lenders providing choice.”\nAnd – despite an unexpected crackdown from the chancellor in last month’s budget that means some landlords will, from next April, start losing a major tax break on their rental income – the number of landlords looks likely to grow further.\nBy 2025 more than half of people under 40 will be living in properties owned by private landlords , according to a report from economists at the accountancy firm PwC last week.\nIn 10 years, PwC predicts that 7.2m households will be in rented accommodation, compared with 5.4m today and just 2.3m in 2001. And while mortgage rules surrounding residential mortgages were tightened materially last year, meaning that borrowers can now be subject to an in-depth two-hour interview about their finances before they can get a home loan, the same cannot be said of buy-to-let.\nThe relative ease of getting a loan has inspired many to give property investment a go. We spoke to some of the newer investors and asked them about their motivations.\nTo get on the housing ladder In a move Shivi Hotwani never expected to make in his ​20s, he became a landlord and says the reason is because he couldn’t afford to buy anywhere to live in himself.\nHe had a decent deposit and looked at lots of new-builds in “up and coming areas” but found that, within such developments, most of the stock had been sold to overseas investors and what was left “wasn’t great”.\nInstead he turned to Nottingham, where he had visited friends who were at university there in the past.\nI'd like to buy to live, but I feel no one is helping me achieve that – so I’m doing what I need to get on the ladder\nShiv Hotwani “I wanted to get somewhere with a big student population so that tenants would be easy to find,” he says. “I don’t make a lot of money but I knew that when I set out. I want it as a long-term investment.”\nIt is not easy to get a buy-to let mortgage if you don’t already own a residential property – only a handful of lenders will consider one on this basis. Hotwani went to brokers London & Country and got a 75% LTV two-year-fix through the Clydesdale.\n“I would still like to buy to live in London but I feel like no one is helping me to achieve that aim, so I’m doing what I need to do to get on the property ladder,” he says.\nTo help children on to the housing ladder Rod Smith, 67, is a retired GP from Reading, Berkshire. Last year he invested in a flat in Highbury, north London, with his son to give him both an investment and a place to live.\n“He works in the City in insurance but it is impossible for him to afford to buy,” he says.\nThis year he bought a three-bed semi-detached in Reading with his daughter.\n“I wanted to get her started,” he explains. “I have owned buy-to-lets in the past and have always found that, as an investment, it has worked well.”\nDr Smith funded his latest property investment using the money from a remortgage on his own home. Because of his age, most lenders would not advance him the money but the Ipswich building society decided he was a low-risk borrower and agreed.\nTo beat the interest rate on savings Katie Vincent, a social media manager, bought her first property to live in, in a small rural village in County Durham in 2006 with her husband Paul.\nKatie Vincent: beating the savings rate Eight years later they wanted a bigger place but switched their attentions to buy-to-let because of a lack of suitable properties on the market.\n“After a lengthy search and a few false starts we realised our ideal home just wasn’t out there,” says Vincent. “With the money sitting in the bank earning next to nothing, we decided to use the money towards a buy-to-let property so that we wouldn’t be tempted to dip in to the cash.”\nThe couple have just completed on a sizeable two-bedroom terrace in Stanley, Co Durham, and believe it will be easy to rent out as the numbers of people locked out of the property market grows.\n“Having previously seen these houses on the market for around £30,000 more than they are now, we felt it was a good time to buy,” she says. “If the struggle for first-time buyers continues, rental properties like ours will be in higher demand.”\nMatthews describes the process of getting a buy-to-let mortgage as “effortless and pain free”, a sentiment that reflects the experience of many borrowers in the market.\nTo supplement a pension Some commentators expect the buy-to-let market to be fuelled further over the months ahead thanks to the pension freedoms that were introduced in April. These allow anyone over 55 to access their full pension pot for the first time if they want to.\nNumerous surveys of over-55s have suggested that many have an interest in investing some of this pension money in property, although the Bank of England said recently that most pensioners would find it difficult to obtain a buy-to-let mortgage.\nSmall business owner Stephen Slade, who is in his mid-50s, recently accessed some of his pension money to invest in his third property in Middlesex.\n“Most people won’t retire with a decent private pension these days,” says Slade, who is a client of Devonshire Wealth Management.\n“We got into buy-to-let a few years ago to supplement our income when we come to retire.”\nSlade says he will only ever invest in Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) as he believes these provide better returns.\n“The pension freedoms mean that we may now consider taking more out of our retirement fund and using it for buy-to-let,” he says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T11:00:39.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
