The group rolled this business into another unit with a banking licence, enabling it to offer invoice advances and other financing. \nHowever, the growth of the new businesses has been sluggish, and the firm has recently started talks to spin out the financing unit into a joint venture with an unnamed company. Its early payment arm advanced £32m in the past year, generating revenues of £100,000 and losses of £12.7m. \nThe firm’s analytics business secured just one buyer during the year, although it carried out trials with 40 potential customers. Tungsten's more established Network service for online invoicing added 7.7pc more suppliers to take the total number to 181,000. \n“The newer parts of our business, Tungsten Analytics and Tungsten Early Payment, were slower to take off than we had hoped, though the reception from customers using the services has been strong and gives us the confidence that these businesses will grow,” the company said. \nShares in the Aim-listed firm, which hit a peak of almost £4 last year, were trading as low as 67.5p on Wednesday. Short-sellers bet heavily against the shares in early 2015 as the price tumbled, and five investment funds now have significant short positions. \nIn May, Tungsten raised £17.5m through a share placing in an attempt to ward off the short-sellers who were betting on the company burning through its cash reserves. Shore Capital analysts have now estimated that the group has about £46m of cash available. \nEdi Truell, who made his name as a private equity rainmaker at Duke Street Capital (Other OTC: CGHC - news ) , this month took a step back into the role of vice-chairman as Richard Hurwitz, who had led the business in America, became chief executive of the group. \n\"As with any growing company, we are becoming smarter about our challenges, and with continued investment, hard work and a dedicated team we have transitioned into the execution phase,\" said Mr Hurwitz.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T20:12:51.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
