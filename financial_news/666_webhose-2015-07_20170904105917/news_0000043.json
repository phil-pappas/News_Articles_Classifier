WNC is the only syndicator that has successfully offered and closed a California fund in each of the last 13 years. \"The closing of the most recent WNC California Series fund is a testament to our experience in the LIHTC market and our dedication to providing affordable housing to the state's low income seniors and families,\" said WNC Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Michael Gaber. \"We have participated in this market for more than 40 years, and in that time, we have learned a great deal about how to successfully navigate and effectively structure low-income housing tax credits, and with more than 80 percent repeat clientele from our WNC Cal 13 development and investment partners, our commitment speaks for itself.\" With the closing of Corp 40 in the spring and this closing of WNC Cal 13, WNC's cumulative portfolio value has now surpassed the $7 billion benchmark. \nAbout WNC \nWNC, founded in 1971 and headquartered in Irvine, Calif., is a national investor in real estate and community development initiatives.
