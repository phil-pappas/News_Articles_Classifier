There is pressure on RBI to cut rate to boost economic growth.\nHowever, RBI has said it would watch out for the data, including inflation, and the monsoon progress before any change in its policy rates.\nWhile retail inflation in June rose to an 8-month high of 5.4 per cent, the overall Wholesale Price Index (WPI) based inflation was (-)2.4 per cent in the same month.\nRBI mostly tracks the consumer price index based retail inflation for its monetary policy decisions, and its next review is due on August 4.\nIt would also wait for banks to pass on the benefit of three rate cuts during the year.\nRBI has cut policy rate thrice during 2015. The total reduction has been 0.75 per cent while banks have passed on an average of 0.3 per cent to customers.\nLast month, RBI cut the repo rate (short-term lending rate) from 7.5 per cent to 7.25, but left all other policy tools like cash reserve ratio unchanged at 4 per cent and statutory liquidity ratio at 21.5 per cent.\n 21, 2015 8:10 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T05:54:24.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
