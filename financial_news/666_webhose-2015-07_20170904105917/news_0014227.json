The bridge, which was built in 1904, carries trains on the New Haven line, Waterbury branch, Amtrak and Shore Line. \nMore repairs to a track will be required before the span is in operation next week, said Kevin Nursick, a spokesman for the state Department of Transportation. \nThe span came off its gears as it opened, he said. Trains are still able to pass, using the southern span at reduced speeds, \"exponentially more manageable\" than the failure at the Walk Bridge in Norwalk last year, he said, when commuters had to find alternative transportation. \nThe Walk Bridge, which was built in 1896, became stuck twice in the open position last year. \nDevon has experienced \"severe deterioration,\" said the Northeast Corridor Commission. Movable bridges, tunnels and other structures date back as far as 1873, the organization said. \n\"Certainly, it's one symptom of years of deferred maintenance on rail line infrastructure,\" said Jim Gildea, vice chairman of the Connecticut Commuter Rail Council, an advocacy group. \nThe state has targeted for replacement four moveable bridges on the New Haven line — A Greenwich span over the Mianus River, the Saga Bridge over the Saugatuck River and the Walk and Devon bridges. \nCosts related to the Walk Bridge are about $400 million, while costs to replace the other bridges have not been detailed. Replacement work is not expected for several years. \nThe state budget approved by the legislature will include a $2.8 billion increase for infrastructure over the next five years, including $1.77 billion for rail, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said. \nThe failure of the Walk and Devon bridges is a \"wake up call\" to state transportation officials, said state Sen. Toni Boucher, R-Wilton. \nHer constituents are \"ballistic,\" she said. \"They have suffered for so long.\" \nTerri Cronin, chairwoman of the Connecticut Rail Commuter Council, said she's been riding trains for more than a decade and service has never been as bad as it is now. \n\"We've ignored the infrastructure so long it's catching up with us,\" she said. \n____ \nFollow Stephen Singer on Twitter at h https://twitter.com/SteveSinger10 \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T19:22:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
