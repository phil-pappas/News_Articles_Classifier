Recently his shares have been seized by the NZ government. Which means the NZ government is in control.\" \nAccording to the Companies Office the biggest shareholder in Mega is Beijing-based Zhi Min Li, who owns 25.9 percent of the company. He's followed by TEY Trustee Limited with 16 percent, Wolf Dieter Ortmann with 15.6 percent and Coatesville Trustee Services Ltd, with 15.5 percent. \nDotcom's ex-partner Mona is listed as a director of Coatesville Trustee Services, but Dotcom appears to claim that these shares have also been seized by the Government. \n\"In addition Hollywood has seized all the Megashares [sic] in the family trust that was setup for my children,\" says Dotcom. \n\"As a result of this and a number of other confidential issues I don't trust Mega anymore. I don't think your data is safe on Mega anymore.\" \nThe Companies Office told 3 News shareholders have up to 10 days to register changes in ownership. We have reached out to Mega.nz, and are awaiting a reply. \nDotcom is sticking by a non-compete clause he has with the current management at Mega, which runs out at the end of the year. He then plans to start a new cloud storage site. \n\"I will create a Mega competitor that is completely open source and non-profit, similar to the Wikipedia model. I want to give everyone free, unlimited and encrypted cloud storage with the help of donations from the community to keep things going.\" \nIn the Q&A Dotcom also called the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement \"corrupt… paid for by the lobbyists of the rich, bribing politicians to do their bidding in expanding monopolies to the detriment of the people\". \nHe also said the Internet Party will fight the 2017 election alone. Last year it formed an unsuccessful alliance with Mana. \n\"We all knew that it was risky but we had to try. It didn't work out and I took full responsibility for that. \n\"In 2017 the Internet Party will run again, solo. We will have more time to prepare for the election and work hard to convince the electorate that we are worthy of making it into Parliament.\" \nOther topics the internet tycoon touches on in the chat include Call of Duty , his legal battles with the US and copyright law. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T04:54:14.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
