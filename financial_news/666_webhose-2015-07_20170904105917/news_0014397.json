Frances Mocnik Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan The Australian property market showed no signs of a slowdown with dwelling values for five major Australian cities surging 2.8 per cent in July well ahead of the 2.2 per cent increase in June.\nSydney dwelling prices increased 3.2 per cent in July compared to 2.8 per cent in June while Melbourne's July price growth was a strong 4.8 per cent versus 2.9 per cent in June, property research group, CoreLogic RP Data's preliminary market readings for its July home value index have shown.\nPrices were flat in Perth and Brisbane while Adelaide prices fell slightly.\n\"Keeping with the trend that has been evident over most of the current growth cycle, housing market conditions across the remaining major capitals have remained relatively sedate compared with the Sydney and Melbourne,\" head of research Tim Lawless said.\nDespite auction clearances cooling in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, property prices have not come down leading to more deterioration in housing affordability in these major cities.\nThe Housing Industry Association Affordability Index fell 2.9 per cent to 79.7 in the June quarter.\nChief economist, Dr Harley Dale said however, the national affordability result masks wide variations around the country.\nIn the June quarter, affordability deteriorated by 3.6 per cent in capital city markets, driven by Sydney and Melbourne, while regional Australia experienced a 2.7 per cent improvement.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

The risk is that this will obstruct new housing supply, aggravating affordability conditions in markets around Australia.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/103218209259241103549", "https://twitter.com/SuLin_Tan"], "published": "2015-07-31T12:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T10:11:55.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
