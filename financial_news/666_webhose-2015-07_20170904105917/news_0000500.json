Robert Rough by Angela Macdonald-Smith Victorian power network owner AusNet Services has declared it is in the box seat to lead a competitive bid for NSW transmission grid owner TransGrid but is leaving its options open on whether it will bid alongside its major shareholders Singapore Power and China's State Grid Corporation, or with other parties.\nTony Iannello, the AusNet director leading the board subcommittee considering a bid, said that AusNet's experience and track record in running similar assets in Victoria placed it well to put forward a \"competitive and compelling bid\" for TransGrid, the first business to be sold off in the NSW government's $30 billion \"poles and wires\" privatisation.\nExpressions of interest in TransGrid, which analysts say is worth about $9 billion, are due to be lodged by 10am on Tuesday, with the state government's advisers for the privatisation, Deutsche Bank and UBS.\nPotential bidders have been forming into consortiums over the past weeks and months, but State Grid, which owns 19.9 per cent of ASX-listed AusNet, is understood to have been in talks with other potential bidders including Macquarie's infrastructure arm MIRA. Singapore Power, the biggest shareholder in AusNet with 31.1 per cent, has not revealed its intentions.\nOther consortiums include one of Spark Infrastructure, Hastings Funds Management and Canadian and Middle Eastern parties. Australian Super is in a separate group with Borealis and Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, while Hong Kong infrastructure giant Cheung Kong is thought to be bidding alone. Other parties involved include China Southern Power Grid with China Investment Corporation, and local infrastructure funds QIC and IFM Investors.\nThe many foreign bidders in the line-up look set to trigger fresh warnings from opponents of the privatisation that selling the state's electricity networks will drive up prices for consumers.\n\"We believe foreign ownership will mean higher prices,\" said Steve Butler, NSW secretary of the Electrical Trades Union. \"We've always thought that there would be a big level of interest from China, but we're not opposed to a country in particular: it's foreign ownership itself that is a problem.\"\nIn the run-up to the state election in March, NSW Opposition Leader Luke Foley also voiced concerns about overseas companies buying the networks, but declined to comment on Monday.\n Any overseas bidders would need approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board to buy the NSW assets, but Mr Iannello noted that AusNet \"has got a structure that is approved by the FIRB and is listed on the ASX\".\nStill, governments are expected to remain mindful of voter sentiment around foreign ownership, with some pointing to risks that the Commonwealth government could block takeovers on security grounds in the run-up to the 2016 federal election, if the Coalition is trailing in the polls.\nSingapore Power and State Grid are being excluded from the work on the bid by AusNet and its adviser Citigroup until they decide whether they will participate in different groups.\n\"We would dearly love them to support any bid that we put forward; what they decide to do is up to them,\" Mr Iannello said in an exclusive interview.\nIn the meantime, others have been knocking on AusNet's door to join in a potential consortium.\n\"We've had a lot of interest from a number of investors; given our strong operational capability it makes AusNet Services a prime target to lead any consortium,\" Mr Iannello said. \"We're keeping our options open ... as we go through the bidding phase.\"\nThough he said AusNet could bid alone, its market value of $4.77 billion would seem to make that unlikely. RBC Capital Markets said in March that Transgrid could be valued at between 1.3 and 1.45 times its regulated asset base, including $4.6 billion of debt and up to $4.3 billion of equity.\nBut Mr Iannello voiced confidence AusNet could fund a solo bid.\n\"AusNet Services has got a very strong credit rating: We've got two major strategic investors and it has got access to a whole range of capital markets on the debt and equity side to be able to carry through on a bid,\" he said.\nTransGrid, which owns more than 12,600 kilometres of high-voltage transmission lines and underground cables, is widely expected to be the most keenly bid for of the three businesses to be privatised using 99-year leases. Transmission is seen less affected than the local distribution business by the surging popularity of rooftop solar, while the 100 per cent equity on offer is also more attractive for bidders than the 50.4 per cent on offer in distributors Ausgrid and Endeavour Energy.\nMr Iannello said AusNet was \"very confident\" of making the shortlist for TransGrid, and declined to say whether AusNet would go on to bid for Ausgrid or Endeavour.\nAusNet in February agreed to pay $260.9 million to settle a class action for compensation for the devastating bush fire that destroyed Marysville in February 2009.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:07:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
