Investors these days are more likely to boast about stable utility companies than the kinds of hot stocks that typically have fuelled a mid-cycle market.\nForget about disrupting the incumbents and getting first-mover advantage, what most investors really want today is a reliable dividend payer – maybe a bank or a telco – the kind of high-quality blue chip you can bring home to meet the family.\nAnd why wouldn't you?\nBecause the returns from bonds and cash have been and still are low, the whole world is fixated on yield. The biggest companies listed on the ASX have been getting in on the act and have created a \"new normal\" for capital returns, sacrificing countless opportunities in the process.\nMany professional investors appear to have openly abandoned their desire for growth and instead bleat endlessly about cost-cutting and asset sales in order to generate returns.\nWell, excuse us for stifling a yawn.\nGood ideas still make money. Interest rates will normalise. This too shall pass.\nWhich is why now is as good a time as any to invest in what professional investors and market watchers alike describe as long-term sustainable growth.\n Chris Daily, a portfolio manager with growth funds manager Tribeca Investment Partners, says stocks that aren't showering shareholders with dividends have been ignored by many investors. Real growth has been overlooked, he says, citing price-earnings multiples that indicate growth stocks are trading at levels below that of the broader market.\nAssessing ASX-listed companies with the highest forecast earnings growth, Daily notes that many are attractively priced compared with market averages, as investors continue to gobble up high-yielding defensive stocks.\nBut which companies have the potential to deliver investors long-term sustainable growth? Forward earnings forecasts may give a clue, but unbridled growth may be equally short-term and unsustainable.\nLook for organic growth \"We rate sustainable, organic growth in earnings highly [against] acquired growth which needs to be viewed, at least initially, with some degree of caution,\" says Ben Griffiths, co-owner and portfolio manager at small-caps specialist investment firm, Eley Griffiths Group.\nSo-called \"roll-up\" businesses, which acquire earnings by buying private companies using public market capital, can give the impression of potential for long-term sustainable growth – particularly in a market where growth is hard to come by – but can also carry significant risks.\nThe recent blow-up of listed personal injury law firm, Slater & Gordon, highlights the risks associated with companies that try to supercharge their growth by adding earnings through multiple acquisitions.\nAs we go to print, $1 billion has been wiped off Slater's market capitalisation because questions grew over its cash-flow reporting and hedge funds targeted the stock. Its stumble came on the back of two years' accelerated growth culminating in its transformative acquisition of the professional services business of listed UK law firm Quindell.\nAlong the way shareholders profited from its astonishing share price returns but those who bought in towards the end of this period have paid the price for what appears to be an unsustainable long-term growth strategy.\nInvesting in companies that pursue aggressive acquisitions strategies isn't always the best way to chase long-term growth as QBE Insurance shareholders found years ago.\nOf all the listed roll-ups, including education provider G8 Education and insurance broker networks Austbrokers Holdings and Steadfast Group, Lee Mickelburough, a partner and the head of Perennial Investment Partners' growth strategy, reckons pet-treatment company Greencross could have the best chance of transitioning its high-acquisitions business model to a long-term sustainable business with organic growth.\n\"In the end you want organic growth.\n\"It's one thing if a company is able to roll out stores or find acquisitions when they make sense, but another thing entirely when they have to make acquisitions to satisfy analyst expectations,\" Mickelburough says.\nThe idea of investing in high-growth companies is appealing to most investors, but there are risks associated with this strategy. Failing to ask if the model is sustainable over the long term is a rookie mistake.\nScaleable business model? The risk of investing in growth for growth's sake is two-fold, explains Stephen Wong, a senior portfolio manager with Melbourne-based multi-family office, Mutual Trust, which manages portfolios that include direct shares on behalf of wealthy families. In the first instance, there is the risk that forecast growth is not delivered (or exceeded), in which case the investor faces potential capital losses as earnings' forecasts are revised down, Wong explains. There's also the risk investors will overpay for stocks trading on a higher P/E multiple than warranted, he says.\nPrice-earnings multiples give a clue of how much expectation is built into the stock price, but so often the market fails to consider whether the business model is scaleable and what that means for the long haul.\n\"The higher the P/E multiple, the larger the downside risk,\" Wong says.\nAt present, Wong and Mutual Trust prefer to look overseas for companies that have the best potential to achieve long-term sustainable growth.\nHe points to NYSE-listed hospitals operator HCA as a good example because of its dominant market share, its capital structure and its option to pursue an acquisition-based growth strategy.\n\"Australian investors will be familiar with Ramsay Health Care, which has been a great Australian success story that has delivered solid growth over the long term,\" he says. \"We believe that HCA exhibits many of the same characteristics, but on a larger stage.\"\nWong also points to NYSE-listed cruise ship operator Royal Caribbean Cruises for its position within the highly concentrated global cruise industry, where the three top players represent more than 75 per cent of the market. The company is also exposed to the long-term, high-growth leisure and lifestyle theme spurred on by the segment of the population that is living longer and will be spending longer.\nCash flow tells the story Strictly speaking, growth is best reflected in a company's financials as free cash flow rather than reported profits, which introduces a host of other factors. Global investors will look for companies with a forecast earnings growth in the mid-teens – compared with the MSCI World Index, which has forecast average earnings growth of about 7 per cent.\nWong says growth-orientated investors would be wrong to ignore dividends, as they will ultimately make a significant contribution to returns over time. But companies paying out too much of their earnings, or even dipping into their balance sheets to increase dividends, should be viewed with suspicion.\nPerhaps the best examples of ASX-listed companies that have been able to achieve long-term sustainable growth and have the potential to continue to increase earnings are the three online classified businesses: SEEK, REA Group and Carsales.com. Analysing what made them great will also help us understand where the next generation of growth stocks may come from.\nFollow the leaders The key to these companies' ability to keep on ramping up their growth trajectory is their carefully planned expansion overseas.\n\"Businesses that have products and services that can be sold into global markets have, by definition, larger addressable markets than those businesses that can only sell their products and services domestically,\" says Mark Arnold, the chief investment officer at Hyperion Asset Management.\nHyperion was one of the early investors in SEEK, the ubiquitous job site that is among ASX-listed stocks widely considered to have high long-term sustainable growth potential. To date it has delivered enormous paper profits for its shareholders.\nSEEK has about doubled in value in the past 2½ years, on its way to a $5.8 billion market capitalisation and is now beginning to test the waters and investigate its global potential.\nHaving secured a leading position in Australia and seen off most of its local competition, the company is buying strategic stakes in similar businesses offshore with the aim of sharing intellectual property and increasing its stake longer term.\nSEEK tells its investors it has exposure to 2.9 billion people globally, who represent about 20 per cent of the world's output.\nSEEK currently owns majority stakes in OCCMundial in Mexico, Brasil Online in Brazil, JobStreet and JobsDB in south-east Asia and CJOL.com in China, through its majority-owned Zhaopin subsidiary in China. It also holds significant stakes in bdjobs.com in Bangladesh and One Africa Media, which currently operates in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa.\n\"We knew the long-term addressable markets were large in terms of total revenues. We also knew from our research that the value propositions of these businesses were strong and sustainable,\" Arnold says.\nInvestors looking for companies that might have the same growth potential as the likes of SEEK, REA and Carsales, but are currently at an earlier stage of their growth, might look to Malaysian-based and ASX-listed iProperty Group and iCar Asia. Both companies have appear to have proven themselves enough within their still-evolving markets to be considered reasonably safe bets and they are cheaper than their older parents, REA and Carsales, respectively.\nBut no matter how big an addressable market seems, or how advanced a company is along its path to maturity within a market segment, Arnold emphasises that investors seeking long-term sustainable growth should always keep in mind that new entrants or emerging players may disrupt growth.\nCompetitive threats \"A key focus for us is on the relative strength of the company's value proposition versus [those of] new disruptive entrants,\" Arnold says.\nREA, which is 61.6 per cent owned by News Corp, remains the largest online real estate advertising site in the Australian market. But it has Fairfax-owned Domain breathing down its neck.\nREA will also have its work cut out to increase its US market share after the February merger of the largest and second-largest US online real estate marketplaces, Zillow and Trulia. Last year REA spent more than $1 billion in a partnership with News Corp to buy the third-largest US online property site, Move.\nMeanwhile Carsales has to keep one eye on the road and one eye in the rear-view mirror as the second-ranked CarsGuide marketplace, which is 50 per cent owned by dealers and 50 per cent owned by News Corp, is holding its market share.\nWhether these online classifieds sites can grow in line with their expectations and beyond will be partly dependent on whether they can manage the competitive threats within their various markets.\nDisruption is the biggest killer of long-term sustainable growth, which is why investors should be thinking about investing in companies \"on the right side of the ledger\" when it comes to the pervasive effects the technology revolution, Perennial's Mickelburough says.\nWithin the financial services segment, where the potential for disruption appears to be greatest, Veda Group is among those companies that have the strongest potential for sustainable growth.\nVeda has been creating a monopoly-like presence by working with large financial institutions and banks to access the credit information they hold on Australians.\nThe company's customers include banks, telecommunications companies, utilities providers and government departments, which use the data intelligence to make decisions on credit risk, verify identities and check employee backgrounds.\n\"It's a long-term story that is on the right side of the digital revolution. Veda is an example of a frontier technology with long-term potential future growth,\" Mickelburough says.\nPerennial's growth fund holds an overweight position in the stock.\nVeda will be well positioned to capitalise on the disruption that peer-to-peer (P2P)lenders are widely expected to introduce into the personal loans market and others. In that world, accurate credit information will be a highly sought-after commodity, Mickelburough says.\nBut the newer the company and the opportunity it pursues, the more risk it carries as it works to build its foothold in full view of potential interlopers.\nAmong the biggest credit reporting companies in the world are Stockholm Stock Exchange-listed Intrum Justitia and London Stock Exchange-listed Experian, which are likely eyeing the less-advanced Australian market for credit reporting.\nThe key lesson here is that most Australian companies can't be considered good candidates for delivering long-term sustainable growth unless they already operate in the global market or plan to do so.\nGlobal reach While relatively unsexy compared with online classified plays, group logistics and equipment company, Brambles, financial services company, Macquarie Group, building materials company, James Hardie Industries, and medical device company, Cochlear, are well-placed for continued growth via world markets.\nAmong these stocks, Macquarie is known to have strong long-term growth prospects thanks to its highly scaleable business model. In particular, Macquarie is expected to benefit from the growth of its advisory and capital markets businesses: Macquarie Capital, Macquarie Banking and Financial Services, and Macquarie Securities. Experts expect it to increase earnings in these businesses without substantial investment, especially in overseas markets such as the US.\nIn addition to global reach, the underlying business theme must be robust enough to withstand whatever the near future may throw at it. Arnold highlights Cochlear for this reason, given that demand for its products will be driven by ageing populations in developed and developing economies.\nGriffiths reckons the small- and mid-caps end of the industrial market is a naturally a good place to start looking for long-term sustainable growth stocks. Some of these stocks might naturally carry more risk before their business models mature. \"Some of the fastest-growing companies in the ASX 100 invariably started life in the smaller end of the market, such as REA and Flight Centre,\" Griffiths points out.\nHe says long-term sustainable growth is difficult to locate in resources, given unpredictable commodity prices and volume growth, not to mention the challenge of replacing reserves. In-vitro fertilisation has emerged as a segment within healthcare that has highly sustainable growth potential and recently listed Virtus Health is considered to have a highly scaleable business model and a large addressable market.\nManagement matters Sometimes quality management and the ability to adapt and become a \"first mover\" within an existing category is enough to ensure future sustainable growth. The \"growthiest\" stock listed on the ASX over the past two years fits this description perfectly – Domino's Pizza Enterprises, a pizza delivery franchise business that has made its mark as a digital disrupter.\nHyperion's Arnold believes that Domino's can live up to its high-growth expectations, explaining his stake in the company based on its innovative organisational culture and management's focus on using technology to drive a better customer experience.\nGriffiths says companies with the potential for long-term sustainable growth, particularly at the small- and medium-cap end of the market where business models are less tested, will often attract solid, aligned management with a clear vision of where the business should be in the long term.\nDomino's Pizza It might seem unusual that a pizza delivery franchise chain is on a list of stocks with sustainable long-term growth potential, but Domino's has shown investors the potential value that can be unlocked by applying a digital business model to a traditional bricks and mortar business. The most recent feature Domino's has rolled out to enable hungry customers to track pizza delivers via a visual display on their mobile, is another example of how the company is using online tools to enhance engagement and customer satisfaction. In addition to engagement, Domino's is also able to use big data from Domino's networks globally to predict buying behaviour and better target subsectors of customers. The company's use of technology will enable it to expand its food offerings and keep track of what works and what doesn't\nGreencross The \"humanisation\" of pets in Australia and the rest of the developed world is what sets the foundation for the long-term growth potential of this stock. Investors can relate to the concept of the \"kennel to couch\" progression that's happened in most households over the last decade, which ensures people are spending progressively more and more on their beloved pooches. The largest pet-care company in the world is the NASDAQ-listed PetSmart, which has ridden this trend in recent years to grow to a more than $US8.25 billion ($10.7 billion) market capitalised company. Greencross is Australia's equivalent and although it's much smaller, has cemented its place as the number one pet services provider after merging with Petbarn in 2013 as it continues its aggressive acquisition growth strategy.\nHCA Australian investors will be familiar with Ramsay Healthcare, which has been a great Australian success story that has delivered solid growth over the long term. Well, HCA is the world's largest hospital company by market capitalisation and exhibits many of the same characteristics as Ramsay. HCA is the largest private hospital operator in the United States; has dominant market share in the regions that it operates; has a sustainable capital structure; is widely regarded as the best hospital operator in that country; and has substantial optionality for acquisitive growth. HCA has a forward PE of 16X, compared with RHC at 31X. There are a few reasons for the valuation differences, particularly given the uncertainty around the legal status of Obamacare, which is being challenged in the Supreme Court of the US. A recent ruling in favour of upholding the current structure of Obamacare saw the shareprice react favourably.\niCar One of the products of the south-east Asian technology start-up boom under Patrick Grove's The Catcha Group, iCar has the makings of a company that could replicate what Carsales.com did in Australia but at a much earlier stage. Currently Carsales owns 23 per cent of iCar and works with the company to progress the model, which services the fast-growing South East Asian region. iCar Asia is already the leading network of online automotive sites in ASEAN with operations in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia reaching more than 4.5 million unique visitors every month. The potential growth trajectory for an online car classifieds business in the fast-developing region is huge and has a longer run-up period than the more mature Australian market. iCar Asia's brands include Carlist.my and LiveLifeDrive.com in Malaysia, Thaicar.com and Autospinn.com in Thailand and Mobil123.com in Indonesia.\niProperty iProperty owns and operates Asia's leading network of property websites spanning high-growth regions such as Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. As with iCar, iProperty was also created within The Catcha Group and counts the more mature Australian equivalent – top 100 ASX-listed REA Group – as its top shareholder. Global media organisation News Corp, has a 61.6 per cent stake in REA. iProperty has built a dominant position in the online real estate porthole business with analysts forecasting two decades of double-digit growth as it continues to evolve with the maturing market where advertising is the dominant revenue source and real estate agents are beginning to pay for preferential listings. Given the strategic interests of its deep pocketed backers wanting exposure to the fast growing South East Asian market, iProperty is likely to protect and grow its market-leading position though acquisitions.\nIRESS Provider of sharemarket and online wealth management systems, IRESS doesn't need to predict how advice or investment services will be delivered in the future because its online tools and white-label services can easily evolve to suit the different models as people decide how they want to manage their personal finances. All investors in this stock need to be sure of, is that demand for analytics and tools relating to wealth and investing will continue to grow. And it will, not just in Australia, where the population's superannuation guarantee system means individuals have a growing pool of savings, but also overseas. IRESS's foothold in several countries means the company will not only grow with the size of the domestic wealth management market, but has the potential to grow in line with global trends relating to self directed investing.\nPact Packaging might not sound like a sexy growth business but it is. Take the example of Amcor, among the favourite holdings of professional investors funds for its consistent non-cyclical returns. Last year Amcor spun off its packaging business, Orora, to spawn one of the best-performing spinoffs in the ASX's history. Pact, 40 per cent owned by Raphael Geminder, son-in-law of the late billionaire Richard Pratt, is of the same ilk thanks to Geminder's global ambitions. Pact is determined to make its mark on the world stage as a manufacturer of rigid plastic packaging products and under Geminder is not afraid to grow through acquisitions and innovate to give manufacturers an edge in the highly competitive consumer market. Geminder remains committed to his vision of creating a global leader and retains a big ownership in the company.\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises The global cruise industry is an excellent hunting ground for stocks with long-term sustainable growth potential, given its highly concentrated industry structure, high barriers to entry, new market growth – particularly Asia – and positive outlook for yield. Royal Caribbean Cruises is the second-largest player in an industry where the top three represent 75 per cent of the overall capacity. Royal Caribbean has among the highest growth profile and strongest management teams of the group. While the Asian market is in its infancy, it represent a huge long-term opportunity and Royal Caribbean has recognised this, recently relocating its flagship vessel to China on a permanent basis. While Royal Caribbean's 17X PE multiple doesn't appear to be cheap at face value, expectations seem warranted given the growth potential. ? With Mutual Trust\nVeda Among the stocks on the ASX with possibly the most untapped and as yet unknown potential, sits this stock. The credit reporting and analytics company appears at a time when the most change is happening within the banking industry and Veda could be well placed to play a pivotal role. As financial institutions look to create more flexible lending services for their clients, demand for credit history and data becomes paramount and Veda is looking to become the first mover to secure information sharing partnerships with all of the major institutions. Once it does, investors hope Veda will have a monopolistic advantage and will be able to use the data to provide valuable insights back to financial institutions about their customers. The credit reporting model in Australia is still evolving so the potential reward attached to this stock also comes with a risk.\nVirtus If you believe that people will want to continue to want to have children later in life, then Virtus is a stock with reasonable long-term growth potential. After listing on the ASX two years ago, Virtus has maintained the mantle as the number one in-vitro fertilisation company, a discretionary service it provides in partnership with specialist doctors. Monash IVF has since listed and competes directly. The more established Primary Healthcare has also started an IVF service. Virtus was the first mover and appears to have protected its valuable relationships with specialist doctors adequately. The kicker in the company's growth potential will come as it tests its model in overseas market, including in Ireland and Singapore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T05:02:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
