Now, it’s time for the second generation model, and the new OnePlus 2 will debut later today internationally. The company is reportedly marketing the device as the ‘flagship killer of 2016′. Sponsored Links \nThe company has surprisingly revealed most of the specifications of the device. OnePlus claims that this move is a part of their direct and transparent marketing policy as they don’t have a big budget. Thanks to this, fans know a lot about the OnePlus 2 smartphone that will launch later today. \nThe company has confirmed that the flagship will come with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 810 chipset under the hood. This will be the third generation variant, the v2.1 that’s currently powering high-end flagships like Xiaomi Mi Note Pro. Qualcomm along with OnePlus has reportedly worked together to fix the overheating issue on the new flagship chipset. Along with the powerful octa-core 64-bit processor, the OnePlus 2 will come with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. This will make it one of the few smartphones with 4GB of RAM in the market. \nThe company has also confirmed in a Reddit AMAA event, that the new device will feature a slightly larger battery as compared to its predecessor. The OnePlus 2 will reportedly come with a 3300mAh capacity battery as compared to the 3100mAh found on the OnePlus One. The company has further confirmed that the OnePlus 2 will be smaller in size as compared to its predecessor. It could feature a similar 5.5-inch display, but with slimmer bezels to make it more compact. \nOne new addition to the flagship will be the fingerprint sensor. Most flagships tend to come with fingerprint ID this year and OnePlus 2 is going to follow this tradition. It is said that the Two’s fingerprint ID will be faster and better than Apple’s Touch ID. The exact sensor under the phone has not been revealed, but it will be integrated into the home button. So, it looks like the phone will have a physical home button too. \nThe OnePlus 2 will come with the new reversible USB Type C port. There will be three different versions for different regions like China, Europe/ Asia and US. Like the OnePlus, the company will make available a bunch of swappable back covers too. Finally, OnePlus CEO has confirmed that the phone will retail for less than $450. \nThe OnePlus 2 launch event starts at US ET 10 PM. Fans will have to download the dedicated launch app to view the livestream of the event.
