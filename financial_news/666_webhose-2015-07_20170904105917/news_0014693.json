Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) , BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) and Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) all dropped about 2 percent. \nA further sharp sell-off in Chinese stocks also weighed on sentiment. The rout has wiped trillions of dollars off Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed shares. \n\"The markets are looking at the bigger picture and focusing on what's happening in Greece and China. The Chinese slowdown and stock market wobbles there are making their presence felt,\" Commerzbank (Xetra: CBK100 - news ) equity strategist Peter Dixon said. \n\"Investors don't want to be 'long' going into the weekend and would wait for the Greek referendum results for a clearer market direction,\" he said, referring to a referendum on Sunday that may decide Greece's future in Europe. \nThe International Monetary Fund delivered a stark warning on Thursday of the huge financial hole facing the country. \nAn opinion poll published on Friday pointed to a slight lead for supporters of Greece's bailout terms, on 44.8 percent, against 43.4 percent for the \"No\" vote that the leftwing government backs. \nIt also showed 74 percent wanted to remain in the euro zone against 15 percent who wanted a \"national currency\".
