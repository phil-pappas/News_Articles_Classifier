Ken Irwin by Jonathan Shapiro Sarah Thompson Slater & Gordon has called on the services of \"Mr Fixit\", Leon Zwier of law firm Arnold Bloch Leibler, as an adviser as the company's accounts are scrutinised by the corporate watchdog.\nABL, the Melbourne-based law firm has deep ties with Slater & Gordon, a personal injury law firm, having advised the company on its 2007 float and its recent $1.3 billion acquisition of the professional services division of London firm Quindell in late March .\nWhile Mr Zwier has been engaged by the company in relation to the ASIC probe , sources told The Australian Financial Review he is also in contact with directors of Slater & Gordon.\nMr Zwier, one the nation's top lawyers, is best known as a distressed debt expert, acting for US hedge funds in Nine Entertainment's multibillion-dollar debt restructure.\nBut he has also advised opposition leader Bill Shorten, who last week faced the Royal Commission into Trade Unions, and the late billionaire Richard Pratt, who was pursued by the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission.\nMr Zwier also advised several high-profile businessmen in trouble with regulators, such as Steve Vizard against the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, Ray Williams from HIH and Peter Scanlon in the Elders IXL foreign exchange case. He also worked with Slater & Gordon to pursue British American Tobacco on behalf of the estate of the late Rolah McCabe.\nWill comply with disclosure requirements In a statement on behalf of Slater & Gordon, Mr Zwier said the company's annual report discloses that ABL acts as its lawyers and that it will comply with its continous disclosure requirements.\n Mr Zwier's involvement comes as the company is under intense investigation from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. The corporate watchdog has asked questions about the company's accounts.\nShares in Slater & Gordon have gained 8 per cent this week to close at $3.670 on Tuesday, after plunging almost 50 per cent since June.\nLast month Slater & Gordon revealed it was the subject of an ASIC investigation after initially dismissing reports in the Financial Review as \"incorrect\" and \"misleading\". The company also admitted to errors in its accounts that related to miscalculating ta x.\nAs part of the investigation, ASIC agents are likely to be assessing the recent accounting errors, announced two weeks ago, that over-stated cash receipts by a total of $92 million over a three-year period.\nThe errors added weight to concerns among analysts and hedge funds that the company was having difficulties bridging the gap between accounting profits and cash. ASIC has declined to comment on the investigation.\nTax error disappointing Peter Wells, an accounting expert at the University of Technology, Sydney, said the tax error was disappointing by itself but \"not quite totally benign\" for two reasons. One is that the nature of the error called into question the standard of their accounting but more importantly \"it means the difference between revenues and cash receipts is greater than previously thought.\n\"This is the thing people are already critical of, the delay between recognising revenue and receiving cash,\" Professor Wells said.\nVGI, a hedge fund that has shorted the company's shares , identified related issues in an April presentation that showed a larger variance of $88 million in 2013 and $98 million in 2014 in reconciling fee revenue with reported receipts from customers.\nHowever, some analysts have disputed the existence of red flags in the company's financial statements and believe the variances can be explained by cash collections being larger than amounts accounted for as work in progress.\nA number of forensic accountants have reviewed the accounts of Slater & Gordon in recent months and identified to the Financial Review what they regard as concerns relating to its growing balance of work in progress – revenue that has been booked but not yet collected.\nSlater & Gordon's management are understood to be meeting with investors this week to update them on recent events and explain the accounting error admission that helped spark a share price fall that shaved nearly $1 billion of value from the company.\nMeanwhile, Slater & Gordon's lenders are keeping a close eye on developments, with sources telling the Financial Review some members of the syndicate are assessing whether they move their exposure to Slater & Gordon to the \"bad bank\" units of their loan portfolios where the emphasis is on maximising recovery.\nFinalised terms The company's lenders recently finalised terms of an $853 million loan used as financing for the acquisition of Quindell's professional services division.\nA growing legion of short sellers are betting against Slater & Gordon on the basis that the controversial $1.3 billion acquisition of the unit will destroy shareholder value.\nWhile accounting issues relating to Quindell were known well before Slater & Gordon's acquisition, a recent announcement that the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has launched an investigation into Quindell has added to investor anxiety.\nQuindell had also planned to release revised accounts for 2013 and 2014 but missed the June 30 deadline. Slater & Gordon management and shareholders will be hoping that the release of the accounts offers insights that validate the £637 million price tag.\nTrevor Griffiths, a research analyst of London-based broker N+1 Singer, said the fact that Quindell had spent less than half of the £640 million acquiring the PSD business, using shares whose value at the time was debatable, was a surprise. He added that Quindell founder Rob Terry would been surprised too, given he disposed of all his shares at a much lower value than that offered by Slater & Gordon.\nThe Law Society of New South Wales is believed to be keeping a close eye on the situation, although chief executive officer Michael Tidball declined to comment on the specifics.\n\"The overriding duty of a lawyer is to the court and then to the clients. These duties override any obligation to provide profits to external stakeholders,\" Mr Tidball told the Financial Review .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:05:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
