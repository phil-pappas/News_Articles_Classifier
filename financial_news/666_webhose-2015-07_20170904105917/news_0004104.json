Norfolk, Virginia (PRWEB) July 23, 2015\nHomes.com®, leading online real estate destination, has released its May 2015 Local Market Index , a price performance summary of repeat sales in the top 100 markets, and the companion Midsize Markets Report for the next 200 largest markets. Among the nation’s top 300 markets, 139 markets (46 percent) achieved full pricing recovery, two more than the 137 markets reported in April.\nFor the fifth month in a row, all markets in the top 100 increased their 3-month average index point change. San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA had the largest 3-month average increase of 1.03 percent, while McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, TX had the smallest average 3-month increase with 0.04 percent.

Full price recovery is critical for homeowners seeking to restore their lost equity after the housing crash, as well as for the economic viability of their communities,” said David Mele, president of Homes.com.\nSouthern Markets Lead Recovery; Midwest Takes Top Spot in Largest Markets Recovery\nThe South continued to dominate recovery with 23 markets, while the Midwest came in second with 10 markets.\nDenver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO was once again the top market with an annual percent change of 7.47 percent, while San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA came in second at 7.37 percent.
