Why did it not make corrections to the economic agenda of earlier Greek governments?\" Putin said.\nGreek banks have been closed since June 29, when capital controls were imposed and cash withdrawals rationed after the collapse of previous bailout talks.\nGreece defaulted on an IMF loan repayment the following day and now faces a critical July 20 bond redemption to the ECB of 3.49 billion euros, which it cannot make without aid.\nThe country has had two bailouts worth 240 billion euros from the euro zone and the IMF since 2010, but its economy has shrunk by a quarter and unemployment is more than 25 percent.\n($1 = 0.8953 euros) (Reporting by Darya Korsunskaya, Lidia Kelly, Denis Pinchuk, Writign by Katya Golubkova, Editing by Timothy Heritage)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T17:14:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
