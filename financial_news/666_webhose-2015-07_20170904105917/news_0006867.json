Emirates NBD PJSC, the United Arab Emirates’ second-biggest lender by assets, slid the most in five weeks. Emaar Properties PJSC, the developer of the world’s tallest tower, lost the most since July 8. Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index sank 0.8 percent at 2:49 p.m. in Riyadh, headed for the biggest fall in almost a month.\nThe drop is “a combination of profit taking after a good start to the earnings season and investors pricing in the impact of Iran’s nuclear deal on oil prices in the short term,” Sanyalak Manibhandu, the head of research at NBAD Securities LLC in Abu Dhabi, said by phone. “If oil were to go another $5 lower, we could see another mini-scare in equities.”\nBrent crude fell to a four-month low on Friday on signs the global surplus will grow following Iran’s agreement to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for lifting of economic sanctions. Dubai stocks rallied the most since April last week after companies reported better than estimated quarterly results. Profit for Emirates NBD climbed 26 percent and for Emaar Malls Group PJSC leapt 43 percent.\nAbu Dhabi’s ADX General Index retreated 0.4 percent.
