Louie Douvis by Lucille Keen The owner of a scaffolding company said he was forced to walk out of a meeting with the militant construction union because of fears he could be implicated in a price-fixing scam.\nMPR Scaffolding owner Petar Josifoski told the Royal Commission into trade union governance and corruption he was worried the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union was pressuring him into signing a workplace agreement that would give pay rises and a minimum price set of $16 a metre for jobs.\nThe Commission has previously heard allegations the union pressured concreters to set a fixed price.\nIn his witness statement Mr Josifoski details a meeting he and other subcontractors had with the CFMEU in which the union demanded workers receive a 5 per cent pay rise despite CPI being at 3 per cent.\nMr Josifoski said he was unable to pay that rate and claims union officials, Tony Vitlar and Jason O'Mara, told him the union would get him more money from the work by getting all companies to agree on a minimum price for jobs.\nHe claims he told them it was price fixing.\n\"I can't be listening to this, I could go to jail just for talking about [it],\" Mr Josifoski said he told the men.\nMr Josifoski said he was later told by another contractor in the industry that the union told them not to use his company because he had not yet signed the union EBA.\n He claims he met with the Mr Vitler and another CFMEU official Zac Smith who told him the union would \"leave you alone\" if he signed it.\nWhen Mr Josifoski refused, he claimed Mr Vitler visited him and allegedly told him \"it looks like MPR won't be around in the construction industry for much longer\".\nMr Josifoski said the union wanted his staff to join as members of the CFMEU but his employees said no.\nHe explained he needed to have a few join the union in order for the company to get work and a few volunteered their names and he reimbursed the union fees in their wages.â€‹\nWon contract After signing the EBA he won a $100,000 job which he claims he would not have won without the EBA.\nThe union's lawyer, John Aguis, suggested to Mr Josifoski that the conversation was not about price fixing, but rather a discussion about what companies should charge to make the EBA affordable.\nHigher Up scaffolding company owner Adam McEvilly said he thought the wage rates the union were asking were \"unrealistic\" and \"did not suit the market\".\n\"If we're all going to sign up to this EBA we'd all go broke,\" Mr McEvilly told the hearing.\nIn his witness statement Mr McEvilly said at the meeting that Mr Josifoski claimed he walked out of, Mr O'Mara suggested companies pay money, tens of thousands of dollars, into a kitty and that if either tried to undercut the others they would lose their money.\nThe hearing continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T16:32:04.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
