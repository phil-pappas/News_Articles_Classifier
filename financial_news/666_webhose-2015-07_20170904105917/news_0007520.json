While a Rs 25,000 smartphone can no longer be called affordable, Sony seems to be trying to get back in the game with Xperia M4 Aqua.\nIf you compare the Xperia M4 Aqua with any other smartphone, you would feel that you are spending around Rs 12,000 more to buy it. But paying extra will allow you to use the smartphone in rains, while swimming or with wet fingers. However, don’t expect to use it under water.\nSpecifications : 5-inch 720p HD display | Android 5.0 Lollipop | 64-bit Snapdragon 615 octa-core CPU | 2 GB RAM | 16 GB ROM, supports microSD cards | 13MP rear camera | 5MP front camera | 4G Dual SIM | LTE connectivity | 2,400 mAh battery\nPrice: Rs 24,990\nSony Xperia M4 Aqua\nApart from the fact that it is waterproof, the Xperia M4 Aqua smartphone appears to be a standard budget smartphone, which you can pick up for half the price from lesser brands. There is nothing amazing on the design front. It looks just like any other Xperia Z series smartphone.\nWhat is good?\nIf you want an affordable waterproof smartphone, then the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua should interest you. The best thing about the Xperia M4 Aqua has to be the capless waterproof micro USB port. While the microSD card and SIM card slots are covered, the microUSB charging port is not. With this smartphone, you certainly need not worry about rains. You can dip it inside a bucket to test it out for yourself, just be sure to take it out within 30 minutes.\nThe performance of the Xperia M4 Aqua is decent. The experience is smooth in general. However, expect the device to take some time while loading heavy games. The device gets heated, but you can ignore it.\nSony is offering a good quality 720p HD display.\nThe smartphone delivers a decent battery life. You can expect it to last for more than a day and the power saving feature comes handy.\nWhat is not good?\nWhile the build quality is good, the device is prone to a lot of smudges and scratches. The camera quality of the smartphone is disappointing. It is clearly not something you expect from a smartphone priced at around Rs 25,000. It is fine for casual photos and selfies. The plus point is that you can click underwater images with the dedicated camera button on the right side.\nShould you buy it?\nIf you want a waterproof smartphone, then buy it. Having said that keep in mind that you are paying a premium for the waterproofing and this means the specifications of the phones are not at par with other brands in this price range.\nFor Updates Check Technology News ; follow us on Facebook and Twitter\n 13, 2015 10:24 am", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress", "http://twitter.com/financialxpress"], "published": "2015-07-13T18:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T08:59:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
