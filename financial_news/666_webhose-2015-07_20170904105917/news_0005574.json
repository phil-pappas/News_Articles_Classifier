Our trading environment remains challenging and we are stepping up the pace of change to drive efficiency, growth and innovation, while maintaining a tight focus on costs.\" \nRoyal Mail has targeted new sectors for parcel delivery and has opened its network later and at weekends in a bid to maintain share in a competitive market. \nThe group’s shares took a hit on Friday, plunging 3.5pc after Ofcom revealed the scope of its forthcoming review of Royal Mail’s operations. The watchdog could impose price caps amid concerns that Royal Mail has no effective competition in letter deliveries. \nOfcom is seeking views on its consultation , which closes on September 11. \nRoyal Mail Group will announce its half-year results on November 19. \nAnalysts at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) were positive about the group’s performance: “Given that the first quarter is a small quarter in terms of activity and that the comparatives get tougher from here in parcels but easier in letters, we regard all of these movements as within the band of expectations.” \nBarclays added: “We believe attention will now turn to the fundamental regulatory review: in setting out the terms of its review last Friday and calling for responses to its six questions by September 11, Ofcom made it clear that, while reviewing efficiency and parcels, the issues around [wholesale and retail] pricing are its main focus.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T10:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T11:03:14.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
