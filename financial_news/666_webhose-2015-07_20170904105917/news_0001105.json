Money is a struggle, the 37-year-old admits – she says she and her 11-year-old daughter Lily-May barely get by.\nI have always worked and I’ve been given pay rises, but I’m no better off\nNicola Marshall Marshall works 21 hours a week for a company that manufactures showers, and campaigns for Gingerbread, the single parent charity. She receives £107 a week from working tax credit and child benefit. She also gets fortnightly housing benefit of £200.\nShe recently got a £100-a-month pay rise but says this has been entirely wiped out by an equivalent recent reduction in her benefits. The freeze on her benefits comes as a further blow.\n“What I find really frustrating is I have always worked and I’ve been given pay rises, but I’m no better off because if you earn more money the benefits get taken away from you,” she says. “Freezing benefits is effectively a further cut and is going to be very stressful.”\nShe says that life has already become a lot more expensive after she had to fork out hundreds of pounds for Lily-May’s secondary school uniform.\n“I am hoping at some point I’ll start earning enough not to worry about money,” she adds. “There is a light at the end of the tunnel, but it is hard sometimes.” Lisa Bachelor and Juliet Stott\nThe Thompson family\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Elizabeth Thompson with her seven-year-old daughter, Eleanor. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Guardian The budget brought a sigh of relief for the Thompsons: there had been media speculation that the chancellor could tax disability living allowance (DLA) payments as part of his £12bn welfare cuts package, which would have left them at least £1,000 a year out of pocket.\nElizabeth and Andy Thompson of Selby, north Yorkshire, claim £400 DLA every four weeks on behalf of their eldest daughter Eleanor, aged seven, who is deaf. The cash is vital to help the family cope with the expense of the 100-mile round trips for Eleanor’s regular hospital appointments.\nThey have also used it to help pay for sign language lessons for Andy, and for specialist books and equipment for Eleanor.\nHowever, the chancellor didn’t tax DLA and promised that – unlike many other benefits and tax credits which were frozen – it would continue to rise in line with inflation each year.\n“It’s a relief,” said Elizabeth, “DLA helps us with the additional costs of ensuring Eleanor lives a normal life. Having it takes the pressure off.”\nElizabeth was also pleased, as someone who makes monthly trips with Eleanor to see medical specialists, that the chancellor pledged to make the NHS a spending priority: “I was very encouraged to see increases in NHS funding. It’s good news that the NHS is going to be protected.”\nThe National Deaf Children’s Society had been lobbying to protect the value of DLA payments. Taxing or freezing it would have left many families struggling to pay for extra support, including therapy, specialist equipment, travel costs and communication support.\nElizabeth, like her husband a civil engineer, thought that overall the budget was “not too bad”. But she remains cautious about the future: “If the government is going to continue to make cuts, who knows what next year brings?” Patrick Butler\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tim Graves works for a computer company. Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris for the Guardian Tim Graves\nThe initial indications are that Tim Graves, 51, will be “a bit over £100 a year better off” as a result of the tax changes in the budget. He lives near Farnborough, Hampshire, and has a “relatively well-paid” job as a solutions specialist for a large computer company.\nHe has mixed views about the contents of George Osborne’s budget box. Having worked for the same employer since 1989 he has been able to pay a decent amount into savings and pensions: “I’ve put something like £20,000 a year into my pension.”\nGraves had been fearing a pensions “raid” but believes he is unaffected by the cuts to the pensions tax relief enjoyed by high earners, though he will be meeting his financial adviser. He says the cut in the lifetime allowance – the maximum amount that can be saved into a pension – from £1.25m to £1m from April 2016 that was announced in the March budget is “a worry for me – and not just me, but an awful lot of people”.\nI’ve thought about buy-to-let and I have to say that I’m not sure I agree with it morally. It’s driving up house prices\nTim Graves As predicted, Osborne announced changes that he said would lift all but the very richest households out of inheritance tax. However, Graves, who is single with no children, says he suspects he is probably “unusual” in that he personally did not have any issues with the inheritance tax threshold staying lower. “I’m responsible for myself, and I personally don’t need [the money from his parents]. If the offspring are reliant on their parents dying, that’s a pretty iffy financial proposition anyway.”\nThe budget included a tax relief cut for buy-to-let landlords. Graves is unaffected – he has lodgers but doesn’t own an investment property. “I’ve thought about buy-to-let and I have to say that I’m not sure I agree with it morally. It’s driving up house prices.”\nHe also has concerns about how the changes to tax credits will affect some people, and as someone who donates a reasonable amount to charity he says he wishes there could have been measures to make it easier and quicker to support good causes, such as improvements to the gift-aid regime.

Photograph: Si Barber for The Guardian It’s hard to miss the colourful facade of the Stalham Shopper convenience store in the north Norfolk town from which it takes its name, but owner Nigel Dowdney (above) fears for the worst if proposals to relax current Sunday trading laws become a reality in this area. He also worries about how much the new national living wage will increase his staffing costs.\nIn his budget speech the chancellor gave the green light for counties and elected mayors to be handed new powers to set Sunday trading hours in their areas.\nThe owner of two convenience stores – one in Stalham and the other closer to Norwich – Dowdney says he would have to consider closing at least one because of the inevitable haemorrhage of business to larger supermarkets who would be allowed to trade for an extra two hours on Sundays.\nThe Stalham store is located just 500m from a Tesco outlet and would be badly affected by changes to trading hours. The arrival of Tesco had already had a major impact on the town and it was important to limit any further adverse effects, he said.\nHe had a taste of the possible impact when trading hours were relaxed during the Olympics in 2012. “In the first three Sundays my shop lost 20% of its sales and 30% of its footfall – and that is in a period when we would usually see an increase in footfall and sales due to people coming here on holiday.”\nOn a typical Sunday the usual pattern is that the Stalham shop has steady business until 4pm (when Tesco closes), followed by a spike in footfall at around 5pm-6pm until it closes at 9pm, as people stock up with food and drink for the evening.\nDowdney employs 31 staff across the two sites and fears that he might have to cut jobs and even close a store if the council agrees to relax legislation. The new national living wage would also bump up his wage bill. He admits: “I rely on Sunday trading and – along with similar restrictions at Easter – it is what keeps us going.” Rebecca Smithers\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Brisbourne, shop owner. Photograph: Si Barber for The Guardian Michael Brisbourne Shop-owner Michael Brisbourne reckons it was a “good” budget overall, and firmly supports the scrapping of inheritance tax on the vast majority of family homes. But he was less keen on the decision to cut pension tax relief for higher earners.\nBrisbourne, 52, is the director of the Peterborough Recliner Centre, a furniture store in the city which he bought about five years ago, and he has one full-time and one part-time employee.\nCuts to inheritance tax mean the amount people can leave to their children tax-free will eventually increase to £1m if it includes a family home. Brisbourne, who lives on his own and owns a flat, said: “I think that’s great. We all go to work to make a better life for ourselves, and we all pay tax, so I don’t see why I can’t leave [my property] to my family.”\nIf someone is paying into something to look after their future, why should they be penalised?\nMichael Brisbourne Brisbourne pays into a pension but does not fall into the higher earner category being targeted by the chancellor. Nevertheless, he does not support the cut in pensions tax relief which will affect those earning more than £110,000 a year. “I don’t agree with that. If someone is paying into something to look after their future, why should they be penalised for it?”\nBrisbourne’s accountant, Shaz Nawaz at AA Accountants in Peterborough, said the move on pensions tax relief was “short-sighted”, adding: “We should be encouraging people to invest more into their pension pots, especially as we’re living longer as a nation.” Rupert Jones", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4agke%2Fsfb%23img-4&ref=responsive", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What+you+thought+of+the+budget%3A+did+it+fill+you+with+horror%2C+or+were+you+cheering+Osborne+on%3F&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4agke%2Fstw%23img-3", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What+you+thought+of+the+budget%3A+did+it+fill+you+with+horror%2C+or+were+you+cheering+Osborne+on%3F&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4agke%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What+you+thought+of+the+budget%3A+did+it+fill+you+with+horror%2C+or+were+you+cheering+Osborne+on%3F&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4agke%2Fstw%23img-5", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What+you+thought+of+the+budget%3A+did+it+fill+you+with+horror%2C+or+were+you+cheering+Osborne+on%3F&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4agke%2Fstw%23img-4", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4agke%2Fsfb%23img-5&ref=responsive", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=What+you+thought+of+the+budget%3A+did+it+fill+you+with+horror%2C+or+were+you+cheering+Osborne+on%3F&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmoney%2F2015%2Fjul%2F11%2Fwhat-you-thought-about-budget-families-george-osborne&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F10%2F1436523187372%2F6be3cdcc-fe47-4b18-9735-cbf905b45eb3-2060x1236.jpeg", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=What+you+thought+of+the+budget%3A+did+it+fill+you+with+horror%2C+or+were+you+cheering+Osborne+on%3F&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmoney%2F2015%2Fjul%2F11%2Fwhat-you-thought-about-budget-families-george-osborne&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F9%2F1436458936454%2F4082cb4e-d42b-4ace-b157-d07a0a3cd566-1360x2040.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4agke%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=What+you+thought+of+the+budget%3A+did+it+fill+you+with+horror%2C+or+were+you+cheering+Osborne+on%3F&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmoney%2F2015%2Fjul%2F11%2Fwhat-you-thought-about-budget-families-george-osborne&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F9%2F1436458787944%2F4cd2ea24-a207-4e3c-97fe-535f68462565-2060x1236.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4agke%2Fsfb%23img-3&ref=responsive", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=What+you+thought+of+the+budget%3A+did+it+fill+you+with+horror%2C+or+were+you+cheering+Osborne+on%3F&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmoney%2F2015%2Fjul%2F11%2Fwhat-you-thought-about-budget-families-george-osborne&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F9%2F1436458580006%2F4c5ddd96-cc97-420c-9555-4761fe31f169-1360x2040.jpeg"], "published": "2015-07-11T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T09:20:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
