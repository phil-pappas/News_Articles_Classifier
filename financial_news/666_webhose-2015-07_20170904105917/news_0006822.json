Market slumped amid fears that the government may accept Supreme Court-appointed special investigation team (SIT) recommendations of stricter norms for participatory notes (P-notes) on markets, equity brokers said. \nHowever, finance minister Arun Jaitley's statement during the market hours that the government will not take any \"knee-jerk\" reaction that will adversely impact country's investment climate failed to lift the mood. \n\"No such step would be taken which could adversely impact investment sentiment in the country,\" he said. \nA sell-off in other Asian markets with over 8% plunge in Shanghai on worries that the Chinese economy is heading for a sharp slowdown added to the rout. \nThe 30-share index commenced lower and dipped below the 28,000-mark to touch a low of 27,529.57 before ending at 27,561.38, fall of 550.93 points or 1.96%. \nMonday's closing was the lowest level since June 19, when the index had closed at 27,316.17. \nAlso, it is the second biggest single-day fall since 660.61 points plunge on June 2. \nThe gauge has now lost 943.55 points in last three days. The broader NSE Nifty also succumbed to all-round selling and slipped below the 8,400-mark to settle the session 160.55 points or 1.88% down at 8,361.00. \nIn broader markets, mid-cap and small-cap indices closed lower by 1.38% and 1.07%, respectively. \nTata steel was the top Sensex loser, tumbling 5.17%, followed by Hero MotoCorp 4.84%. \nOf 30-share Sensex pack, 29 fell, while only Bajaj Auto bucked the trend and rose 0.41%. \nSectorally, BSE metal index fell the most, followed by capital goods, metal, banking, power, realty and auto. \nAmong other Asian markets, Shanghai Composite dived 8.48%, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.95% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng 3.09%. European stocks slid in early trade. Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T08:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T15:31:50.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
