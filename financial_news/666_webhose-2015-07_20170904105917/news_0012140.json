Morgan Stanley says investor appetite for safe assets rises in August as trading volume decreases. Nomura Holdings Inc. is also reminding customers that Treasuries tend to increase during the period.\n“The month of August comes with a bias for lower yields and consequently higher total returns,” Morgan Stanley analysts led by Matthew Hornbach, head of global interest-rate strategy in New York, wrote in a report this month. “The most seasonal month is back.”\nThis August brings a second benefit for Treasuries. There’s no Federal Reserve meeting next month, which means the central bank will probably wait until its meetings in September, October or December to raise interest rates. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said earlier in July she expects to increase borrowing costs in the U.S. before year-end.\nThe benchmark U.S. 10-year note yield was little changed at 2.26 percent as of 6:42 a.m. in London from Thursday’s close in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2.125 percent security due in May 2025 was 98 27/32.\nTreasuries have returned 0.8 percent in July, headed for their biggest monthly gain since January, based on Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. They are up 0.6 percent in 2015.\nCommodities, China U.S. government securities have also tended to gain in the month of July, advancing in seven of the past 10 years, the Bank of American data show.\nThis year, tumbling commodity prices and Chinese stocks along with turmoil in Greece are feeding demand for haven assets.\nThe Bloomberg Commodity Index has dropped 28 percent in the past 12 months, while the Shanghai Composite Index has slumped 29 percent from its June 12 peak. Greece is negotiating with creditors for a bailout loan.\n“Historically, the summer is a time to park cash in the Treasury market,” Nomura analysts led by George Goncalves, the New York-based head of rates research, wrote in a report this month. Treasuries will probably “outperform during the favorable seasonals period ahead,” they wrote in a second report.\nMorgan Stanley and Nomura are both among the 22 primary dealers that underwrite the U.S. debt and trade directly with the central bank.\nFed policy makers met this week and decided to leave their main interest rate near zero.\nAfter bond investors and traders get back from their summer holidays, they can start worrying about the outlook for interest rates again, with the Fed’s next meeting set for Sept. 16-17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T08:59:44.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
