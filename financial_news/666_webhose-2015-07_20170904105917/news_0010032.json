Reuters by John Davidson Yolanda Redrup ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ When the Windows software that powers 90 per cent of the world's PCs gets what promises to be its best upgrade in a decade starting from Wednesday, consumers are bound to embrace it.\nWindows 10, which marks a dramatic shift in the way Microsoft approaches software development following the failure of 2012's Windows 8, is after all the first version of Windows Microsoft has ever given away free of charge to existing customers.\nStarting Wednesday, Windows 7 and Windows 8 users who have signed up for the upgrade will be prompted to download Windows 10 over the internet, without any money changing hands. After that, all Windows 7 and 8 users will be offered the free upgrade, Microsoft says.\nBut consumer enthusiasm for Windows 10 should not be taken as a reason for businesses to make the switch to the new version, too, analysts warn.\nKerry Plowright, CEO of the public warning company Aeeris, says he'll leave it up to his users whether they want to upgrade. \"This is Microsoft's best desktop strategy in 10 years and IT executives must prepare a strategy for dealing with user demands or risk losing control of the enterprise desktop strategy,\" says Kevin McIsaac, an IT infrastructure analyst with Intelligent Business Research Services.\nResisting 'pester power' Rather than cave in to the \"pester power\" that Microsoft is relying on, the same way Apple relied on consumers to pester their employers into adopting iPhones, companies should consider holding on to Windows 7 for a few more years while they figure out whether they even want to stick with a desktop-oriented IT infrastructure, McIsaac says.\n\"The risk posed by the Windows 10 pester power strategy is that it may sidetrack organisations from rethinking the entire concept of the desktop.\"\n But businesses contacted by The Australian Financial Review aren't waiting around. Because Windows 10 embraces both the desktop-oriented approach of Windows 7 and the tablet-oriented approach of Windows 8, for many businesses it's the first chance in years to get all their users on the one platform.\nThe failure of Windows 8 to capture the public's imagination has left the Windows community deeply fractured, with 67 per cent of Windows users still using Windows 7, 13 per cent still using Windows XP and only 14 per cent using Windows 8, according to figures from Net Market Share , making it harder for businesses to support.\nOzForex, a financial company that offers foreign exchange services, is upgrading all its users to Windows 10 as soon as it has the resources to do it, says chief technology officer David Higgins.\n\"The main reason is just because we have a bunch of people on Windows 7, which isn't too bad but it's getting old now, and then we've got a number of others on 8 … which had some issues for desktop,\" he says.\n\"It's not the first time we've done [a company-wide upgrade], but it'll be the first time in the last few years when we've been at this scale,\" says Higgins.\nSeeking mass user adoption Scale, it happens, is what Windows 10 is all about. By offering the new version of Windows as a free upgrade, Microsoft is hoping to get the overwhelming majority of the world's 1.5 billion Windows users onto the same platform for the first time in recent memory, making Windows more attractive to software developers who might otherwise consider writing apps for Google's Android or Apple's iOS.\nIn Windows 10, Microsoft has added technology it calls \"Continuum\", that lets developers sell exactly the same app regardless of whether customers are using Windows 10 on a desktop PC, a notebook, a tablet or even a mobile phone.\n(The phone version of Windows 10 isn't due until later this year, but Microsoft has already demonstrated it running the same version of PowerPoint as the desktop version of Windows.)\nKerry Plowright, CEO of the public warning company Aeeris, says he'll leave it up to his users whether they want to upgrade.\n\"Windows is a great platform, but with Windows 8, Microsoft took away some of the key features we were used to in the previous version. This made it difficult to transition to.\n\"They have listened to their users, and I think they have learned from that experience with Windows 10.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10&qpcustomd=0"], "published": "2015-07-28T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:07:03.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
