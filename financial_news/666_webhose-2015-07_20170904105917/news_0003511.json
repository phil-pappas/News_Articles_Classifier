Sikorsky's X2 helicopter technology was exempted from potential divestments.\nThe contract also spells out Lockheed's agreement to accept certain \"behaviorial limitations, conduct restrictions or similar commitments\" if required to do so by the government.\nBialos said there would be input from other companies and that a second 30-day review period was likely under a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust process. The U.S. Defense Department can object to a merger involving suppliers during a federal antitrust review.\nForeign governments and entities can also raise concerns, said one industry executive.\nLockheed said it aims to complete the process by late 2015 or early 2016. Its agreement with UTC requires a deal to be reached within nine months, with a possible 120 day extension.
