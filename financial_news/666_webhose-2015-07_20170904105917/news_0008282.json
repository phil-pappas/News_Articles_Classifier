We expect a show of force from the authorities today to ensure the market closes higher.\" \nKNOCK-ON EFFECT \nThe wild volatility in China's markets has stoked fears among global investors about the broader health of the Chinese economy, hitting prices of growth-sensitive commodities such as copper, which hit a 6-year low on Monday. \nThe renewed slump hit Wall Street stocks overnight, and sent Asian investors scurrying on Tuesday for safe-haven assets such as government bonds and the Japanese yen. \nBut, while recent stock market weakness will have caught out many Chinese retail investors and companies, the relatively low rate of stock ownership by households and a disconnect between valuations and economic fundamentals mean the impact on the economy is likely to be less than it would be in other markets. \nThe People's Bank of China said on Tuesday it would inject 50 billion yuan (5.2 billion pounds) into money markets in its biggest liquidity boost since July 7, near the trough of the last market sell-off. \nThe central bank also said, in a statement before the stock market opened, that it would use \"various monetary tools\" to maintain \"appropriate levels of liquidity\", a signal that the further monetary easing that many analysts have predicted could be in store. \nDespite a slowing economy, China's main stock indexes had more than doubled over the year to mid-June, when a sudden swoon saw shares lose more than 30 percent of their value in a matter of weeks. \nMarkets finally began stabilising again in the second week of July after a barrage of official support measures. \nChina's central bank cut interest rates, brokerages formed stabilisation funds and regulators lifted restrictions on pensions and insurers investing in stocks, an implied combined total verbal commitment of almost $800 billion. \nBeijing also cracked down on \"malicious\" short-sellers in the futures market, froze IPOs to prevent a liquidity drain and looked the other way as around 40 percent of companies suspended trading in their shares to escape the rout. \nIn the latest in a series of supportive commentaries from state-owned media, the Shanghai Securities News said in a front page editorial on Tuesday that investors should view the latest sell-off \"logically\" and that China's economic fundamentals were still sound. \n\"The stable development trend of the A-share (domestic) market will not be altered by a single day plunge,\" it said. \n(Additional reporting by David Stanway and Ben Blanchard in Beijing and Hong Kong newsroom; Writing by Alex Richardson; Editing by Rachel Armstrong)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T07:28:44.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
