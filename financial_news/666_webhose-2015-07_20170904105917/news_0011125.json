Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS - news ) 's Andrew Garthwaite, for one, told clients markets were underpricing both the short-term and medium-term upside for Bank Rate. \n\"We think interest rates could rise more than expected in the medium term (1.6% is priced in for end 2017) due to the fact that the UK consumer is now less rate sensitive there is a high chance of fiscal policy slippage,\" Garthwaite said. \nThe strategist put the odds of a first hike in Bank Rate occurring in February 2016 at 80%. \"If anything, the chances are higher, in our view,\" he added. \nAn 'in-line' advanced estimate on second quarter UK gross domestic product which revealed a quarterly rate of growth of 0.7% was dismissed by economists at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) . \nThey wrote to clients to say: \"We also highlight that the ONS National Account release can be materially revised even after the release of the final estimate. Hence, we would not recommend drawing excessively strong conclusions from today's release.\" No change in stance was expected from the US central bank, but some sort of indication that a September rate hike might be in the offing was thought possible by some observers. \nNot so according to Bill Hubard, chief economist at Bankor , who pointed out how in previous meetings the Fed had indicated it did not want markets to become too complacent if it were to flag up possible moves in rates too far in advance, especially so for the first hike. \nThe minutes of the April FOMC showed that \"most participants\" had decided that: \"the timing of the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would appropriately be determined on a meeting-by-meeting basis and would depend on the evolution of economic conditions and the outlook,\" Hubard explained. \nLastly, and acting as a backdrop, the European Union and International Monetary Fund mission chiefs were set to arrive in Athens on Wednesday to kick off talks on a third bailout. \nAhead of those negotiations, Mina Andreeva, the spokeswoman for the European Commission said that \"more reforms are expected from the Greek authorities, to allow for a swift disbursement [of rescue funds from the ESM].\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T22:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T22:52:55.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
