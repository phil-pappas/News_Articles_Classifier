Early in July, the National Federation of Independent Business said that 44 percent of small businesses looking to hire that month reported few or no qualified applicants for positions they were trying to fill.\nAlthough job growth has accelerated and the unemployment rate has dropped to seven-year lows, that has not been accompanied by strong wage growth.\nThe NABE survey found the share of companies anticipating wage increases in the next three months grew to 49 percent from 46 percent in the April poll and 35 percent a year ago.\n\"As an economist watching the economy, we're somewhat surprised that wages pressures have been so muted to this point,\" Diffley told Reuters. \"We do expect an acceleration and in fact think it necessary to continue the recovery.\"\nThe share of those reporting actual wage increases during the past three months remained at 42 percent, little changed from 43 percent a year ago but slightly down from 45 percent in April.\nThe economists surveyed represented a broad spectrum of businesses, including goods-producing, transportation, finance and services industries. Forty-seven percent of the firms employ more than 1,000 people.
