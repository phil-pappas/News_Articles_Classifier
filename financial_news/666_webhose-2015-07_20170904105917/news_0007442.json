They effectively constitute a third tier of economies,\" Mr James said. \nSouth Australia remains in seventh place, closely followed by Tasmania at the bottom, where unemployment hit an eight-month high in June. \nHOW THE STATES FARED \n1. NSW - strength in retail spending, weakness in economic growth \n2. VIC - strength in home lending, weakness in equipment spending \n3. NT - strength in unemployment, weakness in housing finance \n4. WA - strength in retail trade, weakness in unemployment \n5. QLD - strength in retail trade, weakness in unemployment \n6. ACT - strength in housing finance, equipment spending \n7.
