Debt collection is expected to be suspended for at least 120 days. \nSome 40,000 former students are believed to have defaulted on Corinthian loans to the tune of $3.5 billion. \nThe for-profit college filed for bankruptcy in May . Soon afterward, ED unveiled a plan under which tens of thousands of former Corinthian students could seek relief from paying off their federal student loans. It's not clear what, if any, workout is being contemplated on the loan balances or if ED is starting from scratch on a new solution. It’s also not clear whether interest will accrue during the 120 payment moratorium if the loans go back into active collection.

Job placement numbers at Corinthian's Heald Colleges, the litmus test for the viability of career or trade school, were deemed by ED to be unreliable--and extremely low. \n\"The Department recently determined that by misrepresenting job placement rates to students at its Heald College campuses, Corinthian committed severe violations of Federal law,\" said Robyn Smith, an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center in a statement. \"In light of these findings and those of state attorneys general, the Higher Education Act clearly authorizes the Department to cancel the Federal loans of Corinthian borrowers. Any claim that the Education Department lacks the power to automatically cancel loans based on this evidence is just plain wrong.\" \nA spokesman for the Department of Education could not be reached for comment. Meanwhile, ED has, for the time being, bowed to pressure from a tiny number of well-organized students.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T18:08:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
