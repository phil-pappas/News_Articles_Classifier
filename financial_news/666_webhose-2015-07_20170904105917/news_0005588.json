A witness told CNN that after the gunman unleashed this first fusillade he drove off of his own accord.\nReserve Recruitment personnel stand outside a Navy recruiting building as the area is cordoned off with blue shell casing markers.

The gunman was shot dead at this site.\nDuring a press conference local authorities later described the incident as an act of domestic terrorism, only to be contradicted by an FBI spokesman, who said the motive for the attack was not yet clear.\nTennessee Highway Patrol Trooper guards the top of a bridge at Amnicola Highway after a morning shooting near the Naval Reserve Centre, in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Abdulazeez, who held a degree from University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, was arrested in April for driving while intoxicated, local media reported.\nUS Attorney-General Loretta Lynch has directed the FBI to lead the national security investigation of the shooting.\n\"The US Attorney's office and department prosecutors are also actively involved,\" Ms Lynch said. \"In the days ahead, we intend to work with our partners in law enforcement and the intelligence community to ensure that the American people are protected and that justice is served.\"\nThe attack has already prompted calls for US servicemen and women to be armed when on duty domestically.\nThe attack follows the massacre of 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard in 2013 and two separate shooting incidents at Fort Hood in 2009 and 2014, in which 13 people and four people respectively were killed.\nOne witness, Gina Mule, told CNN the gunman pulled up to the recruitment centre and opened fire without leaving his car.\n\"I looked out of our window and I seen the guy in his car, a silver Mustang, drop top, a white guy and he had a high-powered rifle and was just firing shots into the Air Force, Navy and Marines office,\" she said.\n\"I don't even know how many shots he fired, but it was a lot â€¦ After he got done opening fire, he pulled out really quick.\"\nAnother witness, Bruce Gans, told the Times Free Press: \"We had the back door of the store open when we heard 'Pop, pop, pop,' which sounded liked an AR-15 [assault rifle]. Within minutes, it seemed, cops were all over the place. We heard rumours that five Marines had been killed. We locked the doors.\"\nA photo of the recruiting centre broadcast on cable TV news station CNN showed its entrance riddled with bullet holes.\nChattanooga lies along the Tennessee River is in the south-eastern section of the state, just north of the Georgia border. Just over 173,000 people live there, according to a 2013 estimate from the US Census Bureau.\nA White House spokesman said US President Barack Obama had been told about the shooting.\n\"The President has been briefed by his national security staff on the Chattanooga shooting, and will continue to get updates as warranted,\" said spokesman Eric Schultz.\nwith Reuters\nFollow FairfaxForeign on Twitter\nFollow FairfaxForeign on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/FairfaxForeign", "https://www.facebook.com/FairfaxForeign"], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T11:40:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
