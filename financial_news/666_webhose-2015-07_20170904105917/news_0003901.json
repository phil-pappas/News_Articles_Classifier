Terapeak users will now be able to view, search and filter the top 30 million trending products on Alibaba.com. This data integration will provide direct access to both sourcing and sales analytics, helping retailers sell more on eBay, Amazon and other channels. Terapeak is a leading supplier of marketplace analytics that helps eBay and Amazon businesses evaluate supply and demand opportunities and optimize sales. Over 2.6 million users rely on Terapeak to navigate online marketplaces and grow their businesses. Terapeak will now offer sourcing capabilities to help its customers find new products to sell, improve profit margins and gain a competitive advantage. Alibaba.com, the leading platform for global wholesale trade, is where the majority of Terapeak users go to source inventory. The platform is owned by Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA), the largest online and mobile commerce company in the world by gross merchandise volume (GMV). The collaboration between Terapeak and Alibaba’s grew out of the efforts of each company to help online merchants grow their businesses. When customers login to Terapeak, they will see a new button to “Source My Inventory.” This feature will give customers access to a searchable list of Alibaba.com’s products. By combining supplier product and price information with Terapeak’s other market research features, retailers can now answer questions such as: \"How much can I sell this for?\", \"How many of these can I sell in a month?\" and \"What does my competitive landscape look like for this product?\" “This partnership with Terapeak enables our shared customers, who source inventory on Alibaba.com, to gain more data-driven insights to better inform their sourcing needs and business decisions,” said Michael Lee, International Business Development and Marketing Director for Alibaba.com. “Terapeak’s growing reach in the e-commerce industry provides our customers with data that allows for a more transparent and trusting relationship between buyers and suppliers, which ultimately streamlines the supply chain in global trade.” Terapeak has also integrated their HotList into the sourcing and research workflows. Sellers who use the HotList to discover new selling opportunities will now have direct access to sourcing opportunities on Alibaba.com. “We wanted to provide Terapeak customers with the ability to uncover global sourcing opportunities, and we believe that Alibaba is the best place to start,” said Kevin North, Chief Executive Officer of Terapeak. “By working with the world’s largest wholesale marketplace, we can help our merchants source the hottest and most profitable products and sell them more effectively on eBay and Amazon. This is about giving our customers a competitive advantage.” To learn more, visit www.terapeak.com .
