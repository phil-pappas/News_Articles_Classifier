In fact, five out of the index’s 10 main sectors are nursing year-to-date losses.\nThe result has been a painful sideways trend ever since the Federal Reserve ended its quantitative-easing program last October and has been flirting with the first rate hike since 2006.\nThe S&P 500 SPX, -0.09% has registered gains of about 2% from the start of the year, while trading in a narrow band.\nRead : Buying oil stocks at these prices is just spilling money\nThe health-care sector is showing year-to-date gains of 11%, while the consumer-discretionary sector is maintaining a 10% return. Both sectors are more expensive in valuation terms than the market as a whole, which is also high by historical standards, as investors attempt to chase winning stocks higher.\nMeanwhile, a significant pullback in utilities since January point to investors’ concerns about an anticipated rise in borrowing costs (which would be due to Fed’s increasing interest rates) while jettisoning transportation stocks over the past several months suggests investors anticipate a slowdown in the economy.\nTransport stocks , which are viewed as a barometer of the health of the economy, at one point were down more than 10% from the end of 2014. After a recent bounce, they’re still down a significant 8.2% year-to-date.\nAlso read: These diverging trends point to a market correction, says UBS\nGiven high valuations and shaky fundamentals, it is hard to be overly optimistic, according to Garry Gordon, founder of Pacific Park Financial, Inc., a registered investment adviser.\nGordon invoked Greek mythology, using the story of Atlas holding up the world as an apt comparison with the role of health-care and retail stocks in the S&P 500.\n“Either Atlas will crumble under the weight or the rest of the market has to improve and take it higher. Historically, the latter does not happen and currently the odds are against it,” Gordon said.\nThe S&P 500 has slowly climbed to new heights recently but the ascent of the market-cap weighted index belies the fact that it is buttressed by fewer companies and sectors, Gordon said.\nIndeed, the chart of the equal-weighted S&P 500 shows that average stocks are trending lower. Equal-weighted index treats changes in prices equally, while market-capitalization-weighted indexes tilt heavily toward larger companies.\nPerhaps it isn’t surprising that Gordon is forecasting a market correction. “Any correction would be good at this point, as valuations would become reasonable,” he said.\nBut the Pacific Park Financial investment adviser stopped short of recommending abandoning stocks altogether: “As long as the Federal Reserve maintains its plan to raise the cost of borrowing, and as long as the U.S. dollar rises alongside those expectations, the broader market is likely to remain range-bound, Gordon wrote in a recent article .\n“You’d have to hold the horses that have been winning…Yet you wouldn’t necessarily want to add to your overall equity position,” he said.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.etftrends.com/2015/07/remember-the-ad-line/"], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T21:08:53.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
