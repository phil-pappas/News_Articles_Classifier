Seattle’s unemployment rate, specifically, swelled from 5.4% to 8.5% during that span. The seemingly bulletproof tech economy had gone cold and a seemingly endless boom of construction and expansion fell into foreclosure.\nThat is when Matthew Lincecum decided to open Fremont Brewing Co. in Seattle’s Fremont neighborhood. With no credit, no loans and only $10,000 in the bank, the former attorney, community organizer and environmental activist had to persuade a developer to lease him space mid-recession and plead with investors to lend him money to buy equipment. Most importantly, Lincecum had to convince everyone involved that offering big salaries and benefits packages would be key to attracting like-minded talent. He succeeded but, unbeknownst to Lincecum and everyone involved, he’d bought in low.\nBy August 2009, when Lincecum had kegged his first beer, both Seattle and Washington unemployment was starting the long slide downward. By the end of 2014, Washington unemployment had dropped to 6.3% and Seattle unemployment sank to 3.8%, all while Fremont’s beer production climbed to nearly 20,000 barrels, good enough to place among the top five brewers in a state with more than 250. Its Interurban IPA, meanwhile, was among the 15 best-selling canned India Pale Ales in the nation last year.\nMore importantly, Fremont could expand. Last year, it announced plans to open an 80,000-square-foot production facility in Seattle’s Ballard neighborhood that could produce 60,000 barrels immediately. It will eventually be able to produce 250,000 barrels, but it will allow Fremont to hire up to 40 more employees, beef up its contracts at its Yakima hop farm and continue supporting its malting business. When he started, Lincecum had about $10,000 to his name. This year, he’ll be opening a $10.2 million facility.\nOn a much brighter day in Fremont, we spoke with Lincecum about anteing up in a down economy, taking care of your employees and building a culture that convinces investors to help you build on a dream.\nWhat was the business plan behind your brewery’s growth. Was it distribution, partnerships? How did it go down?\nLincecum: It went down really fast and it’s still going down really fast.\nThere’s a lot behind it, but I will say, to be brutally truthful, in the beginning you have hopes and a plan, but it was, frankly, desperation. We were in the middle of the worst economic downturn we’ve had in 75 years, almost four generations. We were in the midst of 10% unemployment in this state. I just left my law practice, I had two kids and I couldn’t get a credit card.\nMy business was put together with a desperation model in mind. We didn’t have any money, we didn’t have any deep pockets behind us, we didn’t have a bank behind us and we didn’t even have credit cards because I couldn’t get one. The banks were in mass disarray and Washington Mutual was about to collapse.\nWe started out with two principles: 1. Pay the bills, which would be the goal on Monday. Bills would be due on Friday so, on Monday, I knew I had to go out and sell seven kegs by Friday just to pay the bills. 2. Bake in from Day One health care and the highest wages for all of our employees that we can afford. That’s the biggest part of the business model going out of the gate.\nIs that as daunting in reality as it sounds on paper?\nLincecum: I was driven to grow as fast as we could keep up with the quality beer and consistency we were striving to produce. It’s easier today than it was almost six years ago, but that second part is still critical. We need to increase the revenue so we can increase the margins so I can offer more benefits, and that’s a huge part of what we do.\nIt’s not just about making money for the brewery. It’s about taking this idea of a business and flipping it on its head a little bit. We can do well by selling beer, but we can do better by being an active part of our community. That’s why we have an organic hop project, that’s why we have our Cascadian Grains small-scale craft-malting farming economy in the west side of the Cascades.\nAlso, by giving employees the best wages we can and the best benefits we can. Free health care, matching 401(k) program, free ORCA [mass transit] cards every year for all employees, training budgets, free beer, etc. In doing that, the idea is that we will reap greater rewards long-term as a company. So far, it’s worked out. I think that has driven so much of our growth: Focusing on quality externally and quality internally with our beer and our employees.\nThat seems to echo the Costco model that was implemented not too far from Fremont in Kirkland, Wash., though that’s built on a much broader base. Considering you came into this business with absolutely nothing, what made you prioritize high wages and employee benefits?\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/114362140603273360727/about?gl=us&hl=en"], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T19:37:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
