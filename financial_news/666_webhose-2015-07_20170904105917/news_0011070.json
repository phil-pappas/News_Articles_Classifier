The economy is seen returning to growth after a contraction in the weather-battered first quarter.\nAnother weak GDP reading might \"undermine the optimistic outlook held by the Fed and fuel near-term headwinds for the greenback as it raises the risk for a further delay in the normalization cycle,\" David Song, currency analyst at DailyFX, said in a note to clients.\nIn contrast, Japanese data on Thursday showed the country's factory output rose only modestly in June after a big drop in the previous month, heightening fears of a second-quarter economic slump.\nThe dollar added about 0.1 percent on the day to 124.110 yen , after rising as high as 124.19, its highest since July 24.\nThe euro edged about 0.1 percent lower to $1.0974, after earlier drifting down to $1.0959.\nThe dollar index, which tracks the U.S. unit against a basket of six major rivals, added about 0.3 percent on the day to 97.228, after rising as high as 97.315, its highest since July 24.\nMost economists forecast U.S. economic growth will pick up and that the Fed will begin tightening monetary policy in September, according to a Reuters poll published last week.
