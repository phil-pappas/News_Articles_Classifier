A lot of people are still hungry for yield and looking to these countries, including Portugal.\"\nContagion to peripheral debt has been modest, even as more major banks now see a Greek exit from the monetary union as more liekly than not. Spanish, Italian and Portuguese yield premiums over German benchmarks are still way below peaks hit at the height of the debt crisis in 2011/2012.\nNO SPREA\nInvestor confidence in the ECB's firewalls, including its trillion-euro asset purchases, which started in March, and the expectation it would take more action if needed, is cushioning those weaker economies.\nSome investors see a potential sell-off in those markets in the event of a Grexit as a buying opportunity.\nNeil Murray, head of pan-European fixed income at Aberdeen Asset Management, said peripheral euro zone yield spreads over German benchmarks could widen 50-100 bps in the event of a Grexit \"on a very bad day\".\nThat risk of potentially heightened volatility prompted Aberdeen to cut exposure to Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Irish bonds across its government bond funds to underweight or nothing about six weeks ago. It simultaneously scaled up exposure to top-rated German Bunds, whose yields Murray said could fall 30-40 bps with a flight to quality spurred by ECB bond purchases.\n\"The ECB is still doing quantitative easing ... We wouldn't see (Grexit) as the end of the European project and ... we would see a blowout in spreads, all else being equal, as a potential to buy,\" he said. Aberdeen has a crisis group including its CEO, CIO and heads of asset classes which is planning a call on Sunday to discuss the outcome of the Greek deal, he said.\nYields on 10-year German Bunds, the benchmark for euro zone borrowing costs, were 1 basis point up at 0.69 percent as investors unwound some of the safety bids spurred by the rout in Chinese stocks and global commodities markets. Chinese stocks rebounded sharply after Beijing banned shareholders with large stakes in listed firms from selling.
