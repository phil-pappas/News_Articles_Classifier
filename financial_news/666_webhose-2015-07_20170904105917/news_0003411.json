Big business in Iran \nWith sanctions lifted, South African companies that have invested in Iran would be able to operate with greater ease and so make more profits. MTN for example, which owns 49% of the country's second largest mobile phone operator IranCell, recently said that could stand to repatriate up to $1-billion in loan repayments from Iran if a deal is struck. \n3. The arms industry \nThe country's arms industry could also benefit if SA is able to sell military equipment to the Iranian army, which is the fifth most powerful in the Middle East.
