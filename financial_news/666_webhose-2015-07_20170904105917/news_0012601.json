It was on track for a 2.7 percent weekly fall the biggest since early March. \n'The weakness we are seeing is related to the strength of the US dollar ... and the bearish momentum is sustained by psychological levels being breached like the 1000 mark in platinum' said Norbert Ruecker head of commodity research at Julius Baer. \nPlatinum broke below 1000 an ounce for the first time since early 2009 due to oversupply sluggish demand and weaker gold prices which encouraged speculative selling analysts said. \n'Platinum is suffering from low liquidity and the kind of storm it has been facing in the past few weeks has created some skepticism toward the metal' Saxo Bank Senior Manager Ole Hansen said. \nThe dollar was set for its biggest weekly rise since May on strong US jobs data while global shares edged down after strong gains as Greece looked set to secure a bailout. \n'If we take out the 1140 in gold and we close below it the shorts in both platinum and gold will still have the upper hand' Hansen said. \n'Gold is finding a lot of headwinds from multiple sources: We have seen the Greek risk fade and the focus return to the US and Janet Yellen.' \nNon-interest-bearing gold which is on track for a third year of losses and down more than 3 percent so far has been struggling ahead of an expected US rate rise which would increase the opportunity cost of holding the metal. \nFederal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told Congress the US central bank is on track to lift interest rates this year if the US economy expands as expected. \nGold's fall however has failed to spur demand in top consumers in Asia with domestic prices in No. 2 market India remaining at a discount to global spot prices. \nChina's gold reserves increased by 57 percent to 1658 tons over the past six years accounting for just for 1.65 percent of total forex reserves data showed. \nPalladium slipped 2 percent to 616.20 an ounce after dropping to 614 its weakest since November 2012. Spot silver was down 0.7 percent at 14.86 an ounce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T09:49:10.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
