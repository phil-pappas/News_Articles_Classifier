By Rachel Ward | Telegraph – 6 minutes ago Print \nA play about living and working with dementia has been nominated for a National Lottery award. But what is it about the subject that is so charged, asks Rachel Ward \nThe National Lottery Awards take place yearly and recognise the achievements of Lottery-funded projects across the UK. The awards are split into seven categories: art, education, environment, health, heritage, sport and charity/voluntary. \nThis year’s arts category features seven finalists whose projects range from Glasgow’s 2014 cultural programme, which fed into the Commonwealth Games, to smaller entrants including a free writing workshop for youngsters in east London. \nOne nominee is the theatre project Inside Out of Mind . Social scientists at The University of Nottingham commissioned a new play that looked at NHS research to show the reality of living and working with dementia and the impact on carers those employed in health care as well as family and friends. The result is a courageous and tremendously important piece of work representing life on a dementia ward from the perspective of the patients, staff and visitors. Care home staff, home care workers and the general public were encouraged to attend the theatrical production which toured six cities in the UK earlier this year. \nActor and playwright Tanya Meyers talks to Rachel Ward about how she brought 600,000 words of research field notes to the stage. \n= So how did the play come about? = \nProfessor Justine Schneider, who works in the University of Nottingham’s Social Sciences department, instigated the research. The material was put together as a government report but it’s down to her that it reached the arts [via Nottingham’s Meeting Ground Theatre Company where Myers is co-artistic director]. \n= Do you think that the work successfully builds a bridge between science and the arts? = \nPeople often thought that we would hit marketing problems as they didn’t expect it to be a totally immersive theatrical experience. What Justine gave me and the team was complete permission to make pure theatre. There was no agenda. For someone to cross over from science and say \"here you go do what you want with it\" was just brilliant. What we had to do as a theatre company was to forge the theatre language out of the research. \n= How long did it take to write? = \nIt was a five year project. For a whole year I was sieving through the research and getting lost in all the work. All the original material came from three ethnographers - the voices in the research were quite poetic, which really helped with the writing process. \n= Did you draw on personal experience of dementia? = \nI supported my husband's mother through dementia and my dad died with early onset. Had I realised at the time I would have been much kinder to him. I watch families struggle and it's so apparent that it touches so many people. I also did a lot of research, reading Oliver Sacks’s Musicophilia, the poems of John Killick, and psychologist Graham Stokes’s book And Still the Music Plays. Their work is so rich and powerful. I adapted one of Killick’s poems in the play. \n= How demanding is it for the actors? = \nDuring the rehearsal process it became apparent that the actors who played the nurses would also play the patients [there were nine actors in the play in total]. There were moments when you would see the actors come off stage with a slightly vacant look in their eyes. One said to me that you can’t act mad you have to find the logic. I was so specific with the language when I was writing that I worked incredibly close with them and ended up directing the play as well. Some actors worked by picture, some responded to sound, and some were totally immersed in the material that they just went into their own world with it. \n= Who is the play for? = \nThe play doesn't offer any answers. It would feel presumptuous to do so. What it does suggest is the act of listening. And intuitive listening at that. It’s not about relying on cognitive thinking but finding a way to listen with your heart. You might respond with gesture or touch, or laughter or a song. This is the positive side of dementia what is it doing for the rest of us? What is it enabling us to become as human beings that is more than what we are at present? What sort of connections are possible between patient and carer? It is theatre and not a medical agitprop. \n= How did you manage to find the humour in it? = \nIt was easy really. About six months into the process I met a healthcare worker who said to me: “If you don’t give us permission to laugh, I’ll wring your neck!” So once that permission button had been activated I was able to help the audience laugh with (not at) the people on stage. The second half is a total farce [hitting people over the head with handbags, etc] and the healthcare worker get the chance to the mock the doctors a bit. And the doctors who came to see the play all put their hands up and acknowledged that it was the nurses who really know what’s going on. \n= Do you think dementia has been a theatre taboo in the past? = \nI think a lot of artists have been a bit frightened to go there, but what would be wonderful is if this encourages more people to go there in whatever capacity of the arts, be it dance or anything. \n= How did you go about avoiding audience discomfort? = \nI made three promises: that I would create a beautiful piece of theatre; that I would touch the heart as well as the mind; and, most importantly, to not be judgmental. \nThere are examples in the piece of bad practice and there were positive and negative responses from the nurses. But the way it was done in the piece was not through judgment. It places the undervalued and underappreciated workers centre stage, and lets the healthcare workers bring family and friends along and show them what they do, because a lot of them don’t get the chance to talk about the special work that they do. \n= So how has the Lottery been able to help you? = \nThe theatre tour woudn’t have been possible without the funding, but what it’s also been able to do is bring this to thousands of people, and some of whom have never been to the theatre before. \n= How do you feel about arts funding in this country? = \nWhat we’ve learnt through this work is that you can chuck money at the problem, you can put all the research into finding the drugs that will help but we are way down the line to finding a cure. The only thing that is working is the application of the arts using the senses is the only route through. It’s the same with education. What we are not seeing is that the arts aren’t just a little appendage for a few to enjoy, it’s not just entertainment. In any culture or country that prioritises the arts, you will find a healthier society. \nYou can vote for all the shortlisted projects at lotterygoodcauses.org.uk/awards \nThe winners of the 2015 National Lottery Awards will be announced on BBC One in September", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T00:17:53.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
