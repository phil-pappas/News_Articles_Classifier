Quinn Rooney Share on twitter by Michael Smith It would have been unthinkable a year ago to imagine Qantas dishing out generous bonuses to staff. Chief executive Alan Joyce implemented a wage freeze for all staff as the airline recorded heavy losses amid some of the toughest conditions in the airline's history.\nBut Joyce is now playing Santa, announcing $90 million in bonus payments for 28,000 staff. Joyce's decision has even received rare praise from the unions that have been calling for his head for years.\nThe tide has clearly turned for Qantas following a dramatic turnaround in the airline's financial performance, thanks to a heavy cost-cutting program, improved market conditions and lower fuel prices.\nQantas's accountants have cleverly timed the payment so the one-off cost will not be recognised until the airline's 2016 financial year. The payment is also be recognised outside of underlying earnings, which means future costs and earnings targets will also not be affected.\nSYDNEY, AUSTRALIA - FEBRUARY 26: Qantas CEO, Alan Joyce poses for a photo after the half-year results briefing in Mascot, on February 26, 2015 in Sydney, Australia. (Photo by Jessica Hromas/Fairfax Media) *** Local Caption *** Alan Joyce Jessica Hromas This allows Joyce to meet targets set last year as part of its transformation program while delivering a badly-needed morale-booster to staff. The bonus payment will be recognised in the 2016 financial year when it will not be as noticeable if the airline posts a $1 billion profit as analysts are forecasting.\nThe caveat in the announcement is that the 5 per cent bonus currently only applies to around 7,500 employees currently covered by the wage freeze policy under around 15 EBAs already finalised.\nThe remaining staff will be eligible once the outstanding enterprise bargaining agreements (EBAs) are finalised. Many of the EBAs are on three-year cycles and have not opened up yet. Agreements covering about 12,000 of those staff affected are expected to be finalised by the end of the year. The remaining will be finalised in the 2017 financial year.\nA cynic would suggest the bonus that has been structured is a carrot for staff to sign up to the EBAs. It will obviously help things along, but many of the more contentious agreements, including those with short-haul pilots, engineers and Transport Workers Union staff, have already been nutted out.\n The bonuses do not extend to management bonus schemes. The board will make a decision in August on the remuneration of Joyce and other senior Qantas executives. Management pay at Qantas has not increased since 2012, but it is safe to assume the airline's executives will be due a windfall this year as they meet their performance targets, following the company's now strong financial position.\nQantas has done this before. It announced a bonus for staff in 2002 following a pay freeze in 2001.\nThe bonus averages out to around $3000 per employee if you divide the number of staff by $90 million, but obviously the amount will vary widely if you are a baggage handler versus an A380 pilot.\nThe amount being offered reflects the fact that an 18-month wage freeze would account to around 5 per cent of the airline's costs. Most of the airline's pay deals traditionally equate to an increase of around 3 per cent per annum.\nQantas says the bonus is a thank you to staff who have endured plenty of pain over the last 18 months, as the airline lost money and tackled its high cost base. The challenge is incentivising its staff without giving up the gains made reducing its cost base permanently.\nMichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-07-03T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:06:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
