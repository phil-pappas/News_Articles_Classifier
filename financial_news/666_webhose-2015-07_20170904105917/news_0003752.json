Analysts estimated $4.43 a share.\nChipotle raised prices an average of 6 percent last year to help make up for higher costs of ingredients like beef and dairy. So far, customers have been willing to pay up, drawn by the burrito chain’s promise of better ingredients. They’ve also continued to show up at Chipotle’s restaurants even as it suffers from a shortage of pork used in its carnitas filling. Despite the higher prices and pork scarcity, sales at Chipotle’s established locations rose 4.3 percent in the quarter.\n“They have a lot at their disposal to drive same-store sales,” Peter Saleh, an analyst at BTIG, said in an interview. “They still have room to raise prices.”\nWhile the second-quarter same-store sales gain trailed analysts’ average estimate for a 5.8 percent increase, Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung said on a conference call Tuesday that those sales have gained at a low single-digit percentage so far this month.\nThe shares climbed as much as 8.3 percent to $728.83 in New York, the biggest intraday gain since July 22, 2014. The stock had been down 1.7 percent this year through Tuesday’s close.\nChipotle also repeated its expectation that it will have carnitas back in all of its restaurants this year and announced that its board had added $100 million to its share buyback program.\nNew Restaurants Chipotle is adding new restaurants at a faster clip to help boost sales. The company said Tuesday that openings will be at the high end of its projected range of 190 to 205 locations this year, or even exceed that estimate. That would bring its base to more than 2,000 restaurants.\nThe rapid openings helped total revenue in the quarter rise 14 percent to $1.2 billion. Analysts estimated $1.22 billion.\nChipotle said in April that its higher prices still weren’t enough to cover the cost of beef used for its steak and barbacoa burritos and that it was considering raising prices again this year. In addition, Chipotle is paying more for its tortillas as it switches to flour that’s organic, unbleached and unenriched. The company raised prices by an additional 4 percent earlier this month in some locations.\nPrice Increases Meanwhile, the company held off on raising prices for steak and barbacoa in the approximately 40 percent of its restaurants where it doesn’t have carnitas. Hartung said the company will raise prices at those locations as it resupplies pork.\n“We wanted to avoid the unintended consequence of having customers trade from carnitas to steak and barbacoa and be forced to pay more for their meals,” he said.\nThe company has been trying to boost its pork supply since January, when it suspended a supplier for not meeting its pig-housing standards. As a result, the company pulled carnitas from about a third of its restaurants. Chipotle recently added a British pork supplier , allowing it to add carnitas back to the menu at its more than 100 locations in Florida.\nChipotle said it recently began testing chorizo in the Kansas City area and will expand the product if it proves to attract new customers to the chain, as opposed to providing another option for regular customers switching from chicken or steak burritos.\nAs part of its effort to tout its ingredients, Chipotle debuted a new game on its website that allows customers to compare and contrast ingredients used by Chipotle with those found in traditional fast food.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T18:03:56.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
