Those groups featured among laggards during a seven-day slump the index snapped on Tuesday.\n\"Energy was hit so hard, on Monday it felt like a bottomless pit ... (so) it stands to reason that if there's a temporary turnaround in sentiment for the sector, it'll be led by the big names,\" Picardo said.\nSuncor Energy jumped 4.3 percent to C$34.62, while Canadian Natural Resources Ltd lost 1.3 percent to C$30.75.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index ended up 224.44 points, or 1.59 percent, at 14,301.80.\nThe most influential movers were financials. Royal Bank of Canada rose 2.8 percent to C$75.65, Toronto-Dominion Bank advanced 2.9 percent to C$52.64, and Bank of Nova Scotia added 3.2 percent to C$63.36.\nNorman Levine, managing director at Portfolio Management Corporation, said he was particularly positive on Canadian life insurers because of their U.S. exposure as they will benefit from higher U.S. interest rates, and with large U.S. operations, will also benefit from improvements in the U.S. economy.\nManulife Financial Corp gained 2.1 percent to C$22.98 and Sun Life Financial Inc rose 2.6 percent to C$42.40.\nCanadian National Railway Co gained 1.8 percent to C$81.08 and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd rose 2.8 percent to C$209.26.\nLevine cautioned investors not to pin their hopes on commodity stocks, since prices were not going to recover anytime soon.\nBombardier Inc gained 7.1 percent to C$1.95 despite the company denying a report that said the plane and train maker was in talks with German engineering group Siemens AG around a rail merger.
