However, only 30 per cent of Indian gold jewellery is currently hallmarked. There are widespread differences in purity and an average under-caratage of anywhere from 10% to 15%. \nThe lack of BIS-recognised hallmarking centres across the country is also likely to have an impact on the successful implementation of the Indian Government's gold monetisation scheme which is dependent upon the collateralisation value of gold, further added. \nThe report is clear the development of a more stringent system would deliver huge benefits to the Indian gold market including: increased trust amongst overseas buyers and financial markets, resulting in a larger export market, a stronger domestic market and job creation across the spectrum. \nGoodReturns.in", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T10:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T11:24:47.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
