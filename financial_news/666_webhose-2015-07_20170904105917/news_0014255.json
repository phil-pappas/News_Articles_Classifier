They extended gains and German bunds fell after a letter from Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras showed he offered to accept proposals from Greece’s creditors to end a standoff over its aid program, subject to certain conditions.\nEuro-area finance ministers will hold a teleconference call on Wednesday to discuss Greece, signaling the deadlock between the nation and its creditors may be easing.\n“The market is still hoping for a last-minute deal,” said Felix Herrmann, a market analyst at DZ Bank AG in Frankfurt. “There’s still a chance Greece can survive all this. At the same time, the market also knows the mechanisms that were installed are strong enough to cope with a Greek exit or Greek default.”\nAmid faith even a worst-case scenario can be contained by the euro-region’s firewall, the market’s reaction is a marked contrast to the region’s previous debt crisis, when Italian and Spanish yields soared amid concern the turmoil would spread to other indebted countries.\nYields Slide Italy’s 10-year bond yield fell 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, to 2.24 percent at 10:33 a.m. London time on Wednesday, after dropping six basis points the previous day. The 1.5 percent security due in June 2025 rose 0.805, or 8.05 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,113) face amount, to 93.57.\nWhile the yield climbed 24 basis points on Monday after a weekend of turmoil in Greece, that was only the biggest increase since May 5. In November 2011, yields reached 7.48 percent.\nSpain’s 10-year yield dropped 10 basis points to 2.21 percent, and that on German bunds, the euro area’s benchmark sovereign securities, increased five basis points to 0.82 percent.\nWhile more people still intend to vote “no” in Greece’s referendum on creditors’ proposals for unblocking aid, their number has fallen since the closure of Greek banks, a poll for Athens-based Efimerida ton Syntakton newspaper showed .\n“Greece is in arrears to the IMF, opinion polls show the ‘no’ side with a significant lead ahead of the referendum, albeit with signs that lead is falling in the face of empty ATMs and yet markets are calm,” Kit Juckes, a London-based strategist at Societe Generale SA, wrote in a note to clients. “The impression I get is still that the consensus view expects Greece to reach a deal with creditors and remain in the euro, either before Sunday or after a ‘yes’ vote. This may be right, but seems complacent to me.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T12:47:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
