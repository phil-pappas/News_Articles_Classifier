This statement will likely be seen as a minor step, pointing to a September move as squarely on the table,\" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst with Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc. in Washington.\nThe dollar was last up 0.3 percent at 123.91 yen, while the euro was down 0.7 percent at $1.0983.\nThe dollar index was 0.4 percent higher on the day at 97.159.\nMeanwhile, an initial drop in oil prices exerted downward pressure on the Australian dollar and other currencies closely linked to commodities. A rebound in the oil market helped pare losses in those currencies but their sell-off resumed due to the perceived hawkishness of the FOMC statement.\nThe Australian dollar was last down 0.6 percent at $0.7291 while the New Zealand dollar was down 0.3 percent at $0.6670.\nThe kiwi held firm earlier after the country's central bank governor played down the chances of more deep rate cuts.
