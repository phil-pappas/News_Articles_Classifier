Both Greece and China are on their minds. Bloomberg \"If you are looking for the market to give you a take on the economy, you are probably looking at the wrong place.\"\nIndeed, International Monetary Fund chief economist Olivier Blanchard on Thursday described the Chinese stock market as a \"casino\" that was largely disconnected from the economy.\nThis may explain why Roach is instead looking with more trepidation at Greece's debt crisis.\nGreece only makes up about 2 per cent of Europe's GDP and its economy is about the size of the state of Victoria's.\n Yet Roach, now a senior fellow at Yale University, heard similar reassurances before other unforeseen market meltdowns.\n\"What makes me nervous is the conviction that there can't be contagion,\" says Roach.\n\"This is exactly the same story we heard as the dotcom bubble and [US] subprime mortgage market was bursting.\"\nMost pundits have been more concerned about China than Athens' stand-off with European creditors, since the Shanghai stock market hit turbulence this month. It is an unusual situation when top market watchers are arguing about which of two huge economies, the European Union and China, poses a greater threat for investors.\nGlobal markets on edge Entering the weekend, global markets remained on edge. A possible Greek sovereign debt default and Grexit will come to a head at crucial summit with European creditors.\nBlackRock's chief investment strategist in New York, Russ Koesterich, says that even under the worst-case scenario, Europe and the world economy can survive Grexit.\n\"But similar to the story about China, if we do wake up Monday and it looks like a deal is out of reach, there is going to be a knee-jerk reaction,\" Koesterich told CNBC this week.\n\"I'd watch the bond yields in Portugal, Spain and Italy as a key indicator.\"\nStruggling southern European economies have in the past flirted with exiting the euro to wipe out their debts and to devalue their currencies to become more competitive. So cutting Greece loose raises the possibility of contagion spreading to other struggling southern European economies.\n\"If there is a Greek exit, can the ECB [European Central Bank] contain the contagion to other peripheral European countries?\" Koesterich asks.\nOnce again, seven years after the global financial crisis led central bankers to unleash their fire hoses and make unprecedented interventions in markets, there is an addiction to liquidity from policymakers.\nMany in the market are betting the ECB would come to the rescue by ramping up its €60 billion-a-month money-printing program. ECB president Mario Draghi has been in the thick of the negotiations between Merkel and Tsipras.\nIn a similar vein, the US Federal Reserve is under pressure from the IMF to keep interest rates around zero until next year. The fund this week lowered its global growth forecast to 3.3 per cent – the weakest since the world economy shrank in the financial crisis in 2009.\nThe reliance on authorities to boost growth and solve the market's problems are even more pervasive in China, where policymakers' credibility has taken a severe hit in recent weeks.\n\"I think it is where faith in policymakers could take a big hit,\" says J2Z Advisory principal Jay Pelosky.\nThe loss of stockmarket investor confidence raises questions about the ability of Chinese authorities to carry through their challenging economic transformation and plans to liberalise their financial markets.\nThe Chinese masses piling into shares via risky margin loans has been well documented. Yet amid this maelstrom, it should not be forgotten that only 10-15 per cent of Chinese households own stocks, compared to 38 per cent of Australians and about 50 per cent of Americans. The bulk of China's stockmarket is controlled by the rich.\n\"It affects the wealthy, but not regular Chinese citizens so much,\" says Sean Miner, the China program manager at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. He previously lived in Beijing for three years.\nUnknown factor However, the unknown factor is the impact of falling share prices on investment by businesses and state-owned enterprises, which makes up 48 per cent of the country's GDP. \"It may affect companies' ability to borrow and some firms may start to pare back purchases of land or equipment,\" Mr Miner said.\nPelosky says Chinese companies have issued well over $US100 billion in equity this year to hungry investors to pay down expensive corporate debt. The debt-for-equity swap that China's equity bull market allowed \"is no longer feasible and makes it harder for China to help its highly indebted companies,\" Pelosky says.\nBut most close observers believe the bear market will not spread violently.\nUS Treasury Secretary Jack Lew says China's stock markets are separated from the world economy and financial system. But the recent instability does raise longer term issues. \"How do Chinese policymakers respond to this and what does it mean in terms of the core condition of the economy?\"\nThe answer is of great importance to Australia, a huge commodity exporter to China. As BHP Billiton's chief commercial officer Dean Dalla Valle said in Washington on Wednesday, China is trying to rebalance from an over reliance on investment and manufacturing exports to be more driven by domestic consumption.\nBack in the US, the turmoil overseas and softness in the domestic economy, are giving the Fed consternation about its plan to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade. Minutes released this week from the Fed's June 16-17 meeting, before the worst of the overseas turbulence struck, noted \"uncertainty about whether Greece and its official creditors would reach an agreement and about the likely pace of economic growth abroad, particularly in China and other emerging market economies.\"\nCapital Economics chief US economist Paul Ashworth says those \"concerns will undoubtedly have grown in the past few weeks\".\nThe Fed's mandate is the US domestic economy, so the chaos abroad should only influence its actions if external events spill into the US.\nRaising rates But Fed watchers believe offshore events, at least at the margin, could be the latest excuse for the Fed to delay its plan to raise rates in September or December.\n\"If they're on the fence, you could argue it could delay the onset of Fed normalisation,\" says Roach, who served on the research staff of Fed.\nThe Washington-based IMF this week ramped up pressure on the Fed to defer raising rates, warning that economic growth could be \"significantly debilitated\" by a soaring American dollar.\n\"Should the Fed raise rates the risk of a policy mistake is higher given rest of world is weaker,\" Pelosky says.\nAmid the uncertainty in Europe and China and crashing commodity prices, global capital is flowing into safe haven US-dollar assets like Treasury bonds, sending the greenback to around decade highs versus the euro and Japanese yen. At home, the Australian currency dipped below US74¢ for the first time in six years this week.\nAt Martin Place, Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens has been eager to see the Fed raise rates to help lower the Australian dollar. But like the rest of the world, he will surely be paying close attention to events in China and Greece.\nEven if the financial market ructions are largely immaterial for the longer term health of the world economy, investors may still respond emotionally to surprises in the near term.\n\"If we have an environment that is risk-off sentiment because of the Chinese stock market and issues in Greece, it's unrealistic to believe it won't affect investor behaviour,\" Koesterich says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T10:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:09:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
