The production of eggs were besieged in May by an avian flu, the first U.S outbreak, while beef producers will still face the effects of the drought in the western Great Plains in 2012 and 2013. These disruptions in supply affect producers, distributors and restaurant owners immediately, but consumers do not feel the effect for several months. \nWhen the avian influenza spread across farms in many states, the supply of eggs was cut drastically by 10% to 12% to contain the disease, Graeff said. The shortage affected a wide range of businesses from family-owned restaurants that sell breakfast to companies that use egg whites to make mayonnaise, salad dressing and cake mixes. The adverse effect pushed prices to unprecedented uptick levels -- costing another $0.60 to $1 per dozen.
