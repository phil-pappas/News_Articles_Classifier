It should also combine with more assessment and treatment of drivers who have alcohol issues. \nOne New Zealand company selling the products says the devices cost between $150 and $175 per month. \nA report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the interlock devices have resulted in a 70 percent reduction in repeat offences while they're installed. \nHowever, only about a fifth of those arrested for drink driving have interlocks installed. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T02:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T04:38:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
