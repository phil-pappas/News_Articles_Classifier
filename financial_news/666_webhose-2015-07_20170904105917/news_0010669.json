Shares of GoPro GPRO, -1.57% fell 1.6% to $50.94 on Monday.\nContrary to more bearish Wall Street analysts, Jankowski doesn’t think GoPro’s business will commoditize. She predicts that its strong content engagement – GoPro has roughly 3.5 million subscribers on YouTube – has created a “powerful consumer brand” that will support margins and market share growth in the future.\nGoldman Sachs Goldman Sachs highlights the virtuous cycle that it believes can be produced with the combination of GoPro hardware and content creation. She even compared GoPro to Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.35% and Fitbit Inc. FIT, -4.85% in that its hardware updates and content creation may create a “virtuous cycle” for the company with a solid mix of hardware and software demand.\nGoPro has been investing more money in content creation. Earlier this year, it announced a partnership with Vislink to produce a transmitter that athletes and other content creators could use to live-stream broadcast-grade footage.\nGoldman sees additional sources of monetization through its treasure trove of content down the road as well, such as advertising, licensing, live TV and content distribution akin to the models of Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.56% and Hulu.\nThat said, Jankowski believes that maintaining GoPro’s calendar-year 2016 price/earnings ratio of 28x would require GoPro to sustain 20%-plus growth over the next three-plus years, which she said hinges on the success of its still unproven entry into the drone market.\nGoPro’s stock is down 20% year-to-date, compared with a 1% increase for the broader S&P 500.\nRising saturation of the action camera market also prompted Goldman Sachs to predict that GoPro’s revenue would decelerate this year, though Jankowski said she expects it to reaccelerate into 2016 as GoPro begins selling to quadcopter drones.\nShe also cited recent data from IDC that predicts the sale of more than 15 million action and point-of-view cameras in 2017, up from just 9 million in 2014.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T07:36:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
