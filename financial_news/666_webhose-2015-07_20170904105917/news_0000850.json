(5:00) Barron's Senior Editor Jack Hough previews the current issue of Barron's, including signs that it's time to consider being bullish on Japan. Photo: AP\n“Smart beta,” as the icky marketing label suggests, is Wall Street’s latest sales pitch. Depressed by tumbling expenses on plain-vanilla index funds, and the persistent failure of most “active” investment managers to beat the market, the clever people in the money game have come up with new products to boost profit margins at little cost.\n“Smart beta” exchange-traded funds act a little like traditional index funds, only instead of dumbly following a market index, they follow a “factor” index — such as investing in the MSCI index of “high-quality” stocks or “low-volatility” stocks.\nIt’s not quite as bad as the gimmick sounds. Quite a lot of academic research, as well as some plain common sense, has shown that over the long term investors have actually done pretty well by sticking to the stocks of high-quality companies, or stocks that are cheap in relation to their fundamentals.\nThe problem is that most of this analysis is based on theory and ‘back-testing.’ And as Andrew Lapthorne and the quant team at SG Securities report, in a new note circulated to clients, there is a big difference between theory and practice.\nIn the real world, these investment strategies can involve hefty trading costs and performance risks, they note. Indeed, other Wall Street players can game the system, and drive up your costs, by buying certain stocks shortly before they get included in a “value” or “quality” index.\nAnd in many cases such strategies can only work either in theory or when applied with small amounts of money. Once billions start pouring in — like, say, when your financial adviser and every other financial adviser starts selling these products — they don’t work in the same way.\nTrading costs and portfolio churn needed to follow one of these factor indexes can cut annual returns by anywhere from half a percentage-point to one-and-a-half points, they estimate. And the effect of pursuing these strategies with billions of dollars can drive down returns by anywhere from an estimated half-point to three-and-a-half points a year, they add.\nSG Securities analysts are using their own estimations and assumptions, but you have to start somewhere. And their caveats make sense. Stocks are merely claims on a company’s future profits. Ultimately there is only one way any investment strategy can succeed: By buying those stocks for less than those profits are worth. If the market tends to undervalue the merit of “high quality” companies, you can make money over time by buying them. But once everyone starts pursuing a “quality” strategy, the price of quality stocks will rise and they will no longer be a bargain.\nSG does not mention another issue with factor investing: management fees. Many “smart beta” or “factor” exchange traded funds charge somewhere around half a percentage-point a year. That may seem low by the standards of traditional money management. But if all they are doing is following an index, it doesn’t seem a bargain.\nIf it costs 0.5% a year to run a “smart beta” fund, plus let’s say 0.75% a year in trading costs, and the growing popularity of the strategy shaves one percentage-point a year off returns, investors may find that all of the advantages they were hoping for have evaporated.\nRecently I suggested, slightly tongue in cheek, that the answer might be “dumb alpha” — randomly picking a few dozen stocks ourselves and buying them directly, in equal weights, through a low-cost broker.\nThe more I think about it, the less tongue in cheek that seems.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T17:44:30.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
