this would raise more domestic resources with which to finance their own development without overdependence on aid. \nBut the proposal was shot down, leaving the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as the only intergovernmental body that adopts global standards on tax matters. \nAs a consolation, the CSOs were promised that a few changes would be introduced to the existing UN expert committee on the matter, to take in their concerns. \nThe CSOs issued a joint statement after the failed negotiations on July 15, under the title; Failure in Addis Ababa: Trouble ahead for development. \nIn the statement, they slammed the UN for turning down a proposal that would have literally helped developing countries to own their development financing destiny in the long run. \n\"It is a tragic day for all of us, because a global tax system where half of the world's countries are excluded from decision-making will never be effective,\" said Alvin Mosioma, the executive director of Tax Justice Network Africa. \n\"As long as our governments keep failing to cooperate on tax matters, multinational corporations will be able to dodge taxes; in the end, the Addis Ababa failure will impact us all.\" \nA recent panel commissioned by the African Union and chaired by former South African President Thabo Mbeki found that Africa loses a minimum of $50 billion annually in Illicit Financial Flows (IFF) mainly in form of tax evasion practices by multilateral corporations. \n'Stop the bleeding' \nLast month, civil society organisations launched a campaign dubbed 'Stop the bleeding,' aimed at capturing the attention of influential international organisations such as UN to intervene with policies that would put an end to IFF from Africa. \n\"This came down to power. The powerful simply didn't want to cede one ounce of their authority to the rest of the world, and they succeeded in preserving their control,\" Mosioma added. \nPooja Rangaprasad, of the Financial Transparency Coalition, said the failure of the new proposal helped rich countries to maintain a status-quo where money goes from south to north, but the rules follow the opposite route. \n\"Developing countries have fought hard for this body but today's agreement will do nothing but keep them in a patronising system where a group of 34 countries hold all of the power,\" Rangaprasad said. \nJorge Coranado, the president of Latin American Network on Debt Development and Rights, also voiced his dismay pointing out that rich countries had connived with their multinational corporations to oppose reforms in the global tax policies. \n\"This is a dangerous failure of multilateralism and a triumph for a few. This will simply continue to allow the powerful to dictate taxation rules for the entire globe,\" said Coranado. \nTove Maria Ryding, with the European Network on Debt and Development (Eurodad), also expressed her anger saying it was a painful moment to see the developed countries celebrating the fact that nothing will change about global taxation rules. \n\"Tahis sets a terrible precedent for the post-2015 and climate negotiations. This was never a negotiation in good faith, and the developed countries have consistently refused to even discuss the issues on the table,\" said Ryding. \nOn average, developing countries collect just 13 per cent of their GDP in tax compared with 34 per cent in the developed countries because of weak tax administration and huge revenue losses through tax evasion practices by multinationals. \nAmong the targets reportedly floated in Addis was how low income countries can be helped to increase their tax collection to at least 20 per cent of their GDP on account that it would help them to invest in education, health and infrastructure, hence promoting growth. \nThat's basically what the CSOs were pushing for in their proposal - the establishment of an intergovernmental UN body on tax matters. \nHowever, the refusal by the Addis conference to support the proposal is likely to cultivate some suspicion as to whether there is political will in the international community to empower poor countries to a position where they can fund their post-2015 sustainable development goals.
