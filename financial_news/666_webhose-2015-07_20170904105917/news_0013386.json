AAA notes that 41.9 million people were expected to make trips of 50 miles or more for July 4th weekend. That was the largest July 4th crowd since 2007, spurred on by sub-$3 gas prices that were an average of $88 cents less than they were last year. \nHowever, as the folks at travel site Hopper note, the best weeks to travel during the summer haven't arrived yet. With few exceptions, the last two weeks in August are a great window for summer travel. Even with domestic airfare prices down 10% this summer, those waning summer weeks can knock $80 to $100 off the price of a flight to New York, San Francisco, Orlando or Miami. Leave on a Tuesday or Wednesday, and you can knock another $40 off the ticket price.

Why? Because much of the nation just spent its entire summer traveling and is worn out. Many of those who do have the energy left to take another trip will have to expend it taking their kids back to college or shopping for school clothes and supplies. That means you could wait out the travel industry and take advantage of the off-peak pricing of post-Labor Day September through early November, but you'd get none of the weather. \nWith help from the folks at Hopper and TripAdvisor, were were able to narrow down the list of late-summer destinations to the following ten. They're inexpensive, but we'd still advise booking sooner rather than later: \n10. Orlando, Fla. \nEven the purported vacation capital of the world has an offseason. In Orlando, the Disney, Universal and Sea World folks are forced to go into discount mode by August temperatures with an average high around 92 degrees and August rainfall that averages more than seven inches. Oh, and it's still Florida in the middle of hurricane season, which means you're rolling the dice and really hoping that storms veer off into the Gulf or make landfall on top of some poor suckers to the north. Still, TripAdvisor puts the average cost of a three-day trip for two at around $1,500, which is a steal compared to the $2,100 folks pay to visit Seattle during those same two weeks. However, with just a $43 average discount from peak airfare prices, we don't blame folks for avoiding the storms and seeing orcas in their natural habitat. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T01:42:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
