Reuters Share on twitter by Karen Maley There are three key reasons why Beijing faces a long - and likely unwinnable - battle as it tries to shore up its ailing share market.\nIn the first place, even though Beijing has already spent hundreds of billions of dollars buying shares, investors continue to question its determination to prop up the market.\nIndeed, Monday's sell-off in Chinese markets, which ended up with the Shanghai Composite Index plunging 8.5 per cent in its biggest drop since 2007, appears to have been triggered by fears that Beijing was scaling back its share purchases.\nInvestors were also jittery that China's government could even be about to test whether the market was strong enough to support itself.\nChina shares tumbled 8.5 per cent on Monday. Rickety edifice of margin loans But there is a second, and much more worrying, reason why Beijing's efforts appear doomed to failure.\nThat is that the Chinese share market rests on a rickety edifice of margin loans, which are estimated to total several trillion yuan.\nIndeed, it was the enthusiasm of Chinese investors – particularly the less sophisticated retail punters – for margin loans that helped push the Shanghai index up by a staggering 150 per cent from the beginning of the year to its June peak.\n The amount of money borrowed from brokers to invest in the share market soared from 400 billion yuan ($88 billion) in July 2014 to 2.3 trillion yuan at its peak almost a year later. What's more, investors possibly borrowed as much as 2 trillion yuan through other channels to pour into shares.\nTypically, Chinese investors are able to borrow $1.25 for every $1 of cash they hold, which enables them to leverage their exposure to the share market. The problem is that if the share market falls sharply, brokers issue \"margin calls\" asking investors to top up their cash. If they fail to do so, the broker will liquidate their shares.\nBecause many Chinese households waded into the market when it was at its peak, they have now either received, or are close to receiving, margin calls. And even though official margin loans outstanding have dropped to 1.4 trillion yuan from 2.3 trillion yuan, the huge volume of margin loans that still need to be unwound is casting a huge shadow over the market, leaving it extremely vulnerable to savage sell-offs.\nThe risk is that the market drops so precipitously that it's not only investors with margin loans that have their shares sold – which pushes the market even further - but that the brokers themselves suffer losses. The pain could even extend as far as the country's banks.\nGrowth outlook Finally, investor confidence in the Chinese share market has been undermined by renewed fears about the country's growth outlook. This was highlighted on Monday with the release of official figures showing that China's industrial profits fell 0.3 percent in June from a year earlier, as falling prices squeezed profit margins.\nThe slowdown in Chinese growth and the spread of deflationary pressures partly stem from problems in the country's real estate market – which is estimated to account for just over one-quarter of the economy when construction, steel and related industries are included.\nWhen demand for housing started to pick up just over a decade ago, the mining and manufacturing sectors were quick to feel the benefits. The boom in construction of new housing led to rising demand for steel, copper and other materials, as well as for construction equipment and household appliances. In turn, the makers of those products boosted investment to meet the stronger demand.\nBut in the past few years, demand for housing has hit a plateau, leaving many developers saddled with unsold inventory. In turn, industries that are reliant on construction have suffered from weaker demand, and have been forced to cut output and prices.\nAdding to the pressures on growth, Chinese commodity producers – particularly the big state-owned enterprises – have been hard-hit by the collapse in global commodity prices. They've responded by cutting back their spending, which has led to weaker demand both for machinery and equipment, and also for the services of transport and utility firms. This has added to the deflationary pressures in the economy.\nThe problem is that although the impressive run-up in the Chinese share market to its June peak bore little connection with the underlying performance on the Chinese economy, its collapse is likely to worsen the country's economic woes.\nThat's because the atmosphere of gloom is likely to spread well beyond the 90 million Chinese who like to dabble in the share market. Even those who haven't lost any money are likely to respond to the steep share market slide by cutting spending and becoming more cautious.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-07-28T05:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T05:04:54.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
