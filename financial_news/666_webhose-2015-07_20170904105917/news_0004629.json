This is clearly the case in dollar-Asia,\" Citi strategist Luis Costa told clients.\n\"The nature of this EM currency selloff is two-fold in our view: Fed fears and the commodities downtrend. We tend to be a lot more concerned with the commodities downtrend, because this is structural and it has come to stay.\"\nSentiment also took a knock after data showed South Korea's economy grew 0.3 percent in April-June over the previous quarter, the slowest since early-2009. It is the latest developing economy to post disappointing economic data.\nThe malaise is hurting funds investing in emerging markets, with Aberdeen Asset Management shares at one-year lows after the EM-specialist asset manager said investors withdrew $15 billion in the April-June quarter.\nIn emerging Europe, the rouble fell 0.7 percent to the dollar, hurt by oil weakness while the lira hovered near one-month lows as investors awaited the outcome of coalition talks between Turkish political parties.\nThe central bank is expected to hold interest rates steady on Thursday, as many see it keeping its powder dry in case the failure of coalition talks sparks a lira selloff.\nThe rand was flat, after Wednesday's softer-than-expected inflation data cast doubt on whether South Africa would resort to its first rate hike in a year. Economists are split on the rate rise possibility.\n\"We are in the 'hold' camp...the idea is that they will give a very hawkish signal. A lot of the factors supporting the hawkishness have reversed, like oil has worried them a lot, but that has changed,\" said Ilan Solot, a strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.\n\"We think there are enough arguments for holding fire just now, and maybe raise later in the year.\"\nSolot expects fresh elections in Turkey and added: \"We think the lira will go back to test its (record lows) from June.\"\nOne-month risk reversals - a gauge of demand for options betting on a currency's rising or falling - show the bias for dollar strength versus rouble and lira is at the highest since early-April and early June respectively .\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2015, see link.reuters.com/jus35t\nFor GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2015, see link.reuters.com/weh36s\nFor GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging Europe performance 2015, see link.reuters.com/jun28s\nFor GRAPHIC on MSCI frontier index performance 2015, see link.reuters.com/zyh97s\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see ) (Additional reporting by Karin Strohecker ; editing by Susan Thomas)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T13:04:51.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
