Brendan Esposito by Angela Macdonald-Smith A gain in production has softened the impact of lower LNG prices for Santos, which reported sales in the June quarter of $786 million, down 19 per cent from a year earlier.\nOutput in the quarter was 12 per cent higher than in the same period last year, at 14.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, and edged up 2 per cent from the March quarter. Production was boosted by a full quarter of output from the new Papua New Guinea LNG project, in which Santos has a stake.\nBut the sales figures fell short of UBS's estimate of $847 million, which was based on expected production of 14.2 million boe.\nImportantly, Santos chief executive David Knox reported that the $US18.5 billion GLNG venture was progressing toward completion, with first LNG production expected \"around the end of the third quarter\", in line with guidance given in May.\nMr Knox also highlighted the cuts Santos has made on capex and operating costs after last year's dive in crude oil prices. Spending so far this year is down 53 per cent from last year's levels, while production costs for the first half are \"tracking below guidance\", at $14 per barrel of oil equivalent, he said.\nSantos maintained all its guidance for 2015, including full-year output of between 57 million and 64 million boe, and capital expenditure of $2 billion.\nSantos reported an average price for oil sold in the June quarter of $82.59 a barrel, down 32 per cent from the $121.51 obtained in the same quarter last year. But the price climbed 15 per cent from the first three months in the year.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T05:02:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
