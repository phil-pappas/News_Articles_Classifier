So far the response from homebuyers has been very strong. CHICAGO\nChicago-based @properties has announced that Phase I sales for Basecamp Old Irving Park, a new single-family home development on Chicago's North Side, have surpassed the 50-percent sold mark.\nThe developers, a joint venture between Ranquist Development Group and Stocking Urban LLC, recently finalized their purchase of the land for Basecamp Old Irving Park and will begin work on the site this month.\nLocated at 3700 N. Milwaukee Ave., just south of the historic Six Corners district, Basecamp Old Irving Park will consist of 48 single-family homes, with four- and five-bedroom floor plans starting at $479,900.\nThe community features contemporary architecture by Chicago-based Pappageorge Haymes Partners. Homes offer large open floor plans, 10’ first-floor ceiling heights, upscale finishes, a private two-car garage and spacious backyard. The community also has its own pocket park, and puts homeowners within walking distance of neighborhood parks, shops, restaurants and public transportation including Metra and CTA Blue Line trains.\n“Single-family home inventory in the city is so low, and what’s out there in terms of new-construction is hard to call a value. With Basecamp Old Irving, we’re bringing almost 50 new homes to the market with pricing, plans and finishes that are right in the sweet spot of demand,” said Zev Salomon of Ranquist Development. “So far the response from homebuyers has been very strong.”\nBasecamp Old Irving Park is the latest development from Ranquist, which has been one of Chicago’s most active neighborhood builders during the past couple of years. Recently completed Ranquist projects include Backyard Andersonville, Basecamp River North, and Flexhouse and Flexhouse II in Logan Square and Avondale. Each development features a modern aesthetic similar to Basecamp Old Irving Park.\n“Ranquist has a knack for understanding what buyers want. Their homes always have a degree of originality and innovation, and are just plain cool. On top of that they offer a great value, so it’s no surprise that they tend to sell quickly,” said @properties broker Heather Gustafson, sales agent for Basecamp Old Irving Park.\nSite preparation for Basecamp Old Irving Park will begin in July, with groundbreaking for the new homes slated to start in October. First deliveries are planned for spring 2016.\nA sales center and model unit is located off site in River North at 455 W.
