Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Opposition leader Bill Shorten has decided to take on the Left of his party and support turning back asylum-seeker boats if Labor's win the next federal election.\nMr Shorten will make his argument for the policy change at the Labor National Conference this weekend as part of his announcing Labor's immigration policy.\nAs previously reported by The Australian Financial Review , a deal is being negotiated between factions with the aim of leaving the policy platform blank on the issue of turnbacks – neither supporting it nor opposing it. This would give any future Labor government the discretion to apply the policy should it feel the need.\nMr Shorten will argue on Saturday for that option.\nMr Shorten confirmed on Wednesday he would propose a renewable energy target of 50 per cent by 2030 at the conference and side with union concerns about the China Australia free-trade agreement.\nGovernment claims that Labor's misgivings over the trade deal were driven by xenophobia were dismissed as absurd and offensive by shadow trade minister Penny Wong.\nSenator Wong, who experienced racism as a child, said concerns from Labor and the unions about provisions in the agreement relating to the importation of Chinese workers were legitimate and Trade Minister Andrew Robb had a responsibility to respond.\n\"This is an absurd allegation from Mr Robb,\" she said. \"Rather than engaging in spurious and offensive attempts to distract the public, Mr Robb should answer the questions Australians have about this agreement.\"\n Senator Wong revealed to the Financial Review last week that Labor would seek to tighten provisions of the trade agreement when it comes before Parliament this year to be enshrined in legislation.\nThe trade union movement is campaigning hard against the same provisions and will move a motion at this weekend's Labor national conference, the party's top policymaking forum, seeking to bind Labor to reject elements of the agreement.\nThe Chinese have warned they have the right to renegotiate elements of the trade agreement if any changes are made. Mr Robb said the criticism was a \"vile, xenophobic scare based on falsehoods\" and vowed to not change a word.\nNot opposed to the FTA Mr Shorten said on Wednesday Labor was not opposed to the trade deal and it contained \"definite and important benefits.\n\"But no way can Labor simply just expect to rubber stamp a deal which sells out Australian jobs,\" he said.\n\"Mr Abbott thinks that life is about win-lose – he wins and other people lose. We're going to propose sensible amendments in the Parliament to make sure that Australians get priority and jobs in Australia and we don't see rorts of the 457 and other visas.\"\nMr Shorten said he supported free trade and guest workers \"but we want to make sure that where you've got unemployment, where you've got Australians willing to work, this trade agreement doesn't open the floodgates and let these people in, in favour of other arrangements negotiated by this government.\n\"A free-trade agreement should never be increasing the cost of living by causing greater unemployment and denying our own young people jobs of the future.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-22T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:07:08.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
