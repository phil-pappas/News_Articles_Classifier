Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell Local investors are warning that Australia is in for tougher years than many other nations as global markets grapple with a slower growth outlook.\nThe International Monetary Fund has already downgraded its global growth target by 0.2 per cent to 3.8 per cent in 2015. It comes as post-global financial crisis bull markets are running out of steam and entering a more volatile period.\nAt a briefing event in Sydney, Wingate Asset Management's chief investment officer Chad Padowitz and Platypus Asset Management chief investment officer Donald Williams said Australia's dependence on commodities in a slowing global growth environment was going to hurt.\n\"For the first time in a long time Australia is on the wrong side of global growth. From the dot.com crash until very recently, we have been able to ride out the wobbles but that has now turned,\" Mr Padowitz said.\n\"Everything here is going to be much tougher than before and compared to the rest of the world.\"\nCommodities crunch The Australian sharemarket has already been hit by the commodity crunch, most miners shedding multi-percentage points in the past few weeks.\nIn the last month, Rio Tinto has lost 7.7 per cent, BHP Billiton has lost 8.6 per cent and Fortescue Metals Group has lost 21.1 per cent.\n Mr Williams said Australians needed to get used to a slower-growing country and a new range of GDP totals.\n\"The reality is the growth pulse of the world is not strong enough for commodities to lift off again,\" he said.\n\"The only bright spot in the economy is property, and that's very mature now. We're going to get used to GDP growth whose handle starts with a two, rather than a three like we are now.\"\nRBA warning The warnings echo a caution issued last week by Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens, who said Australia needed to rethink its ideal growth rate.\nMr Stevens pointed to low population growth and other demographic factors as possibly the main drivers of the need for an adjustment.\n\"If there are assumptions about absolute growth rates embedded in business or fiscal strategies, or retirement income plans, they would need to be re-examined,\" Mr Stevens said.\nFlatlining prices Both Mr Williams and Mr Padowitz said they expected commodity prices to flatline for years, with the first likely uptick to be oil in 2017 or later.\n\"The most optimistic commodity at the moment is oil at its current price ,\" Mr Padowitz said, adding he saw no reason for the iron ore price to improve for many years.\n\"China doesn't recycle as much steel as it will, so they may not need more iron ore for a long, long time.\"\nMr Padowitz said there was a small chance commodity companies had hit the bottom of their range, if the past few weeks turned out to be a capitulation.\nMr William said the only commodity companies he might look at investing in within the next few years would be oil companies, provided they had reduced costs significantly.\nHis fund at Platypus Asset Management has limited commodity exposure, although one of the roughly 35 securities they hold is Gold Road Resources, which has a market cap of $686.4 million. Mr Williams said they had no plans to sell out of it despite the gold price dipping under $US1000 per ounce last week.\nAcorn Capital head of equities Douglas Loh said the bottoming out of Australia's big miners was a timely reminder that local investors should more proactively seek out investment options with exposure to Asia's growth.\n\"Now the commodity cycle is ending, everyone who thought they had exposure to Asia is suffering,\" Mr Loh said, adding that he thought investors should allocate about 70 per cent of their available funds earmarked for emerging markets to Asia, rather than the 5 to 10 per cent Australian investment groups currently allocate.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-asx-in-stunning-turnaround-20150728-giltmm", "https://99.fairfax.com.au/business/the-economy/rbas-glenn-stevens-australia-may-need-to-rethink-growth-20150722-gihsvm.html", "https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/why-bhp-billiton-is-being-hit-so-hard-as-iron-ore-oil-and-copper-prices-plunge-20150728-gilaf2", "https://twitter.com/rosepowell"], "published": "2015-07-28T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:04:05.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
