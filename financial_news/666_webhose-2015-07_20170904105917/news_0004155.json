The diffuse perception of the phenomenon undermines citizens' confidence in institutions and in politics,\" the Bank of Italy's Financial Intelligence Unit said in an annual bulletin sent to parliament.\nWhile the number of reports - up at 71,700 in 2014 from the previous year - was due to closer scrutiny by bank personnel, the report also said money laundering poses a \"very significant\" threat to Italy's economy, the euro zone's third-largest.\nMafia groups such as Sicily's Cosa Nostra, the Camorra around Naples, or the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta have long had a stranglehold on swathes of the south, and recent investigations have documented their spread north to Rome, Bologna and Milan.\n(Reporting by Steve Scherer; Editing by Louise Ireland )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T14:53:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
