Germany's DAX was seen falling 294 to 328 points, or as much as 3 percent lower, and France's CAC 40 was seen slipping by 134 to 143 points, or down as much as 3 percent. \nStunned European leaders called a summit for Tuesday to discuss their next move after the surprisingly strong victory by the 'No' camp defied opinion polls that had predicted a tight contest. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's deputy said Athens had wrecked any hope of compromise with its euro zone partners by overwhelmingly rejecting further austerity.
