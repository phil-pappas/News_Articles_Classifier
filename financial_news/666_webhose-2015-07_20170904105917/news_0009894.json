The landmark deal will be signed Sunday between SkyPower and Kenya's ministry of energy. \nThe announcement, made during the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES), underlines the raft of investment deals signed between global companies, financiers, entrepreneurs and governments. Related Topics Rwanda: Cimerwa Unveils New Rwf126.7b Plant \nSkyPower has developed over 25GW of solar power projects worldwide, with 6 GW having been recently announced in bilateral agreements for development in Egypt and Nigeria over the next five years. \nIn March this year, SkyPower and International Gulf Development (IGD) signed an agreement with the government of Egypt to develop 3 GW of solar power, a project that would be implemented over four years at a cost of a $5 billion. \n\"SkyPower develops, finances, owns and operates solar energy projects from the initial stages through commercial operation in more than 60 countries around the world,\" the company says on its website. \nINSTALLED CAPACITY \nKenya is keen to ramp up its power capacity to 5,000MW by 2018. Currently, the country has an installed power capacity of about 2,000MW. The country is moving to tap into renewable power production sources such as geothermal, wind and solar. \nThe country is also targeting to explore a coal project in Kitui to boost power capacity, a development set to bring down the cost of power and of doing business in the country. \nA number of deals seeking to increase power production in the country were also signed at the GES meeting in Nairobi. US multinational, General Electric (GE), signed a Sh15 billion deal with Kenya's Kipeto Energy to build a 100MW wind power station in Kajiado County. \nThe Sh15.5 billion ($155 million) deal also includes a 15 year service agreement, with GE being the sole supplier of wind turbines and other equipment for the project. \nEarlier this month, power producer, KenGen said it would build a 400 MW wind power plant in Meru beginning next year. The first phase of the project, which will generate 100 MW, will cost Sh27 billion and is set for completion in 2017. \nKenya, in collaboration with private investors and development finance institutions is also developing a 300MW Lake Turkana Wind Power Project in the north-east part of the country. \nThe renewable energy initiatives in the country demonstrate increasing governments, private sector and development financiers in fulfilling President Obama's Power Africa initiative, which seeks to add more than 30,000 MW of \"cleaner, more efficient electricity generation capacity as well as increased power access with 60 million new connections throughout Sub-Saharan Africa\". \n\"Our Power Africa initiative has been leveraging private capital to invest in electrification all across the continent. Our preliminary goal was 10,000 megawatts; now we're looking at 30,000 MW and we're well on our way. \nSome of those megawatts are going to be generated by very traditional power plants and the traditional financing and large-scale capital,\" US President Barack Obama said on July 25 at the GES in Gigiri, Nairobi. Kenya \nEmbassava Sacco has struck out 314 matatus from its fleet of 733 vehicles saying it no longer owns them. see more » Copyright © 2015 The Nation. All rights reserved.
