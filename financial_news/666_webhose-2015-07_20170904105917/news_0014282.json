It’s like stumbling on a little piece of Positano or Capri in the middle of a sleepy surf town – sun-bleached Cabarita Beach in northern NSW.\nPaper Daisy, the hotel restaurant, serves the kind of clever food – clean, produce driven and created around a bespoke wooden fire grill – that you’d expect to find in a chic metropolitan eatery. And the decor is comfortably luxurious yet whimsical rather than formal: rich fabric-upholstered walls, hand-picked antique treasures and original art from around the world, with a theme of deep blue and white set off by touches of gold.\nThe owners, Brisbane-based sisters Siobhan and Elisha Bickle and husbands Adam Flaskas and Dave Wadley, fell in love with the old Hideaway site and bought it in 2011. It was their first hotel development, having spearheaded the award-winning Bunk Backpackershostel and Victoria Park function centre in inner-city Brisbane.\nPaper Daisy, the hotel's restaurant, serves the kind of clever food – clean, produce driven and created around a bespoke wooden fire grill – that you'd expect to find in a chic metropolitan eatery. They engaged architect Virginia Kerridge, winner of the 2013 AIA Interior Architecture Award for the Lilyfield Warehouse in Sydney’s inner west, to redesign the hotel and she has kept some of the nostalgic Spanish-style archways and breezeways. However, white-washed walls, carefully manicured grounds and the now uber-stylish rooms and restaurant have breathed new life into an old surfside favourite.\nFor the interior, the owners travelled to New York with designer Anna Spiro to buy vintage pieces as well as furnishings from designers and artists. There are John Derian sofas, Madeline Weinrib rugs and drawings by Wayne Pate, all brought to life by a team of bespoke craftsmen, including lampshade makers and furniture restorers.\nIn the suites and restaurant these finds sit alongside antique seascapes collected from around Australia. The rooms, which start at $550 a night for a king suite and go to $1500 for a two-bedroom suite, make use of fabrics from Britain. Each room has its own aesthetic; the idea is that guests will find a favourite to which they can return.\nThere are plenty of diversions at Halcyon House: take a surfing lesson with world-class board rider Joel Parkinson, attend a cooking class, walk or recline on the nature reserve and beach or do nothing but relax on the balcony or poolside, while working on a Mediterranean-style tan. A hairdressing salon and full day spa are planned.\n In the restaurant, dine on light and flavoursome dishes from a menu that has an emphasis on seafood and incorporates native bush foods, greens and herbs. Head chef Ben Devlin, named Brisbane Times Good Food Guide Young Chef of the Year in 2014, was previously chef de cuisine at the three-hatted Esquire and, before that, worked in Copenhagen for acclaimed chef owner Rene Redzepi at the two-Michelin-starred Noma.\nThe pipis with lemon myrtle, butter and warrigal greens are a sublime blend of squeaky fresh shellfish in a rich seafood stock, while the swimmer crab with soft tofu, citrus and buckwheat combines subtle and zesty flavours that surprise the palate. Lamb belly with grilled cabbage, horseradish and almonds, and pastrami beef on rye bread with sauerkraut and pickle are also popular dishes.\nThe dessert reflects the fun that sparkles behind both the decor and the hotel philosophy, with gourmet-style ice-cream flavours such as cheese and berries presented in delicate waffle cones.\nHalcyon House is a 20-minute drive from Gold Coast Airport and a 30-minute drive from Byron Bay but eons away from the city bustle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:15:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
