Advertising Print This Post J uno Markets, a recently established New-Zealand headquartered and Asia focused global brokerage , has just announced a strategic partnership with Tradeworks, the Denmark and Singapore-based online solution for building, testing and automating FX trading strategies. Tradeworks is the recently renamed business of Magick . The name change came as the firm rolled out several new features and upgrades; specifically the platform’s back testing capabilities. Tradeworks is designed to enable traders create automated trading strategies on an easy-to-use interface without any need for programming. The strategies are cloud-hosted and run independent of the client terminal without the need for a VPS. Morten Fillipsen, co-CEO of Juno Markets explains the rationale of partnering with Tradeworks added: “We believe in specialization, and we endeavor to bring the best possible trading environment to our clients and partners. With their intuitive and simple-to-use platform, Tradeworks have successfully broken down the barriers to create automated trading strategies. This is something a lot of our clients and portfolio managers are interested in so we see this as a perfect complement to our offering.” Mikael Breinholst, CEO of Tradeworks: “With their focus on serving portfolio managers and IBs across Asia, Juno Markets is an excellent partner for Tradeworks. I have known Morten Fillipsen professionally for many years and I am very impressed with how he, and the Juno Markets team, have approached the Asian market where they already have a strong foothold. Juno Markets’ in-depth knowledge of retail FX in Asia will serve us well and I am confident that the joint venture between Tradeworks and Juno Markets will be very beneficial for both parties”. The partnership with Tradeworks follows the recent launch of the Juno Markets Portfolio Manager platform and this segment in particular is a focus for the new partnership as Arthur Le, co-CEO of Juno Markets comments: “Smaller portfolio managers will typically come from a technical trading background, but perhaps lack the skills to code and maintain a traditional Expert Advisor type algo. Through the partnership with Tradeworks, the portfolio manager will now be able to easily convert his strategy into an automated algo, while at the same time enjoying the sophisticated allocation tools in our Portfolio Manager system.
