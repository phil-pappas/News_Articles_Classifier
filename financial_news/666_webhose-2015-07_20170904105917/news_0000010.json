Photo: Reuters\nWild gyrations in Chinese equities left their mark on the local sharemarket, with the ASX 200 plunging sharply in early trade before recovering just as dramatically to end the day slightly lower.\nThe benchmark index had braced itself for a hit at the open after China's Shanghai Composite Index fell 8.5 per cent after the local market closed on Monday, and the ASX200 duly fell around 1 per cent in early trade.\nBut it quickly shot higher, briefly trading in the black after Shanghai trimmed early 5 per cent losses, before finishing the day a relatively modest 5 points, or 0.1 per cent lower, to 5584.7, while the broader All Ordinaries index ended down 0.15 per cent at 5571.\nThe Shanghai Composite also briefly traded higher around midday but by the afternoon had fallen back into the red, down 1.5 per cent.\n\"What we saw today was first of all a reaction to events overnight, in terms of commodity prices and European and US bourses, followed by a reaction to the recovery in the Chinese market,\" Patersons economist Tony Farnham said.\n\"We had a reasonable fall in the SPI futures last night, and we reflected that early on. But then the talk started coming through that the Chinese authorities had intervened after the Shanghai index fell 8.5 per cent,\" Mr Farnham said.\nIn further evidence the Australian dollar is tracking the fortunes in China, the Aussie hit a fresh six-year low of US72.57¢ prior to the Chinese bourses trading, when futures showed its sharemarkets were poised for sharp losses. Later in the day the currency jumped back above US73¢.\nThere was no official word from the Chinese government on Tuesday but the talk was the Shanghai Composite Index's reversal of fortune was due to government funds buying up big bank, brokerages and oil stocks, while the central bank injected 50 billion yuan into money market, in its biggest liquidity boost in three weeks.\nSupport buoys Asia markets IG markets analyst Evan Lucas said it was clear Beijing would support the market at its 200-day moving average \"come hell or high water\".\nThat support buoyed markets around the Asia, he said.\n\"As soon as the cash market opened at 11.30am [Beijing time], everything around the region was rallying,\" he said, including the ASX which moved 65 points in the space of 90 minutes.\n\"There was some very impressive trading,\" he said.\nBut the best performing stocks of the day were a mixed bag, with Sandfire Resources up 3.5 per cent, G8 Education, up 3.1 per cent and Greencross, up 2.9 per cent.\nThe best-performing sectors were energy, up 0.8 per cent; utilities, up 0.4 per cent; and health, up 0.3 per cent.\nOrigin Energy's shares jumped 2.7 per cent to $11.45 after it announced its Australia-Pacific LNG project was on track to meet its export target.\nMeanwhile, blue chip CSL Ltd led the health index after gaining 1.6 per cent to $96.17 following news the US Food and Drugs Administration would review its haemophilia treatment after positive clinical trials.\n\"CSL is one to watch this earnings season, you may actually see the first three-digit stock for a very long time,\" Mr Lucas said.\nOn Tuesday morning, ahead of the FDA news, Citi upgraded CSL from a \"sell\" to \"neutral\" with a target price of $101.58, citing its diverse portfolio.\nMiners lose ground In the big miners, BHP Billiton fell 0.6 per cent after a rollercoaster session which saw it fall 2 per cent, while Rio Tinto lost 0.2 per cent. Fortescue Metals Group gained 2.3 per cent.\nThe banks were also mixed, with Commonwealth Bank and ANZ Banking Group up 0.3 per cent each, while Westpac fell 0.4 per cent as IT issues weighed and National Australia Bank shed 0.2 per cent.\nWoolworths fell 0.2 per cent, Wesfarmers rose 0.2 per cent, and Telstra finished the day flat.\nThe market would be led by global economic drivers in a quiet week of local data, Mr Farnham said.\n\"The next one for us will be the Reserve Bank meeting next week, and our reporting cycle, with the big companies due to report in a little while, \" Mr Farnham said.\nGlobal markets would take their lead from the last hour of China's trading, which Mr Lucas said usually proved to be \"feverish\", after the close of the ASX.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T06:49:20.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
