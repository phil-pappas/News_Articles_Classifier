Sahlan Hayes Share on twitter by Joanna Mather New rules for superannuation boards will require the replacement of 40 chairmen and 200 directors at a minimum cost of $20 million, but the lobby group for bank-owned funds wants the law tightened even further.\nThe Abbott government has proposed a law requiring all super funds to have at least one-third independent directors and an independent chairman from July 1 next year.\nThe change would affect industry, public sector and corporate super funds most because they operate on an equal representation model, with half of the directors appointed by an employer body and the other half by a union.\nThe government's draft law says anybody with a \"material relationship\" to a fund cannot act as an independent director.\nIn a submission to Treasury about the draft legislation, the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees estimates that 200 directors, or trustees, will have to be replaced, along with 40 chairmen.\nThe institute's governance chief Eva Scheerlinck said the cost of recruiting new directors, plus the extra fees charged by independent directors, would add up to at least $20 million, which would have to come out of members' money.\n\"There seem to a lot of risks and costs for no quantifiable benefit,\" she said.\nThe institute believes the equal representation model has served members well and insists there is no hard evidence to suggest independence in itself leads to better outcomes.\n But the Financial Services Council said the new laws did not go far enough. It wants a list of \"prohibited relationships\" enshrined in the legislation to safeguard against conflicts of interest and a ban on directors sitting on more than one super fund.\nFurthermore, super fund boards should be required to at least consider installing independent chairmen on their various committees, the council says.\n\"The draft legislation is a good start [but the council] has made practical recommendations to the government to raise the bar further to ensure all super funds have the highest level of corporate governance,\" council chief executive Sally Loane said.\nThe new rules start to apply from July 1, 2016, although there is a three-year transition period.\nKing & Wood Mallesons partner Nathan Hodge said the legislation did not adequately define independence. Problematically, that job would be left to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, he said.\n\"So you're leaving the person who is supposed to be regulating the law to set the law,\" Mr Hodge said.\n\"APRA more recently has power to set governance rules but this seems to be a new level of detail.\"\nScott Donald, director of the Centre for Law, Markets and Regulation at the University of NSW, has raised similar concerns .\nBut the Business Council of Australia backs the changes , as does peak body, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-07-23T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T17:07:03.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
