The government has not shut down. So why haven't state lawmakers gone home for summer vacation? They still have work to do. \nThe Legislature worked until dawn Wednesday trying to resolve policy issues related to the budget.

Lawmakers may try again next week after the holiday weekend. \nThe class size initiative, 1351, matters because the $38.2 billion budget signed by the governor just before midnight Tuesday does not includes the estimated $2 billion in state dollars needed to hire more teachers and shrink class sizes in grades 4 through 12 for the next two years. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T02:29:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
