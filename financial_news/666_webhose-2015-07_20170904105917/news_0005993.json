Picture: SUNDAY TIMES MEMBERS of Parliament from the portfolio committee on social development are on a week-long visit to the Northern Cape to inspect facilities aimed at tackling the province’s substance-abuse problem‚ which is linked to a high incidence of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder.\nMEC Mxolisi Sokatsha told committee members that foetal alcohol spectrum disorder was prevalent among farming communities in Upington and De Aar‚ and was even worse in Kimberley‚ with Galeshewe township recording rates of 11% per 1,000 young people.\n\"This means well over 60 per 1,000 youths have permanent irreversible brain damage due to alcohol damage during pregnancy. Both rural and urban areas are negatively impacted in the same way‚\" Mr Sokatsha said in a statement.\nMPs will this week visit rehabilitation centres in Kimberley and De Aar‚ among other places.\nActing chairwoman of the committee‚ Hope Malgas‚ said the committee wanted to determine if the department’s programmes were having an impact‚ especially in resolving the triple challenges of poverty‚ unemployment and inequality.\n\"Substance abuse is not only limited to the Northern Cape. The Nelson Mandela Metro (Port Elizabeth) and the farming communities in the Western Cape suffer from this condition (as well).\n\"It is really said to see children born with this condition‚\" Ms Malgas said.\nShe said the committee had identified substance abuse strategies in the province as a particular area of interest.\nRDM News Wire", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T02:23:59.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
