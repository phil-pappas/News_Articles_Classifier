Photo: Louise Kennerley\nQBE Insurance Group has sold its mortgage and lender services business in North America for $90 million, ramping up its strategy of shedding businesses that it deemed non-core to the global insurer's overall operations.\nQBE, which has a market valuation of $19.7 billion, will sell the M&LS division to National General Holdings in a deal that is expected to generate a loss of $120 million for Australia's biggest global insurer in fiscal 2015.\nThe losses are due to one off non-cash charges and write-offs, some of which will be booked in the group's upcoming half year results in August.\n\"As previously advised, we have been evaluating a range of strategic options with regards to the M&LS business in North America,\" QBE chief executive John Neal said in a statement.\n\"The sale of this business is a pleasing result as we look to focus on commercial lines and significantly build out our specialty underwriting capabilities in North America.\"\nMichael Karfunkel, chairman and chief executive Officer of National General said the acquisition facilitated the group's entry into the lender-placed insurance segment for auto and homeowners risks.\n\"While the lender-placed business has had difficulties in the past, we believe it is now an area of great opportunity after numerous changes that have been enacted throughout the industry,\" he said.\nThe sale is expected to free up over $100 million of capital for QBE, which will be used for reinvestment in other areas of the North American business.\nRevenue, or gross written premium, will also fall by $400 million following the sale. QBE however expects to improve its North American operations' combined operating ratio and return on allocated capital by around 1.5 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively after the transaction.\nThe latest deal comes after QBE sold its agency businesses to Alliant Insurance Services for $US300 million earlier this year.\nQBE has been busy trying to simplify its business, which expanded aggressively under the watch of former QBE boss, Frank O'Halloran. The insurer entered North America in 2006 and was hit by a series of problems including severe drought claims, losses from Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and problematic lenders-placed insurance arm.\nThe latest deal is expected to be completed on September 30.\nQBE shares closed 1 per cent or 14 cents higher to $14.39 on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T05:12:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
