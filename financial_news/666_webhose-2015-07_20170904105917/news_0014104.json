The plan is being opposed by investors who say it would put the onus on them, instead of the banks, to close trades on time or forfeit that interest, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information isn’t public.\n“If what is being proposed is implemented, they will basically be moving away from a compensatory system towards a punitive one,” said Steve Kieselstein, whose law firm advises investment firms on loan trades. “The real question is how will market participants avoid being stripped of compensation if they have been blamed for delays on a trade unfairly.”\nThe push-back to the plan proposed by the Loan Syndications & Trading Association highlights the market’s challenges in moving away from antiquated practices that result in an average of almost 20 days to settle trades. The pressure to hasten transactions has mounted amid a surge in loan funds that must meet investor redemptions faster than the trades can be completed.\n‘Significant Improvement’ “The LSTA believes that these recommendations provide incentives for significant improvement in the functioning of the loan market,” Bram Smith, the LSTA’s executive director, said in a statement. “We all look forward to the support of the entire membership as we implement the proposal in due course as a significant step to reducing settlement delays.”\nTrading in the loan market reached a four-year high of $647.4 billion last year, according to the LSTA, as issuance of collateralized loan obligations, the biggest buyer of leveraged loans, rose to a record $123.6 billion. At the same time, almost $24 billion was withdrawn from loan mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, according to Lipper.\nThe slow settlement times are receiving more scrutiny as regulators draw attention to the risk that mutual-fund investors will be stuck holding illiquid fixed-income assets when sentiment sours.\n‘Sea Change’ “The push is a sea change in the way the LSTA approaches closing delays,” Kieselstein, founder of Kieselstein Law Firm, said in a telephone interview.\nInvestors are currently compensated by being paid interest on the loan they want to purchase as they wait for the transaction to close. These payments, which kick in seven days after a trade commences, were introduced as a way to work around settlement delays.\nIn April, the LSTA told members about its plans to fix the delayed compensation process, three of the people with knowledge of the communication said.\nUnder the proposal, buyers have to provide proof they have funds available to close a trade. They would also need to pick a deadline for closing the trade within seven days. Failure to meet these conditions could mean investors forfeit any interest received during the settlement process.\nThe LSTA’s proposal isn’t requiring the bank brokering a trade to procure a loan within a week, two of the people said.\nLock-Up Risk “There is the risk, if you lock up your funds for however many days, and for whatever reason the bank can’t deliver the trade, you are out of luck.” Sabur Moini, a money manager at Payden & Rygel, said in a telephone interview.\nThe market has other logjams that aren’t addressed by the delayed-compensation proposal.\nLeveraged loans remain constrained by administrative bottlenecks. In many instances, consent is needed from a company for trading its loan. In other cases, a borrower may disqualify some investors from purchasing its debt. And then there are cases where a bank administering a loan might deliberately delay settlement if an investor asks another dealer to broker a trade, three of the people said.\nParticipants also have been seeking to automate trading in a portion of the market since 2007, replacing communication by fax machines with electronic messaging.\n“It’s a step in a the right direction to improve settlement time, especially with the growth in the loan market,” Moini said. “But investors are reticent about any proposal to give up the delayed compensation, especially when settlement can take such a long time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T15:12:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
