Photo: Andrew Quilty\nAustralian shares continued their recovery rally on Thursday to close at a three-week high, as concerns over the Greek debt and Chinese equities crises further eased.\nThe benchmark ASX200 index added 0.6 per cent to 5669.6, posting its third day of gains, while the broader All Ordinaries rose 0.5 per cent to 5649.8.\nNews that the Greek parliament had passed tough economic reforms cheered investors, and sentiment was also helped by Chinese stocks rebounding from early losses to trade higher for the first time in three days in a volatile session.\nThe Shanghai Composite climbed back into positive territory, rising nearly 1 per cent in late trade after erasing a loss of as much as 3.1 per cent in the morning.\nThe Australian market \"started strongly and then came back a little bit which I don't think is a huge surprise after yesterday,\" said Aurora Funds Management chief investment officer John Corr.\n\"Telstra is a big focus ahead of its result in mid-August. Resources were weak but yield names seem to be pretty strong.\n\"You're seeing the banks reasonably well bid and Telstra well bid, and that's reflecting domestic investors at work being happy to focus on Australia rather than overseas situations that are a little bit more problematic at the moment.\"\nThe falling Australian dollar had not boosted the market as expected, he said. \"You would have expected better support for heavy miners given the weaker dollar, but that's not really happening.\"\nAmong blue-chip stocks, Rio Tinto only increased 0.35 per cent to $53.31 after being forced to slash a forecast of its iron ore exports for 2015 after weather and other factors weighed on first half exports.\nRio had previously hoped its iron ore shipments would be \"approaching 350 million tonnes\" in 2015, but said it now expected them to reach 340 million tonnes from its operations in Canada and the Pilbara region.\nRio's competitor in the heavyweight ming stakes, BHP Billiton, added 0.7 per cent to $27.08. Fellow blue-chip stock Telstra easily outperformed the market, climbing 1.2 per cent to $6.46.\nAmong the banks, ANZ Bank lifted 0.7 per cent to $32.64, Commonwealth Bank 1 per cent to $87.96, National Australia Bank 1.6 per cent to $34.32 and Westpac 1.8 per cent to $34.63.\nDespite the iron ore price recovering to around $US50.55 a tonne after sinking to a six-year low of $US44.59 a tonne last week, pure-play iron ore miner Fortescue sank 1.4 per cent to $1.75.\nFellow miner Atlas Iron announced it would be offering new shares at 5¢ each, with a free option at 7.5¢, as part of a $180 million raising. They were trading at 12¢ before being suspended in April. The lead manager of the raising, Hartleys, is turning to fund managers to try to make up the shortfall that still stands at $105 million.\nAmong the few sectors to post a decline, energy fell 0.9 per cent after oil prices slipped on Wednesday night.\nWoodside shed 1.1 per cent to $34.57 as the plunge in liquefied natural gas prices, following last year's dive in oil prices, drove its second-quarter revenues down 46.5 per cent, in line with market expectations.\nQBE climbed 2 per cent to $14.67 after selling its mortgage and lender services business in North America for $90 million, ramping up its strategy of shedding businesses that it deemed non-core to the global insurer's overall operations.\nQBE, which has a market valuation of $19.7 billion, will sell the M&LS division to National General Holdings in a deal expected to generate a loss of $120 million for Australia's biggest global insurer in fiscal 2015.\nPrimary Health Care was the day's biggest loser , slumping 8.1 per cent to $4.77 after the company posted a profit warning after the market closed on Tuesday. Primary lowered its earnings guidance for 2014-15 and admitted that it would deliver a 5 per cent fall in underlying net profit.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/brand/chanticleer/bad-weather-not-iron-ore-forces-rio-tinto-to-cut-2015-output-forecast-20150716-gidenc", "http://www.afr.com/news/world/interactive-explaining-chinas-market-dilemma-20150716-gidow5", "http://www.afr.com/business/health/hospitals-and-gps/primary-health-care-shares-slump-after-earnings-confession-20150716-giditp", "http://www.afr.com/markets/forget-greece-and-china-heres-what-investors-really-need-to-watch-20150716-gidfa1"], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:48:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
