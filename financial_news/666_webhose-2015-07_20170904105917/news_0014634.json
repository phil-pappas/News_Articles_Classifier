Glenn Hunt Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires The problems in the eurozone are dominating global market consciousness, and the risk that the deepening crisis will push markets down in coming weeks means it's a good time to seize some discounted stocks, stockbroking firm Morgans says.\n\"We know that markets discount uncertainty so it's not surprising they have already retreated back to 'fair value',\" Morgans equity strategy analyst Andrew Tang wrote in a note.\n\"Despite this gloomy context, the 6 per cent fall in the market since May has started to throw up some interesting opportunities,\" he said.\nMr Tang has selected nine stocks worth buying this month that he believes will outperform the market.\nAmong those are some surprises, including ANZ, which along with the other three big banks had sparked the sell-off earlier in the year, and BHP Billiton, whose share price has fallen 20 per cent since April amid falling iron ore prices.\nAmcor Limited\n\"[Amcor is a] high quality, defensive business with growth from emerging markets,\" Mr Tang said.\n\"Given its defensive characteristics, we think the stock should be well supported in the current volatile environment.\"\n The company reports in US dollars, and a fall in the Australian dollar to US73Â¢ levels will deliver a boost to the share price, he said.\nANZ Banking Group\nDomestic banks should continue to perform well with further interest rate cuts looking likely, he said.\n\"We think ANZ offers the best value of the major banks (on a price-earnings ratio and yield basis), and should deliver return on equity expansion as it gains economies of scale in its Asian operations\", Mr Tang said.\nBHP Billiton\nThe miner's demerger has shed less profitable operations from its asset portfolio, including South32, resulting in a leaner, simplified business. It has also flagged potential M&A activity in copper and oil, two of Morgans' preferred commodities.\n\"We expect BHP's portfolio of predominantly high-margin business segments will underpin its progressive dividend, supporting a fully-franked dividend of 5.3 per cent,\" he said.\nFederation Centres\nFederation's merger with Novion Property Group has made it a top 30 stock, with a market capitalisation of around $22 billion.\n\"Given the increased size and scale we expect the merged group will become meaningful for both offshore and domestic investors,\" Mr Tang said.\nQantas\nMr Tang said Qantas is poised to return to near-record profits on the back of lower oil prices and its $2 billion cost-out program. It can also expect revenue to be boosted by an increase in capacity and ticket prices as domestic and international travel picks up.\n\"News flow is a key share price driver of airline stocks and the next six to 12 months is likely to remain positive,\" he said.\nRamsay Healthcare\nRamsay has the obvious benefits of an ageing population. It also delivers above market growth at 18 per cent per annum on average and is forecast to grow at 15 per cent per annum, Mr Tang said.\nResMed\nDespite a recent disappointment of the SERVE-HR clinical trial, Mr Tang said the trial, which represented less than 2 per cent of all devices sold, was ringfenced from the broader business. Its quarterly results were above market expectations, recording 14 per cent sales growth.\nSydney Airport\n\"Interest rate costs are expected to fall materially, as out-of-the-money interest rate swaps expire and are replaced at far lower interest rates,\" Mr Tang said.\nThe lower interest rates combined with the solid earnings growth should boost distribution and create capital management opportunities, he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-07-02T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:06:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
