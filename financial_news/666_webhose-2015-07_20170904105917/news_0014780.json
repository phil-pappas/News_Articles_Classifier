Louise Kennerley by Sally Rose A shocking end to June in global equity markets, amid turmoil resulting from the Greek debt crisis, has pulled down the estimated median annual return for the average Australian superannuation fund member below 10 per cent for the first time in three years.\nThe result and reaction to Greece's weekend referendum, on whether or not to accept the terms of its creditors, will set the tone for global financial markets at the opening of the new financial year. But super fund investment chiefs are confident that even a worst-case scenario will not have any significant impact on their medium to long-term strategy.\n\"Any market panic based on the possibility of Greece defaulting on its debts and being forced out of the eurozone will ultimately represent a great buying opportunity. In terms of medium-term risk, I am more worried about China,\" UniSuper chief investment officer John Pearce says.\nAs recently as three weeks ago, the annual average return for super fund members in a growth option was tipped to come in above 11.5 per cent. On June 30, super fund ratings group Chant West said fund members now looked likely to narrowly miss out on a third consecutive year of double-digit returns.\nThe superannuation industry research firm estimates a median return of about 9.5 per cent for the 2014-15 financial year from the growth funds in which the majority of Australian workers are invested by default. But the performance of the best and worst funds is tipped to range from as low as 6.5 per cent to as high as 12 per cent.\nStrong returns Chant West director Warren Chant says that while it feels like Greece spoiled the party, the superannuation industry has still delivered another year of strong returns.\n\"Following returns of 15.6 per cent in 2012-13 and 12.8 per cent in 2013-14, this really underlines a full recovery from the global financial crisis. The last negative return was back in 2008-09. Since then, we've had six straight years of positive returns, adding up to about 73 per cent growth overall or an average of 9.5 per cent per annum\".\n That represents a return of about 7 per cent per annum above the inflation rate, well ahead of the typical longer-term objective for growth funds to beat inflation by between 3 per cent and 4 per cent annually.\n\"Generally speaking, the stronger-performing funds in FY 2014-15 will be those that maintained a relatively high exposure to foreign currency [because of the decline in value of the Australian dollar] and Australian listed property, and a lower exposure to Australian shares, bonds and cash,\" Mr Chant says.\nSuper fund members who elected to have their retirement savings managed under a more aggressive growth strategy over the past financial year have been rewarded. Fund members who dialled their risk all the way up to invest 100 per cent of their retirement savings in growth assets are set for returns in the range of 8 per cent to 15 per cent, with a median return of 12 per cent.\nIt was a very tough year for conservative investors, as the lowest global interest rate environment in modern history led to ultra-low returns from bond yields. The range of returns for members invested in a conservative strategy, the most popular option for people post-retirement, is tipped to be between 3.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent with a median annual return of 5.9 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T01:02:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
