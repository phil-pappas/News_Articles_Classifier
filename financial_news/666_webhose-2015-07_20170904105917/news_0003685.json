Marco Del Grande Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Durkin Author and journalist Peter FitzSimons has been appointed chairman of the Australian Republic Movement as it overhauls its team and reboots plans for a high-profile campaign ahead of the next federal election.\nThe Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull has also reiterated his support for the republic cause but cautioned supporters they may have to wait until a change of monarch to achieve success.\nMr FitzSimons, a Fairfax Media columnist who is married to the Nine Network's Today host Lisa Wilkinson, will throw his weight behind the push and identified Prime Minister Tony Abbott as the last political obstacle to a republic.\n\"I do believe that the Prime Minister will be in all likelihood our last monarchist Prime Minister,\" Mr FitzSimons told The Australian Financial Review .\n\"Whatever happens from this point should it be Labor or should it be another Liberal, in all likelihood there will soon be bipartisan support in the federal leadership. I don't know if Tony Abbott is going to be there for 10 days, 10 months or 10 years but there will come a time in the next political cycle will there be bipartisan support for a republic,\" he said.\nRenewed debate Mr Abbott ignited the debate on a republic earlier this year with his unilateral decision to award as knighthood to the Duke of Edinburgh .\nBut Mr FitzSimons denied that citizens would have to vote for a change of government to achieve a republic.\n \"Who knows who will succeed Tony Abbott but one possibility would be Julie Bishop who I believe is a republican, Joe Hockey is certainly a republican and I know Malcolm Turnbull is as devoted to the republican movement as he was in 1999, so there is support for a republic in the high echelons of the leadership of the Liberal Party,\" he said.\nCommitted to a republic Mr Turnbull told the Financial Review that he was as committed to a republic as he had ever been and supported a plebiscite to determine whether a head of state should be determine by parliament or popularly elected.\n\"Winning a referendum is obviously enormously hard and we all understand that you would need enormous momentum and a sense of timing and the next big watershed event is going to be after the Queen's reign,\" he said.\n\"If we are going to be a republic then I think there is merit in holding a plebiscite to determine [the model] then that verdict would inform the choice for a referendum.\"\nOn September 9, the Queen becomes the longest-reigning monarch in British history and reports have emerged that Queen Elizabeth has stopped breeding her Pembroke Welsh corgis partly because she does not wish to leave any of her beloved pets behind when she dies .\nMr FitzSimons – who will lead the push for a plebiscite for a republic by 2020 – urged Australians to move past their celebrity worship of the Queen and Prince William's children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte .\n\"The French stormed the Bastille, the Americans had a war of Independence. We don't have to have a war, we just have to overcome the cult of celebrity and stop believing everything about England is better than us.\n\"Those who wish to follow all the in and outs of Buckingham Palace can still do exactly that and the Royals might even still visit us. It is just the ludicrousness of having them as part of our governmental system,\" he said.\nA referendum for a republic was comfortably defeated in 1999 , after division among republicans over the method for electing a president.\nMinimal change in Constitution Mr FitzSimons, who replaces Professor Geoff Gallop as chairman of the ARM and is a director of AusFlag which also advocates for a change to the Australian flag, argues for a minimal change to the Constitution.\n\"My personal view is for the minimalist option, keep the current system where the PM chooses the Governor General, just simply don't ask an Englishwoman in Buckingham Palace, 'is this ok with you?'.\"\nLast month, Federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten posted his colours to the mast by urging Australians not to wait until the Queen dies to renew the debate about becoming a republic.\n\"Like all Australians, I have tremendous respect for Queen Elizabeth, she has fulfilled her constitutional responsibilities with grace for many years,\" Mr Shorten said. \"But I don't believe we have to wait for a change of monarch to renew the republic debate.\"\nMr FitzSimons admits he is no Constitutional expert but has plenty of passion and media sway and wants to build a financial war chest to gear-up for the campaign.\n\"I am going to talk to as many people as I can and say your goodwill is not enough, we need you to turn up and we need funds,\" he said.\n\"Constitutional law is not my strong suit but in my view there has been way too much high-brow consideration of clause 3 paragraph b, subsection a and not enough low-brow passion – but low-brow is a personal specialty, you've come to the right place there,\" Mr FitzSimons said.\nThe ARM has also appointed media and policy expert Tim Mayfield as their new national director and seeking to fill an executive officer position.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108544913517269724355/posts", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_republic_referendum,_1999", "http://www.ouridentity.org.au/", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/patrickdurkin", "http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity/ls-celebrity-news/princess-charlotte-christening-crowds-gather-for-a-glimpse-of-the-royal-baby-20150705-gi5peb.html", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3163214/The-poignant-reason-Queen-refuses-corgis-American-cowboy-advises-Monarch-reveals-mortality-decision.html", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_FitzSimons", "http://www.smh.com.au/comment/abbotts-knighthood-decision-for-prince-philip-adds-fuel-to-the-republican-debate-20150128-12zbwb.html", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-12/bill-shorten-republic-new-generation-voters-should-have-say/6540372"], "published": "2015-07-19T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T04:43:55.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
