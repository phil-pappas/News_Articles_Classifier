It was below 75 U.S. cents for a second day amid concern an eight-day selloff in iron ore, Australia’s biggest export earner, and a rout in China’s stock market will hurt the nation’s economy.\n“Probably below 70 cents is where the RBA would want to see the Aussie, but probably they’ll be happy with the progress that’s being made considering they haven’t been easing any more,” said Stan Shamu, a market strategist at IG Ltd. in Melbourne. “The RBA’s sort of been in data-dependent mode since they last cut, and I think that’s going to be maintained in today’s meeting as well.”\nAustralia’s dollar fell 0.2 percent to 74.84 cents at 10:43 a.m. in Sydney, after reaching 74.52 Monday, its weakest since May 2009. The Aussie was little changed at NZ$1.1213 after rising to NZ$1.1430 on July 2, the strongest since November 2013.\nThere’s an 11 percent chance the RBA will cut its key rate from 2 percent at Tuesday’s meeting, according to calculations based on swaps.\nNew Zealand’s dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 66.76 U.S. cents. The nation’s central bank will reduce its benchmark rate twice more to 2.75 percent from 3.25 percent, said Christina Leung, senior economist at New Zealand Institute of Economic Research in Wellington.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T08:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T04:35:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
