For many people, even the experts can't fully tell you if you're in the clear to pull the retirement trigger. Why? Because no one knows the future of health care costs, which could be one of your biggest expenses during retirement. More Headlines Chip-And-PIN Credit Cards Are Still Years Away \n\"There are people who are ready to retire, but a lot of people who retire are assuming we're not going to have runaway health care costs and hyperinflation,\" said Rick Salus, senior vice president and investment officer at St. Louis-based Wells Fargo Advisors. \"If you're paying $600 a month, who knows what it will cost in five years?\" The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said spending on health care costs from 2014 to 2024 will see an average annual increase of 5.8%. And while Salus points to other inflationary expenses like food, health care seems to be the greatest unknown. \"Even the projections [on health care costs in the future] are still a guess,\" he said. After all, the older you get, the more health care you're going to need. \"If you're in your early 50s, you're going to live a fairly long time,\" Salus added. \"People who aren't realistic in their cost projections during retirement are kidding themselves.\" If you're looking to retire in the foreseeable future, the fogginess of health care costs might make you reconsider. Regardless, now's the time to consider a few other financial factors as you ponder your retirement readiness. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T19:49:04.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
