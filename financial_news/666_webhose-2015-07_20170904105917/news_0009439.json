State-owned power producers on the coast have at the same time been forced to reduce imports of coal.\nBut with 85 per cent of Chinese thermal coal producers and 35 per cent of metallurgical coal producers running at a cash loss, the risk is that the National Development and Reform Commission ramps up the restrictions on imports, Wood Mackenzie senior coal analyst Robin Griffin told a conference in Sydney.\n\"We know that state-owned operators are constantly in the ear of the NDRC to come up with new and better ways to protect them from competition,\" Mr Griffin said.\nAdvertisement \"Given it's getting worse there is a very high likelihood that there's a great risk that the government will institute even more strict policies and restrictions on imported coal.\"\nThe unexpectedly slow rate of closures of loss-making mines means the market for thermal coal may not get back into balance until 2022, leaving seven years before prices recover to about $US80 a tonne, on Wood Mackenzie's forecasts.\nFor metallurgical coal, used in steel production, the consultancy's outlook is only slightly less bleak, with supply and demand returning to balance in about 2020.\nThermal coal prices are currently down at about $US60 a tonne, down from more than $US130 in 2011. Metallurgical coal prices have fallen to about $US80, from north of $US300 in the boom years.\nThe weak markets have given extra weight to claims by anti-fossil fuel groups that coal markets are in terminal decline as major users such as China put more weight on renewable energy and other less polluting fuels. But both Mr Griffin and a second coal analyst speaking at the conference, IHS senior manager Marian Hookham, insisted the current slump was just part of the commodity cycle rather than a more fundamental, structural shift in the market and that prices would recover.\nIHS's price forecasts are more positive, predicting thermal prices will recovery to just under $US110 a tonne by about 2020 and metallurgical coal would recover to just short of $US200 a tonne.\n\"We think that this year will market the bottom of the cycle: I am hoping so because we simply cannot continue as we are,\" Ms Hookham said.\nWood Mackenzie calculates the metallurgical coal traded market is up to 30 million tonnes a year in oversupply, with about half of capacity running at a loss. The seaborne thermal coal market has about 200 million tonnes a year of excess capacity, with about 30 per cent under water.\nStill, Australian suppliers are doing \"relatively well,\" having cut costs by about 40 per cent in thermal coal in the last three years, while metallurgical coal costs have been slashed by 45 per cent in US dollar terms, including both productivity and production gains and foreign exchange benefits.\nMr Griffin said Indonesian suppliers were most at risk of closure in thermal coal, with about 100 million tonnes of production never likely to make a positive margin and vulnerable to closure, but that rationalisation was also needed elsewhere.\nIn metallurgical coal, US companies are hurting, with Walter Energy this month filing for bankruptcy protection and Alpha Natural Resources struggling, but some Australian and Canadian capacity would also need to close to restore the market to balance earlier, he said.\nStill, demand forecasts still point to a major opportunity for coal longer term, with energy demand expected to more than double across Asia over the next 15 years.\n\"Even with quite substantial assumptions around renewables growth, nuclear, hydro, gas â€¦ there is a place for coal and coal will grow substantially too, more than doubling in terms of its demand to the power sector,\" Mr Griffin said.\nWood Mackenzie is forecasting total traded volumes of thermal coal will increase to about 1.6 billion tonnes by 2035, up 60 per cent from 950 million tonnes in 2035.\nIn metallurgical coal it is forecasting an \"enormous requirement\" for new projects by the end of the decade resulting in a spike in prices above $US140 to revive investment in new projects, which has stalled.\n\"It's a pretty bright light, but unfortunately it's a pretty long tunnel,\" Mr Griffin said. \"But we think there are rewards for those that are able to withstand the downturn.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T06:55:32.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
