It depends on who you ask and who you’re talking about. That was one of the main takeaways from a live debate between experts here about the appropriate way to portray the nation’s $1.2 trillion student debt problem.\nElizabeth Akers, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and Andrew Kelly, the director of the center for higher education reform at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, argued against the resolution posed as part of an academic-style debate by moderators at the National Association of Student Financial Aid administrators conference “student loans are a crisis for students and the economy.” Mark Huelsman, a senior policy analyst at Demos, a left-leaning think tank and Kevin Fudge, the manager of government relations at American Student Assistance, an organization aimed at increasing access to higher education for low-income students, argued in favor.\nAlso see: The national student loan debt clock\nAkers and Kelly managed to sway more members of the audience, who voted by text message, than their opponents. Still, the debate raised questions about how policy makers should help the students that struggle the most with debt -- either because they don’t graduate or because they took out the loans to obtain a worthless degree.\n“This view that college pays off and that most people pay off their loans, is narrow and tragically flawed,” Heulsman said in his opening remarks. “This is a crisis of equity, it’s a crisis of opportunity and we’ll argue it’s a crisis for the economy.”\nHeulsman’s research shows that student debt has the effect of widening racial inequality; black students typically borrow more to attend school than their white counterparts . Their elevated levels of student debt may make it more difficult for black college graduates to buy homes and save for retirement, which will only perpetuate the racial wealth gap.\nFudge noted that while college is worth it for the average borrower who completes their degree, borrowers only get the return on their investment “if they finish” and “that’s a big if.” http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/american-students-struggling-defaulting-small-debts/ Fudge argued that for these borrowers, student debt certainly constitutes a crisis because even programs that allow borrowers to pay their loans back based on their income levels often extend their periods of repayment .\nHe also argued that their debt creates a problem for the economy overall because it prevents this group from purchasing homes and consuming in other ways.\nKelly countered with the claim that just because more young people have student debt and fewer young people are buying homes doesn’t mean the two trends are related, noting that declines in homeownership could be due to young adults’ more transient lifestyle or the fact that they tend to favor urban areas where homeownership rates are lower.\nHe acknowledged that while the number of borrowers who struggle to pay off their debts has increased in recent years, that’s largely because the types of students who take out loans have changed to include more adult borrowers “who are in shakier financial situations to begin with.”\n“Some borrowers are clearly struggling to repay their loans, but that does not constitute a crisis,” he said. He also cautioned that framing the issue as a crisis could deter low-income students from taking on debt, even though the point of the program is to increase access to higher education for the people who can’t afford it.\nAkers noted that the risk students take on when they get a degree has grown because the cost of college rose over the past few decades, but she said that programs that allow borrowers to repay their loans based on their incomes mitigate that risk.\n“The crisis that we’re talking about in the political narrative, the crisis that we’re talking about in the media, is an absolute fiction,” Akers said, of headlines and comments from politicians unveiling their plans to combat student debt. “There are folks in crisis and the more time we waste talking about this fictional crisis the less time we have” to help them.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/american-students-struggling-defaulting-small-debts/", "https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven"], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T15:13:54.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
