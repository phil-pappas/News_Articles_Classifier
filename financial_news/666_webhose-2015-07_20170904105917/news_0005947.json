I think we will use that meeting to assess the data. We have tried to be data dependent here,\" Bullard told Fox. \"But I'd see September having more than a 50 percent probability right now, I think.\" (Reporting by Michael Flaherty ; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T16:51:08.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
