There are assets and difficulties. \n\"That's why we need to establish this working group to explore feasibility, timetables etc.\" \nA Treasury source said: \"The idea that British taxpayers' money is going to be on the line in this latest deal is a non-starter.\" \nThe Chancellor arrives in Brussels for Ecofin - the meeting of EU finance ministers - on Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T21:51:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
