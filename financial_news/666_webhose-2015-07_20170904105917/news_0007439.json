Exor holds controlling stakes in carmaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and tractor manufacturer CNH Industrial.\nExor's move also follows a similar proposal from Axis and PartnerRe, which improved their $6.2 billion merger agreement last week with a higher special dividend.\nWhile Exor's all-cash offer would give PartnerRe investors more money upfront, PartnerRe and Axis have argued their tie-up makes more sense over the long term given the reinsurance industry is at a relatively low point.\nReinsurers, which help insurers pay large damage claims in exchange for part of the profit, are under pressure to consolidate after being squeezed by price competition and weak demand from insurers amid record low interest rates\nExor said on Monday that, with its offer, PartnerRe shareholders \"won't suffer from the impact on PartnerRe of a complex integration, with expected widespread job losses, loss of brand and culture and the very real risk of loss of clients and business\".\nShares in Exor were up 1.2 percent at 46.8 euros, in line with Milan's blue-chip index, while those in PartnerRe and Axis were up 0.7 percent and flat, respectively.\n(Reporting by Agnieszka Flak ; Editing by Mark Potter )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T18:39:12.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
