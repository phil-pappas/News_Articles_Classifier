Chicago, IL (PRWEB) July 16, 2015\nAccording to the National Association of Realtor's latest Foot Traffic report released on July 8th, interest in purchasing a home increased during the month of June. The report provides information regarding the amount of foot traffic seen at open houses and showings nationwide. The Federal Savings Bank finds the report interesting as the research is provided by SentriLock on a monthly basis and it demonstrates a strong correlation with the number of home sales in the future.\nAn increase in foot traffic bodes well for the future of the real estate market\nThe report showed a 10 point surge for total foot traffic. This is the highest level seen since June 2013. There has been an upward trend for foot traffic since February 2015.\nA higher number of individuals looking at homes and considering investing in them indicates a strengthening housing market. A higher demand for housing will also likely increase the amount of construction of new houses which will help boost the construction industry as well.\nImproving economic conditions and better job security also likely contribute to the increasing interest in homeownership. The Bureau of Labor Statistics released its employment situation summary and it showed a higher number of available jobs. In fact, nonfarm payroll employment jumped up by 233,000 during the month of June. In addition, unemployment decreased to 5.3 percent. Professional and business services, retail trade, warehousing, transportation, food services and drinking places, financial activities and health care all saw a notable boost in total job openings available for interested applicants.\nAvailable employment in professional and business services jumped to 64,000 new positions.\nHealth care employment increased by 40,000 new jobs. Ambulatory care services saw the highest number of new employment opportunities at 23,000 and hospitals came in second with 11,000 new jobs.\nThe financial activity sector added 20,000 positions. Insurance carriers and related activities made up the most substantial portion of these types of jobs at 9,000 employment opportunities.\nOver the course of the year, the earnings for employees increased 2 percent.\nMore employment opportunities translates to individuals who feel more confident in their financial situation. Those who are more confident and feel secure in their job are more likely to invest in a home.\nIn addition, historically low interest rates affixed to the average home mortgage are an appealing perk many potential buyers will likely want to secure while they can.\nWhile there are more people interested in purchasing a house, knowing what buyers want in a new home is also important.\nProspective buyers interested in move-in ready homes\nThe Federal Savings Bank sees a number of mortgage applicants are looking to purchase homes that need very little to no work and updates. Home buyers are looking for move in turnkey ready properties.\nUpdated kitchens and baths are a priority for many buyers, and individuals who are considering listing their home should invest in renovations now to help increase the chances of a higher offer and a quicker sell.\nContact the Federal Savings Bank, a veteran owned bank, to learn more about mortgages.", "external_links": ["http://t1947869.omkt.co/track.aspx?id=402|1DB8DD|E52C|0|289|0|3BF|1|67CF81A8&destination=http%3a%2f%2fwww.realtor.org%2finfographics%2fjune-2015-foot-traffic&dchk=1D36B636", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibHMuZ292L25ld3MucmVsZWFzZS9lbXBzaXQubnIwLmh0bQ==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGVmZWRlcmFsc2F2aW5nc2JhbmsuY29t", "http://t1947869.omkt.co/track.aspx?id=402|1DB8DD|E52C|0|289|0|3C0|1|67CF81A8&destination=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thefederalsavingsbank.com&dchk=E082038", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWFsdG9yLm9yZy9pbmZvZ3JhcGhpY3MvanVuZS0yMDE1LWZvb3QtdHJhZmZpYw==", "http://t1947869.omkt.co/track.aspx?id=402|1DB8DD|E52C|0|289|0|3C1|1|67CF81A8&destination=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bls.gov%2fnews.release%2fempsit.nr0.htm&dchk=1DC2C0E6"], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T07:39:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
