There will be clarity once the bank licences are issued,” said Ronesh Puri, MD, Executive Access. \n“Unless an existing microfinance company, or non-banking finance company, is converting into a bank, all others would require large number of employees,” Ashvin Parekh, managing partner, Ashvin Parekh Advisory Services said. \nJob search firms also said that several employees engaged with the existing banks – both private and public – are looking for a switch. \n“There is likely to be exodus as well,” a senior executive at a large private sector bank said. Sources also said that hundreds would be tapped from the public sector banks, where most employees have to adhere to the government pay scale, which are significantly lower than the private sector. \nSmall banks will be able to provide only basic banking services of acceptance of deposits and lendings. A payments bank will be able to accept deposits, issue ATM and debit cards, and allow payments and remittances. IIFL Holdings, SKS Microfinance, among others have applied for small banks licence, while Airtel M Commerce, India Post, among those have sought payment banks.
