Get Outta Here! \nThat explains the enthusiasm generated over the first visit to Kenya since his 2008 election to the most powerful office in the world. \nIt has been a long-awaited call. Soon after his election, Mr Obama promised to visit Kenya during his tenure, but a confluence of events kept him away. \nHe did not make it during his first term in the White House, but now as he begins to wind down his second and final stint, he is finally making that trip. \nOfficially, President Obama is here to attend the sixth edition of the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, but beyond the gathering of entrepreneurs, business leaders, innovators, and government officials will be a lot of bilateral issues. \nThis watershed visit serves as an indication that it is time to move beyond the factors that poisoned relations between Nairobi and Washington since the election of the Jubilee coalition government. \nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto were elected in 2013 while under indictment of the International Criminal Court on charges related to the 2007-2008 post-election violence. \nThey came to office on the back of very strong indications that the White House would not maintain normal relations with leaders facing charges of crimes against humanity, culminating in the infamous \"choices have consequences\" warning ahead of the polls. \nICC \nThere was suspicion from official circles in Kenya that the US had actively influenced the ICC indictments and that it had been working all along to ensure that Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto were put behind bars so that the opposition Cord coalition would have easy passage to State House. \nA lot of water has passed under the bridge since. The case against President Kenyatta has collapsed and the ongoing case against Mr Ruto increasingly looks likely to suffer a similar fate. \nBeyond the ICC, both State House in Nairobi and the White House in Washington have realised that neither can afford to cut long-standing relationships. \nKenya has since the Kibaki presidency pursued a \"Look East\" policy that has been pushed even more aggressively under President Kenyatta. \nThe policy has indeed borne fruit, but there has also been the inescapable realisation that closer diplomatic and trade ties with China, India, and Russia does not have to come at the expense of established links with the US and other Western nations. \nThe US has in turn had to acknowledge that it cannot afford to lose Kenya to new courtiers and neither can it afford to abandon a country that is a vital regional communications, security, trade, and economic fulcrum. \nIf Nairobi and Washington have drifted apart, President Obama's repair of the bonds is of great importance to both countries. But that must not be seen in terms of either partisan local politics or other foreign relationships. \nKenya's interest lies in retaining friends and partnerships across global geopolitical divides.
