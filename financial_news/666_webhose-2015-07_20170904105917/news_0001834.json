Louie Douvis by John Kerin and John Kehoe The Abbott government will on Saturday release a $1.2 billion package to boost farm incomes and increase drought assistance as part of its long awaited agricultural competitiveness white paper.\nThe paper to be unveiled by Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce includes $728 million extra for existing and new investment programs and a further $500 million for the development of new dams over four years in what appears to be a win for Senator Joyce over economically drier Liberal colleagues.\nDelivering the paper was a key Coalition pre-election pledge and a draft green paper released in October last year foreshadowed changes to taxation arrangements and improved access to finance.\nThe paper also contains a commitment to extend drought assistance concessional farm loans program by a further $2.5 billion over 11 years.\n\"The Commonwealth Government's Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper is an investment in our farmers and our … strengths in agriculture,\" Prime Minister Tony Abbott will say.\n\"A strong agricultural sector contributes to a strong economy – and that means more jobs, more exports higher incomes and better services to the community,\" Mr Abbott says.\nAgriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce said the government was \"determined to make the sector more competitive and deliver practical actions that will keep our farmers profitable and resilient\".\nThe package contains $500 million for the development of new dams including pre-feasibility studies and also expands the Farm Management Deposits [FMD] Scheme.\n The FMD scheme enables farmers to better average their incomes by setting aside pre-tax income in good years that they can draw on in lean years.\nOffset against farm loans It will be extended to smaller fams and for the first time used as an offset against farm loans. The concession is estimated to reduce interest costs to producers by up to $150 million a year.\nThe maximum allowable deposit limit will be lifted from $400,000 to $800,000 from from July 1 2016.\nThe package also includes $11.4 million to set up a special Agriculture Commissioner on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to encourage fair trading in the sector, a further $200 million boosting research and development programs, $200 million to boosting biosecurity surveillance and $30 million to breaking down technical barriers to trade.\nMr Abbott also hailed the government's delivery on its trifecta of North Asia free trade agreements as delivering a boost to farm exports and the government was continuing to pursue one of the world's biggest trade deals – the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nBut negotiations over the TPP have been plagued by domestic criticism with canegrowers and a North Queensland MP hitting back at US Trade representative Mike Froman's comments Washington will not budget on providing the Australian industry with better access to the US sugar market.\nThe TPP is a proposed major trade and investment accord covering more than 40 per cent of the world's economy. It aims to set sweeping new rules for trade and investment in relations to tariffs, quotas, intellectual property, labour, the environment and state-owned enterprises.\nAustralian cane growers can sell a relatively paltry 87,000 tonnes of sugar in the US while American producers are guaranteed of supplying at least 85 per cent of domestic sugar demand under the government's sugar program.\nPolitically influential growers, including in the key swing state of Florida, hold enormous lobbying sway over American politicians, who are preparing for elections in November 2016.\nThe Australian Canegrowers group said Mexican growers could not meet the projected increase in US sugar import demand, so sugar should be fully included in the TPP.\n\"There is no reason why unsubsidised Australian sugar should have lesser access to the US than Mexican sugar, which has been found to be subsidised and dumped into the US,\" Canegrowers economics head Warren Males said.\nRockhampton based Queensland Nationals Senator Matthew Canavan said while he understood the \"political sensitivities of the sugar States for the US government those sensitivities need to be managed if we are to do a TPP deal\".\n\"Australian canegrowers are not asking for free and unfettered access to the US market but they are asking for moderate increase in the existing quota,\" Senator Canavan said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T12:12:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
