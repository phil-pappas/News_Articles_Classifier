Final bids are expected by end-August. \nThe sources could not be identified as discussions were confidential while official announcements on the process and shortlisted candidates will not be made public. \nKKR and TPG declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. \nMacquarie Group and Carlyle did not immediately respond while a spokeswoman for HNA Group said she was not aware of the deal. \nDeutsche Bank is advising ANZ, Australia's third-largest bank, on the sale. A spokeswoman at Deutsche declined to comment. \nShortlisted parties are currently undertaking due diligence for the car finance unit, called Esanda after preliminary bids were received on June 29, the sources said.. \nKKR, Varde Partners and Deutsche Bank had successfully bid for GE Capital's Australian and New Zealand consumer lending arm which is expected to be completed by September. \n(Additional reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Stephen Coates) Private Equity & Hedge Funds", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T09:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T10:04:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
