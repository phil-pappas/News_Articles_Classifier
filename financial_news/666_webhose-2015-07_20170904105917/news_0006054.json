Money wasn't the only thing that enabled financier Cosimo de' Medici to become de facto ruler of Florence for much of the Italian Renaissance. He exemplified a special leadership skill - the ability to get diverse teams of contending bankers, merchants and traders to collaborate. How? He identified with each group's sentiments and perspectives. He built new bridges of common purpose, resulting in a \"team\" that produced greater, more sustained economic, social and cultural value for all parties - and the broader society.\nCentral to Cosimo's success was what I call \"multivocal leadership.\" Multivocal leaders identify directly or vicariously with a diverse set of people and broker communication among them to guide collaboration.\nShane Black, the Hollywood action-genre screenwriter and director who's behind mega hits such as \"Predator,\" \"Lethal Weapon,\" \"As Good As it Gets\" and \"Iron Man 3,\" personifies the modern multivocal leader adept in these qualities:\nFluency across fields and cultures The best leaders of diverse teams can speak the multiple \"languages\" of their teammates, based on their own experience and learning. Black discusses how writers and directors need to speak to actors in a vocabulary that they value and understand. Multivocal directors help actors to understand the full context of a given scene and to evoke emotion by connecting the role with the actor's own experience and by empathizing with frustration over multiple takes. The same approach enables the leader to broker exchanges more effectively among teammates, too.\nPerspective built on breadth of experience and a deep curiosity about people Multivocal leaders are genuinely interested in what drives those around them. From that curiosity comes knowledge about what motivates others, and what will help build trust. For example, Black urges screenwriters and directors to take acting courses to appreciate how much actors bring to movies and to use that knowledge to guide collaboration. \"It's a way of approaching things that lets you know that, 'Hey, I know how hard this job is for you. Let's talk on your terms . because I appreciate and love actors ..' \"\nA self-awareness of one's strengths and weaknesses Effective leaders understand what they bring to the table as well as what they can't. That helps them to defer to the expertise of their teammates, where needed. Black had studied theater and was interested in acting early in his career but recognized that his shyness made him \"intimidated by the cattle call auditions.\" That self-awareness helped him to focus on writing - and later, directing - and to rely on his actors and crew to bring his ideas to the screen.\nMultivocal leadership is critical in a relatively new domain: data science Handling big data means dealing with unprecedented volumes of information and complex decisions about questions to ask, frameworks and tools to use and insights to seek. Success requires integrating the efforts of computer scientists, physicists, computational biologists, social scientists, graphic designers and others. Individual players on data analytics teams will have diverging viewpoints and work styles. For example, a physicist may value the ability to convert data-based concepts into mathematical language, whereas a social scientist may believe that such a conversion diminishes the ability to derive bigger-picture insights from the data. A multivocal leader can create order from this potential discord, aligning efforts into a solution or product where the whole is much greater than the sum of individual contributions.\nSome elements of multivocality are innate. Others you can learn.\nSidestep impostor syndrome It can be easy for leaders of diverse teams to feel that they are in over their heads because they lack the same level of expertise as any one teammate. No one individual can be an expert in every area that a team represents. The most effective leaders understand and appreciate their own limits. By translating team differences into complementary skills, leaders guide diverse individuals to solutions that no teammate could have discovered on his own.\nExpand your perspective - and translation skills Multivocal leaders need to interpret and translate complex issues among teammates. The psychological concept of \"perspective-taking\" concerns the ability to identify with somebody else. Enhance your perspective and fluency by taking a personal interest in teammates' backgrounds and styles. Perspective-taking for the leader begins with understanding what each teammate values and then communicating shared value among teammates.\nConduct an honest, ongoing self-assessment Research points up our tendency toward a \"self-serving bias\" that may prevent us from understanding our weaknesses. Such blind spots disrupt multivocality by endowing leaders with a false sense of competence. Be honest with yourself about your capabilities and constraints. Meaningful self-assessment can take the form of a formal skills inventory administered by a third party or a more casual approach including inputs from your team, higher-level managers, and/or mentors. Be brutally candid with yourself to boost your collaboration skills.\nMultivocality is a complex term for a simple concept To lead a diverse team most effectively, draw on your past roles, cross-disciplinary fluency and self-awareness to build trust, shared understanding and momentum. Maximize your team's success by finding and channelling your inner Cosimo.\nBrian Uzzi is a professor of leadership and organisational change at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management.\nÂ© 2015 Harvard Business School Publishing Corp.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T10:42:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
