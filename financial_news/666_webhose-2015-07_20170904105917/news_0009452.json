For instance, we pay $1,455 a month to rent a nice home downtown, as opposed to the $1,650 we were paying to rent a condo with a concrete slab for a yard in Santa Barbara.\nBut as I’ve taken on new clients and grown my business here, that extra $1,000 or so that’s been coming in has been quickly used up.\nPage 1 / 3 Continue", "external_links": ["https://www.learnvest.com/personal-financial-planning-program/", "http://www.learnvest.com/2014/11/hack-my-budget-how-can-i-trim-800-from-my-monthly-spending/", "http://www.learnvest.com/2015/07/hacking-lifestyle-inflation-problem/"], "published": "2015-07-28T18:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T18:40:41.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
