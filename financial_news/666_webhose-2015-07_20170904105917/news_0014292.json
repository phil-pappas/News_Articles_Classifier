Illustration: Rod Clement Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow Remember Campbell Newman ? He was a little guy. Bald. Shouted a lot.\nYou might also remember he was thrown out of office in February less than three years after Mark Textor and Co helped him win a parliamentary majority so big it disqualified the Labor Party from official opposition status.\nWell, after a brief convalescence, it seems the Little Major is back in combat. And this time around the battle theatre is the business world.\nWe were a bit surprised to see him in the audience of a business leaders' lunch Deutsche Bank held a fortnight ago, at which NSW Premier Mike Baird was one of the headline acts. Just as ageing supermodels avoid younger, fresher creatures, Newman might be advised to keep his distance from Bruce's son. The contrast isn't pretty.\nBut it seems there was a reason for his apparent self-flagellation at the Sydney event. The word spreading around business circles faster than a cane toad plague is that Newman is hungry for board positions. Move over John Dawkins !\nIn the meantime, demonstrating the can-do spirit he made famous – and then infamous – he's getting on with the job himself.\nWith his wife Lisa Newman , he registered a company, Araluen Capital, days after he resigned as premier to make way for the ascension of Annastacia Palaszczuk ( which we still haven't quite got our head around ).\nAnd, in recent weeks, he's been getting down to business.\n He's joined forces with agricultural entrepreneur Andrew Bate to become chairman of robotic agricultural firm SwarmFarm Robotics three weeks ago, according to documents filed with the ASIC registry. [The documents also reveal his middle name: Kevin. How did we not know that?]\nNewman's also joined another related company with Bate – Advanced Agricultural Systems. That'll teach Alan Jones for saying all those rotten things on the radio about how Newman wanted to destroy prime agricultural land.\nAnd at the start of June, Newman became a director – and, through Araluen, an investor – in cloud technology company LinkSprite Australia .\nSo far, so small, but he's clearly keeping busy.\nAnd all while writing his autobiography (out in October) with co-writer and former Cairns MP Gavin King .\nKing told us on Thursday that he had interviewed Newman the day before for two hours about his three years as premier (over the phone as the frenetic Newman drove his car).\n\"Even I was surprised by some of the frank admissions of the political failings,\" King says. \"We spoke about Clive Palmer and Alan Jones – the list went on and on.\" Did it ever.", "external_links": ["http://www.swarmfarm.com/", "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/in-depth/partys-over-but-nsw-premier-mike-baird-keeps-the-ball-rolling/story-fnivd8cj-1227403061679", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow", "http://www.linksprite.com.au/"], "published": "2015-07-02T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:13:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
