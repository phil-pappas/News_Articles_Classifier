Of importance is the fact that these artisanal workings only occupy a small fraction of the 14km mineralised structure mapped at the Berrio Gold Project. \nPrevious exploration by Pacifico and results from this latest channel sampling program indicate that mineralisation continues along the contact 20m below surface and remains open at depth as well as to the north and south. High-grade gold and silver mineralisation hosted at the contact between the Berrio Sediment Package and Segovia Batholith included: \n- 50cm @ 42.49 g/t Au, 77.5 g/t Ag and 0.24% Cu (channel sample 43567) \n- 50cm @ 33.24 g/t Au, 146 g/t Ag, 0.34% Cu and 0.84% Zn (43571) \n- 80cm @ 31.41 g/t Au, 106 g/t Ag and 0.23% Cu (composite channel sample 43566 and 43570) \n- 50cm @ 8.19 g/t Au, 59.5 g/t Ag, 0.5% Cu and 23.48% Zn (43569) \nChannel sampling was undertaken across two levels and was restricted to faces and pillars left by miners to act as support in stopes (see Figure 1). Previous field mapping, selective grab and soil sampling undertaken by Pacifico identified gold anomalism associated with the contact between the Berrio Sediments and Segovia Batholith which is the primary target at the Berrio Gold Project. Conceptually, the block channel sampled by Pacifico, measuring 22m x 20m and, based on 11 channel samples, has an average width of 0.59m and weighted average grade of 15.50 g/t Au, 147.14 g/t Ag, 0.16% Cu and 2.26% Zn. See Table 1 below for all 11 channel sample results. Further exploration along the contact is warranted and these channel sample results strongly support Pacifico's exploration strategy along the faulted contact between the Berrio Sediments and Segovia Batholith. \nPacifico is exploring for high-grade gold mineralisation, with associated silver and base metals, hosted at the faulted contact between the Berrio Sediments and the Segovia Batholith, the contact has been mapped within Pacifico's tenements for 6.2km and is projected to continue for a further 7.8km (see ASX announcement 18 February 2015 for further details). \nRecent soil sampling across the contact identified several well developed gold anomalies closely associated with the mapped contact with one of these anomalies extending for well over 1km along the contact (see ASX announcement 25 June 2015 for further details). \nPrevious IP surveys conducted by Pacifico provide partial coverage across the mapped contact in one of the areas where soil sampling was undertaken (see ASX announcement 3 July 2014 for further details). Highly encouraging well developed resistivity lows and chargeability highs are noted at the contact underlying the gold in soil anomaly. \nTable 1: Channel sample assay results.

Length weighted average grades are 80cm @ 31.41 g/t Au, 106 g/t Ag and 0.23% Cu.\nOngoing and future exploration plans \nAdditional soil sampling is ongoing to the east of the central grid to target shear hosted mineralisation in the Berrio Sediments, a style similar to that drilled by Pacifico in its 2014 campaigns. Soil sampling has proven to be a cost effective and efficient method for guiding exploration at Berrio and we look forward to testing the remaining 11km of the faulted contact mapped within our tenement package. \nUnderground channel sampling of artisanal mines close to the contact will continue. \nGuided by gold in soil anomalies and the latest results from underground channel sampling Pacifico's geologists are currently designing drill program to test the continuity of high-grade mineralisation at the contact along strike and down dip of artisanal mines. \nTo view tables and figures, please visit: http://media.abnnewswire.net/media/en/docs/ASX-PMY-725851.pdf \nAbout Pacifico Minerals Limited: \nPacifico Minerals Ltd (ASX: PMY.AX - News ) is a Western Australian based exploration company focussed on advancing the Berrio Gold Project located in Colombia. Berrio is situated in the southern part of the prolific Segovia Gold Belt and is characterised by a number of operational, artisanal-scale adits, tunnels, and declines. The project is 35km from the Magdalena River which is navigable to the Caribbean Sea and has excellent infrastructure in place including hydro power, sealed roads, water supply and telecommunications coverage. Pacifico also has an interest in two other projects in Colombia (Natagaima and Urrao) and one project in the NT, Australia (Borroloola West Project). \nContact: Simon Noon (Managing Director) Phone: +61 (0)8 6266 8642 Email: info@pacificominerals.com.au \nSource: \nCopyright (C) 2015 ABN Newswire.
