Meanwhile, young adults take 16 minutes and older adults take up to 47 minutes to respond to an email. \nDovetailing off that, the study also found that older folks send longer replies with a median of 40 words, young adults use 31 words, and teens barely say anything at all, with a median of 17 words. \nBut all age groups responded faster to emails on Monday through Friday during work hours, and replies across the board were shorter when the email was sent later in the day or on the weekend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T17:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T17:55:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
