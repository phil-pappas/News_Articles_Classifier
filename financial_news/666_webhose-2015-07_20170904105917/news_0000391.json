If that continued, most economists expected the rate to begin coming down.\n\"History shows that the RBA tends not to cut further when the unemployment rate is past its peak,\" said HSBC economist Paul Bloxham. \"So, at the minimum, today's numbers are likely to reduce the chance of any near-term cut in the cash rate.\"\nBut not all were convinced.\n\"Today's data do not incorporate the impact of any shock being imparted by the developments in Europe and China ,\" said JPMorgan economist Ben Jarman.\n\"There are still some negative demand impulses to be digested. Of particular importance will be whether global turbulence hits activity in the non-mining economy.\"\nThe dollar, which hit a six-year low this week after the Chinese sharemarket meltdown and falling commodity prices, rose after the jobs data to about US74.62¢ from about US74.19¢.\nFull-time employment jumped 24,500 and part-time work dropped 17,200.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-07-09T09:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:16:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
