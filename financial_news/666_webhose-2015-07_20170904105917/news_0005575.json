They have a better chance of selling on to someone else or to a 'Blackhat Market' on the 'Deep Web'. They’ll profit from this in a big way, especially with the size of this database.\" \nVinnie said the hacking community he is connected to is impressed at the scale of this attack but that the group claiming responsibility is unlikely to be able to pull off anything on this scale again. \nHe believes the threat to publish details is simply a publicity stunt to get buyers interested in the huge amount of credit card details that will soon be up for sale online in batches of 100 - 1 million. \nThe group has also compromised two other dating sites; Cougar Life and Established Men. These sites are also owned by ALM. \nThe hackers said in a statement: \"Avid Life Media has been instructed to take Ashley Madison and Established Men offline permanently in all forms, or we will release all customer records, including profiles with all the customers' secret sexual fantasies and matching credit card transactions, real names and addresses, and employee documents and emails. \n\"The other websites may stay online.\" \nIn their own statement, ALM said: \"We apologise for this unprovoked and criminal intrusion into our customers' information. \n\"The current business world has proven to be one in which no company's online assets are safe from cyber-vandalism, with Avid Life Media being only the latest among many companies to have been attacked, despite investing in the latest privacy and security technologies. \n\"At this time, we have been able to secure our sites, and close the unauthorised access points. We are working with law enforcement agencies, which are investigating this criminal act. \n\"Any and all parties responsible for this act of cyber-terrorism will be held responsible.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T14:53:41.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
