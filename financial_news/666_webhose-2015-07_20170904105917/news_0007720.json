These three states received top marks because they’re economically healthy, affordable for retirees, and have low crime rates. Wyoming \nLet’s start out West with Wyoming. The Cowboy State has lots of wide open spaces, no income tax, and the third lowest poverty rate in the country for people who are 65 and older. The state’s unique landscape includes Yellowstone National Park, the Grand Teton mountain range and the Snake River. Cheyenne, Wyoming’s capital, is a good city to consider for retirement. Iowa \nIn the Midwest, don’t overlook Iowa—yes, Iowa—where the retirement-age population is both robust and economically secure. Affordability is a big draw. In Des Moines, which offers many big-city amenities, the cost of living for retirees is nearly 10% below the national average. If you’d like to live in a smaller city, consider Cedar Rapids. AARP named it one of the most livable midsize cities in the U.S. for people 50-plus. Another option: Iowa City, which was ranked the top small metro area for successful aging by the Milken Institute. Advertisement Delaware \nIf you have roots on the East Coast, your best place for retirement might be Delaware. This small state is a big winner when it comes to taxes on retirees. Delaware has no sales tax, income taxes are modest, and Social Security income is exempt. Real estate is expensive in beach towns such as Dewey and Bethany, so look inland to save on housing. A good bet in Milford. Frequent Amtrak service from Wilmington, Delaware’s largest city, makes it easy to reach D.C., New York, Boston and Philadelphia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T15:50:11.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
