Such is the case with Yello – formerly Rescolu – a Chicago-based software provider that prides itself on the reengineering of how companies large and small recruit. Yello hosted its open house on July 15 at their new digs located at 120 North LaSalle Street.

View all 6 photos \nYello's sourcing and recruiting products and service suite ranges from software, data protection, physical security and regularly updated infrastructure. Yello announced the change of their corporate identity during their recent Recruiting Solutions Conference hosted in Chicago and the move has been met with much praise, as it better represents the ability for their corporate partners to better engage with candidates. \nFor a millennial-heavy startup, the soundtrack during Yello’s open house was eclectic and energetic – an 80’s mix that switched to a Jay-Z playlist, concluding on a country music playlist – blaring over the speakers as the attendees mingled, while others were squired away in various recreational spaces to play video games and hoop baskets. \nSpeeches by Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jason Weingarten, Co-Founder and President Dan Bartfield and Chief Technology Officer Jason Allen, peppered the event, echoing their website content: bringing their A-game to ensure employers of all sizes – from Fortune 500 multinationals and large public sector organizations to high-growth early stage companies – rely on Yello to manage and mobilize their recruiting processes. \nThis was a “reliable” initiative with a workplace culture to match. \nNo diggity. No doubt. \nFor more information on Yello’s sourcing and recruiting products and services, or to join their team, visit www.yello.co .
