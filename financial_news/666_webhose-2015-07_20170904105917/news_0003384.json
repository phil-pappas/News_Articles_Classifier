The index has now risen for two straight weeks, clawing back some of the huge losses suffered in just under a month after hitting a June 12 peak. Hong Kong stocks won one percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T15:24:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
