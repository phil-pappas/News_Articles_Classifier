She did not attend a civil hearing. Louise Kennerley by Lucille Keen Embattled former union leader Kathy Jackson established a \"secret\" slush fund of members' money to shop at Bulgari, make divorce payments to her former husband and pay for overseas holidays, the Federal Court has been told.\nShe is being sued by the Health Services Union and on Tuesday the Federal Court was told Ms Jackson allegedly established a bank account, under the name of the National Health Development Account, using a $250,000 payment from a Melbourne cancer hospital for members' back pay.\nCounsel for the Health Services Union, Mark Irving, SC, told the court Ms Jackson \"set up a scheme to circumvent\" having to declare the money and her spending, to the union.\nHe said she set up the NHDA \"to avoid revealing what the [Workplace Relations Act] act requires her to reveal\".\n\"It's as good as in her pocket,\" Mr Irving said.\n\"She wants to keep secret what she is doing. The purpose of setting up these arrangements is to avoid disclosure requirements.\"\nMr Irving said the account was opened and used by Ms Jackson and was never audited by the union or taken into account for the union's finances.\nIn the case, which is before Justice Richard Tracey, the HSU is seeking $2.5 million from its former leader, who allegedly misappropriated $1.4 million of union funds.\n Wrong doing denied Ms Jackson denied any wrongdoing. She filed for bankruptcy 10 days ago and had not appeared in court, nor had she had legal representation since June.\nA statement of affairs filed in court showed Ms Jackson was driving a 2005 Mercedes station wagon, and owed more than $70,000 in legal fees. Geelong Grammar was listed as an unsecured creditor and was owed $16,000 in school fees for Ms Jackson's children.\nThe trustee of her estate last week said they would not fight the case and the union decided to proceed despite not being able to reap financial benefits if they succeeded.\nThe court was told Ms Jackson withdrew large sums of money, up to $9800 at a time in the days before 14 holidays to places such as Hong Kong, London and Los Angeles.\nIt was also told she spent $3000 on Bulgari luxury goods in 2009 and made personal retail purchases including at Tony's Gourmet, a butcher near her home in Balwyn, and at a women's clothing store.\nEvidence was also offered that the union claimed Ms Jackson transferred $102,000 to her former husband Jeff Jackson between March 2008 and March 2010. During the same period $104,300 was withdrawn from the NHDA account by Ms Jackson.\n\"The figures almost perfectly match,\" Mr Irving said.\nBank documents also show in March 2009 Ms Jackson had $50,000 from the union deposited into the NHDA account. The following day she withdrew $50,000, the same day she wrote a $50,000 bank cheque to Mr Jackson.\nIn her defence, Ms Jackson has claimed she was allowed to use $4000 from the NHDA for personal expenditure.\n\"We say she invented the $4000 allowance,\" Mr Irving said.\nThe hearing continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T19:17:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
