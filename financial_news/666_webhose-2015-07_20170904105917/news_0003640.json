(German language)\nPT1M0S Berlin: German Chancellor Angela Merkel has lit up the internet, drawing mockery for stroking a Palestinian girl facing possible deportation after she had reduced her to tears.\nDr Merkel was explaining her country's policy on asylum seekers at a discussion forum in the northern city of Rostock when a girl told her in good German that she wanted to study in Germany.\nThe girl, identified as Reem arrived from a refugee camp in Lebanon, and has lived in Germany for four years but her family may be forced to leave.\nIt was unpleasant that she could not share the enjoyment of the life experienced by her peers because of uncertainty over whether she would be able to stay, Reem said.\nAdvertisement Video of Merkel reducing Palestinian refuge girl to tears goes viral http://t.co/LQjyIOfkkb #Palestine #merkelstrokes pic.twitter.com/ihPGhilS6a\n— al whit (@soitiz) July 16, 2015 \"I understand,\" said Dr Merkel. \"However ... sometimes politics is hard. When you stand in front of me and you are a very nice person, but you know in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon there are thousands and thousands (of people) and if we say you can all come, and you can all come from Africa, and you can all come. We can't manage that.\"\nAt that point Reem cried.\nLooking surprised, Dr Merkel walked up to her and said: \"Ah, you did a great job.\"\nThe moderator of the discussion intervened to say the young woman was crying more because of her difficult situation than over whether she had done a good job in presenting her views.\nDr Merkel retorted: \"I know ... Still, I want to stroke her.\" She then stroked Reem on the back.\nTweets mocked the chancellor, accusing her of looking clumsy and lacking empathy.\nThe hashtag #merkelstreichelt (#merkelstrokes) and video clip of Dr Merkel's exchange with the girl went viral.\n\"With the chancellor in the zoo,\" tweeted Torsten Gaitzsch.\n\"#merkelstrokes with the cold hand of an ice queen\" wrote Martina Wilczyniski.\nWe've come to the point where DE Chancellor tells a crying girl she has to leave the country, on a TV show. #merkelstreichelt #Merkelstrokes\n— Zoe Gardner (@ZoeJardiniere) July 16, 2015 Felix Seibert-Daiker, who moderated the forum, told the Suddeutsche Zeitung that Dr Merkel had reacted in a humane manner.\n\"Of course, we all would have liked Merkel to take Reem in her arms and say 'you can stay' but that is not the situation.\" He said she respected her attempt to explain the political situation to a child. \"Many colleagues would have talked around it.\"\nThanks@angie_merkel for telling truth to ten-year old girl who just said her only wish is to live in your little cozy country #merkelstrokes\n— Antonio D. Coscia (@lumisono) July 16, 2015 Immigration has shot up the German political agenda due to mounting fears the country won't cope with a flood of asylum seekers, especially from the Middle East and Africa. Many of Dr Merkel's conservative party colleagues want her to take a harder line.\nReflecting mounting resentment among Germans, violence on refugees is rising. So far this year there have been 150 attacks, nearly as many as in the whole of last year.\nGerman President Joachim Gauck has warned that xenophobic attitudes are taking root.\nReuters\nFollow FairfaxForeign on Twitter\nFollow FairfaxForeign on Facebook", "external_links": ["http://t.co/ihPGhilS6a", "https://twitter.com/FairfaxForeign", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/merkelstreichelt?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Merkelstrokes?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/merkelstrokes?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/soitiz/status/621708943711014912", "http://t.co/LQjyIOfkkb", "https://www.facebook.com/FairfaxForeign", "https://twitter.com/lumisono/status/621788713929076737", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Palestine?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/ZoeJardiniere/status/621696707353554944"], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T11:40:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
