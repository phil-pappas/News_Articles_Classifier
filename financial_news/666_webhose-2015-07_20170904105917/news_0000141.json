In the document, Greece agreed to carry out \"ambitious\" pension and tax reforms and \"significantly\" increase its privatisation programme. \nAnd it has also accepted it will push reforms into law this week on a first set of measures as it tries to avoid a \"Grexit\". \nBut stumbling blocks remain. \nThe government believes some of the measures demanded by creditors, such as a requirement to put €50bn (£35.8bn) worth of state-owned assets into a fund for subsequent sell-off, are intended to \"humiliate\" them. \nOne diplomat said it was tantamount to turning the country into a \"German protectorate\", stripping it of more sovereignty. \nAnother official said the other sticking point is the future involvement of the International Monetary Fund in the bailout programme. \nThe list of demands has led to a social media backlash against Germany, with #ThisIsACoup the second top trending hashtag on Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) . \nIf Greece meets the conditions, the German parliament would meet on Thursday to allow Chancellor Angela Merkel and finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble to open talks on a new loan. \nThen Eurogroup finance ministers would meet on Friday or at the weekend to formally launch the negotiations. \nThe draft said Greece needs €7bn (£5bn) by 20 July, when it must make a payment to the European Central Bank, and a total of €12bn (£8.6bn) by mid-August when another ECB payment is due. \nGreece's proposals for a new bailout, backed by parliament, are aimed at offering to bring in tax rises and spending cuts in return for another loan. \nGreece has already had two bailouts worth €240bn (£172.2bn) from eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund since 2010. \nThe eurozone talks were not about whether to agree a new bailout, but rather over whether to allow further negotiations over the Greek rescue package. \nSpeaking ahead of the talks, Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said: \"We can reach an agreement tonight if all parties want it.\" \nBut Mrs Merkel cautioned there would not be a deal later on Sunday \"at any price\", and she said trust in debt-laden Athens had been lost, warning of \"tough\" negotiations ahead. \nMeanwhile, French President Francois Hollande said he was going to do everything he could to keep Greece in the euro.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T08:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:07:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
