These \"officials\" have threatened them with jail time, deportation and wage garnishments if they don't send money to them or their \"agency\" immediately. The calls can be unsettling, but consumers should remain calm. \n\"Although the imposters are very convincing, customers should never send money to someone they don't know, especially a stranger who calls and asks for money,\" says Kim Garner, MoneyGram's senior vice president of Global Security. \"We want customers to know that a real government agency will not use the phone to request payments for fees, fines or back taxes.\" \nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission, imposter scams were the third most common consumer fraud complaint in 2014. MoneyGram remains vigilant in detecting and preventing imposter scams and urges consumers to think carefully about requests from purported government agencies to send money via MoneyGram. \nConsumers who think they may have been a victim of an imposter scam should file a police report, even if only a small amount of money was lost. Reporting a crime helps law enforcement apprehend the imposters and prevent future scams. MoneyGram also urges consumers to report the imposter scam to the company via its website www.moneygram.com or toll-free number 1-800-926-9400 if they believe MoneyGram was used to wire money as a result of a scam. \nMoneyGram has taken a leadership position in consumer fraud education and is the founding member of the Scam Awareness Alliance, a nonprofit organization that provides information about scams.
