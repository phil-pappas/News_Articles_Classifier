(IFC) is considering taking a 74% stake in Red Wings Airlines , IFC CEO Alexander Roubtsov confirmed, adding the lessor will make a final decision at a board meeting at the end of July.\nIn June, IFC representatives said Red Wings could support promoting the Sukhoi Superjet 100 (SSJ100) in Europe using wet-lease deals with European carriers. IFC purchased eight SSJ100s at the Farnborough Airshow in 2014.\nThe Moscow-based carrier is the largest operator of Russian-built aircraft in the country. Its fleet includes eight Tupolev Tu-204s aircraft, leased from IFC, as well as three SSJ100 s. Later this year, the airline expects to take delivery of two more of the type.\nIn April 2013, Russian tycoon Alexander Lebedev sold Red Wings for a symbolic RUB1 ($0.0318) to GHP Group and businessman Sergey Kuznetsov. The decision was made after Red Wings’ air operator’s certificate was suspended following the Dec. 29, 2012 crash of the carrier’s Tu-204 , which overshot a runway at Moscow Vnukovo Airport, killing five people. The airline relaunched flights in June 2013.\nAccording to Russia’s Federal Air Transport Agency, Rosaviatsia, in January-May 2015 Red Wings carried 248,432 passengers, up 20.5% year-over-year. It is the 19th biggest airline in Russia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T08:35:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
