Washington, D.C.-based CoStar (NASDAQ: CSGP) reported Atlanta-based SWH Residential Partners LLC, a development partnership of Norcross, Ga.-based Worthington Hyde Partners, bought an assemblage of 3.3 acres along the Atlanta Beltline for $5.3 million from Southeast Capital Cos. (The Masquerade concert venue and 1.32 acres for about $2.8 million), The Atlanta Beltline Inc. (0.76 acres for about $1.1 million), and The Atlanta Development Authority (1.1 acres for about $1.3 million) Southeast Capital has plans to repurpose the 26-year-old Gothic-inspired Masquerade on North Avenue — known for its three indoor stages called Heaven, Hell and Purgatory— as part of a 24,000-square-foot development. “On the remaining land, SWH Residential Partners and Southeast Capital plan to co-develop an eight-story luxury apartment complex consisting of 220 residential units, eight loft units, and a 4,500-square-foot restaurant,” CoStar said. Atlanta Business Chronicle reported in February that Southeast Capital Cos. was moving ahead with plans to add more than 200 apartment units around the historic Excelsior Mill, home to The Masquerade. A redevelopment of the old mill, built in 1901, has been in the works for nine years. In 2006, Southeast Capital Cos. bought the property for nearly $4.3 million and planned to turn it into condos. SWH Residential Partners hopes to break ground on the project in October 2015, according to CoStar. \nWant Atlanta Commercial Real Estate news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
