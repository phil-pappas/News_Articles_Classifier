Photo: Louise Kennerley\n The iron ore rout isn't done yet and the raw material will extend declines into the $US30s a metric ton this year, according to Andy Xie, an independent economist who predicted a collapse in prices in February.\nSteel demand in China is shrinking while iron ore supplies are still rising, Xie, a former Asia-Pacific chief economist at Morgan Stanley, said in an interview from Hong Kong on Wednesday after benchmark prices plunged a record 10 per cent . The slump in China's stock markets , which showed a speculative bubble was bursting, was accelerating declines, according to Xie.\n\"China's steel production is actually declining, that's the reality,\" Xie said by phone. \"All the high-cost guys have to shut down for this market to stop falling. It's not going to stabilise because Chinese demand is coming back, that's not going to happen in the foreseeable future.\"\nIron ore sank for the past 10 days on concern that low-cost output from Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Vale is rising while demand sputters in China, the world's largest user. The slump was exacerbated by tumbling equity markets in China, which prompted investors to shun risky assets, including most commodities. China's been slowing for a long time, with industrial output flat this year, according to Xie.\nAdvertisement 'All the stuff' \"Just look at Australia, new projects are coming up, look at all the stuff out there,\" said Xie. \"For BHP, Rio and Vale, they will not cut production because it doesn't make sense. Why'd you want to cut production and let the high-cost producers come online?\"\nOre with 62 per cent content delivered to Qingdao lost $US5.01 to $US44.59 a dry ton on Wednesday, according to Metal Bulletin. That's the lowest price on record dating back to May 2009, the data show. Until the past several years, the raw material was traded predominantly through annual benchmark prices and compared with those, the price would be the lowest since 2005, data compiled by Clarkson plc show.\nIn February, Xie said iron ore will slump below $US40 a ton, citing expanding low-cost supply and shrinking steel demand, and he maintained that outlook on Wednesday. Xie, who also worked at the World Bank, has tracked China for more than two decades.\nHis outlook for rising supply is borne out by projections from Australia. Shipments from the top exporter will expand 10 per cent next year, more than twice the pace forecast for 2015, the government said on June 30, citing output from billionaire Gina Rinehart's new mine and growth by producers including Rio.\nStock in Rio fell as much as 1.5 per cent to $49.31 in Sydney on Thursday, the lowest price since September 2012, and traded at $49.28 at 10.36am local time. BHP dropped as much as 1.4 per cent and Fortescue Metals Group was at the lowest since 2008. The companies are Australia's top three exporters.\n\"In the long run, we need only big, low-cost producers,\" Xie said. \"All these marginal producers that came up because of high prices, they need to vanish.\"\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T05:42:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
