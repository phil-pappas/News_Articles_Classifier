On Wednesday, it offered odds of 5/4, implying a roughly 45 percent probability.\nWilliam Hill also offered odds of 4/9 that Greece will still be in the euro zone on Jan. 1 next year, implying a probability of 69 percent. On Wednesday, its odds of 4/7 reflected a 62 percent chance of no Grexit this year.\nThe latest betting patterns come as the Greek debt crisis enters its most critical phase yet. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras raced on Thursday to finalise a tough package with tax hikes and pension reforms due within hours if Athens is to win a new aid lifeline and avoid crashing out of the euro.\nU.S. bank Citi, whose economists coined the term Grexit in 2012, on Thursday said that is now its base case scenario. Citi joins a clutch of other big banks, including JP Morgan and Barclays, who now say Grexit is more likely than not.
