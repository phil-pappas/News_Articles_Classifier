Credit has expanded more rapidly in recent years than any major economy in history, a sure warning sign.\"\nFor years, prominent shortsellers like Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates, have warned about a property, debt and investment bubble bursting in China only to see government officials engineer an economic soft landing.\nYet Gross said investors should still hold an appropriate amount of cash \"so that panic selling for you is off the table.\"\nEl-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz, said he continues to recommend a \"barbell\" approach, where investors should stay mostly in cash on one end of a portfolio and illiquid assets such as infrastructure, a portfolio of selective tech startups and certain private market opportunities in emerging countries on the other.\n\"The stock market volatility is certainly notable in China,\" El-Erian said.\nRosenberg, chief economist and strategist of Canadian asset manager Gluskin Sheff, added: \"The country is undergoing a huge deleveraging at a time of lousy demographics and an ambitious rebalancing of the economy.\"\nChina's growth has slowed from as much as more than 14 percent in 2007 to 7 percent in the first three months of 2015, its slowest quarterly pace in six years. Ivascyn said Pimco has estimates of around 6 percent in economic growth for this year.\n\"China is a monster and is the world's second largest economy,\" David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer of investment firm Cumberland Advisors in Sarasota, Florida. \"It's not to be ignored, given how interconnected China is to global markets and economies.\" (Reporting By Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Tomasz Janowski )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T12:11:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
