Already Lend Lease has lodged plans for the first $250 million commercial tower. In all, seven towers are expected at Melbourne Quarter.\nThe site runs between the Collins Street extension and Flinders Street and will include a new pad built over one of Docklands main traffic routes, Wurundjeri Way.\n Along with the pilot micro-apartments, the three towers provide for one-, two- and three-bedroom units, with an average size of 62 sq m. The largest apartment will be a a 104 sq m three-bedroom dwelling\n\"The apartments provide a highly considered blend of sizes and aspects,\" said Karl Fender.\n\"They facilitate modern lifestyle with thoughtfully laid out, flexible planning, practical yet beautiful selections of finishes, generous balconies and abundant resident facilities.\"\nLend Lease has been selling heavily into an unabated appetite for CBD product. By the time two residential projects further along Collins Street were approved last month, more than 70 per cent of their apartments had been provisionally sold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:10:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
