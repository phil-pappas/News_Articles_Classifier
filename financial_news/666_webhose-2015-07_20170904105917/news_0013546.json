AFP by Matthew Smith Long term investors are shrugging off a savage sell off in Chinese equities as they look to the next leg of an economic cycle where discretionary spend is king.\nPatrick Ho, the portfolio manager for AMP Capital's ASX-listed China Growth Fund, describes this as the \"Consumer 2.0\" theory, citing entertainment companies as among the key beneficiaries.\n\"After people have their basic necessities – once they've bought their apartments and their cars – they will want to upgrade their spiritual standard,\" Ho said, speaking from his base in Hong Kong.\nThere's been an explosion of cinemas in recent years as demand from Chinese consumers with greater disposable income and a hunger for home grown popular culture has grown, Ho said.\nAMP's China Growth Fund is the only listed investment company on the ASX devoted to the Chinese mainland A shares market – those companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchanges available to be traded by foreign investors.\nAmong his top picks are cinema chain operators and film production companies including Huayi Brothers Media and the recently listed Wanda Cinemas.\nIn addition to producing films and records, Huayi's talent agency manages many of the top Chinese A-List movie, music and TV celebrities. Meanwhile Wanda is among the newest debutants on the Shanghai Stock Exchange after being spun out of Wanda Group, the private company controlled by Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin, which also owns North American cinema chain AMC and recently acquired Australian cinema chain, Hoyts Group.\nChinese cinema explosion The explosion in Chinese cinema is an investment theme being pursued by billionaire James Packer through his Ratpac venture with Hollywood producer Brett Ratner.\nThere are a small handful of Australian investment firms with a license to trade A-shares, including AMP listed funds manager Platinum Investments and Macquarie Group.\nFor some, the existence of the China A shares market only came into sharp focus following a powerful rally that saw the Shanghai Composite index skyrocket more than 150 per cent from November last year to its recent peak in mid-June.\nThose who jumped in at the tail end of this meteoric rise might have regretted the timing, with the volatile market losing around 10 per cent of its gains in the few days.\nSome pundits are predicting more falls to come – investment firm Morgan Staley warned China A shares investors not to buy on this dip and predicted more losses in the near term.\nBut it's no surprise investors with a long view on China are less concerned with the bumps and scrapes of this market along the way.\nAustralian investors are still fairly limited in the ways they can access the China A shares market – most ordinary investors will have to invest via one of the local funds management firms here that have a license, which own shares via China's Securities Depository and Clearing Corp and not directly. More recently Market Vectors launched a synthetic ETF that offers exposure to China A shares by mirroring the movement of the CSI 300 index.\nThe managed slowdown of the Chinese government's fixed asset investment along with a debt-heavy state-run banking sector and fears of a property bubble means foreign investors have been treading carefully in China's share market directly, choosing to invest in locally-listed proxy companies instead.\nUncertainty discount This uncertainty is one of the reasons why AMP's China Growth fund has consistently traded at a substantial (circa 25 per cent) discount to the net asset value of its underlying assets, Ho said.\nAMP's listed China fund was sent a letter by UK activist hedge fund Metage Capital in May highlighting the \"unacceptable discount\" and demanding the investment firm pay capital to back to shareholders.\nBut Ho reckons the discount to AMP's NAV can be narrowed and the fund will trade close to the underlying value of its assets if he's able to better encapsulate the opportunity of some of the investment themes he's working on.\n\"Before it was possible for Australians to say they like the China story but they already had BHP and Rio, and they don't need any more China exposure. They can't say that anymore. Most people I talk to now realise they have to have China exposure in their portfolio in some way.\"\nHo said he's moved under the benchmark weight in Chinese banks within his portfolios; he explained there's only downside in the banks' earnings growth. In addition to the Consumer 2.0 theme, Ho said he liked brokerage businesses that will capture the increased sharemarket activity among Chinese investors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T01:04:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
