The utility appealed to all its customers to continue to reduce their electricity usage throughout the day but to be aware of the need to save more during the peak periods from 6am to 10 am and 5pm to 9pm. \n\"As the evening temperatures begin to drop, we urge electricity users to consider energy efficient ways of keeping warm. This is particularly important as we are currently experiencing cold weather across the country,\" it said.
