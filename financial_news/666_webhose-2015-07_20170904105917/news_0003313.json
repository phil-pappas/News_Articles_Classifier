The campaign also focused on the harmful effects of use of fake parts like damaging the car engine and causing accidents. \n'Imported items are sent to check faults and make sure they conform to the specifications' the source said adding that a recent study conducted by the customs department showed that the volume of fake parts in the local market had reached 45 percent which also increased the number of traffic accidents especially due to the malfunctioning of brakes that were made from sawdust and cardboard. The study confirmed that such commercial frauds had covered as many as one million items. \nThe Saudi Standards Quality and Meteorology Organization (SASO) has specifications especially with regards to cars and their parts. It has issued more than 200 specifications in line with international safety standards and those with the US Federal Standards which calls for the highest specifications to withstand shock endurance in times of accidents. \nSASO has laid down conditions that should be available in imported cars the most important of which is the availability of seatbelts with triple fixation for the front sets to provide support for the head and chest in times of accidents that involve colliding with the steering wheel. The organization stipulated that the front windshield should be made of plywood to stay solid during accidents. \nIn fact some fake spare parts are so well made that they are taken as genuine or original. 'The market suffers from weak control which encourages unscrupulous retailers to sell fake spare parts as original' says Saeed Salem director of spare parts in a company. \nHe said products in general need to be classified in terms of quality and place of manufacture because the Kingdom has more than 65 factories to manufacture car accessories. The Kingdom has made great strides in this industry Salem said adding that these factories have clear rules and basis to produce and manufacture spare parts in a comprehensive manner. \nThe Ministry of Commerce and Industry needs to support them to produce quality products that are approved by car manufactures he added. \nAccording to Salem a number of international car companies purchase spare parts from the Kingdom and the local market depends greatly on locally produced spare parts. \nSalem said expectations point that the number of new vehicles will reach 1 million by 2020 adding that this volume will convince investors to enter the Saudi market especially with the opening of Gulf and Arab markets for Saudi products. \nThe role of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry becomes all the more important to see that the parts manufactured are of highest quality and the market is rid of fake products a market leader observed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T08:47:41.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
