Ltd on Wednesday hiked the minimum investment amount in four of its thematic equity funds to Rs. 1 lakh, up from Rs. 5,000 earlier. These four schemes are Sundaram Select Thematic Funds-PSU Opportunities, Sundaram Infrastructure Advantage Fund, Sundaram Entertainment Opportunities Fund and Sundaram Financial Services Opportunities Fund. “Being sectoral and thematic funds, these are high-risk funds. They are more volatile than other equity funds. We have hiked the minimum amount so that retail investors and pensioners do not come in. It’s a problem if such funds are sold to, say, a 65-year-old retired person,” said Harsha Viji, managing director, Sundaram Asset Management Co. Ltd. It’s the first time that any fund house has hiked the minimum investment amount of an equity fund to such an extent. The higher minimum amount is valid only for lumpsum purchases and not for purchases made through systematic investment plans. Apart from hiking the minimum investment, Viji said the fund house has also started to make telephone calls to new investors across its equity schemes to find out, among other things, if they have “properly understood” the facets of the scheme, what it intends to do, and so on. Viji said such calls aim to find out if the schemes have been mis-sold to the investor. The fund house initially started this exercise for all new investors across its thematic and sectoral funds three months ago, but in June it extended it to all its equity schemes. By hiking the minimum investment amount, can Sundaram AMC really stop mis-selling? “No”, said Deepak N., a Bengaluru-based mutual fund distributor. “mis-selling can happen when minimum investment is at Rs. 5,000, Rs. 25,000 or even Rs. 1 lakh”. Ravikumar T.V., director, Gaining Ground Investment Services Pvt. Ltd, said informed investors invest in thematic and sectoral funds to take tactical calls. “Such genuine investors can get impacted as they now have to invest a large sum of Rs. 1 lakh”, he said. Khyati Mashru, founder, Plantrich Consultancy Llp, a Mumbai-based financial planning firm, said hiking the minimum amount can help. “The amount of Rs. 1 lakh is large, for sure. It can keep the smaller lot of investors out and so it can prevent mis-selling to an extent”, she said. Last year, the mutual funds industry came under criticism for paying high upfront fees to distributors on the back of a large number of closed-end funds launched by a few of them. Since a closed-end structure virtually locks in an investor throughout the scheme’s tenure (typically three to five years), funds had started to pay the trail or future commission upfront. Typically, funds pay some commission upfront (known as upfront fees) at the time of bringing in fresh investment and then loyalty fees (or trail commission), every year, for as long as the investor stays invested. In the case of closed-end funds, mutual funds have been paying the trail fees at the beginning. This practice is called upfronting and it resulted in the distributor commission (paid upfront) going up to as high as 5-8% last year. Fund houses dip into their own pockets to pay a high upfront fee and then later recover it from the asset management fees that they collect on the investor’s assets that stay with the fund house till the closed-end fund matures. In 2014, Sundaram Asset Management Co. Ltd launched 15 closed-end equity funds (that collected around Rs. 730 crore), followed by ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co. Ltd which launched 10 such funds that collected around Rs. 2,220 crore and Birla Sun Life Asset Management Co. Ltd, which launched nine and collected around Rs. 860 crore, according to figures provided by Value Research, a mutual fund tracking firm. In 2015, Sundaram AMC has launched four closed-end funds so far, one less than ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co Ltd. In March, the Association of Mutual Funds of India, the Rs. 12 trillion Indian mutual fund industry’s trade body, issued a “best practices” circular urging fund houses to cap the upfront commissions that they pay to distributors to 1%. Payment of future or trail commissions upfront (at the time of bringing in fresh investments) was also discouraged.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T17:05:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
