Its previous assessment of the U.S. financial system was conducted five years ago. \nMutual funds could \"act as amplifiers\" of a panic if jittery investors cash out, forcing funds to dump risky investments into a collapsing market. \nThe IMF warns that at time when ultra-low interest rates are pressuring insurance firms to take bigger risks, regulation of the business is \"fragmented\" between states. It calls for a federal regulator. \nThe IMF urges U.S. regulators to finish enacting regulations Congress passed in 2010, though some lawmakers want to \"water down\" the law. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T17:43:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
