Shipments declined in China for the first time in six years during the first quarter, according to research firm IDC, although it is unclear whether the drop was a deviation or the start of a downward trend.\nIn a statement, Lei framed Xiaomi's growth as stellar given the market environment.\n\"Even with the China smartphone market slowing down, we did a stellar job of posting a 33 percent growth on last year's numbers,\" he said. \"It can be said that we outperformed the market and produced an excellent report card.\"\nThe Beijing-based company, which has portrayed its Android devices as a cheaper but well-designed alternative to Apple Inc's iPhones, was valued by private investors at $45 billion during a capital-raising exercise in December.\nStill, it has faced increasingly stiff competition from more established firms like Lenovo Group Ltd <Lenovo Group Ltd> and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, who are showing they can compete with Xiaomi on features and price - if not quite buzz.\nSeeking to expand beyond the cut-throat Chinese market, Xiaomi has undergone a period of rapid international expansion, recently launching its phones in India and Brazil.
