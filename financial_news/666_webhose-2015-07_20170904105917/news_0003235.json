Dominic K Lorrimer A lower risk weighted assets number means less dollars of capital need to be set aside. Conversely, more risky assets require banks to raise additional capital (the numerator) in order to maintain the capital ratio.\n2. What will the impact on bank returns be?\nMaking banks hold more equity against their mortgages reduces the return on equity (ROE) on home loans.\nThe mortgage ROE for the big banks is currently around 40 per cent. With a risk weighting of 25 per cent, the ROE would fall to around 26 per cent, according to estimates by Macquarie.\n Therefore, the reduction in the ROE on their biggest asset, mortgages, will reduce the group ROE – unless action can be taken to pass the higher costs of equity on to customers or shareholders.\n3. How will banks respond?\nGiven their desire to maximise returns to shareholders, banks will do whatever they can to maintain the existing return on equity in face of increased capital.\nThe banks have a range of levers that they can pull to recover the additional costs of the higher equity, on both the revenue and the costs side of the business. They could look to increase revenue or reduce costs. Or they could change the way they pay dividends, either by issuing more shares under dividend reinvestment plans or by reducing the growth in dividends, which increases retained earnings – a key part of bank capital.\n4. What are the revenue and costs options?\nOn the revenue front, banks may increase the interest rate on standard variable home loans , or on other loans, to increase their \"net interest margin\".\nAccording to Credit Suisse, the whole cost of the additional measures announced by APRA would mean standard variable interest rates rise by around 0.2 of a percentage point, or 20 basis points.\nMacquarie analyst Mike Wiblin said on Monday banks had a \"clear mandate to reprice mortgages as funding costs rise due to the use of more (costly) equity to fund mortgages.\"\nOther revenue measures are available. Banks may decide to reduce the rate of interest paid on deposits. Or they could increase a range of bank fees.\nOn the costs side, banks could continue to look for savings, for example by employing technology to reduce overheads, to offset the higher costs of the equity.\nIt seems likely that banks' response will involve a combination of the above.\n5. How will dividends be impacted?\nBanks may decide to retain more of the profit they generate as retained earnings, a key element of capital.\nA way this could be done is to reduce the dividend payout ratio, which would increase the amount of profit kept in the bank but reduce the growth in dividends received by shareholders.\nBanks can also use their dividend reinvestment plans to raise capital. Dividend reinvestment plans attempt to induce bank shareholders to invest their dividends back in the company's shares by offering them a discount. This means shareholders receive their dividend as shares, rather than as cash.\nFor the bank, that's effectively the same as issuing new shares, which increases the amount of common equity, helping to boost the ratio.\n6. What will determine what approach is taken?\nIn one word: competition.\nBanks will be stopped from passing on the full cost of the additional equity due to competitive forces in the market place.\nThe Customer-Owned Banking Association said on Monday that if the big banks seek to increase home loan interest rates in response to APRA's new capital settings, mutual banks and credit unions might look to take market share from the major banks by holding their rates steady.\nCredit Suisse analyst Jarrod Martin said the the major banks were only likely to increase interest rates on mortgages by some of the 20 basis points because competition would restrict the big banks' ability to push up prices.\nSimilarly, competition for deposits, and the already low interest rate environment, will limit the ability of banks to slice rates to depositors too much lower.\nAnalysts have pointed out that it will be easier for banks to \"reprice\" loans if the Reserve Bank of Australia cuts interest rates again.\nBanks could recoup some of their higher capital costs by not passing on any RBA reductions to borrowers in full.\nThey could also look to other areas where competition is less intense - for example, bank fees for products such as credit cards, or interest rates on personal loans - and recoup the lost profitability from mortgages there.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/mortgage-costs-tipped-to-rise-as-banks-face-higher-costs-under-new-apra-rules-20150720-gig1nb.html"], "published": "2015-07-20T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T22:46:59.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
