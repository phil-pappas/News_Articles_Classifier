He said Britain has “plans in place” to deal with whatever outcome. Results of the vote are due Sunday evening.\n“Whatever Greece decides, Britain is prepared,” Osborne said. “We cannot be immune from these developments, but it’s all the more reason why we’ve got to keep our house in order, run that budget surplus, pay down our debts, be better prepared for whatever the world throws at us, because clearly, the world can throw anything at us.”\nThe escalation of the Greek crisis comes as Osborne prepares to deliver his first budget in a majority Conservative government on Wednesday. He has promised to keep pledges made in the election campaign. These include finding an additional 12 billion pounds ($19 billion) a year in welfare cuts.\nBenefit Reforms Osborne, who told Marr he has identified the savings, has already given details of some, with welfare for those of working age set to take the bulk of the reductions. The government will curb housing subsidies for higher earners , making local authority and housing association tenants who earn more than 30,000 pounds -- or 40,000 pounds in London -- pay market rates in rent.\n“We have to take difficult decisions like freezing working age benefits,” he said. “We’ve got to look at the benefit system and make sure it is fair to working people.”\nHe also confirmed plans to lower the cap on benefits outside London, without specifying a figure. The cap will be reduced to 23,000 pounds in the capital.\nThe chancellor said Britain’s tax-credit system was “hugely expensive” and had to be scaled back. The best way to help low- and middle-income earners is to make “sure they keep more of their own money” through tax reforms, he said.\nAsked whether he would cut the top 45 percent rate of income tax, as urged by many Tories, Osborne said he would meet the promises set out in the manifesto, which didn’t include a cut to the top rate. He has confirmed he will raise the threshold for inheritance tax , allowing people to pass on homes worth up to 1 million pounds tax-free.\nHe also refused to be drawn on whether he would announce a reform of Britain’s non-domicile rules, which allow wealthy individuals to escape paying British taxes on some of their income. The opposition Labour Party called for the rule to be scrapped in its election campaign.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T13:57:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
