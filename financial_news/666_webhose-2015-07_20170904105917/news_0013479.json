They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\" \nLatino advocates have lambasted Trump's comments as irresponsible and bigoted. \nAn online petition from the progressive group MoveOn called on Macy's to \"dump Trump\" for his \"unpleasant, nasty, and despicable behavior.\" The petition has drawn more than 730,000 signatures. \nThe Macy's Trump line includes cufflinks and money clips, in addition to pinstripe suits and French Cuff shirts. Macy's website lists 88 items under the line, most of which were on sale Wednesday. \nTrump, who has stood by his statements on Mexican immigrants, accused his former business partners of pandering to special interests. \n\"I have decided to terminate my relationship with Macy's because of the pressure being put on them by outside sources,\" Trump said. \n\"Both Macy's and NBC totally caved at the first sight of potential difficulty with special interest groups who are nothing more than professional agitators, who are not looking out for the people they purport to represent, but only for themselves.\" \nTrump also said he was \"never satisfied\" with the Macy's deal because the shirts and ties are made in China. \n\"Should I start a new product line somewhere in the future, I would insist that they are made in America,\" he said. \nThe stampede away from Trump has called into question the Miss Universe pageant, which is co-owned by Trump and has previously been broadcast on NBC and Univision. \nOn Tuesday, Bogota canceled its candidacy to host the Miss Universe show and Mexico withdrew from the contest, which is popular in Latin America. \nMiss Mexico Wendolly Esparza -- a brunette who studied journalism in the United States -- said that when she felt that going to Miss Universe would \"affect my values and the values of Mexicans, the best decision was not to participate.\" \n\"The biggest crown for Mexico is its dignity,\" she told Radio Formula.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T21:31:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
