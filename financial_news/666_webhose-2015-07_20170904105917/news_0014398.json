AMRUT aims to provide basic services like water supply and sewerage to households and build amenities in cities. The minister said this provision was made in the mission guidelines to avoid delays in the execution of projects under the mission. He said AMRUT was a time bound programme to be implemented over a period of five years from 2015 with stipulated reforms to be completed in four years. \"To avoid delays in implementation, the ministry has also left the task of preparation, appraisal and execution of projects to the states and UT unlike in the past under JNNURM,\" the minister told the Rajya Sabha.
