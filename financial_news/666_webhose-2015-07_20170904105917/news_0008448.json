The group swung to a $92m profit from a $126m loss last year, while sales surged 20% year-on-year to $23.2bn, beating analysts' expectations by over $300m. \nAmazon said it expects net sales of between $23.3bn and $25.5bn in the third quarter, compared with sales of $20.6bn in the corresponding period last year, while it anticipates operating income to be between a loss of $480m and a gain of $70m compared with a loss of $544m a year ago. \nThe Seattle-based company reported a 17.4% to $22.7bn increase year-on-year in operating expenses for package handling, marketing and streaming video content, which reflects the group's desire to reinvest its cash resources into the business. \nAmazon Web Service, the group's computing division, published results for only the second time in the company's two-decade history, reporting an 82% hike year-on-year in sales to $1.82bn, while operating profit surged from $77m to $391m. \nIn the wake of the results, Amazon's market valuation soared by over $40bn and with about 465.68m shares outstanding, the surge is expected to bring the group's market capitalisation to $262.18bn, higher than Wal Mart (NYSE: WMT - news ) 's $233.52bn. \n\"This quarter represents a big step forward for Amazon,\" said the Financial Times' Lex column . \n\"But its market value, at over $260bn, is still a bold bet on a future that will take many years to arrive, even at the current torrid rate of growth.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T12:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T13:11:05.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
