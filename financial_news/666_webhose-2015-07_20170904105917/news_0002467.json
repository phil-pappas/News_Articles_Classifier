There is still a way for someone to get the money back. \n\"The funds submitted to the UFAA are those that have been dormant for a period of two years either due to inactivity on the M-PESA Account or where a customer is deceased and the funds have not been claimed by the next of kin.\" The post added. \n\"Where funds have been submitted to the UFAA the next of kin can still claim them from the UFAA by filing a claim with them. The next of kin will be required to provide certain documentation as will be advised by the UFAA.\" It continued. \nOne can register their next of kin details, free of charge, from your phone by dialing *234# and Selecting Next of Kin.
