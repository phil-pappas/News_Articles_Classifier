The payments processor, taken private by KKR & Co. eight years ago for $29.8 billion, filed on July 20 for an IPO without naming underwriters. \nThe pitches -- commonly known as a bakeoff -- take place before most IPOs. During the interview, banks will discuss how their firms would market the deal and estimate the potential offering size and valuation for the new stock. Banks should be notified of whether or not they were mandated on the deal over the next few weeks, the people said. \nKristi Huller, a spokeswoman for KKR, and Mark Murphy, a spokesman for First Data, declined to comment on the IPO. \nKKR is seeking to extract a profit from First Data, which was financed with more than $20 billion in debt during its 2007 leveraged buyout. The company runs a debit-card network, processes bank-card transactions for banks and merchants, helps small businesses detect fraud and provides data analytics and other services to merchants. \nKKR has about $4.5 billion in exposure to First Data, Scott Nuttall, the firm’s head of global capital and asset management, said on an earnings call last week. That includes $3.2 billion in the private equity firm’s funds and $1.3 billion of its own money, said Nuttall, who serves on First Data’s board of directors.
