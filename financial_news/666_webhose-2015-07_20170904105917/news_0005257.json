Shares of Barrick Gold Corp, the world's biggest gold producer, dropped nearly 16 percent on Monday.\nBut on Tuesday the benchmark TSX index's gold-mining group jumped 4.5 percent, with the energy sector adding 1.3 percent.\n\"We're making a bit of a comeback after yesterday's selloff,\" said Irwin Michael, portfolio manager at ABC Funds.\n\"The volatility is still substantial. The oversupply issues in resources, particularly energy, need to be resolved,\" he added.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was up 52.86 points, or 0.37 percent, at 14,478.41. Five of the 10 main sectors on the index were higher.\nThe choppiness in resource shares has weighed on the index this year. It is down about 1.1 percent so far in 2015.\nAmong shares of energy producers on Tuesday, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd advanced 1.9 percent to C$32.08 and Suncor Energy Inc rose 0.2 percent to C$33.93.\nIn the gold-mining sector, Barrick advanced 4 percent to C$9.96 and Goldcorp Inc jumped 5.1 percent to C$17.59.\n($1=$1.29 Canadian) (Reporting by John Tilak; Editing by Peter Galloway)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:03:16.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
