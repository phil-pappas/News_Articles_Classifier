[] \n\"They can probably stabilise the market, but it will be a political decision, as they will have to compel government, state agencies, banks, pension funds, insurance companies to buy,\" said Ashok Shah, investment director at London & Capital. \n\"Essentially the political decision is: to transfer the potential losses from private investors ... to the state in some manner.\" \n($1 = 6.2078 Chinese yuan renminbi) \n(Reporting by Samuel Shen, Pete Sweeney, Brenda Goh and Kazunori Takada; Additional reporting by Pratima Desai in London; Writing by Alex Richardson; Editing by Will Waterman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T07:05:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
