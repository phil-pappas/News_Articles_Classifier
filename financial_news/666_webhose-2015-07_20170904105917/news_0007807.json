It is not a monetary-policy instrument.”\nThe document on the ECB’s financial-risk management clarifies the conditions surrounding emergency bank aid at a time when policy makers are restricting the provision of such funding to Greek banks. The reference to moral hazard indicates that officials are worried that bending the liquidity rules for Greece, as the country heads for a possible default, may lead future recipients to act less responsibly.\nOn Monday, the ECB increased the discounts on collateral for lenders receiving ELA from the Bank of Greece. That makes it more difficult for banks to access the funds that have kept them alive as deposit withdrawals accelerated amid uncertainty over the country’s place in the euro.\nWhile the risk of ELA is nominally borne by the national central bank that provides it, the Frankfurt-based ECB has broad discretion over the terms. The new document didn’t specify what would quantify “overly generous” provision.\nPolicy Threat An older public version of the ECB’s rules stated that ELA recipients should be solvent and that the funding shouldn’t “interfere with the objectives and tasks of the Eurosystem.” The new document goes further.\nThe ECB said ELA shouldn’t represent “a threat to the singleness of monetary policy,” or “a threat to the implementation of monetary policy, for example by making the steering of short-term rates more difficult.”\nELA also shouldn’t be “a threat to the financial independence of the national central bank, for instance if ELA was not provided against sufficient collateral to safeguard such independence,” it said.\nThe ECB reiterated a key limit on its freedom of action, namely the provision in European treaties that prevents it from funding governments. ELA should not give rise to “an obvious concern about a possible breach of the monetary financing prohibition,” it said.\nIn 2014, the ECB said it was concerned about the risk of monetary financing implied in an arrangement introduced by the Irish central bank, which replaced collateral posted against ELA loans for government bonds.", "external_links": ["https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/financial_risk_management_of_eurosystem_monetary_policy_operations_201507.en.pdf\\", "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/201402_elaprocedures.en.pdf?e716d1d560392b10142724f50c6bf66a\\"], "published": "2015-07-07T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T13:14:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
