MARCO GARCIA Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe\nProgress on a potential major Pacific Rim trade and investment agreement appears to be stumbling as the United States holds out on opening up its protected dairy sector, frustrating a push by Australia and New Zealand to sell more milk, cheese and butter into the lucrative American market.\nParticipants at a crucial meeting in Hawaii are becoming less confident that trade ministers will strike a conclusive deal by Friday's deadline because of differences over market access for agriculture, according to trade professionals in Maui close to the talks.\nTrade ministers from 12 countries, including Australia, Japan, Canada, Mexico and Peru, arrived on the island of Maui this week, talking up the prospects of an historic deal on the mooted Trans-Pacific Partnership covering 40 per cent of the world economy.\nAs expected, cutting US import limits for Australian sugar and stronger intellectual property rights for American-designed medicines remain key sticking points after two days of negotiations between trade ministers.\nOfficials and industry groups attending the meeting said on Wednesday in Maui that the TPP talks were \"intense\", with several conceding they were not progressing as smoothly as hoped.\nOne person close to the talks said progress had taken a \"backwards step on some issues\", while a foreign trade official said progress on market access for agriculture had \"stalled\".\nNew Zealand is believed to have been particularly upset at the US failure to cut tariffs and quotas for Kiwi dairy farmers such as national champion Fonterra. Australian industry is understood to share similar concerns, amid a complex standoff on diary between the four big countries of the US, Canada, Japan and Mexico.\n The 12 TPP countries believe clinching an in-principle agreement this week is vital, because further delays risk talks dragging into the Canadian election in October and US presidential and congressional elections next year.\nTrade and Investment Minister Andrew Robb said he was \"70 to 80 per cent confident\" a deal could be concluded this week, saying compromise was required.\n\"A satisfactory dairy conclusion amongst several countries is still the elephant in the room,\" Mr Robb said, listing the US, Canada, Mexico and Japan as the key players.\nCanada more open to dairy imports\nSomewhat promisingly, Canada has belatedly begun talking about steps to open up its protected supply management system that shuts out foreign dairy. It was originally hoped such a move could smooth the way for the US to open up its dairy market for other countries, but now the US appears to be being less co-operative.\nAccess to Canada for Australian dairy farmers would be welcomed, but local industry sees the much larger US market as the big potential prize because its population of 320 million people is about 10 times larger than Canada's.\nUnderlining the complex trade-offs in the negotiations, the Obama administration is pressuring Australia and other countries to grant longer patent protection for US-designed medicine data, known as biologics. Japanese press reported the US had cut its demand to 10 years, from 12 years. Australia is worried extending the patent from the current five years will increase the cost of drugs under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.\nThe powerful Republican chairman of the US Senate finance committee, Orrin Hatch, said this week it was \"very unlikely\" he could support a final TPP deal without 12 years of data protection for biological drugs.\nAn industry representative positioned on the sidelines of the talks at the Westin hotel in Maui said there was a distinct feeling that the talks were proving to be \"challenging\". \"I think everyone came here with a lot of optimism and a sense that is was going to be done, but that's probably a little lower now than at the outset,\" the representative said.\nMeanwhile, the Australian sugar industry is pressing the government to lobby the US for local cane growers to partially fill a US domestic shortage of three to four million tonnes a year.\nCANEGROWERS head of economics Warren Males said from Maui that \"there were really strong reasons for the US to take a leadership role on sugar\".\nCurrently, Australia is only allowed to sell a relatively paltry 87,000 tonnes into the US after failing to get better access in the 2004 free trade agreement signed by prime minister John Howard and president George W Bush.\nMr Robb, under pressure from Queensland National Party MPs, has vowed that Australia will not sign up to a deal without a meaningful offer from the US on sugar.\n\"If I don't get some reasonable movement on sugarâ€¦sugar, biologics and ISDS [investor-state dispute settlement] are showstoppers for us,\" Mr Robb said.\nReuters reported Mr Robb saying in Maui that ministers were considering a forum to prevent currency manipulation, a compromise between the currency manipulation hardliners in the US Congress and Asian opponents who won't accept any action on currency in the TPP.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-07-30T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:04:44.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
