Africa is one of the fastest growing regions in the world,\" Obama told the conference, where he was greeted by applause when he began with the words \"Jambo\", the Swahili for \"hello\". \"It is wonderful to be back in Kenya.\"\n\"Entrepreneurship offers a positive alternative to the ideologies of violence and division that can all too often fill the void when young people don't see a future for themselves.\"\nHe said government had a vital role on issues such as establishing the rule of law and curbing corruption, citing two issues often cited by businesses as major obstacles. He said more had to be done to help new firms secure capital.\nAn array of technology and other companies have started up in recent years in Africa in a bid to shift the continent away from a traditional focus of commodity exports, but entrepreneurs often complain they cannot find affordable capital.\n\"Africa is open for business,\" Kenyatta said in his opening in which he welcomed the U.S. president. \"It is the time for a new generation of Africans to promote inclusive prosperity.\"\nThe annual U.S.-sponsored conference was being held for the first time in Sub-Saharan Africa at a U.N. compound in Nairobi.\nObama will later pay tribute to victims and survivors of the 1998 bombing by Islamist militants of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. After that attack the embassy was moved to a site next to the U.N. compound.\nOn Saturday evening, he will hold talks with Kenyatta before attending a state dinner. Discussions are expected to focus on security and counter-terrorism cooperation.\n\"Proud to be the first American president to visit Kenya. Happy to see family, and to talk with young Kenyans about the future,\" Obama wrote on his Twitter account after arriving on Friday and meeting members of his extended family for dinner.\nSome Africans complain that Obama, whose father is buried in western Kenya, has not given paid enough attention to the continent during his presidency. Obama has sought to change that perception, in part by hosting African leaders in Washington last year.\n(Additional reporting by George Obulutsa ; Writing by Edmund Blair; Editing by Mark Heinrich )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T12:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T11:50:22.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
