James Brickwood. Share on twitter by Joanna Mather Super wealthy business owners are being told to brace themselves to be named and shamed as tax cheats if the Abbott government fails to water down new disclosure laws.\nThe Australian Taxation Office is preparing to publish details of taxable income and tax paid by 2300 companies with annual turnovers of $100 million in accordance with a law brought in by the previous Labor government.\nAn exemption proposed by the government would spare 1000 privately owned Australian companies on the basis that disclosure would effectively reveal the tax affairs of the individuals and families who own the enterprises.\nBut the exemption has to get through the Senate, which will not sit again for several weeks In the meantime public relations firm Senate SHJ has issued a 10-page briefing warning clients to be prepared.\n\"Activist groups are likely to seek targets to name and shame as tax cheats, regardless of the facts,\" the briefing said.\n\"Well-known families and individuals, some of whom may be considered pillars of the community, may well find their reputations publicly tarnished if they are associated with a corporate or family group deemed by the community or activist group as not paying their fair share,\" it said.\nWhile many of the individuals and families involved will already appear on the BRW Rich List, others have remained below the radar and want to keep it that way.\nATO officials confirmed on Wednesday they were pushing ahead with plans to publish the information, but not until November or December.\n AFR Weekend can reveal the government had the support of at least four of the six cross-bench senators it needed to get legislation passed. Bob Day, David Leyonhjelm, Dio Wang and John Madigan indicated they would support the government's exemption.\n\"Apart from the obvious risks and commercial disadvantages those companies would suffer domestically under these rules, the rules will effectively paint bullseyes on the back of some companies for foreign takeover,\" Senator Wang said.\nSenator Madigan said he agreed large companies should be transparent. \"We also need to consider the privacy and security concerns of those who stand behind them. On the face of it, the government's proposed exemption appears to strike the right balance between these competing concerns.\"\nBut wealthy entrepreneur Dick Smith said the laws did not go far enough.\nHe said Australia should be like Norway, where everybody's tax return was published annually.\n\"In Scandinavia the tax you pay is not secret,\" he said.\n\"That's really good. I don't understand why if you're a typical worker for the government then people can find out what tax you pay, but if you're a wealthy person you keep it a secret. You should be proud of it.\"\nThe requirement is that the ATO publish the names, ABNs, taxable income and tax payable for 2300 multinationals, public companies and private businesses. Coalition MPs expressed concern that revealing information about private companies would effectively expose the personal wealth of those who own them. This could open them up to kidnapping.\nQueensland University of Technology tax expert, Professor Kerrie Sadiq said the kidnap fear was \"silly.\"\n\"It isn't revealing anybody's personal tax details. It is just information about companies and only big companies that meet certain criteria,\" she said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-07-03T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T12:15:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
