Photo: louise kennerley\nNational Australia Bank is repaying 62,000 wealth customers $25 million after internal errors meant clients were not paid all the money they were owed.\nOn Friday the bank confirmed the payments would affect clients who had accounts on the Navigator Wrap platform, which NAB acquired when it bought Aviva in 2009 .\nThe problems dated back to 2001 and affected clients when they were closing accounts.\nAn internal review had identified \"errors\" relating to how income and tax was allocated to accounts. The problems resulted in money being held within the platform's funds, rather than being given to individual customers.\nAdvertisement The bank expected to pay the 62,000 customers an average of $400 each, including interest. But half the affected customers would get less than $100, it said.\nThe failure to pay clients all their money was detected in a review into the Navigator Wrap platform, which NAB launched in May last year.\nCrediting accounts \"We're now in the process of crediting the accounts,\" NAB wealth chief executive Andrew Hagger said. \"This review was instigated by us, we want to make sure we get the right amount into customers' accounts at all times.\"\nMr Hagger said NAB had reported the breach to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission after a \"significant focus\" on identifying potential breaches of its financial services licence.\n\"These errors date back to 2001 and are centred on processes and controls relating to Navigator – a platform NAB inherited when we acquired Aviva in 2009,\" he said.\n\"These errors are in no way related to the quality of NAB Wealth's advice to customers.\"\nEarlier this year it was revealed by Fairfax Media that NAB had compensated 750 customers a total of $14.5 million in the past five years in response to bad advice.\nMr Hagger said the bank's wealth division was continuing to work on compensating clients who had received bad financial advice.\n\"We continue to respond to new customer complaints within 45 days ... [the] process continues and it's progressing in a satisfactory manner,\" he said.\nNot the only one NAB was not the only large financial services institution on ASIC's radar. Macquarie Investment Management said last month it would refund $5.5 million to about 2300 clients due to system errors between 2001 and 2014.\nWestpac's BT Financial Group said in 2013 that it would compensate customers of its BT Wrap and SuperWrap platforms due to excess adviser fees.\nANZ Banking Group revealed in April it would pay $30 million in compensation to thousands of affected customers of its financial advice services who did not receive all of the services they were promised.\n\"ASIC expects banks to vigilantly monitor their platforms for issues such as this,\" ASIC commissioner Greg Tanzer said in response to the NAB problems.\n\"Any issues identified should be swiftly and proactively reported to ASIC, with a view to promptly compensating customers.\"\nNAB shares fell 2¢ to $34.08 on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:32:44.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
