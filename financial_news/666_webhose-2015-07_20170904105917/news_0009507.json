This was an increase of 45,000 barrels per day (or bpd) compared to the prior week’s average. \nThis uptick in the refinery utilization rate caused refinery operating levels to increase by 0.2 percentage points to 95.5% of operable capacity, from 95.3% in the week ended July 10. \nCompared to last year, current refinery input levels are ~1.6% higher. The four-week average refinery input of 16.7 MMbpd in the week ended July 17 was 1.7% higher than the corresponding period last year at ~16.4 MMbpd. The four-week average rose 0.5% week-over-week. Looking at four-week averages gives you a smoothed view of the trend for what is otherwise a volatile number week-over-week. \nSo, while the increased refinery activity, due to the summer driving demand, is positive for crude oil prices, it wasn’t sufficient to pull crude oil inventories lower. A surge in imports, as we saw in part one of this series, was largely what drove inventories to increase in the July 17 week. What this means \nAn increase in demand for crude oil inputs indicates that refiners such as Tesoro (TSO) and Valero Energy (VLO) as well as refining MLPs such as Northern Tier Energy (NTI) and Calumet Specialty Products Partners (CLMT) expect higher profits at current crude oil and refined product prices. The increased demand for crude oil lends a bullish tone to crude oil prices. TSO and VLO make up ~3% of the iShares U.S. Energy ETF (IYE). Refinery demand \nRefineries are the main source of crude oil demand. Refinery input levels affect crude oil inventory draws and builds. Refining throughputs affect inventory levels not only for crude oil but also for refined products such as gasoline and distillates. We’ll discuss inventory levels for these products in later parts of this series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T17:18:56.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
