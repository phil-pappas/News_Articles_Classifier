Written by: Robert McGarvey 07/27/15 - 10:36 AM EDT More Headlines Immaculate Reception: Cutting the Best Deal On Cell Phone Service \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — The retirement crisis in the U.S. is no secret with Americans fearful of outliving their assets in their golden years. But the hardships for retirees could be all the more dire : feeding America reports 8 million Baby Boomers in America go hungry pretty much daily. More of us nationwide are not getting adequate food ourselves. Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks, said that whereas four years ago it was feeding 37 million Americans, it is now providing for 46 million. But the picture looks grimmer for Boomers, a generation that matured as the American economy flourished. Now things may be turning particularly sour for that age group. Here is how ugly it gets in many Boomer households: according to Feeding America, 77% buy the cheapest food available, and 35% water down food and drink to make it stretch. Many have to choose between food and other necessities. Feeding America said 63% frequently have to decide between food and health care . One-third of the people fed by Feeding America are 50+ (Boomers usually are defined as those born from 1946 - 1964), so that puts a lot of Boomers in the nation’s soup lines. Worse: that number is almost sure to rise as more Boomers (10,000 a day according to Ross Fraser, director of media relations for Feeding America) turn 65. Many are financially unprepared for retirement, and most have little or no retirement savings, said Feeding America. The organization, in its report, added this: “in 2013, the annual median income in the U.S. for individuals between the ages of 65 and 74 was $24,644, compared to $38,643 for those ages 45 to 54.” Government benefits - such as food stamps, now called SNAP - are good as far as they go, but the evidence is that many older Americans have significant difficulty navigating a bureaucracy that may be inflexible. The primary cause of Boomer hunger: they are cash strapped , simple as that. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T18:44:01.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
