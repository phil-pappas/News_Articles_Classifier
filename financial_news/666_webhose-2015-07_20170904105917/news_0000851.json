From left, former BoQ chief Stuart Grimshaw, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank managing director Mike Hirst, ME Bank chief executive Jamie McPhee and Suncorp Bank chief executive John Nesbitt.\nRegional banks and mutual lenders gave a qualified thumbs up for the banking regulator's move to hike big banks' capital on mortgages , but they warned any advantage would depend on the majors' response and the deposit levy due in January 2016 could wipe this out.\nFrom July 2016 the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority will impose an average floor of \"at least\" 25 per cent on the risk-weighted capital the big four and Macquarie Bank hold against their mortgages, up from an average of 16 per cent now.\nThe listed regional banks Bendigo and Adelaide, Queensland, Suncorp and super fund owned ME's average risk-weighted capital on mortgages is 39 per cent. This will effectively almost halve the difference in the cost of home lending between the major and regional banks.\nIn a joint statement on Monday, the four regional lenders welcomed APRA's long-flagged move.\nAdvertisement In addition, by the time the APRA capital changes take effect, Bendigo and Adelaide and Suncorp should be well on the way to being able to set their capital at the same level as the large banks, with analysts forecasting they could reduce the average by about 10 per cent to about 30 per cent.\nBank of Queensland, while further behind on its preparation, has flagged it is also preparing to be counted as a so-called internal ratings bank.\nME chief executive Jamie McPhee said the benefit for it would depend on what the large banks did. If they did raise their interest rates or reduce discounts, or lower their deposit rates to maintain their return on equity, ME Bank would not follow suit.\n\"Assuming the majors re-price their mortgages to a degree, then it gives us the option to keep the rates where they are and gain some market share,\" he said.\nLook to take market share The Customer Owned Banking Association, which represents mutual banks, credit unions and building societies, said if the big banks raised their interest rates in response to the capital hike they would also look to take market share, rather than matching them to improve their margins.\n\"If the major banks seek to increase home loan interest rates in response to APRA's new, fairer capital settings, customer-owned banking institutions look forward to taking market share from the major banks,\" chief executive Mark Degotardi said.\n\"APRA's website lists well over 100 banking institutions that are not affected by the capital reforms, including regional banks and foreign banks, as well as customer-owned banks, building societies and credit unions.\"\nBut the biggest credit union in the country, CUA, which has about an $11 billion loan book – $6 billion of which are variable rates – said its main standard variable rate, which accounted for about 60 per cent of its variable mortgages, was linked to the average of the big fours' standard variable rates, but set between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent lower.\nIt offers another mortgage rate that has quickly increased to 40 per cent of CUA's total variable mortgages in the past 12 months and has stayed lower than the big bank rates even with reductions in interest rates. Chief executive Rob Goudswaard said if banks raised rates to maintain their returns to shareholders that rate would stay lower and discounts in future would favour owner occupiers.\n\"It is a relatively better position for us – closing that gap is a good thing,\" he said. However, he believes the large banks might maintain their interest rates and recoup their lower profits on mortgages via raising fees in their non-loan products.\nThe mutual lenders and some of the regional banks will also be hit harder by the federal government's deposit levy of 0.05 per cent due in January, because between 80 per cent and 100 per cent of their funding comes from deposits, compared to about 60 per cent for the majors. COBA calculates this will reduce their banks' profits by between 5 and 7 per cent and the majors' by about 1.3 to per cent if they absorb the levy.\nRelatively better off The capital landscape will change again when global changes come in from 2018. So-called Basel 4 will change how all risk-weighted capital is calculated. They are to be based on loan-to-valuation ratios rather than probability of default. However, the regional banks and mutual lenders are also expected to be relatively better off under these changes.\n\"In absolute terms, we're pleased with APRA's announcement and we are also hoping that the future releases of the Basel committee might see our mortgage risk rate fall further. More than 90 per cent of our lending is under the 80 LVR level,\" Mr Goudswaard said.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/big-four-returns-set-to-suffer-under-apras-new-terms-20150720-gig7mq"], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T21:12:42.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
