Sam Brownback's budget director announced $63 million in adjustments to the state's $15.4 billion budget to lessen the chances of a deficit. \nThe state finished its 2015 fiscal year on June 30 with tax collections $26 million short of expectations at $5.7 billion. The shortfall was about 0.5 percent. \nState officials are watching tax collections closely. Even with the budget adjustments and sales and cigarette tax increases taking effect this month, the state won't have much of a financial cushion in cash reserves. \nBudget problems arose after lawmakers slashed income taxes in 2012 and 2013 as an economic stimulus. \nThis story has been corrected to show that the budget adjustments announced Thursday were $63 million, not $50 million. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:54:02.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
