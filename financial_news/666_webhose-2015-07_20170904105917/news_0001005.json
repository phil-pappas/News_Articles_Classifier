Chicago, IL (PRWEB) July 21, 2015\nWe are proud to celebrate The Perritt Low Priced Stock Fund (PLOWX) for the achievement of its three-year track record.\nThe Fund invests in small-cap stocks that have a market capitalization below $3 billion, with the added discipline of a stock price below $15 at the time of initial purchase.\n“We launched The Perritt Low Priced Stock Fund (PLOWX) to offer our proven (since 1987) investment process in micro-cap stocks to investors and Financial Advisors seeking small company opportunities. The Fund broadens opportunities for our shareholders,” says Michael Corbett, Portfolio Manager and CIO (with the firm since 1990).\nPortfolio Manager Brian Gillespie, who has been working side-by-side with Mr. Corbett since 2005, adds, “We are proud of the benchmark-beating results we have achieved for our shareholders over the first three years. We are looking forward to the future of this nimble and exciting fund.”\nInvestors hire Perritt Capital Management as their small company specialist. Our shareholders are seeking an experienced portfolio management team with a strong track record in an under-researched space (small- and micro-cap), where it may be difficult for the “big name” firms to quickly capitalize on market inefficiencies, uncover small companies and thrive.\nOur shareholders trust Perritt Capital Management because of our developed niche in this under-followed asset class. Many investors’ primary concern is that they don’t have the time nor the expertise to research the thousands of small companies publicly listed. Our investors want a partner who sits down with small company management teams to uncover those which are growing, can reduce correlation to the broad stock market and increase return potential.\nWe now have added this opportunity for investors and Financial Advisors who seek Funds with a strong three-year track record. With The Perritt Low Priced Stock Fund (PLOWX) , Perritt Capital Management is optimistic in participating in the major corporations of tomorrow, by investing in dynamic entrepreneurs of today.\nThe Perritt Low Priced Stock Fund was named Category King in The Wall Street Journal amongst Small Cap Core Funds based on Lipper data.

The fund is the successor to a separately managed account. The investment policies, objectives, guidelines and restrictions of the fund are in all material respects equivalent to those of the predecessor, and the predecessor’s portfolio managers are the current portfolio managers of the fund. However, the predecessor was not a registered investment company. Had the predecessor been registered under the Investment Company Act and been subject to the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Internal Revenue Code to which the fund is subject, its investment performance may have been adversely affected. The performance information reflects the gross expenses of the predecessor adjusted to reflect the higher fees and expenses of the fund. The performance is shown net of the annual management fee of 1.00% and other expenses. The performance was achieved by the predecessor when assets were relatively small; the same strategies may not be available, and similar performance may not be achieved, when the fund’s assets are larger.\nThe fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The statutory and summary prospectuses contain this and other important information about the investment company and may be obtained by calling 800-331-8936. Read carefully before investing.\nThe Fund was ranked 15 out of 792 Small Cap Core Funds Lipper for the one-year period ending 6/30/2015. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) ranking is based on Lipper data. However, the WSJ only considers the largest class of a Fund in their “pool” of Funds for any particular category, whereas Lipper counts every class of a Fund as a separate ranking entity. Because the number of Funds in the WSJ ranking category may be smaller than the Lipper category, the WSJ ranking for the Fund may be higher than the Lipper ranking.\nLipper Analytical Services, Inc. is an independent mutual fund research and rating service.

Rankings for the periods shown are based on Fund total returns with dividends and distributions reinvested and do not reflect sales charges.\nMutual fund investing involves risk.
