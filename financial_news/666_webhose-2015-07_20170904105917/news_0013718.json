ADVERTISEMENT Thirty-nine percent, meanwhile, said the size of their workforce is not changing. \nGallup’s index in May set a record-high since it began tracking this measurement in 2008 when the recession hit. \nIn January 2008, the index received a +26 rating, but dropped to -5 by early 2009. It later reached a high of +30 last September. \nLast month’s survey found the index measured at +27 in the East, +36 in the Midwest, +33 in the West and +30 in the South. \nThe poll surveyed 16,572 full and part-time workers from June 1 to 30 with a 1-point margin of error.
