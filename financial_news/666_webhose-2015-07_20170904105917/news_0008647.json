But even though the company has only explored about 10pc of this Mozambican asset, the initial results are promising. It is estimated there are 432m carats of rubies on the site, giving the mine a 21-year life, according to resource experts SRK. \nThe production from the Montepuez mine would equate to 40pc of the global supply of rubies, giving Gemfields (LSE: GEM.L - news ) a dominant position on pricing, according to analysts. Marc Elliott from Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) has also almost doubled his estimate for the value of the ruby mine and increased the target price on the shares to 90p. \nThe big unknown when ascribing a value to the ruby mine is the future of prices. \nThe market has been weaker recently and Gemfields latest auction in Singapore showed falling prices. Questor thinks demand will remain weak as the global economy slows. \nThe lower ruby prices mean pre-tax profits are expected to fall from $36.1m (£23m), to $27.5m in the year to June. That said, the company has made good progress during the past two years. \nProduction and prices of emeralds from its 75pc-owned Kagem mine in Zambia remain steady. Meanwhile, luxury jewellery brand Faberge has enjoyed an improved performance since coming under the control of Gemfields in 2013. The creation of coloured gemstone auctions in international hubs such as Singapore has also created a route to market for the mining group. \nThe shares in Aim-listed Gemfields have jumped more than 7pc higher this week on the positive news from the ruby mine, and that restores our faith to stay positive (Buy, 59.75p, June 22) . \nCommodity, precious metal and gemstone prices are all falling, but if you can stomach the ups and downs this is one to tuck away for the long term. \nA fall in profits should be reported alongside full-year results in September. \nHowever, as production increases from the Kagem and Montepuez mines then revenue is expected to increase to $239m, giving $72m in pre-tax profits and 6.8p in earnings per share next year. \nThis investment is not without its risks but the shares trading on 13 times forecast 2016 earnings look like one that is worth taking.
