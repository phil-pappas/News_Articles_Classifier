Authorities may need to consider further restrictions on daily cash withdrawals if they accelerate before the referendum, the people said.\nSpokesmen for the ECB and the Greek central bank declined to comment.\nGreece’s vote could effectively decide its future in the euro area, after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras broke up negotiations with creditors and allowed the country’s European Union bailout program to lapse. The ECB capped Emergency Liquidity Assistance for Greek Banks at 88.6 billion euros last Sunday, after the referendum was announced.\n“The Governing Council stands ready to reconsider its decision,” the central bank said in a statement on June 28. “It will work closely with the Bank of Greece to maintain financial stability.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T18:21:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
