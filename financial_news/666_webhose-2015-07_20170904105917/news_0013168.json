Now, Morocco is trying to partner with yet another one - this time onshore. WSRW warns industry to not fall into the trap. The new controversial block, Lemsid, is located in its entirety in the territory that Morocco is illegally occupying, south of the capital city of Western Sahara, El Aaiún. \" said WSRW.

Western Sahara Resource Watch calls on all companies to not engage in the Lemsid block, or any other petroleum exploration in Western Sahara until a solution to the conflict has been found. Any oil exploration in Western Sahara taking place in violation of the wishes and the rights of the Saharawis, will only lead to a further entrenchment of the Moroccan position, and will undermine the talks for a solution to the conflict\", stated Erik Hagen, campaigner in Western Sahara Resource Watch. \nFurther exploration of the hydrocarbons are in violation of international law as long as the people of Western Sahara do not consent to it. This was the main conclusion of a legal opinion of the United Nation's Legal Office on behalf of the UN Security Council.
