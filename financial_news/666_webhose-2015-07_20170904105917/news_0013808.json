Share on twitter by Vesna Poljak A top economist at UBS says denying same-sex marriage rights erodes an economy's competitiveness and holds back labour force mobility at the expense of much-needed productivity.\nLondon-based economist Paul Donovan analysed the outcome of the US Supreme Court decision in new research published by the global investment bank.\nHe dismissed the impulse to attribute a figure to the economic value of wedding spend for same-sex marriages, arguing this was only a one-off benefit and ignored enduring contributions to trend growth from labour force productivity.\nThe economist also measured the relationship between homophobic attitudes and economic competitiveness and found populations with intolerant attitudes correlate closely with inferior competitiveness scores.\n\"Irrationally discriminating against a section of society will deny an economy the full value of that group's skill set,\" he argued.\nMr Donovan explained that denying individuals their marital rights distorts the efficient allocation of labour guided by the US example where states differed in their recognition. High labour mobility was associated with the strongest-performing US states and areas within the European Union.\nMore difficult to quantify is the impact on societal status. Mr Donovan started by addressing the existence of an economic distortion where inconsistent rights are enforced. \"It does not matter what the discriminating characteristic is – gender, religion, race, class, sexuality etc,\" he said.\n\"If one group in society is privileged relative to another, and there is no possibility of moving between those two groups, then the group denied the privilege will be economically disadvantaged and the economy as a whole will become less efficient [less productive].\"\n This, he argued, means that even if lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals have full legal rights within a same-sex union, without the ability to enter into marriage, the issue of status inferiority remains unresolved and the full potential of human capital is \"wasted\".\n\"If the word marriage has any value in society, then to deny one group the right to use the term is to send a signal that membership of that group denotes an inferior status in society. Obviously if one group is perceived as inferior, whether that perception is overt or covert, this tendency will be economically wasteful,\" the economist argued.\nHe aligned global competitiveness scores measured by the World Economic Forum with published attitudes to the LGBT community and found that the most tolerant and non-discriminatory economies were the most competitive.\n\"Raising productivity for 5 per cent to 6 per cent of the population will have an impact on trend economic growth … Investors looking for economies with a competitive edge should take note.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/@Tim_ber_wolf"], "published": "2015-07-10T12:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:04:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
