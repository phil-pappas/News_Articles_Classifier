Bloomberg Share on twitter by Joanna Mather The Coalition's pledge not to raise taxes has been shaken for the second time in a week after Treasurer Joe Hockey agreed to examine Labor's so-called Buffett rule , which would lift the tax take by $2.5 billion.\nMr Hockey has been criticised for not immediately ruling out the so-called Buffett tax, which would override existing laws on legitimate tax deductions – including possibly dividend tax credits – to set a minimum tax rate of 35¢ for anybody earning more than $300,000.\nTax advisers said some types of high-income earners, such as doctors, would be hard hit by the measure, while others would simply be able to re-structure their affairs to come in under the $300,000 threshold.\nMr Hockey told ABC radio on Monday he was seeking more information about the proposal.\nHis comments came after Prime Minister Tony Abbott last week said he was open to a GST increase but later clarified that such an increase would have to be accompanied by reform, rather than simply raising revenue.\nLeading tax lawyer Mark Leibler said the tax system included a series of legitimate and perfectly legal deductions and Mr Hockey should have put the kybosh on the \"misconceived\" idea immediately.\nBuffett rule not wanted \"The so-called 'Buffett rule' will lead to the arbitrary and inappropriate disallowance of legitimate expenses, and for that reason alone, ought not to be pursued,\" he said.\n US investor Warren Buffett called for the rich to pay more tax after learning his secretary paid more than he did. The ALP national conference agreed on Friday to consider adopting an Australian version of the rule, named after United States billionaire Warren Buffett.\nThe Australian Buffett rule was based on a paper written by The Australia Institute, which estimated 31,500 households would be forced to pay an average of $79,053 more tax a year .\nThe paper cited Australian Taxation Office statistics that showed 75 individuals earned more than $1 million in 2011-12, but paid no income tax.\n\"They did this by finding tax deductions that reduced their taxable incomes to levels below the income tax threshold,\" the paper said.\nMr Hockey told ABC radio on Monday Labor had gone six years in government without putting the rule in place, but he was nonetheless \"happy to look at it\" as part of the government's tax white paper.\nCare urged He cautioned Australia needed to be careful about pushing tax rates so high as to encourage high-income earners to move overseas.\n\"Fifty per cent of all income tax in Australia is paid by 10 per cent of the working population,\" he said.\n\"If you don't get the formula right, you are going to see mobility in that 10 per cent of the workforce, where they can go and work overseas in a way that our parents and grandparents could never have imagined.\"\nYoung entrepreneur Doug Morris, who ran a Sydney based stock portfolio management system start-up called Sharesight, said he was tempted to go offshore.\n\"Hockey is correct in flagging the mobility issue for high-income earners, or even entire businesses as is the case with tech start-ups.\n\"If the government doesn't tailor the local tax scheme for technology companies, then I expect firms to leave the country.\n\"From what we gather from other tech firms, Singapore is an awfully attractive global tech hub. It would take very little effort for Sharesight to base our operations from there.\"\nSydney accountant Daniel Vasin said there were legitimate reasons a taxpayer with income of more than $1 million could reduce their tax to zero.\nThe sale of a small business might generate $1 million but be legitimately exempt from capital gains tax, he said.\nJolyon Dare, a partner with accountancy firm HLB Mann Judd, said high-income earners who derived their wealth from assets rather than labour, would be able to plan tax to remain under the threshold.\n\"Doctors will be hit by a Buffett tax without being able to get around it because if it's income from personal exertion that doctor must be the person paying the tax on it,\" he said.\n\"So they won't be able to plan around the $300,000 rule in the same way as someone with income from assets can. Income from assets can be put into companies and trusts and, therefore, the amount that reaches an individual in a given year can be quite flexible.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-07-27T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:49:31.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
