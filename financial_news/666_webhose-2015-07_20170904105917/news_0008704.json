Jim Rice by Sue Mitchell Myer risks entering a \"dangerous spiral\" of declining customer service and sales if it cuts staff numbers and hours, analysts have warned.\nAustralia's largest department store chain says a voluntary redundancy program to reduce the number of permanent staff in 42 stores and cut the hours of part-time and casual staff by 20 per cent is aimed at increasing flexibility rather than cutting costs.\n\"This new model will give Myer stores the ability to have more flexible hours available for peak periods such as Christmas and stocktake, while ensuring appropriate levels of service during quieter times,\" a Myer spokesman said on Monday.\nIn some stores Myer's ratio of permanent full-time and part-time staff is as high as 90 per cent, making it difficult for the retailer to respond to changes in retail spending and consumer shopping habits.\nHowever, Myer employees and analysts have warned that the move, announced last Friday afternoon, risks compounding the retailer's poor service record and further alienating customers, triggering a \"dangerous spiral\" of declining foot traffic and sales.\n'Once in a blue moon' shift staff \"Sadly, if people thought you couldn't find staff in Myer before you will find even less now in October, and the staff member you will find will be a casual who has no ownership of the area they looking at since they're only there for a three or four hour shift once in a blue moon,\" one Myer employee said.\n\"I'm sure the focus is on more flexibility around rostering and managing the peaks and troughs in customer traffic and demand,\" Citigroup analyst Craig Woolford said. \"The danger of this approach is retailers are caught in a downward spiral – if sales are slow they'll tend to roster on less staff and if they roster less staff there's a chance sales will slow further as customers don't get the right level of service.\"\n \"If it's about reshaping staff on the floor i.e. more casuals to give more flexibility across the trading days, perhaps there's some rationale but if it's about cutting hours in totality that's very different,\" CLSA analyst David Thomas said. \"If they go down that path it will accelerate their decline.\"\nMyer's strategy runs counter to that of rival David Jones, which has been increasing the ratio of permanent staff to casuals in a bid to improve customer service.\nLast week, David Jones chairman and Woolworths Holdings chief executive Ian Moir said the shift towards permanent employees with better training had been a major factor behind the retailer's 10 per cent plus sales growth in the June-half.\n\"It's not just about the number of people, it's actually about the employment relationships – we are reliant less on part-timers and less on casuals, and more on permanent full-time staff,\" Mr Moir told Fairfax Media.\n\"With permanent full-time [staff] what you are getting is people who are more engaged, more motivated and who you can give more training to and more product knowledge to – that's made a big difference,\" he said.\nMyer's voluntary redundancy program in stores follows the loss of 80 head office jobs in May and comes ahead of anticipated job losses in its distribution network as the retailer closes distribution centres as part of a strategic review.\nThe VR program also appears to be at odds with the objectives of its 2010 enterprise agreement, which included a commitment to maximising permanent employment and to provide an effective career path. Myer is due to recommence negotiations for a new stores agreement in the next month.\nShop Distributive and Allied Employees Association national secretary Gerard Dwyer said the union would try to minimise the number of jobs lost and seek to impress upon Myer the importance of certainty and predictability of permanent employment for retail staff.\n\"There's a difference between the parties as to the degree to which casualisation is needed to address those ups and downs in trading hours across the week,\" Mr Dwyer said. \"We'll submit that a well managed part-time workforce can equally address that,\" he said, pointing to David Jones' recent success.\nMyer has given staff until August 4 to accept the voluntary redundancy offer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:06:30.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
