A spokeswoman for Zillow declined to elaborate and said Cohen wasn’t available to comment.\nHis departure “serves as a direct rebuke to the lofty rhetoric Zillow management has been doling out about the company’s total addressable market for the past 5 years,” Bradley Safalow, an analyst at PAA Research LLC, wrote in a report. Traffic at its Trulia operation has “slowed meaningfully” since Zillow acquired the rival site in February, he wrote.\nZillow has faced escalated competition with Realtor.com since its parent was acquired by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. last year. Meanwhile, the housing market has gathered steam.\nThe shares were down 32 percent through Thursday from their peak this year on Feb. 18, when Zillow acquired Trulia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T18:50:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
