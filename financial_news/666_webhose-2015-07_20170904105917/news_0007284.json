When lawmakers passed the first bundle of measures last week, more than a quarter of the lawmakers from Syriza, the governing party, rebelled.\n“Those who try to divide Syriza into the good and the bad guys will get no help from us,” Tsakalotos told the parliament in Athens. “Do not bank on divisions in Syriza because you will be soon proven wrong.”\nPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras is trying to hold together an ad hoc majority long enough to finalize the 86 billion-euro (£93 billion) bailout program that Greece needs to stave off financial collapse and hang on to its membership of the euro region. Abandoned by party hardliners led by former finance chief Yanis Varoufakis, Tsipras is reliant on his political opponents to deliver the measures that creditors have demanded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T04:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T00:14:11.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
