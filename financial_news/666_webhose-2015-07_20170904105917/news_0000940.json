Egg prices soared 69.6 percent, after a 42.9 percent rise in May, as an avian flu outbreak has forced farmers to kill millions of chickens and other birds. \nExcluding food and energy prices, so-called \"core\" PPI rose 0.4 percent. \nYear-over-year, producer prices fell 0.7 percent in June, the fifth month in a row of declines. \nThe pick-up in wholesale prices in June could add fuel to the Federal Reserve's plan to raise interest rates this year. The Fed has insisted muted inflation would eventually climb as the economy heals from the Great Recession. \nIn prepared testimony to Congress on Wednesday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen stuck to her forecast for an increase in the central bank's zero-level federal funds rate, saying: \"If the economy evolves as we expect, economic conditions likely would make it appropriate at some point this year to raise the federal funds rate target.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:54:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
