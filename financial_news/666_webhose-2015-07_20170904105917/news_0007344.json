The property has about 73 rooms and two retail stores at ground level.\nAdvertisement The Bourbon hotel is also ear-marked for redevelopment into apartments.\n\"The gentrification of these fringe areas, such as Kings Cross, which is transitioning from its ​traditional night club zone into more apartments, is being targeted by private investors,\" Mr Duncan said.\n\"This was evidenced by the sale of the Mercure Potts Point property to the Greenland group which is expected to redevelop it into apartments.\"\nAnother development site in the heart of Surry Hills' dining mecca, surrounded by celebrated eateries including Bourke Street Bakery and The Book Kitchen, has hit the market for the first time in over 22 years.\nLocated at 249 Devonshire Street, the 532 square metre site features three street frontages, north-east facing aspect and extensive development potential underpinned by flexible B4 mixed use zoning. The site further benefits from the Sydney light rail development, which upon completion, will travel along Devonshire Street and improve transport links in the area.\nGemma Isgro​ and Anthony Bray of CBRE are negotiating the sale via a public auction.\nMs Isgro said given the high level of buyer interest in the Surry Hills area recently and the strength of the residential development market, the property's private owner occupier had deemed it an ideal time to sell.\nIn the north, a local private investor has purchased a retail asset in the Chatswood CBD for $25 million with a yield of 3.9 per cent, outbidding over 10 groups who flew in from Hong Kong, China and interstate.\nThe property, leased to Westpac, at 425 Victoria Avenue, Chatswood, was sold through Dominic Ong, Linda Zhu and Brett Burridge​ of Knight Frank on behalf of a private investor, The Law Family.\nKnight Frank's senior director Asian markets, Dominic Ong, said the purchaser saw this as a safe haven investment, underpinned by the growth and transformation of the Chatswood CBD together with the strong tenant and secure income stream.\n\"There was intense competition in the auction room as this was a rare opportunity to secure a highly sought after freehold asset situated on one of the busiest intersections directly opposite Westfield and This is the first time this property has come to market in over 15 years and there is potential to split the ground floor into multiple tenancies with independent frontage along Anderson Street.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:17:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
