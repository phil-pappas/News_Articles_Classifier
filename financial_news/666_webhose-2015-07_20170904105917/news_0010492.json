The Fed has said it will raise rates once it sees a sustained recovery.\n\"The Fed is taking baby steps towards a rate hike,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.\n\"The Fed is doing a good job getting people ready for a rate hike before year's end, making it likely to be a low-impact event,\" he said.\nAdvancing issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered declining ones by almost 3 to 1, while Nasdaq-listed advancing issues slightly outnumbered declining issues.\nWith more than half of second-quarter results now reported, analysts expect overall earnings of S&P 500 companies to edge up 0.8 percent and revenue to decline 3.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nShares of General Dynamics hit a record high, gaining 3.9 percent after the company said it saw a rebound in demand for its Gulfstream business jets.
