Viki Lascaris Share on twitter by Philip Baker As the market was blazing ahead towards 6000 a few months ago there were many investors waiting for a pull-back.\nWell, now it's here.\nThis week the major S&P ASX 200 index posted its worst three-month period since the third quarter of 2011. Stocks fell 7.3 per cent for the three months to June 30, the worst quarter since a 13 per cent fall in the three months to September 2011.\nIt's not surprising then that since those heady days in April the major S&P ASX has shed about 8 per cent, providing an opportunity to put money to work instead of being stuck in those next-to-nothing paying term deposits.\nAnd the latest report on term deposits held with the banks shows they have dropped for the fourth consecutive month, implying some of the money has been put out to work either to pay bills, buy property or buy shares.\nWhen compared to a year ago term deposits are down by almost 4 per cent – the largest decline since 2002 – while in May investors took out $6.3 billion from the banks, yet they still have a commanding $521.9 billion left on deposit.\nThere has been no shortage of reasons for the sell-off, thanks to Greece , the Federal Reserve, China's sharemarket and some decent downgrades from Woolworths, Metcash, Seek, Flight Centre, REA Group and Nine Entertainment.\nBut for all the talk of rising volatility and warnings that investors should get used to it, the moves seen haven't been that far out of the ordinary.\n After all, there's always something for the sharemarket to be worried about.\nUp and down Deutsche Bank's strategist Tim Baker has had a look at all of the recent moves, up and down, and his spreadsheets since 2009 show there have been 19 dips or corrections. That's either a fall of 5 per cent or more or a full-blown correction, defined by a drop of 10 per cent or more.\nThat means on average there are three chunky falls a year, meaning if one occurs in the first half of the year – like the one we've just seen – it isn't that unusual.\nIndeed, he says that over the past six years, between dips, the market on a median measure trades up by 10 per cent over 47 days. As Baker points out, before the April peak the market rallied 16 per cent over 94 days, implying that a fall was due.\n\"Market weakness could easily extend further with a lack of progress in Greece. But that aside, we are upbeat. The market's peak-to-trough fall has hit 9 per cent, which is in line with average. And the duration of the weakness has been quite long – 45 days versus the median of 25 days,\" he says.\nThe broker has also run a filter of sorts through a list of stocks to see if any stand out after the sell-off. To be included the shares of the company had to fall by at least 3 percentage points more than the overall market during the sell-off since April, have their forward price earnings ratio fall and yet their earnings per share for the 2015 and current financial year could only have been downgraded by less than 3 per cent.\nWith that in mind Ansell, Westpac, ResMed, and Perpetual stack up as worth having a look, as do Coca-Cola Amatil, Fairfax (publisher of AFR Weekend ), FlexiGroup, IOOF, Mirvac, Orora and Treasury Wine Estates.\nDeutsche Bank also points out that although the forward price earnings ratio of the major index has fallen, from more than 16 times earnings to just more than 15 times as bond yields have spiked higher, over the longer term higher bond yields have a very high correlation to a high PE, as long as bond yields don't go north at a rate of knots.\nFall further Baker says both \"respond to a better growth environment\", whereas some experts are expecting the PE to fall further as the US Federal Reserve gets ready to hike interest rates.\nThe US Federal Reserve's path to higher rates hit a hurdle on Thursday night, when the latest US non-farm payroll numbers implied the economy was perhaps not quite as ready for a hike as many had thought.\nIt means that investing for yield might not have run its race. The problem for investors is that even if rates stay lower, at the end of the day share valuations can only go so high on shrinking dividend yields and expanding price-to-earnings multiples.\nAt some stage companies need to be increasing their revenue and profit.\nIt has been almost seven years since the worst of the global financial crisis, at which point the Federal Reserve not only slashed rates to almost zero but also pumped money into the system through quantitative easing. It's interesting to note the best sharemarkets now are Japan and Europe, where the central banks are still printing money.\nInvestors are also worried about the result of the Greek referendum this weekend, so the selling might continue for some weeks, until it has all been sorted.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-pain-for-miners-20150703-gi46bn"], "published": "2015-07-03T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:05:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
