More Egypt militants kill at least 64 soldiers \nThe Leviathan gasfield was one of the gas industry’s largest underwater finds in recent years when US-based Noble Energy discovered it off Haifa in 2010. Five years later, development has stalled as Israel’s politicians fight over how much of the gas windfall should go to the companies tapping it, and how much to the public in the form of taxes and lower gas prices. \nMr Netanyahu’s government, which holds a one-seat Knesset majority, is on the defensive after having agreed a backroom deal that would allow Leviathan to proceed with Noble and Delek , its co-shareholder in the field, which is majority owned by Israeli billionaire Yitzhak Tshuva. \n“It’s a great shame that there is decisive co-ordination among the tycoons and the government,” Shelly Yachimovich, MP with the centre-left Zionist Union party, said at a recent meeting, airing a widely held view in Israeli opposition circles that Mr Netanyahu’s cabinet is colluding with big business. \nThe outline was meant to settle a challenge from David Gilo , Israel’s antitrust regulator, who in December said he would review whether the two companies’ control of Leviathan represented a “restrictive agreement” because the two companies already control the smaller Tamar field. In May, Mr Gilo announced he was quitting after a compromise emerged, brokered by Mr Netanyahu’s government, that would see Delek and Noble divest some of their gas assets and agree a formula on future gas pricing. \nHowever, Mr Netanyahu was forced to refer that plan to public consultations last week after MPs attacked a deal they claimed favoured rich “tycoons”. An impassioned Knesset committee debate on the matter on Monday at times degenerated into shouting. \n“This is organised robbery,” said Yaron Zelicha, an economist and former finance ministry official who is a vocal opponent of the gas deal, as he questioned how successive Israeli governments awarded drilling licences and set gas prices. \n“We have the most expensive flats in the western world, the most expensive cars, the most expensive food, and now we will have the most extravagant margins on our gas.” More video \nThere is more at stake than just Leviathan: Mr Netanyahu says that Israel’s reputation with foreign investors is at risk, and that the country must not yield to “populism” or risk going the way of its bankrupt regional neighbour, Greece. \n“We will not capitulate to populism. we must extract this gas,” Mr Netanyahu said on Sunday. “We must find the right balance between the needs of the Israeli economy and the need to ensure both additional investments and competition.” \nThe government, along with Noble and Delek, say Israel’s tax regime, a 40 per cent ceiling on gas exports, and other controls on the gas market are already among the toughest in the developed world. \nMr Netanyahu and the gas companies have warned that if Leviathan’s investors are squeezed for more concessions, the field’s estimated 22tn cubic feet of reserves could remain undeveloped. \n“If the government doesn’t approve this arrangement in the near term, Israeli citizens will not enjoy the economic and geopolitical benefits of the development of offshore natural gas resources,” says Yossi Abu, chief executive of Delek Drilling. \nCritics, however, are crying foul over an alleged lack of transparency in the government’s talks with the gas companies. \n“You would expect your government to take care of the public interest and at least not sound like the corporations, but in fact they sound the same,” said Or-ly Barlev, a leader of the Mavak Hagaz, or “Gas Fight”, Facebook group that has helped organise protests in Tel Aviv and other cities in which thousands took part. “But in fact, they are talking the same language: we say they talk fluent Noblish.” \nMs Barlev and other protesters are heirs of a mass movement that in 2011 saw tens of thousands of Israelis protest in Tel Aviv and other cities against high living costs and the control by rich family shareholders of some of Israel’s biggest companies. \nOn Saturday evening, about 500 protesters held a demonstration in Tel Aviv’s Habima Square holding signs saying “It’s a robbery” and depicting Mr Tshuva and government ministers as pirates. “This is everybody’s gas,” they chanted. \nBoth sides’ arguments have some statistical backing. \nSocial justice campaigners point out that Israel’s level of income inequality is among the highest in the developed world, according to figures from the OECD.
