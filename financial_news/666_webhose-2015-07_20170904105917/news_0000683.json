Dannel P. Malloy says it's \"a little early to tell\" whether a reduction in a state salary account will lead to state employees foregoing future pay raises. \nA budget-related bill that passed the General Assembly during Monday's special session reduced the \"salary adjustments\" account for state employees by $13 million in fiscal year 2017. \nAsked Tuesday if that reduction to the account provides the Democratic administration with more leverage in upcoming negotiations with state employee unions, Malloy said \"it's a little early to tell.\" \nBen Barnes , Malloy's budget secretary, said labor contracts will need to be renegotiated for all state employee unions except the state police union. \nHe said the administration looks forward to reaching \"agreements at the bargaining table that are fair to them and to us.\" \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T01:51:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
