A five-year, $350 million unsecured amortising term debt facility will be used to refinance the Sirius facility and fund the project's development and operation.\nAdvertisement Chief financial officer Scott Steinkrug said the agreement put the company in a stronger position to repay future debt than if it had stuck with the existing Nova project finance facility.\n\"There is a shorter term loan so, we talking seven years moving down to five years, lower margins in the construction phase, better utilisation of the funds we have and we can also utilise the existing cash coming out of the operations,\" he said. \"So in terms of an overall cash spend to repay debt we believe we will be in quite a stronger position than Nova.\"\nCredit Suisse analyst Paul McTaggart said Independence \"could have continued with the Nova facility but this seems to provide more flexibility in terms of not constricting cash\".\nIndependence owns the Long nickel mine, Jaguar zinc-copper mine and a 30 per cent stake in the Tropicana gold project, all in Western Australia.\nBlemished report The company's June quarter report was blemished by a close to halving in its profit after tax for the period, down from $14.7 million a year earlier to $7.5 million.\nIndependence said the result was due to the impact lower copper sales at Jaguar, lower payable nickel volumes at Long and higher exploration expenses had on earnings.\nHowever, preliminary full-year results were strong, with the miner delivering the highest levels of revenue, at $499 million, and net cash flows, at $202 million, from operating activities in its 13-year history.\nMr Bradford also revealed the diversified miner would postpone a decision on the development of its $233 million Stockman zinc and copper project in Victoria until at least early 2017 as the company was \"unlikely to proceed with a second development while developing Nova\". A decision was expected to be made in October 2015.\nHe added the company was looking forward to its first cashflow from Nova in early 2017 if the proposal is approved by Sirius shareholders at a meeting expected to be held in early September.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T01:07:55.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
