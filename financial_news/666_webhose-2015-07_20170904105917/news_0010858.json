Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! NEW DELHI: It's there in one of the numerous notifications issued by the finance ministry â€” a seemingly innocuous line that could be easily missed. But some are suggesting it speaks volumes about the state of engagement between the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India. This is what it says: \"The central government hereby nominates Shri Ajay Tyagi , additional secretary (investment), department of economic affairs, ministry of finance, to be director on the central board of directors of Reserve Bank of India with immediate effect and until further orders vice Shri Rajiv Mehrishi .\" What this means is that Tyagi will attend RBI's board meetings, not the seniormost bureaucrat in the ministry, who is Finance Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi. Government circles are abuzz with talk that this is the first time that in place of the finance secretary, an officer lower in hierarchy would attend central bank board meetings. The government appoints two members to the board. The other appointee, Financial Services Secretary Hasmukh Adhia , continues to be on the board. The central bank is said to have been taken aback by the change in nominee and has asked the finance ministry about the shift. Not surprisingly, it's kept Mehrishi's name in the list of directors on its website. RBI and the finance ministry didn't respond to ET's questions. The finance ministry has previously been at pains to deny any unease with the central bank. It's not known what prompted the change, which comes after the finance ministry withdrew significant reform proposals announced in the Budget at the behest of the central bank. These included creating an independent debt management agency and allowing the Securities & Exchange Board of India to regulate government securities. Insiders speculate that the move suggests operational ties between the two sides may not be at their warmest. One senior finance ministry official said too much was being read into the notification. It merely reflected the practical difficulties involved as the RBI board meeting is held in various cities in India. \"It is a good alternative to not attending the board meeting on a regular basis due to time constraints,\" said the official, adding that it was aimed at operational flexibility. The relationship has had its ups and downs over the years given the central bank's focus on prices and the government's emphasis on growth. But while RBI governors and finance ministers have had their differences in recent times, channels at the level of officials have always been kept open, said a senior government official . Former RBI governors YV Reddy and D Subbarao, known to have sharp differences with finance ministers during their terms, would walk into the rooms of officials below secretary level for discussions or occasional chats, but this has changed. According to the RBI Act, the central bank's affairs are governed by the central board of directors. The seniormost bureaucrat in the finance ministry has traditionally been a member of this. The board can make regulations consistent with the RBI Act.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:26:24.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
