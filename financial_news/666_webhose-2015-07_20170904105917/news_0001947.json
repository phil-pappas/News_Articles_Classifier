Photo: (c) Andrew Holt By Anna White , Property correspondent 2:11PM BST 08 Jul 2015 Comments \nLandlords across the UK will be hit in the pocket after the Chancellor announced that he is scrapping tax relief on private rented homes, in an attempt to quell the economic risk posed by the booming buy-to-let market. \nMr Osborne said the income tax relief enjoyed by landlords will be cut to the basic rate, which currently stands at 20pc. The measure, which will address \"unfairnesses in property taxation\", will be phased in \"gradually\" from 2017. \nBuy-to-let landlords can offset their mortgage interest payments against their income, whereas homeowners who live in their properties cannot, he explained. \nThe popularity of buy-to-let investments has been intensified by the pensions freedom initiative that came into force in April and enabled those over the age of 55 to withdraw their pension in one lump sum, with many choosing to sink it into rental property . \nGraham Davidson, managing director of Sequre Property Investment, says: “Despite a phased approach, the reduction in tax breaks for landlords will make buy-to-let a much less attractive proposition, ultimately discouraging investment in the sector and reducing the amount of rental stock available, which will push rents up. \n“As per Labour’s proposed rental caps and controls, this is another example of politicians not understanding how the market operates, directly contradicting their apparent goals for an improved private rented sector. Landlords should be free to deduct legitimate costs, just like any other business does.” \nIt also fuelled concerns that the Government's housing reform will hit the London property market. \n“The changes to mortgage tax relief for buy-to-let landlords will particularly hit those owning properties in the more expensive quarters of central London, where the sums involved are very high and the yields extremely low,\" said Ed Heaton, a lawyer at Heaton & Partners. \n• House prices crash through the £200,000 ceiling for the first time \nGenevieve Moore, a partner at chartered accountants Blick Rothenberg, also slammed the move. \n\"This is likely to impact many of Britain's workers who have saved hard and invested in property to supplement their retirement. [We] could see a flood of buy-to-lets being sold as the squeezed middle bow out of the rental market,\" she said. But to let is a business, not an investment and finance costs should not be taxed. http://t.co/mHOeDCVAX7 — Richard Blanco (@richardblanco_) July 8, 2015 Inheritance tax - friend or foe for the housing market? \nLoudly trumpeted at the weekend , Mr Osborne officially announced that the Government will scrap inheritance tax (IHT) on homes worth more than £500,000 for single dwellers and up to £1m for married couples. \nFrom January 2015 the Chancellor will raise the inheritance tax (IHT) threshold from £325,000 per person to £500,000. This means that a married couple will be able to pass on assets worth up to £1m, including a family home, without paying any IHT at all. \nThousands of homeowners have seen the value of their properties soar in recent years, particularly in London and the South East, thanks to a buoyant property market. This has raised concerns for many about the amount of tax their estate will incur after their death. \nHere's how much you will pay under the new regime. \nSingle person", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T16:28:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
