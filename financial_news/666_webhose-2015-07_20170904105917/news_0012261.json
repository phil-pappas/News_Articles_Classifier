As Goldman Sachs analysts have said in their weekly note on oil rigs for the last few weeks now, \"should WTI prices remain near $60/bbl, US producers will ramp up activity given improved returns with costs down nearly 30% and producers increasingly comfortable at the current costs/revenue/funding mix.\" \nWe'll be back with the details of this week's rig counts once the numbers cross.
