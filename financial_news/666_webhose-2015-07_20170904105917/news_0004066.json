That is expected to grow to 700m by next year. \nThe show had racked up a staggering 1.3bn views on Sohu, the Chinese internet conglomerate, before it was taken offline. \nThe online video industry in China generated revenues of 23.97bn yuan (£2.48bn) in 2014, a rise of 76pc from the previous year, and is expected to almost quadruple in size by 2018, reaching £9.29bn. \nSohu, the new legal home of The Big Bang Theory in China, has more than 250m unique monthly visitors. Chinese internet users spend a third of their online time , a total of 5.7bn hours, watching videos. \nOther media and technology companies have been desperate to get their hands on the Chinese market. Netflix (Xetra: 552484 - news ) 's share price jumped to an all-time high , breaking through $600, following reports that the film streaming service was about to launch in China. \nUber chief executive Travis Kalanick recently announced that China, a crucial smartphone market , is the company's \"number one priority\" and unveiled a $1bn budget for the region this year. \nThe Big Bang Theory has undoubtedly enjoyed enormous success in the US, but it looks like its biggest bang is yet to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:26:13.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
