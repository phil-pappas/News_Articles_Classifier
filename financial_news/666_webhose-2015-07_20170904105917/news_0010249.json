This is a tax evasion racked aggregating to Rs5,000-6,000crore. While more than 900 entities have been banned from capital markets by the SEBI, it has also referred these cases to the Income Tax Department for further investigations. \"We have banned more than 900 entities and my guess is that the tax avoidance that has happened in these cases is more than Rs5,000-6,000 crore,\" SEBI Chairman U K Sinha said. Giving a \"complete picture\" on this menace, the SEBI chief said, \"In any country or in any market, there are always people who are trying to find loopholes and take advantage. These are the people who have criminal intent. They are not here to help in the growth of the country. They work with a desire to corner money with criminal intentions.\" \"We have given all the details to the CBDT (Central Board of Direct Taxes) and we have told them that they should probe them,\" Sinha told reporters.
