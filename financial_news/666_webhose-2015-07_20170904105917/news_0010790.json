As I see it, part of the reason that one should invest in REITs is not just to own a diverse portfolio of buildings, but to also “hire” a management team to run them.\nThe legendary investor Ben Graham believed in the importance of qualitative research – analyzing management, integrity, and uniqueness of brand. In order to assess the value of the enterprise, Graham looked at the businesses behind the securities as a prospective buyer would of the whole business. In Security Analysis, Quote: :\nIt must never be forgotten, that a stockholder is an owner of the business and an employer of its officers.\nIn an effort to measure leadership within the REIT sector, I decided it would be interesting to rank CEOs based upon their overall worth. Not just a personality contest, but instead I opted to take a more tactical approach based on hard analytics, weighted on crucial metrics such as dividend safety, shareholder returns, and market capitalization.\nWhile I won’t rule out small-cap CEOs, I will require that the CEO have at least two years of experience (in the CEO role) with a minimal market cap of $1 billion. There are some excellent CEOs running smaller REITs, but I don’t feel like it’s fair to the NBA coaches to be compared to the collegiate players.\nLeading a REIT and creating value depend on many talents that are hard to measure—strategic vision, truthfulness, and long-term planning – to name a few. And investors certainly aren’t the only stakeholders that need nurturing; the best-run REIT CEOs should connect effectively with customers, analysts, and the overall investment community.\nWhile executive compensation is important, I decided not to assign a value to a CEO’s pay package. As you know, the best CEOs are paid well and while I’m sure there are many CEO’s that are overpaid, they aren’t on the “best CEO list”. Perhaps this article can also serve as a “wake up call” aimed at certain REIT board members who don’t see their company on the list. Who knows, I may even decide to write an article aimed at “The Worst CEO’s in REIT-dom”.\nForbes Real Estate Investor\nEarn safe, reliable income with the help of veteran real estate expert Brad Thomas in Forbes’ newest advisory Forbes Real Estate Investor . The Best-Performing CEOs in REIT-dom\nIn order to find the best CEO’s in REIT-dom I decided to filter out the best candidates by utilizing my Intelligent REIT Lab (in my Forbes Real Estate Investor newsletter). Within my REIT Lab I have around eighty REITs that I research and I collect most of the data from SNL Financial.\nI decided to rank the CEOs based on the following metrics: balance sheet strength, dividend growth, payout ratio, 2-year Total Total Return, and Total Return since becoming CEO. Then I also add a “softer side” score based on the following: communication skills, transparency, etc…\nThe later categories are more subjective but I believe these metrics balance the “best CEO” approach with this broad reaching scoring system.\nPage 1 / 4 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T14:10:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
