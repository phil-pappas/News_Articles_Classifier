It has already cut interest rates four times since November and repeatedly loosened restrictions on bank lending.\nJapanese brokerage Nomura said in a note this week that it expected another 50 basis point cut to the reserve requirement ratio for banks, which would free up more money for lending, and another interest rate cut of 25 basis points before year-end.\nChina's Politburo, a decision-making body of the Communist Party, this week promised to step up targeted adjustments of economic policy to foster stable growth.
