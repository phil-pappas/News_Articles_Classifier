In performance terms, it ranks 61st out of 79 in its sector over the past year, figures from FE Analytics show.

Over the past three months, the fund ranks 34th in its category; over a five-year period, its performance remains top-quartile. \nM&G said it would not comment on fund flows. \nM&G Optimal Income , an unconstrained vehicle that can rove through global bond markets and can also buy equities, was the UK’s best-selling retail fund last year despite a 3 per cent entry fee. \nInvestors were drawn to its flexibility and strong nine-year record amid uncertain bond markets, but performance suffered in the past year from a decision to shorten duration, or sensitivity to interest rates, in preparation for rate rises that have not yet materialised. This meant the fund did not take part in a government bond rally late last year. \nThe big outflows were partly down to the fund’s popularity with continental European retail investors, who tend to move money rapidly in response to performance, said Juliet Schooling Latter, research director at Chelsea Financial Services. \n“M&G is suffering more than other strategic bond funds,” she added. The M&G fund made up the lion’s share of outflows from the strategic bond sector, according to the Investment Association, while investors also pulled £536m from corporate bond funds. \nThe product has, meanwhile, faced criticism over its ballooning size . “That fund is too big. It has too many securities in it,” said Jake Moeller, head of UK and Ireland research at Lipper. \n“Those guys are excellent bond fund managers, but when you’ve got 1,500 securities in a bond fund, it’s too many. You will approach an index position. It becomes much harder to outperform — that’s true of any fund.” \nMr Woolnough told an interviewer at Fidelity Personal Investing in May: “The larger a fund is, then by definition it makes it harder to add individual stock selection ideas. But it also depends what the purpose of the fund is. \n“In the case of Optimal Income, it’s a very wide ranging fund with a wide remit. It’s traditionally about asset allocation, and we have a whole range of big levers we can pull there, [but] investors should be aware that the larger a fund gets, the harder it gets to add value in individual stock selection, and that’s something we’ve faced over the last 10 years.” \nHe added that the fund was finding the best value in investment grade bonds, which he said were “historically cheap compared to government bonds and high yield”. The fund has since reduced its exposure to investment grade, but this asset class still makes up more than half of the fund. \nMr Hollands said that the fund, which has an underlying yield of 2.73 per cent, has an “excellent long-term record” but that his firm has a “slight preference” for the smaller PFS TwentyFour Dynamic Bond fund. \nMr Woolnough has been identified as the highest-paid employee of Prudential, M&G’s parent company, and company documents say he was paid more than £15m in each of the past two years.
