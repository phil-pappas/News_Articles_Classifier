The Exchequer Statement shows that the Exchequer deficit at end quarter 2 2015 stood at €292 million. Excluding all of the substantial one-off transactions the underlying Exchequer position is showing a year-on-year improvement of c. €2.7 billion due to increased tax and non-tax revenue and reduced expenditure. \nCommenting on the strong performance of tax revenues, Minister Noonan stated: \n“Overall, the tax performance for the first half of 2015 is ahead of expectations, with headline tax revenues coming in over 4 per-cent ahead of target. Of particular note is the performance of the main tax heads which all show significant year-on-year growth. The €478 million increase in income tax collected on the same period last year is real evidence of the number of jobs being created. This has been achieved despite the reductions in income tax and USC which I introduced in Budget 2015. Further, the €347 million increase in PRSI collected for the Exchequer also points to the increase in the number of people employed”. \nCommenting on the reduction in net voted expenditure in the first six months of 2015 Minister Howlin stated: \n“Minister Howlin welcomes the latest exchequer figures which reflect the positive economic position. The gap between our income and what we are spending has narrowed substantially compared to this time last year. Spending is broadly in line with expectations for the first half of the year. We have spent €25.7 billion delivering public services and income supports to citizens. Just over a billion of this was invested in capital projects around the country”. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T19:08:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
