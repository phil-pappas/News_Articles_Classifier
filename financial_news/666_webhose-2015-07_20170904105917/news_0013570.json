Ghartey said the Central Bank’s daily injection of 20 million dollars into the system is unhealthy for the economy. \nThe IEA is also accusing the Central Bank of breaching its own Act – Bank of Ghana Act 612, section 27 which establishes the Monetary Policy Committee and sets out its roles and responsibilities. \nAccording to the IEA, the decision by the Central Bank to inject some 20 million dollars into the economy weekly in a bid to arrest the depreciation in the value of Cedi, not only smacks of an interference in the market system, but also a blatant attempt to cheat businesses and individuals. \nEconomist and visiting Senior Fellow at the IEA, Prof. Edward E. Ghartey, told Joy Business the Central Bank’s action would go a long way to aggravate inflation. \nHe is also challenging the Central Bank to change its approach to stabilizing the cedi. \n“The economic goal is a stable exchange rate. It is possible that the exchange rate can be allowed to depreciate or appreciate a bit but the desire is to get it stabilized. If the exchange rate was like 4.30 Cedis to one dollar for example, and you inject money into the system to bring it to 2.9 Cedis to 1 Dollar, that would not cause the exchange rate to stabilize.\" \nHe advised the Central Bank not to intervene in altering the currency from where the market forces have placed it. \nThe exchange rate, he said, “should be allowed to stay where it is supported by market fundamentals. Somebody tells a sad story of how he lost 24,000 cedis due to the Central Bank’s intervention. \n\"If somebody pegged his 20,000 US dollars to the cedi at the going Exchange rate and the BoG pumps in more money and the rate that he pegged his money was say 4 cedis to the Dollar, and he ends up getting say, 2.7 cedis to the Dollar, has the man not been cheated of his money?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T16:09:49.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
