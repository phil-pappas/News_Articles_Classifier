However, that would mark the slowest pace since 1990, a year after the Tiananmen Square crackdown. \nDeveloping Asia as a whole is now expected to grow 6.1 percent this year and 6.2 percent in 2016, the ADB said, slower than the 6.3 percent previously predicted for each year. \nInflation was revised down to 2.4 percent from 2.6 percent this year, with the 2016 forecast of 3.0 percent unchanged. \nSoftness in major industrialised economies should lead to growth in East Asia -- including China, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong -- to ease to 6.2 percent this year instead of 6.5 percent, the bank said. \nIt did not say if its 2016 forecast of 6.3 percent growth for the sub-region was changed. \nForecasts for India were unchanged at 7.8 percent in 2015 and 8.2 percent in 2016, backed by a healthy monsoon and new investments. \nGrowth next year will be driven by continued service-sector expansion and \"the removal of procedural bottlenecks that have hampered investment\", the bank said. \nHowever, it added \"risks to growth prospects could emerge from further delay in passing some legislation crucial to easing land acquisition for industry and to implementing a uniform goods and services tax\". \nIndia's advance would help South Asian growth rise to 7.3 percent this year instead of 7.2 percent, the ADB said, with better-than-expected growth in Bangladesh balancing a quake-induced slowdown in Nepal. \nIn 2016 the sub-region should grow 7.6 percent, unchanged from March's forecast. \nSoutheast Asia's economic growth forecast was cut to 4.6 percent this year from 4.9 percent, and 5.1 percent next year from 5.3 percent. \nLower global commodity prices and the Russian recession will dampen growth in Central Asia, with the 2016 growth cut to 4.2 percent from 4.5 percent, though the 2015 forecast of 3.5 percent was unchanged.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T11:23:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
