The bureau, created by the Dodd-Frank reform law in the wake of the financial crisis, enforces federal protections for consumers dealing with U.S. finance companies. \nOver the last 4 years, Paymap and LoanCare pitched an Equity Accelerator Program that promised to drastically reduce borrowers' interest on home mortgages by making biweekly, rather than monthly, payments, the bureau said in a statement. The companies claimed the average customer would achieve over $33,000 in interest savings, the bureau said.

Although the companies promised to pay consumers' mortgages every two weeks, and in fact withdrew money from customers' accounts on that schedule, they simply held the money in custodial accounts and submitted payments to the mortgage holder once a month, the bureau said. \nThe companies charged an enrollment fee of $295 and, typically, fees of $2.50 for each automatic deduction from customers' checking accounts, the bureau said. Any interest savings that consumers get through the Equity Accelerator Program is because they make a higher annual mortgage payment, using the same schedule as before enrollment, the bureau said. \n\"Today's action is delivering relief for consumers deceived by Paymap and LoanCare, and sending a clear message that these practices will not be tolerated,\" bureau director Richard Cordray said in the statement. About 125,000 consumers will receive refunds, the bureau said, and both companies will be required to stop their unlawful advertising and marketing practices. \nPaymap did not admit or deny the agency's allegations, Western Union said in a regulatory filing today. Representatives of Paymap and LoanCare didn't respond to messages seeking comment on the bureau's action.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T02:15:31.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
