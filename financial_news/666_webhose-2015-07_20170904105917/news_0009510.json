Related Topics Somalia: African Forces Capture Al-Shabaab HQ \nThe survey conducted by GeoPoll also revealed that young entrepreneurs believe the Kenyan government should lay more emphasis on educating entrepreneurs than partnering with private businesses. \nSeven out of ten of the Kenyans surveyed want entrepreneurship courses introduced in schools by the government as opposed to working with the private sector. \nThe sentiment is shared by 1,000 entrepreneurs surveyed across five countries in Africa who also believe the government should do more by improving business conditions and regulations. \nThe SMS survey across Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa showed that entrepreneurs need financial resources, better facilities and services, and government support to alleviate the challenges new businesses face. \nCOMMON NEEDS \nThe study done in collaboration with GES and the US State Department will be used at the GES to highlight common needs of entrepreneurs across Africa and around the world. \n\"Being able to hear directly from the entrepreneurs helps guide our conversations at the Summit and beyond,\" Jonathan Ortmans, president of the Global Entrepreneurship Network said. \nAbout 36 per cent say they require more funding while 24 per cent want better facilities and services. Two out of ten people surveyed want more support from the government. \nHowever most of the young people polled wanted more government support while the older ones thought more financial services is crucial to expand entrepreneurship in Africa. \nThe respondents also said that financial literacy courses were more important than learning business courses or networking. Mentor programmes and trade events were less prominent the kind of support entrepreneurs required, at 13per cent each. \nHalf of the entrepreneurs in the five African countries get information to support their new companies from social media. Blogs have also grown in importance with 26per cent of the respondents saying the got key information there. \nThe mobile survey company which reached out to 200 entrepreneurs in each country showed that women and youth, the focus of GES' opening day, want funding (41per cent), government support (22per cent), market information (18per cent) and access to skilled workforce (16per cent).
