Slide 1 of 7 Along Manhattan’s 57th Street, stretching from Columbus Circle on the west side to Park Avenue on the east, you’ll soon find more than a half-dozen glittering, ultra-exclusive condominium towers that will offer unparalleled views of Central Park and virtually the entire city. Welcome to Manhattan’s Billionaires’ Row, the latest trophy real estate acquisition for the 1%.\nThe mega-projects, with some penthouse floor plans such as those at 432 Park Avenue at more than 8,200 square feet, are expected to list on average for more than $14.5 million (or $4,375 a square foot). Some even have living rooms bigger than most condos in Manhattan (the average size of a condo in Manhattan is just 1,100 square feet.)\nThe sky-high condo prices on Billionaires’ Row will also help push the average condo price for new developments in Manhattan to $7 million (or $2,787 a square foot) by 2017, according to Gabby Warshawer, head of research for CityRealty, a New York real-estate research firm. Manhattan condos on average were just $1 million in 2005, says Warshawer.\nAn inside look at Manhattan’s 'Billionaires’ Row' (2:19) For the world’s elite, the sky-high trophy condos overlooking Central Park will set new marks for luxury and price along 57th Street.\nAside from the luxurious apartments and central location, there’s something else appealing about the apartments. As Noble Black, a real-estate agent who has marketed condos in One57 points out, unlike many city co-ops (whose boards are famously picky and have turned down pop singer Madonna and former President Richard Nixon as potential residents) Billionaires’ Row doesn’t ask potential owners to open up their financial books to co-op board members — or even interview them.\nHere’s a look at what $14 million-plus will buy you along Billionaires’ Row.\nJeff Bush Slide 2 of 7 157 West 57 Street\nOne57 , built by developer Extell, was the first on the Billionaires’ Row strip to be built and is 75 stories tall and more than 1,000 feet high. The building, which includes a Park Hyatt hotel to cater to the condo owners’ every whim with room service, maid service and a spa and gym, saw its penthouse apartment sell for a record $100.5 million in December 2014 to a still yet-unnamed buyer. All told, the entire building’s 92 condos were worth an estimated $2 billion and will sell for an average of $6,300 a square foot, according to CityRealty.\nJeff Bush Slide 3 of 7 111 West 57th Street\nBuilt by JDS Development Group, it will rise 80 stories — more than 1,400 feet — and will be the slenderest tower in the world, and even taller than the Empire State Building. The 60 apartments will start at $14 million according to the developer’s website and rise to $100 million, according to CityRealty. Completion is expected in 2018.\nJeff Bush Slide 4 of 7 550 Madison Ave\nThe rehab of the 37-story Sony Building will include a $150 million penthouse and possibly a five-star hotel. The skyscraper , completed in 1983, was sold to Joseph Chetrit, a real-estate developer for more than $1 billion in 2013. The sell-out price for the property will likely approach $2 billion, or more than $4,400 a square foot, CityRealty says.\n432 Park Avenue Slide 5 of 7 432 Park Avenue\nCurrently the tallest residential building in the city at 1,396 feet, the condo development by CIM Group/Macklowe Properties recently sold the penthouse for $99.5 million.The building’s total sales will be worth an estimated $3 billion (or nearly $6,300 a square foot), according to CityRealty, assuming the 144-unit building is sold out. Closings on the remaining condos — which range from $17 million to $81 million — are expected to start at the end of the year.\nHWPR Slide 6 of 7 53 West 53rd Street\nHines Development’s 77-story condo has actually been in the works for 10 years, but has only recently started marketing its 100-plus units. The 1,050-foot high trapezoidal tower with geodesic elements will be completed in 2018 and will include a unit priced at $70 million, according to CityRealty. All told, the sell-out price will be upward of $2 billion.\nMarketWatch Slide Shows\nSports and Entertainment AFP/Getty Images • Electronic sports explained in 5 pictures\n• Summer movie fun: prequels, sequels and more\n• 10 most valuable comic book movie franchises\n• 6 movies that spectacularly destroy S.F.\n• 9 ‘American Idol’ stars who raked in most cash\nWealth GatesNotes.com • This is Bill Gates’s idea of summer reading list\n• 10 richest newcomers on billionaire list\n• Meet the richest person in each U.S. state\n• 5 celebrity money mistakes we can learn from\nEducation\n• 10 business schools that churn out billionaires\n• The best college for every major\n• 10 states where college is most affordable\n• 10 states where college is most expensive\nMoney and Investing Terrence Horan/MarketWatch • Robo advisers vs. human investment advisers\n• 5 things you don’t know about Vanguard\n• 10 ways to lower your health-care costs\n• 5 reasons you are poor\n• How much to tip everyone\nwork Shutterstock • Jobs where women make much less than men\n• 10 jobs robots already do better than you\n• 5 blue-collar jobs that pay $100,000 a year\n• 10 best-paying jobs without a college degree\n 5 once-prestigious jobs that are now B-List\nRetail Coors • 12 worst American product flops\n• 7 reasons some shoppers hate Costco\n• 5 things NOT to buy at Costco and Sam’s Club\n• What not to buy on Amazon\n• Oreo has a new, all-around-the campfire cookie\n• 10 retail tricks that make you spend more\nReal estate\n• California may really be the best place to live\n• What a $1 million home looks like across U.S.\n• Best places in U.S. to buy a vacation home\n• 5 countries for buying a second home\n• Biggest surprise among 10 greenest U.S. cities\n• The 10 smartest cities in America\n• 10 most miserable cities in America\n• Are these 7 remodeling projects worth it?\n• 10 states with best bang for taxpayers\n• 10 states with the worst bang for the buck\nRetirement Ebyabe/Wikipedia • 10 of the prettiest places to retire\n• 5 tips to help you retire early\n• 10 coastal towns where you can afford to retire\n• The 10 best states to grow old in\n• The 5 best cities for aging well\n• The best places to retire abroad — with friends\n• Great mountain towns for retirees\n• 10 most popular U.S. cities to retire in\n• 10 budget cities where you can retire in comfort\nTRAVEL Reuters • World Trade Center’s observation deck opens\n• Which passports are best (and worst) to have?\n• 5 places in Europe deal hunters should visit\n• 12 money-saving travel secrets from experts\n• 4 things NOT to buy in duty free shops\n• Airlines with the best economy seats\n• 8 must-see sites for fans of Nikola Tesla\n• 10 safest cities in the world\ncars Nissan • 7 cars that people can’t wait to trade in\n• 10 cars that could actually go up in value\n• The 10 most obnoxious car features\n• Now taking orders for sexiest supercar\n• Your flying car is finally here…almost\n• Arctic Circle: best place to drive a Lamborghini\n• 10 classic car beauties\n• 10 surprising myths about gas mileage\n• New cars, trucks with the worst gas mileage\ntechnology Planet Solar • 6 unexpected places to find solar power\n• 5 cool gadgets coming to consumers\n• 8 technologies that will change everything\n• 6 drones you need to see\nPrev Page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Next Page You Might Like", "external_links": ["http://therealdeal.com/blog/tag/550-madison-avenue/", "http://432parkavenue.com/?state=home", "http://www.one57.com/", "http://432parkavenue.com/floorplans/432_FP_Availability_PH91-96.pdf", "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DM634_WTC_ob_MD_20150525151341.jpg", "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DL941_esport_MD_20150513152450.jpg", "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DM390_carsHa_MD_20150520115640.jpg", "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DM309_gates__MD_20150519134310.jpg", "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DJ928_robots_MD_20150417142126.jpg", "http://skyscrapercenter.com/building/53-west-53rd/317", "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DJ856_womenj_MD_20150416205413.jpg", "http://111w57.com/", "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DJ202_flops__MD_20150406183702.jpg", "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DL114_pretty_MD_20150502182600.jpg", "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DF044_solar__MD_20150206111527.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T20:43:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
