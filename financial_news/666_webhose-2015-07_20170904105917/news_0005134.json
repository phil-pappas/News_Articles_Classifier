We didn't learn anything fundamentally new today with the information we saw,\" he said. \n\"There's also been a weight on the currency because iron ore futures in China are down almost four per cent.\" \nAt 1700 AEST, the Australian dollar was at 91.75 Japanese yen, up from Tuesday's close of 91.53 yen, and at 67.70 euro cents, down from 67.94 euro cents. \nThe bond market is stronger after the inflation figures missed expectations. \nThe 1.5 per cent rise in the year to June was weaker than economists' expectations of a 1.7 per cent lift, and well below the RBA's two to three per cent target band. \n\"We had a whippy session,\" RBC Capital Markets fixed income and currency strategist Michael Turner said. \n\"We rallied a bit on the CPI data. We've backed off a bit from the highs but we're still closing in reasonably firm territory.\" \nMr Turner said comments from Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens also had an impact. \n\"He said rate cuts were still on the table - that headline was enough to restore a tiny bit of a bid,\" he said. \nAt 1630 AEST on Wednesday, the September 2015 10-year bond futures contract was trading at 97.065 (implying a yield of 2.935 per cent), up from 97.020 (2.980 per cent) on Tuesday. \nThe September 2015 three-year bond futures contract was at 98.000 (2.000 per cent), up from 97.970 (2.030 per cent). @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T10:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T11:43:09.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
