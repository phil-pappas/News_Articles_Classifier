Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro Ask many of the world's brightest investors to name a book that has moulded their mind the most, and chances are they'll answer One Up on Wall Street . Peter Lynch's investment manual is littered with gems that are just as relevant for institutional giants as small-time stock pickers. In fact he emphasises the edge the average investor often has over the professional if they pay attention to the world around them.\nThe behaviour of households is a powerful driver of the economy and corporate profits, so it's well worth considering our own ever-evolving consumption patterns in our investment process. At the moment an audit of what we're doing with our time doesn't bode well for many businesses on the Australian stock exchange.\nFree-to-air TV Take the free-to-air television sector for example – it's been battered by profit warnings as eyeballs and advertising dollars flee. Seven West, Nine Entertainment and Ten have all been punished in the sharemarket with large falls. Nine has fallen by a third in value since relisting in late 2013.\nCharlie Aitken, who recently set up his own investment fund , says it's a powerful demonstration of Lynch's mantra.\n\"You look at your own children and they don't watch free-to-air television. Whereas you look at Apple – everything they have is an Apple product,\" he says.\n\"I'm always paying Apple. There is massive investing insight in looking at how your family behaves.\"\nThe assault on free-to-air business models as eyes shift to iPads and smart phones is one of many investment insights that we can glean from within our own homes.\n For Jason Sedawie, who runs a globally focused fund, Decisive Asset Management, investing in the companies of products he may consume is more than a source of good ideas. The approach also gives comfort to investors in his fund who know that when there's macro-induced panic gripping global equity markets, the flow of dollars in their direction won't be halted.\nSedawie writes a weekly investment blog on global stocks and I tapped his brain for trade ideas based on what I've seen in everyday life.\nOne is the rise of television shows, that we don't actually watch on TV. I prefer House of Cards but the popularity of Game of Thrones seems to exceed it. Australian households may have a notorious reputation for pirating but many would appreciate the money-spinning potential of Time Warner (TWX:NYSE), which owns HBO, the producer of the show.\nSedawie is an investor in Time Warner and believes that HBO's online presence will be a great catalyst for the company. The move will be attracting those who don't subscribe to a cable service, while pressuring cable companies to include HBO in their cheaper tiers.\n\"Similar to Netflix, online viewing is a much better experience on demand, no ads. They also own Warner Brothers which can add more content to their programming,\" Sedawie says.\nSports teams I'm more of a sports fan and asked about two sports-related stocks that I can't ignore.\nAs a diehard Arsenal fan, I'd be rather short the shares of the team I despise – Manchester United (MANU:NYSE), which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange – than buy their stock.\nBut I can still appreciate this 113-year-old football team's brand is among the most captivating in the world. That their local and European rivals Manchester City and Real Madrid are about to pack out the Melbourne Cricket Ground is evidence of football's unrivalled global appeal.\nThe problem is that football teams haven't proved to be great business models. The star players command enormous salaries – just this week the club forked out $165 million on two players to shore up its midfield. But once you accept, just like investment banking, the stars will capture a large share of the economic returns, then there's an investment case to be made.\nIn fact live sports is one of the few reasons most people still watch free-to-air television. The only reason I have a Foxtel subscription is to watch Arsenal in the wee hours.\n\"MANU is a play on TV sports rights. Love them or hate them [I hate them], MANU command more than 51 per cent of the Premier League's entire global TV audience,\" Sedawie says.\n\"They are monetising their brand in Asia and in the US, where soccer is becoming more popular.\"\nAnother sports-related stock I asked about is Under Armour [UA:NYSE] – \"the Nike of the new generation\". They make great gear – although they do sponsor Tottenham Hotspur, the one team I hate more than Manchester United.\n\"Their clothes can be seen on campuses and upcoming sport stars worldwide. UA is an expensive stock, but it's still predominantly an American company at a $19 billion market cap that could eventually grow into Nike's $91.5 billion market value.\"\nBut Sedawie says at a price to earnings multiple of over 70 times, it doesn't come cheap. In just three years, UA has soared by 10 times in value, which may be a warning that if we're too far behind the fashion trends, we may be even farther behind in our market timing.\nTelstra, Woolworths, Aldi These examples show that in a global wired world, the threats and opportunities for investors are borderless. But Credit Suisse's equity strategist Hasan Tevfik says there are a couple of examples of applying Lynch's outlook to the local equity market.\nOne would be to avoid Telstra in favour of its smaller, nimbler competitors like TPG, M2 and Vocus, which are capturing more revenues from the telco giant. But Tevfik agrees that many local stocks are threatened by global trends imported by global businesses. For instance the retail-focused real estate investment trusts (REITs) aren't helped by the shift towards online shopping, with no real outlet to profit from this trend on the exchange.\nThe forces of disruption are being felt strongest by one business that touches our lives more than any other – Woolworths – which along with Coles once accounted for 40 cents out of every dollar we spend.\nBut in recent months Woolworths has come under siege from ferocious low-cost competitor Aldi. More of our household dollars are certainly flowing in that direction.\nWhat is fascinating about this is that Aldi is a private company, so it's not a zero sum game. One listed company is losing, but not at the expense of another. Woolworths' shareholder profits are being divided among Aldi's private owners and, fortunately, consumers who are saving money. That's good news for us but for investors it presents a challenge that could become worse, not just in Australia but around the world.\nThe forces of change aren't just threatening some listed companies at the expense of others, but the equity market as a whole. Tevfik is concerned that more of the opportunities we see in everyday life are no longer trickling back to investors in the form of shareholder returns but are being scooped up by private owners.\nSmaller companies gain ground That's evident in one of his major investment themes – the rise of \"selfies\" – or self-managed superannuation funds. More evidence suggests rival boutique fund managers are gaining share of these assets at the expense of listed giants like AMP and Perpetual.\nMore generally, as we've seen with taxi disrupter Uber and other tech phenomena, these capital-light companies don't need the equity markets to grow, just to cash out when they've created enough wealth.\nThat's positive for households if the service or product they're providing is better or cheaper, but in deploying those savings, it's a little harder to act on Lynch's advice.
