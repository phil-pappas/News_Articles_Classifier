Phil Carrick by Trish Power The months following the end of the financial year are often the busiest time for organised SMSF trustees, and for fund administrators working on their behalf.\nAt this stage, you should have already checked off super contributions made during the previous financial year, and ensured minimum pension payments (if any) were paid. As SMSF trustee, you must also ensure your fund's assets are valued at year's end, and that you meet the reporting obligations.\nThe previous financial year accounts have to be finalised, certain paperwork has to be prepared, along with member and financial reports. You must appoint an auditor to review your SMSF and its accounts, and then lodge the fund's tax return in due course â€“ definitely before the lodgement date.\nIf tax-deductible super contributions have been made during the previous financial year, the SMSF member must submit to the trustees (you), a \"notice of intent\" form to claim a tax deduction. The trustees need to acknowledge receipt of the form, and accept the contributions into the fund.\nYou cannot lodge your personal income tax return until the trustees acknowledge receipt of your form. Your super fund then uses this form to classify the type of super contributions made, which are reported in your SMSF's annual return.\nWhile you're looking back, you also must be looking forward, into the current financial year.\nYou must review your fund's investment strategy, consider what investments to make, check your insurance cover or assess whether cover is necessary, and decide how much you intend to contribute for the year. If you're running an SMSF pension, you need to ensure that you have enough cash during the year to withdraw the minimum pension payments required under law.\nATO may risk-profile your SMSF The Australian Tax Office is also taking a special interest in what your SMSF is doing during this time; in particular, whether you are complying with investment rules, tax rules and your fund's administrative and reporting obligations.\nBe mindful that your super world has changed in two significant ways. First, the ATO may have already risk-profiled your SMSF to determine whether it is likely to breach the super rules, or if you have breached the rules, whether this poses a serious risk to your SMSF, and to the super system generally.\nSecond, if the ATO does discover that you have broken the rules, depending on the seriousness of the breach, you can expect direct attention from the ATO, and a possible financial penalty, as well as any rectification action required.\nIn the past, the ATO took a much gentler, educative approach to SMSF trustees breaking the super rules.\nThis softer approach was influenced by the fact that the ATO previously did not have many options when imposing financial penalties. In the recent past, the main penalty option was to make your super fund non-complying, which meant losing half your fund's assets in the form of penalty tax.\nUnderstandably, the ATO rarely imposed this penalty, especially for less serious breaches.\nSince 1 July 2014 however, easy-to-impose financial penalties are now available to the ATO for a suite of offences committed by naughty SMSF trustees. Importantly, the penalties are imposed on you personally, rather than on your super fund.\nSo what does that mean in practical terms?\nIf you break the rules and receive a financial penalty, you have to source the hundreds, or most likely thousands of dollars, directly from your personal savings, rather than from your super fund account.\nBefore the ATO can impose penalties on misbehaving SMSFs, the regulator has to identify the funds breaching the rules, or those at risk of breaking them.\nIdentifying risk levels So, how does the ATO consider whether your SMSF is risky?\nIn recent speeches, Matt Bambrick, ATO's Assistant Commissioner, SMSF Segment, has outlined the approach to investigating funds.\nEighty per cent of SMSFs investigated are selected by risk modelling.\nIf your auditor identifies that your fund has broken a super rule and lodges an auditor contravention report (ACR), your fund will be investigated to determine if the risk is low, medium or high.\nAccording to Bambrick, all funds reported via ACRs will receive an ATO audit, phone call or letter shortly after lodgement.\nA fund considered low-risk will receive a letter advising the trustees of their obligations and encouraging them to comply in the future. The ACR issue will then be closed and no penalties will be imposed.\nA medium-risk fund will receive a telephone call within six to eight weeks of the ATO receiving the ACR.\nThe ATO will discuss the breach and any other matters, and the fund will be given an opportunity to rectify the issue without financial penalties.\nIf the fund fails to address the issues, it may be audited and penalised.\nFines up to $10,200 If the ATO considers that details of your fund's ACR indicate it is high-risk, it will be audited.\nThe audit will cover the breaches outlined in the ACR and also other areas of concern. You can expect penalties of up to $10,200 per trustee per breach, and a possible order to undertake education, or to rectify the breach.\nThe remaining 20 per cent of funds targeted by the ATO are identified while monitoring industry activities. On taking a closer look, the ATO considers them to have taken \"undue advantage of the concessional rates of tax for complying super funds and entering aggressive tax planning arrangements\".\nExamples of such activities include claiming extra dividends on the same shares (dividend washing), incorrect allocation of fund expenses, and incorrectly claiming exempt current pension income.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T12:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:51:35.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
