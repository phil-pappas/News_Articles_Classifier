(NASDAQ: ESEA), an owner and operator of drybulk and container carrier vessels and a provider of seaborne transportation for drybulk and containerized cargoes, announced today that the effective date of its a1-for-10 reverse stock split announced on July 2, 2015 has been reset to be July 22, 2015. As announced, the reverse stock split is undertaken with the objective of meeting the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for listing the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The reverse stock split will become effective after the close of all trading on the effective date, and the Company’s common shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 23, 2015, which is the trading day next following the effective date, or such other date as determined by Nasdaq. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Instead, the Company will issue one full share of the post-reverse stock split common shares to any shareholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share as a result of the reverse stock split. Each common shareholder will hold the same percentage of the outstanding common shares immediately following the reverse stock split as that shareholder did immediately prior to the reverse stock split, except for minor adjustment due to the additional net share fraction that will need to be issued as a result of the treatment of fractional shares. The reverse stock split was authorized by the Company’s shareholders on June 19, 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T01:11:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
