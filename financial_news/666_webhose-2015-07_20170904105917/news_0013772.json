Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett The opposition to free (more correctly, freer) trade deals is getting much noisier. How destructive this will turn out to be is an open question. Much of it can be put down to opportunistic rhetoric, devoid of any realistic threat as well as any real logic.\nBut the Abbott government is still belatedly realising a more consistent and concerted selling effort is needed – even if most of its front bench seem more consumed by the future of Bronwyn Bishop than the future of free trade.\nThe gathering storm of complaints ranges from predictable outrage among Queensland cane growers afraid of missing out on the US sugar market to even more predictable muscle-flexing from the unions about threats to jobs. Then there are the vague community concerns about such issues as the ability of foreign companies to sue the Australian government or worries about the cost of pharmaceuticals.\nA coincidence of timing means a union campaign against the free trade agreement with China has ramped up, complete with emotive and dishonest advertising, just when Trade Minister Andrew Robb is in Hawaii for final negotiations over the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal involving 11 other countries although not China.\nIt's still uncertain whether a TPP deal can be done given the level of angst from various interest groups in various countries. For all the talk about this being a twenty first century agreement for a global economy increasingly based on trade in services and intellectual property, the most intense antagonism is usually for the most old-fashioned of protectionist reasons - agriculture.\nThe Canadians, for example, are not about to open their heavily protected dairy sector ahead of a close election this October. The real political issue is how much that timing and detail affecting Canada can be fudged. Australian cane growers also won't get the access they want to the US market and will have to be content with a modest improvement in tonnage – no matter how much the Nationals fulminate.\nNuances of state dispute resolution But nor will Australia, as well as others, agree to extending the patent protection for US drug companies out to more than five years. Robb will also have to keep carefully explaining the nuances of investor state dispute resolution, including why this protects companies investing overseas but deliberately allows the Australian government to exclude policy areas like public health and the environment for its own purposes.\n That's still assuming all those trade ministers can now nut out an acceptable agreement given the political timetables of various countries, including the US.\nFor Australia, however, the key agreement with its most important trading partner in China is already supposed to be finalised.\nIt can only be unravelled if Labor can manage to alter some of the relatively minor enabling legislation in the Senate over the next couple of months. It's an outcome that remains unlikely despite the furore being whipped up.\nTony Abbott told the Boao Forum meeting in Sydney that free trade agreements are too important to be \"sacrificed at the altar of short-term xenophobic politics.\"\nHis primary target is the union scare campaign, led by the CMFEU and backed by Labor, against various aspect of the free trade agreement with China, in particular the supposed impact on Australian jobs.\nThe Prime Minister insists, with good reason, that to try to amend any part of that agreement is to re-open it all – with big risks to Australian businesses, exports and jobs. The Chinese won't wear it.\nThe ALP leadership does understand this political reality no matter how much its MPs seem willing to placate the unions over their long standing antagonism to temporary 457 visas for skilled workers.\nPenny Wong, shadow minister for trade, announced Thursday the Prime Minister should \"stop playing the race card and start answering genuine questions about the impact of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.\"\nNew Government restrictions on foreign investment do weaken its arguments but Wong's assertion certainly takes genuine nerve given the openly racist nature of the union campaign. It would still be an extremely regressive step for Labor to vote against an agreement it always supported in principle both in government and in opposition\nIt's even more regressive given the deal does not in any way weaken the protections for Australian workers. Instead it increases the prospects for Australian jobs given the aim for greater Chinese investment in Australia and Australian investment in China.\nThere's no altering the precipitous decline in Australia's terms of trade with China given the collapse in prices for exports like iron ore and coal, and a Chinese economy slowing from its previous extraordinary pace. Yet that only makes the FTA more important in offering greater opportunities to Australian companies to export more services and agricultural products to a fast changing Chinese market rather than just the big boys expanding the volume of commodities exports.\nThat doesn't mean any change to the current rigorous requirements for testing of the Australian labour market ahead of actually bringing in any skilled Chinese workers to fill gaps, including on big projects. Nor does it weaken the skills necessary for Chinese workers to be granted 457 visas. This process will continue to be administered by the Department of Immigration according to complex regulations – with which the free trade agreement must comply.\nAt the Boao Forum, Fortescue chair Andrew Forrest was only one of the business leaders concerned about the deliberately misleading nature of the ad campaign, describing the attempts to meddle with the deal as \"economic vandalism\".\n\"If it weren't so dangerously wrong, it could almost be humorous,\" he said. \"All those protections exist and to pretend they don't because we have signed a free trade agreement is being misleading and irresponsible about Australia's economic future.\"\nBut economic logic is always harder to hear when there's so much political nonsense peddled.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-07-30T15:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:06:28.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
