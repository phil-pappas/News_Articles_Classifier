The case is being investigated by Malaysian authorities and a parliamentary committee. \nNurul Izzah, a parliamentarian and daughter of jailed ex-opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, called for Cameron's entourage to also meet with the opposition. \nMeeting only with Najib's government \"would be seen as if they were oblivious to the undercurrents here and the public concerns,\" she told AFP. \nOn Monday, Cameron will meet with Indonesian leader Widodo as well as the head of regional bloc the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). He departs for Singapore on Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T06:03:22.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
