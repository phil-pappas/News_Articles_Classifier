Quentin Jones The bank said there has been a strategic shift within China from mining and resources deals to infrastructure assets, reflecting a move in its economy away from heavy industry into transport, logistics and engineering with a long-term investment focus.\n\"When you talk to the senior folk in those firms, it's not just a pure investment thesis,\" said Lyndon Hsu, HSBC's Asia Pacific head of leveraged acquisition finance. \"In fact the returns these investors are making you could not describe as being short term, high level returns. They are actually more longer term based returns.\"\nWhile long-term supplies of Australian iron ore and coal remain critical for China, deals are unlikely to be so closely tied to the mine gate, according to Mr Hsu who points to China Merchants and Hastings' preference for long dated, reliable returns from the Port of Newcastle.\n\"Clearly China Merchants were attracted to the infrastructure asset and they like the long-term returns associated with that type of investment,\" said Mr Langsford.\n Assets up for sale in the next six months are expected to include the NSW Government's $20 billion lease of its electricity poles and wires; Origin Energy's APLNG gas pipeline in Queensland for up to $6 billion and Santos's GLNG pipeline, which could fetch a similar sum.\nBG Group struck a $US5 billion deal in December to sell its QCLNG gas pipeline to APA Group as part of a tender that also drew a bid from $US200 billion sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation.\nMr Langsford said Chinese companies will look at both the APLNG and GLNG deals .\n\"The pipeline asset that sold at the back end of last year – QCLNG – went to APA but there was clearly China sovereign wealth investors who were lined up in bidding consortium and bidding for that asset,\" said Mr Langsford. \"There will be other pipelines in Queensland later this year that we expect they will bid for in addition to NSW electricity poles and wires assets.\"\nSome Chinese companies gained a reputation during the peak of the mining boom for overpaying on assets. While most of the big bang deals fell away as the climate for Australian mining moved into cost cutting mode following a slump in the price of commodities, the Port of Newcastle price tag last year stunned many investors.\nThe NSW Government expected to reap around $1 billion for the port, but the final price came in at $1.75 billion, representing a multiple of 27 times earnings. That followed a $5.2 billion price tag for the Port Botany and Port Kembla assets sold by the NSW Government, raising questions over whether an IFM led consortium had overpaid for its port assets .\nHowever, Mr Hsu said Chinese investors' reputation of overpaying for assets no longer held true.\n\"They are relatively disciplined,\" said Mr Hsu. \"They are often winning those assets so they are paying the highest price but they doesn't mean they are overpaying.\"\nMr Langsford also emphasised that Chinese investors were increasingly looking beyond price and also focusing on how China could take the learnings and expertise from its infrastructure investments in Australia and put them to use in China.\n\"The ability to take the technology and know how from these high end value assets and importing that technology and know how back to China and effectively using those technologies to improve whatever standards are required in China is important,\" said Mr Langsford.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/fund-manager-ifm-tips-high-prices-for-privatised-infrastructure-20140601-39ckx.html"], "published": "2015-07-08T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T04:09:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
