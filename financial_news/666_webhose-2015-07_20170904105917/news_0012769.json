More than $3.2 trillion has been wiped off the Chinese equity market in less than a month. Meanwhile, European bourses continued to feel the effects of the Greek debt crisis. The German DAX tumbled 2pc to 10,676.78, while 2.3pc was knocked off the CAC in Paris. * Why Chinese stocks are in turmoil With little progress on the Greek front, energy and mining stocks fell sharply in afternoon trade, as a slump in metal and oil prices dragged the index towards a six-month low. Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) and Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) were knocked into negative territory after copper prices fell to a five-month low amid mounting concern about economic growth in China. Glencore became the biggest FTSE 100 laggard, hitting its lowest level - down 17p, or 6.9pc, at 230.6p, while Anglo American lost 50.9p to close at 832.3p. \nMeanwhile, oil prices slumped for a second consecutive day, after their biggest sell-off in five months on Monday, before steading by market close. Iran’s attempts to seal a deal with global powers to release more of its oil into an already oversupplied market weighed on oil prices. US crude futures were changing hands at $56.66 a barrel by yesterday evening. BP slid 10.9p to 418.6p and Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) fell 39p to £17.61. As oil prices weakened, easyJet and IAG flew higher in afternoon trade, jumping 14p and 3.8p, respectively, amid the prospects of cheaper fuel. \nElsewhere, shares in chip designer Arm Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) were marginally lower amid mixed messages from brokers. Investors initially piled into the chip maker - which makes products for Samsung and Apple (Swiss: AAPL.SW - news ) - after Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) lifted its target price from 980p to 1180p, upgrading it to “overweight”. \nThe bank urged investors to forget about a slowdown of the smartphone market, and instead see the “buying opportunity” it has created, offering long-term revenue and earnings growth. Francois Meunier, of Morgan Stanley, advised “the duration of growth is longer than the market believes, marking ARM a good example of a compounding stock in tech and outside tech”. While analysts acknowledge the smartphone industry is slowing down unit wise, they believe “the mix is improving”. \n“In our view, the share of Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) is increasing, especially in China,” Mr Meunier said. Interestingly, analysts point to the pricing of smartphone chips, which they say is stabilising. “We believe that the upgrade cycle for 4G smartphones is helping chip prices stabilise”, Mr Meunier wrote. At its current level, Arm Holdings’ share price make it an interesting entry point Morgan Stanley says, as concerns around smartphone growth and some contagion risk around Greece weigh on the stock. \nHowever, Morgan Stanley’s note comes less than two weeks after Bernstein slashed the stock’s target price from 1000p to 800p , citing the slowdown in the smartphone sector as the very reason for doing so. Fearing a deep deceleration in smartphone shipments it downgraded the stock to 'underperform’. Nevertheless, investors appeared to have short-term memories on Tuesday morning, as the stock jumped as much as 2.5pc before closing down 0.5pc at £10.31. \nBritain’s benchmark index was also dragged lower by Rolls-Royce who extended their losses for a second consecutive day after the FTSE 100 engine-maker issued its fifth profit warning since January 2014 on Monday. A slew of broker downgrades followed on Tuesday, as RBC Capital Markets, Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) , JPMorgan (LSE: JPIU.L - news ) Cazenove, among others slashed its price target. David Perry, of JPMorgan, said the company will be in “a major transition phase, over the next three to four years”, and as such, the sales growth during this period will be average. Rolls-Royce dropped a further 43p, or 5.5pc, to close at 759.5p - bringing its two-day loss to 11.7pc. * New Rolls-Royce boss Warren East faces £2bn headache in first week Meanwhile, Land Securities (LSE: LAND.L - news ) made strides on Tuesday - up 20p, or 1.6pc, to £12.50 after UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) lifted its rating to 'buy’ from 'neutral’, believing the stock is trading at a discount. “Investors may be concerned by rising bond yields and that we may be reaching the peak in the cycle, but we think this is misplaced,” Osmaan Malik, of UBS, said. \nElsewhere, a trading update from Marks & Spencer (Other OTC: MAKSF - news ) was relatively in line with subdued expectations . The British retailer posted a dip in first-quarter underlying sales in its clothing, footwear and homewares business. Investors were left disappointed by the retailer’s inability to sustain the positive momentum in the general merchandise business - which were down 0.4pc on the previous quarter. “Whilst today’s update has taken us back to familiar territory for Marks & Spencer, with one step forward and one step back, we remain positive on the short-medium term potential,” Darren Shirley, of Shore Capital said. Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) were off 2.2pc at 535p. * Marks &Spencer has 'alienated' core customers Finally, Aim-listed Eagle Eye soared 9.1pc to 216.5p following the announcement of its multi-year contract with Sainsbury’s. Phill Bundel, chief executive, described the contract win as a “significant milestone” for the company. “Eagle Eye is becoming a key lever in retailers’ struggle for customer loyalty and the industry standard network for digital vouchers,” George O’Connor, of Panmure Gordon, said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T00:46:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
