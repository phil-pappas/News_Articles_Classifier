All three major stock indexes ended up more than 1 percent, in what some strategists described as a relief rally.\nBut some said doubts would remain until the proposal is actually accepted.\n\"Investors did not like that a Grexit is still on the table if Parliament votes no,\" managing director at BK Asset Management, said in a note to clients. \"The risk is far less now than a week ago but the fact that it is not eliminated puts pressure on the euro.\"\nThe euro last traded at $1.0998, down slightly on the day. Against the yen, it was steady at 135.84 yen .\nThe greenback was buying 123.52 yen, up slightly, ahead of congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday that will be closely monitored for any further hints regarding the timing of an interest rate hike.\n\"The dollar should have a relatively easy time topping 124 yen, especially if Yellen sounds hawkish during the testimony,\" said Junichi Ishikawa, market analyst at IG Securities in Tokyo.\nIn commodities trading, U.S. crude slipped about 1.1 percent to $51.62 a barrel, pressured by reports that Iran was close to a deal with six world powers that would allow it to sell its oil again on the oversupplied world market.\nA draft nuclear deal between Iran and six major powers calls for U.N. inspectors to have access to all suspect Iranian sites, including military, based on consultations between the powers and Tehran, a diplomatic source said on Tuesday.
