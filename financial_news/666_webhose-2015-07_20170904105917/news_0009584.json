The levy applies from July 1, and if there are any changes in the rate over the next decade, SkyCity will be able to offset any licence or regulatory fee against the gaming tax, it said. In May, the company said its Darwin casino continued to experience challenging trading conditions. SkyCity's Northern Territory casino generated revenue of $A73.1 million in the six months ended December 31 and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $A21.6 million. SkyCity's shares last traded at $NZ4.19, and have gained eight per cent this year.
