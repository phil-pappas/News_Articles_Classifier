The firm uses computer algorithms to determine how it trades.\nTumbling stock markets in June have curtailed the best start to a year for hedge funds since the financial crisis of 2008. In Europe, the STOXX Europe 50 index fell 4.6 percent in the month amid uncertainty about whether Greece will remain in the euro. Chinese equities slumped on concern valuations have reached unsustainable levels.\nIn addition to European stocks, Winton said it lost money on its bets against the euro and corn.
