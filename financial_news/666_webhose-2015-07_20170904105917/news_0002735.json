REUTERS/Toru Hanai \nBy Lisa Twaronite \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks skidded on Wednesday after earnings dragged down U.S. equities, while the dollar edged away from highs hit earlier this week. \nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan extended losses and was down about 1 percent. \nS&P 500 mini futures (ESc1) were down about 0.4 percent from late U.S. levels, after U.S. equities tumbled on weak earnings from bellwethers IBM (IBM) and United Technologies (UTX), while Apple Inc (AAPL.O) slumped in late trading after posting its results. \nJapan's Nikkei stock index (.N225) dropped 1.3 percent on track to snap its six-day rising streak, and pulling away from Tuesday's nearly four-week closing high as the Apple news reverberated on related tech shares. \n\"Since the market had been rising, such bad news can take a toll,\" said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities. \"But the impact from Apple's weak forecast should not drag on.\" \nSpot gold (XAU=) shed about 0.6 percent on the day to $1,094.50 per ounce, after plunging to five-year lows on Monday as investors unloaded bullion against a backdrop of improving risk sentiment as Greece agreed on a plan with its creditors that will keep it in the euro zone for now. \n\"Our commodities strategists believe gold should range-trade around current levels, but they do not dismiss the possibility of further price falls, given the lack of safe-haven interest,\" strategists at Barclays wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. \nStandard & Poor's on Tuesday upgraded Greece's sovereign credit rating by two notches and revised its outlook to stable from negative, citing euro zone countries' initial agreement to start negotiations with Athens on a third bailout. \nThe euro edged down about 0.1 percent on the day to $1.0927 (EUR=), edging back toward Monday's three-month low of $1.0808. \nThe dollar index rose about 0.1 percent to 97.392 (.DXY) after rising as high as 98.151 in the previous session, its highest level since late April. \nThe dollar edged down about 0.2 percent against the yen to 123.69 yen (JPY=) after scaling a six-week high of 124.48 yen on Tuesday. \nCrude oil futures remained under pressure as investors worried about ample supply. \nU.S. crude (CLc1) was down 1.6 percent at $50.05, while Brent (LCOc1) shed about 1 percent to $56.50. \n(Additional reporting by Ayai Tomisawa in Tokyo; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Eric Meijer) Apple Inc", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T08:26:52.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
