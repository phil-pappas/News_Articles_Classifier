New Zealand Markets close in 5 hrs 12 mins ANZ targets retirement inequality View Photo \n\nOne of Australia's largest banks, ANZ, will provide free finance advice to women with a superannuation balance of less than $50,000 in what it says is an effort to close the gender gap in retirement savings. \nThe bank will also provide paid parental leave for two years, up from one year previously, and pay a $500 a year super top-up to its female workers. \nThe move comes after an ANZ-commissioned report found full-time working women will earn on average $700,000 less throughout their lifetime than men and are more likely to retire in poverty. \nANZ boss Mike Smith said the bank was committed to pay equality for women, and gender equality, including equal representation for women in senior leadership roles, was a priority for the business. \n\"Promoting diversity and gender equality is a priority in our business,\" chief executive Mike Smith said. \n\"Much more still needs to be done though to achieve full gender equality in the workplace and while we recognise we're not there yet, today's announcement is about rethinking how we address the imbalances women face in the workplace and in retirement.\" \nThe ANZ Women's Report: Barriers to Achieving Gender Equity looked at the financial experiences of women from birth to grave, finding that those working full time earn $15,000 a year less than men. \nOver a typical 45-year career, the pay gap means women end up retiring from the workforce with $700,000 less than men. \nThey are also more likely to end their careers with, on average, around half as much superannuation as men and to be 15 per cent more likely to experience poverty in retirement. \nThat's despite women between the ages of 25 to 29 being more likely to hold a university degree. \n\"Unfortunately, Australian women are more likely to retire in poverty than men,\" the report said. \n\"This is largely because they are paid less for the same work and they often revert to part-time jobs to assume child rearing or family responsibilities at some point in their lives.\" \nThe report found that the main reason many women continue to earn lower wages than men for similar work was simply because of their gender. \nTypecasting around educational and employment choices continues to play a role in the gap, leading to women being over-represented in lower-paid work. \n\"Some occupations remain skewed by gender due to lingering stereotypes about the types of roles women and men should follow and the flexibility offered in those roles,\" the report said. \nIn Australia's most lucrative industries, including mining and financial services, women tend to be employed in lower-paying jobs, such as administration. \nSex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick said time spent out of paid employment to care for others continued to affect women's lives disproportionately. \n\"I have often asked myself: `Is poverty to be the reward for a lifetime spent caring?'\" she said. \n\"This is where many women in Australia are at.\" \nBARRIERS TO FINANCIAL GENDER EQUALITY \n* Women make up 35pct of the full-time workforce \n* Women's pay packets are an average 18.8pct less than men \n* Female uni graduates earn on average $3,000 less a year \n* Women spend almost twice as much time on unpaid work \n* Just 20.4pct of ASX 200 board members are female \n* 90pct of women will retire with inadequate savings \n* One-in-five women yet to retire have no superannuation \n(Source: ANZ Women's Report)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T02:55:37.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
