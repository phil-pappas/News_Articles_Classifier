Ben Franklin’s SGICC Releases Study on Opportunities to Use Natural Gas and Propane as a Transportation Fuel in Pennsylvania Press Release : Ben Franklin Shale Gas Innovation and Commercialization Center – 10 minutes ago Print \nSTATE COLLEGE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \nUsing funds provided by the PA Department of Community & Economic Development (DCED), the Shale Gas Innovation & Commercialization Center ( www.sgicc.org ) commissioned a study regarding the “Opportunities to Use Natural Gas and Propane as a Transportation Fuel in Pennsylvania”. \nThe SGICC commissioned the study in an effort to offer an educational tool for anyone considering purchasing or converting to CNG/LNG or propane vehicles, or installing a fueling station for natural gas powered vehicles. Gannett Fleming, a full service consulting and engineering firm headquartered in Camp Hill, PA was chosen to author the study, with assistance from the Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Central & Northern PA’s Transformation Business Services Network. \nBill Hall, SGICC Director noted, “We’ve been closely following the acceptance and conversion to the use of natural gas or propane in the United States’ transportation market - especially in our region over the last few years. There are many options available which can create confusion and uncertainty. But, there are niche opportunities that definitely make economic sense for companies to switch to using natural gas or propane to power their vehicles even with the relatively low price of gasoline and diesel. It’s our intention to supply a resource that companies can use to educate themselves and help them consider the options.” Hall also noted that the study should be considered just one resource available for interested parties to use as a reference guide. \nThe study is posted on the SGICC web site at http://www.sgicc.org/dced-grant-white-papers.html . \nThe Ben Franklin Shale Gas Innovation and Commercialization Center ( www.sgicc.org ), an initiative of Ben Franklin Technology Partners/CNP ( http://www.cnp.benfranklin.org ) is designed to harness innovation and new technologies as a means to maximize the economic return to Pennsylvania’s citizens from the various shale formations that comprise part of the energy reserves of the Commonwealth. The Center also identifies, supports, and helps commercialize technologies and early-stage businesses that enhance responsible stewardship of the environment while properly utilizing this transformative energy asset.
