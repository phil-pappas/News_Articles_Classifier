All they have to do is spread the word and tell their friends, colleagues and loved ones about how beneficial and satisfying it is to be a Societe-General customer, to be guaranteed rewards' he said. \nThe promotion, which runs from now until December 31, 2015, works by rewarding existing customers who refer new customers to the bank while also rewarding the new customers when they open a current account with the bank. \nMr Francois Marchal, Deputy Managing Director of SG Ghana, the Spread the Word promotion was in line with the bank's strategy to show its customers that it valued their enthusiasm and loyalty. \n'We believe that it is important to build real team spirit with all our customers and this is the best way to achieve this,' he said. \nHe said the positive feedback received from customers showed that they would be the best candidates to honestly share their joy and satisfaction at being on the SG Team with others. \n'When our customers spread the word, you can trust that their opinion is highly objective and unbiased and rooted in their day to day experiences with the bank.' \nMr Frederick Addy, Head of Segment and Product Development, said when a referred person, who must be a salaried worker, opens a current account with an initial deposit of GH¢ 50.00, he or she would receive a welcome gift. \nThe referrer receives rewards at three stages of the promotion: when the referred person's salary, pension or social security is paid into the new account, the referrer receives GH¢ 25.00, paid directly into his/her account. \nIf the referred customer receives three consecutive salaries, both the referred and the referrer earn 50 points, if the referred applies for and is given a loan of GH¢ 5000.00 and above within the promotional period, he/she receives 50 points while the referrer receives 100 points. \nMr Addy said at the end of the promotion, the total points accumulated would be converted into cash and paid into the customers' accounts. \n'Everyone wins because there are no restrictions with regard to how many people you can bring on board as referred customers! In fact the more people you bring on, the more rewards you get,' he said, adding: 'Bring five people, you can walk away with up to GH¢ 875.00 bring 10 people and you will get GH¢ 1,750.00.'
