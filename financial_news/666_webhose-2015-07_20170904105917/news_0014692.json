By Roland Head | Fool.co.uk – 28 minutes ago +0.12 \nRecent market weakness means that a number of high-yielding shares have just got cheaper. \nIn this article, I'll ask whether now is the time to buy Ashmore Group (LSE: ASHM), Berkeley Group Holdings (LSE: BKG) and Laura Ashley Holdings (LSE: ALY) \nAshmore Group \nEmerging markets asset manager Ashmore Group has suffered from poor sentiment towards emerging markets over the last year, but do the fundamentals justify this decline? \nAshmore shares are 23% lower than 12 months ago, meaning they now offer a prospective yield of 6%, which is expected to rise to 6.25% in 2015/16. \nAlthough dividend cover of 1.2 times is a bit tight, in my view, the firm's strong cash generation suggests to me that a cut is unlikely unless trading gets much worse. \nAshmore is expected to report a 15% rise in earnings per share for the year just ended, placing its shares on a P/E of 13.3. Earnings are expected to fall by around 5% this year, giving a forecast P/E of 14.0. \nThis valuation looks about right, in my view. I reckon Ashmore could prove to be a strong long-term income buy, for investors who are able to ignore any short-term weakness. \nLaura Ashley \nLifestyle retailer Laura Ashley has paid a dividend of 2p per share, unchanged, since 2012. That gives a cracking 6.8% yield. \nI'd normally be suspicious of such a high yield, but this payout is covered by earnings so there's no obvious reason to expect a cut. However, the firm's decision to spend £31.1m on a buying an office building in Singapore to use as its Asian headquarters did surprise me. \nAlthough international sales are increasingly important at the firm, international revenues only account for 10% of sales at the moment. Significant expansion will be required to justify this purchase, which will use up most of the firm's cash and require it to move from net cash to net debt. \nThis could weaken support for the dividend if trading slows in the future. However, on a forecast P/E of 11.8 and with a covered 6.8% yield, I still rate Laura Ashely as a buy at 30p. \nBerkeley Group \nBerkeley recently completed a 434p per share capital return to shareholders. The firm plans to return a further 433p by September 2018 and another 433p by September 2021. \nAnalysts' forecasts suggest that this year's portion of this payout will be 150p per share, giving a prospective yield of 4.4%. That's attractive, and for existing shareholders probably represents a good reason to hold. \nHowever, I think a closer look at Berkeley's valuation is needed for potential new investors. \nBerkeley's shares have risen by 36% so far this year. This has left the firm's shares trading on 2.8 times their book value. \nI think this is quite a demanding valuation, especially as profits are expected to be broadly flat this year, putting the shares on a forecast P/E of 14. \nAlthough a 48% rise in earnings per share is expected in 2016/17, there's no guarantee that market conditions won't change before then. Land, labour and material costs may rise, or house prices may weaken. \nIn my view, Berkeley is a high-quality company, but is already fully valued. I'd hold. \nThe three stocks featured in this article all have the potential to deliver a rewarding income. \nThey aren't the only strong income buys in today's market, however. \nThe five stocks featured in \" 5 Shares To Retire On \" all offer unique advantages and a compelling investment case for investors wanting a market-beating dividend income . \nYou can find full details of all five companies in this FREE, no-obligation report . \nTo receive your copy today, all you have to do is click here now . \nRoland Head has no position in any shares mentioned.
