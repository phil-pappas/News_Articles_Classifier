It also involved constructing and furnishing four shops, a school, and a prayer centre, as well as digging two artisan wells equipped with a 4,000-litre water tank and a solar-powered pump.\n\nThe second project involved building 44 family housing units for 264 people in the village of Erukkalampitti, in addition to two fully-furnished shops.\n\nThe Sri Lankan government contributed the land on which the houses were constructed.\n\nAs the executive partner, Serendib Foundation for Relief and Development (SFRD) conducted a field survey to identify the beneficiaries.\n\nA QRC delegation visited Sri Lanka to explore the rules and regulations for building houses, secure the necessary licences and approvals, and examine building materials. The delegation also took a field tour of the project sites. SFRD is a leading Sri Lankan Islamic charity with 110 main offices and 10 district offices in major cities, in addition to the headquarters in Colombo. It has experience in building housing units at reasonable prices to match the local market.\n\nQRC's delegation visited four housing projects already implemented by SFRD in different areas, with funding from Kuwait.\n\nCompleted in less than 12 months, the housing units were made in compliance with international and environmental standards. The components and material for execution were purchased from the local market, and execution was done by local labourers. \n\nThe houses and facilities of the projects were handed over during the Holy Month of Ramadan to 114 families, after approving the lists of beneficiaries developed by local government and public bodies. The school will be opened this summer to hold Quran memorization sessions. The mosque will also be used for the same purpose.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:40:39.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
