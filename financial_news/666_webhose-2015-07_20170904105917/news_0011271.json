Sheriff Bojang, Minister of Information and Communication Infrastructure, in his remarks, described the laying of the foundation as another significant achievement in the country's ICT sector. \nMinister Bojang described President Jammeh as the \"Jaliba\" of the women of The Gambia as wherever he goes and whenever he speaks, he praises and encourages them to seize the day. \nThe advent of the GSM business has created opportunities for employment and entrepreneurship development in The Gambia, he noted, adding that the GSM and ISP industry has created, from 2001 to date, thousands of jobs for people, both directly and indirectly, and generated billions of dalasi for the economy. \nFor her part, Mrs Aminata Jallow-Ceesay, founder and CEO of Marimoo, her journey did not start today but was inspired by President Jammeh who is the champion of women's empowerment. \nWomen have a voice today because President Jammeh has given them one, she remarked, saying they the women could only continue to contribute to national development as President Jammeh has given them the opportunity and they would never let him down. \nMadam Jallow-Ceesay thanked the management and staff of Africell, her family, husband and friends, as well as her staff, for supporting her. \nShe also thanked President Jammeh for creating the enabling environment for making sure the voice of women is heard, saying \"his leadership is worth emulating\". \nOther speakers on the occasion included Papa Leigh, Director of Public Relations at Africell, Mr Barry, who deputised for the managing director of Africell, and Mayor of KMC Yankuba Colley.
