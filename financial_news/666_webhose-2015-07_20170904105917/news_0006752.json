Japan's largest media company will take on the FT Group, which publishes the iconic Financial Times, after Pearson spent a few weeks exploring the sale. Atif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers , said if the transaction would be a \"positive move for Pearson even though they would be selling a strong asset and brand\". \nNumis has predicted Pearson would reveal broadly flat first-half underlying growth on the back of revenues of £2.17bn, adjusted operating profit of £103m and adjusted pre-tax profit of £67m. \n\"Our first half profit represents just 9% of the full year,\" said analyst Gareth Davis in a note published on Thursday before Pearson announced its sale of the FT Group. \n\"We remain comfortable with our 'reduce' recommendation into this set of results.\" Friday 24 July INTERIMS Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) , Beazley INTERIM DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE Dunedin Smaller Companies Inv Trust, Electra Private Equity, Octopus Titan VCT , Paragon Group Of Companies, RWS Holdings (LSE: RWS.L - news ) , TP5 VCT, TP5 VCT 'B' Shares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) , Zytronic QUARTERLY PAYMENT DATE Land Securities Group, Real Estate Credit Investments PCC Ltd INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ANNOUNCEMENTS New Homes Sales (US) (15:00) GMS (Taiwan OTC: 6481.TWO - news ) Afren IMSS Marston's, Vodafone Group (NasdaqGS: VOD - news ) SPECIAL DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE Direct Line Insurance Group, Northern 2 VCT AGMS Axis Bank Ltd GDR (Reg S), China New Energy Limited (LSE: CNEL.L - news ) , DJI Holdings (LSE: DJI.L - news ) , Edinburgh Inv Trust, Greka Drilling Ltd (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ), Greka Engineering & Technology Ltd (LSE: GEL.L - news ) .
