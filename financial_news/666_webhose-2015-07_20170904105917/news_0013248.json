He said they were in conversation with law enforcement agencies regarding the operation. \nMakhura has accused aggrieved taxi owners and operators of holding government ransom because they were opposed to the modernisation of public transport. \nHe also alluded to the fact that taxi violence was on the increase in the province, and that Mamelodi had been a hot spot with at least eight incidents reported and three taxi bosses gunned down. \nGovernment had prioritised the fight against taxi violence in the province, he said. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T18:51:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
