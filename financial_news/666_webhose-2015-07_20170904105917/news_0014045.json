We continue to regard Schroders as a core sector holding for the long term.\" \nThe strong performance mirrored that of peers including Jupiter Fund Management, Rathbone Brothers (LSE: RAT.L - news ) and St James's Place, who have this week all reported increases in new business. \nNet flows of cash into Schroders' various funds, which focus heavily on equity and multi-asset, along with fixed income, emerging market debt, commodities and real estate across the globe, hit 8.8 billion pounds, up from 4.8 billion a year earlier and beating consensus estimates for 8.1 billion. \n\"We had positive net flows in institutional, intermediary and high net worth,\" Chief Executive Michael Dobson told Reuters. \"We had 4.8 billion of net new business in fixed income, which was a very strong performance.\" \nTotal (Swiss: FP.SW - news ) assets under management rose 14 percent to 309.9 billion pounds, from 271.5 billion last year. \nWhile net flows had been positive across its different funds, Schroders gave a cautious outlook, based on increased market volatility that would likely depress investor sentiment. \n\"In the short term, with continuing uncertainty in the eurozone and China and the prospect of interest rate rises in the U.S., market volatility is likely to remain high, which may impact retail investor demand in particular,\" the company said in a statement.
