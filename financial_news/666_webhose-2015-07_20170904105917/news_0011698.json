European shares dip but no sign of alarm before Greece summit Reuters - UK Focus â€“ 40 minutes ago \n* FTSEurofirst 300 down 0.6 pct, Euro STOXX 50 down 1.1 pct \n* Unfazed investors putting their faith in ECB - strategist \n* Technip (Paris: FR0000131708 - news ) slumps after restructuring news (Updates prices, adds detail) \nBy Alistair Smout and Liisa Tuhkanen \nLONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Tuesday before a euro zone summit billed as the last chance for Athens to cut a rescue deal, but there was no sign of investor panic two days after Greek voters rejected conditions for a new bailout. \nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 was down 0.6 percent by 1406 GMT, while the euro zone Euro STOXX 50 fell 1.1 percent, adding to Monday's 2.2 percent drop. \nCoutts Global Equity Strategist James Butterfill said investors seemed to be betting on the readiness of the European Central Bank to smooth over any volatility resulting from the Greek crisis. \n\"We're surprised with how little markets have sold off following the referendum, but there seems to be faith in the 'Draghi put', and peripheral markets have decoupled from Greece,\" Butterfill said. \n\"Markets may well tread water until we get some sort of decision from the European summit.\" \nFrance and Germany told Greece on Monday to come up with serious proposals to restart financial aid talks, while the ECB kept a tight grip on funding to Greek banks. \nStrategists at BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) said Sunday's referendum results did not mean Greece had to quit the euro zone, but did increase the chances it will leave to 70 percent. \n\"In light of the referendum, the likelihood of the Greek government acceding to creditors' demands has diminished,\" they said in a note. \nAmong gainers, ProSiebenSat1 added 0.4 percent after sources said talks over a merger with German publishing house Axel Springer had restarted. \nAxel Springer - which called speculation that its majority owner, Friede Springer, might relinquish control \"unfounded\" - rose 3.1 percent. \nEvonik gained 2.5 percent and SAP (Swiss: SAP.SW - news ) edged 0.7 percent higher after UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) lifted its target price for both stocks. Svenska Handelsbanken (Stockholm: SHB-A.ST - news ) rose 3.3 percent, the main gainer on the pan-European index, after a similar upgrade from Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) . \nOn the downside, Technip sank 8.8 percent to its lowest level since January after the oil industry engineering and construction group announced a restructuring programme, booking a 650 million-euro ($719 million) charge and cutting 6,000 jobs. \nRolls-Royce dropped 6.2 percent, following a 6.3 percent loss on Monday, as brokers downgraded the stock after a third profit warning in nine months. \nEurope bourses in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/pap87v \nAsset performance in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/gap87v \nToday's European research round-up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T17:54:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
