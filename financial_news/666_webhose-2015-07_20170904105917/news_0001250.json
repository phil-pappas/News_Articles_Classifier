Share on twitter by Philip Baker One of the of the golden rules of investing used to say that there are just two things that matter: the dividend rate and when it's payable.\nThat rule still rings true, as investors chase any sort of income with interest rates so low. But recently people seem to have forgotten another old investment chestnut – the need to diversify.\nIn contrast to what the text books and history preach, the past few years have been good ones for all investors. There has been no need to diversify because shares, bonds and property have all been great little earners.\nAs Damien Wood from Spectrum Asset Management points out, as far as \"spreading the risk\" is concerned a quick look at returns over the past couple of years has \"turned this theory on its head\".\nThe reason?\nRecord low bond yields.\n\"The shift to a low-bond-yield environment has helped values in many asset classes rise in unison. The risk is the reverse may apply – that is, asset classes could fall at the same time should bond yields rise,\" Wood says.\nNegative correlation Bonds have typically been a hedge against shares in the portfolio. When shares produce losses as the economy weakens and the outlook for profits deteriorates, it has been good to have some bonds on board. Shares and bonds were meant to have a negative correlation.\nThe accompanying graphic shows that for the years between 2004 and 2012, this textbook relationship held true.\nBut in the past few years there has been a positive correlation between all the asset classes, as the other graph shows.\n\"In a perfect world, investments are positively correlated when they are going up in price and are negatively correlated when some assets are falling in value. The first part of this wishful equation has broadly worked since 2013. Asset prices have generally risen together. The risk for investors is this relationship continues in a price decline environment,\" Wood says.\nThe scenario starts to unwind and creates a headache when global bond yields start to head higher.\nThat means losses for bond investors if they are in fixed-rate bonds and problems for sharemarket investors if the \"yield climb is not accompanied with a compensating upswing in earnings expectations\", Wood says.\nBuying floating-rate corporate debt is one way to avoid a sell-off in fixed-rate bonds.\nPressure on yields It will take only an upward flip in long-term bond yields and last week's warning from the Federal Reserve that rates are on the way up will put pressure on yields.\nIt comes as QIC is also warning investors about a spike in bond yields.\nSusan Buckley, head of the QIC global liquid strategies team, says bond investors should get ready for a rise in the \"term premium\".\nThe \"term premium\" is the additional reward or yield investors should get for holding long-term debt such as a bond that matures in 10 years or more.\nThe trouble is, over the past few years investors haven't been rewarded at all. Indeed, at times it has been negative, thanks to all the work central banks have done through quantitative easing programs.\n\"In essence this means there's been no excess compensation for investors holding long-term debt. But we have identified a range of global factors that signal a return to higher levels – and believe investors should be acting upon this return sooner rather than later,\" Buckley says.\nThe drivers that will change the current set-up include higher rates in the US, the possibility of inflation emerging and investors wanting to be compensated more for the risks they are taking when buying long bonds because of the lack of liquidity brought on by more regulation in the finance sector.\nSince the middle of April the yield on the major 10-year government bonds has risen to about 2.92 per cent from 2.28 per cent.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-07-20T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T22:49:17.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
