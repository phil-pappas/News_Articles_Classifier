Although equities have been impacted worldwide by the floundering Chinese stock markets, Royal Caribbean has escaped such woes. Instead, it attributed its improved profit outlook to the fast-growing Chinese market. \nChina's stock market crash: five numbers you need to know \nThe company said more than 95pc of its cruises in China were booked for the year. While Carnival forecast disappointing earnings for the third quarter, in late June analysts at Deutsche bank upgraded the stock owing the move to growth in the Chinese market also. \nEarlier this year, Carnival declared its intentions to carry half of the expectated one million Chinese cruise passengers this year. The positive outlook had a knock-on effect industry-wide lifting Carnival in afternoon trade by 176p, or 5.2pc, to £35.52. \nIn the wider market, the FTSE 100 ended the month in positive territory, advancing 27.41 points to 6,696.28. \nRolls-Royce motored to the top of Britain’s benchmark index, rising 5.9pc to 794p, after activist investor ValueAct took a 5.44pc stake . Ahead of that news emerging late in the day, brokers had however cut the stock’s target price, with RBC Capital Markets among those to lower it to 760p. \nRobert Stallard, of RBC, said “we don’t see a lot of earnings per share growth potential over the next couple of years”. However, he noted new management may help but for now, he reckons investors will remain underwhelmed by the stock’s performance. \nITV made gains -up 9.1p to 280.7p - after Liberty Global upped its stake in the television broadcaster to 9.9pc . Analysts at Liberum noted Liberty’s move suggests it thinks a move by another player is likely. \nMeanwhile, Thomas Cook tumbled to the bottom of the mid-cap index - down 6p, or 4.8pc, to 119.9p - after two brokers slashed the stock’s price target. The travel operator warned on Thursday profits would be bruised by about £64m due to the recent attack in Tunisia, concerns about the Greek economy, and foreign currency headwinds. Geopolitical concerns have weighed heavily on the share price this year and as a result, Nomura lowered its target price to 123p from 135p, while Natixis cut it to 145p. \nAntofagasta slipped 2.3pc to 567p as it revealed it will buy 50pc of a copper mine, Zaldivar, in Chile from Barrick Gold for more than $1bn. The miner was also targeted by Goldman Sachs, who cut its target price to 490p from 500p believing Anto’s internal view of the copper price is more optimistic than that of the market. \nFinally, shares in I nterContinental Hotels Group slumped 45p, or 1.6pc, to £26.98.
