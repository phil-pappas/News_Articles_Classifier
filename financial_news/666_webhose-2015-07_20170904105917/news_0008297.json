And there are no foreseeable plans to revisit that worldview or produce a workable principle. \nWith the cedi in the state it is today, there is no better time to explain the \"seek ye first\" worldview and the dichotomy presented between those who believe or oppose this view - and to couple that with the government's recent dare to pump more dollars into the economy so as to stabilize or stop the cedi's downward spiral. \nAccording to much-reported news, the Bank of Ghana (BOG) has \"hinted of moves to inject $20 million daily into the money market to stabilize the cedi.\" Whether BOG has enough reserve on long-term basis to pull off this trick is not the point. The problem is whether this approach is the right mindset for a developing economy. \nPumping $20 mill daily into the economy is not a creative or productive act. It only means adding to the purchasing power of traders and importers - a free flow of funds to purchase more goods from abroad will be the result. \nThe irony is it is exactly this indiscriminate importation of goods with our hard reserves that has gotten us here, exacerbated the woes of our economy and pushing the rapid sinking of the cedi. \nPurchasing more of the same products that we should produce ourselves; toothpicks, cane chairs, ineffectual electrical appliances, factory rejects and used items from abroad is not going to help stabilize the cedi. \nWorse, very little of the BOG jolt, the $20 mil dollar stimulant, can be guaranteed to trickle down to local manufacturers. Any result from this initiative will be temporary but soon the downward trend of the cedi against the dollar will continue to accelerate. \nBut we brought this misery unto ourselves because of what we have failed to understand about our development efforts and their requirements. Again, economies do not operate in vacuum. Because they take places in political incubators, they require guiding principles - a worldview . Watch China, Korea, India and even capitalist America. \nThere have been ideas that could have liberated us and the \"Seek ye first\" philosophy was one. \nWith this principle, the intention was to seize and exercise political sovereignty so as to spark economic enterprises and initiatives from within the nation. Not a bad idea, if you should ask me. Some who understood it called it the \"Domestication\" policy. Those who didn't thought it was a policy that put little emphasis on direct economic growth, whatever that was. \nUnder the \"seek ye first\" philosophy, import substitution industrialization projects happened. Importation of things you could manufacture inside was not allowed and light industries were set up by the state to do just that. \nNaturally, the policy caused some pain in the 60s. People started hoarding things, all of which acts could have passed in time. But the shortages added to the excuses for the 1966 coup. The cry went up that we had run out of essential commodities like sardines and milk. \nAnd the policy was roundly criticized and its worldview thwarted. As Pogo, our local drunk, said, \"to enjoy getting mugged drunk you need not worry about the shirt on your back.\" \nSo here we are, now stripped naked of almost all our ingenuities and left to import toothpicks; plaster boards, motorized tricycle trucks and humongous amount of useless, easy to manufacture finished goods from abroad. The light industries that could have put the brakes on these imports were almost long gone. \nConsequently, our hard currency reserves were exposed and continue to be so. Others now profit from our negligence. Truth be told, we are financing and supporting labor in places like China while our local streets are full of the unemployed or underemployed. \nAnd as the drunk had implied, we have gotten to the stage where we have accepted continuous poverty, cup in hand with no shirts on our backs and foreign support for our national budgets. Promoting your own manufacturing base is a simple policy that must be easily understood. But our policy planners don't. They don't have that worldview yet. \nIt was a worldview under President Kufuor that accepted the fact that we were broke, that in order to develop we needed to come out clean from debt. This view brought relief from HIPC and that also brought us the awareness that it didn't pay to acquire debt that we couldn't recompense. \nThat knowledge bought us a needed respite for take-off, an opportunity that has currently been squandered. \nSo hard currency from our reserves continues to flow outward and there is no known worldview from our political thinkers to capture some of the wealth back as countries like South Korea did in the 70s. \nInstead, we are now ready to up the ante with the $20 mil daily influx of dollars we don't have as we brace our national harbors for more importation of manufactured goods from abroad.. \nMore misery will follow. \nIt seems to me that the fault is not the economy. It is the philosophy, stupid. If your worldview is wrong, your economic policy will be wrong too.
