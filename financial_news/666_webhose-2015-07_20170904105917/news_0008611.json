IG market strategist Evan Lucas said the company was on track for its best full year result in years, after posting multi-billion dollar full year losses of $2.2 billion in 2013/14 and $5.8 billion in 2012/13. \"On the numbers they've shown, they've obviously done relatively well,\" Mr Lucas said. \"There's no doubt Newcrest has seen a bit of a turnaround after three years of horrible numbers and horrible situations.\" The group received an average price of $1,532 an ounce during the June quarter, up from $1408 an ounce during the 2014 financial year, a result driven by the sliding Australian dollar. The company lifted production one per cent to 2.42 million ounces of gold during the year. \"All of that has moved in their favour,\" said Mr Lucas. \"Their cost differential is heading in the right direction, and the fact they do all their costs in the Aussie dollar but price in US dollars has been a tailwind positive, as the sliding Aussie dollar improves their situation.\" \"The 2015 financial year should be building up to be a relatively good number.\" A fall in global gold prices, which dropped from $US1,325 an ounce to $1,175 during the year, with further falls expected, remains one of the biggest concerns for the company, Mr Lucas said. \"I don't think gold is currently a place investors want to be targeting considering the current market conditions in the underlying commodity.\" The death of two workers at its mines since May this year - one at Telfer in Western Australia and another at Hidden Valley in Papua New Guinea - has also put the company under scrutiny. At 1321 AEST on Thursday, Newcrest Mining shares were trading 33 cents higher, or 2.86 per cent, to $11.86.
