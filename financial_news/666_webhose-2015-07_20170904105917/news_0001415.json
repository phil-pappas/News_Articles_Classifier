The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index closed up 2.2%, Germany's DAX rose 2.3% and France's CAC finished 2.5% higher. \nGreece's s ASE Composite remained shut, and according to a statement from the Hellenic Capital Market Commission released early on Thursday, the stock market will stay closed for the rest of the week and on Monday, after the finance ministry decided to extend the current bank holiday and capital controls to Monday. \nGains in the periphery were even more pronounced, with Italy's FTSE Mib up 3.5% and Spain's IBEX 35 up 2.8%. \nHopes of a Greek debt deal grew after Athens made a formal request on Wednesday for a new three-year bailout from the European Stability Mechanism. Greece must present new proposals to its Eurozone creditors by the end of Thursday and will need to reach an agreement with them by Sunday. The main sticking points are expected to relate to pension cuts and tax increases. \nDeutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) said that although the odds of a 'Grexit' have risen materially since the overwhelming 'no' vote in the referendum, it continues to see Greece staying in the euro as marginally more likely. \nIt said an agreement between Greece and its Eurozone creditors will likely include tougher terms than those rejected at the referendum, given the deterioration of the Greek economy and the longer time period to be financed under a third programme. \nIt said that any sustainable solution to keep Greece in the Eurozone will require debt relief. \"An outright debt haircut will be politically impossible. However, a conditional debt restructuring (along the lines advocated by the International Monetary Fund) should be slightly more acceptable and would have an equivalent economic impact.\" Market participants said that sentiment was being supported by hopes that the European Central Bank would step in with supportive measures if needed. \nMeanwhile, a strong rebound in Chinese markets and higher metals prices, with the exception of gold, also helped to underpin the tone in Europe, boosting basic-resource stocks, which are highly dependent on demand from China. \nThe Stoxx Europe 600 index for basic resources rose 1.9%. \nDespite the upbeat tone, some market analysts remained sceptical over Greece. \n\"With rhetoric having hardened on both sides, it seems unlikely that a solution exists that will appease all involved,\" said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) . \"Yet with three days left, it's the possibility of an orderly resolution being found which is keeping markets calm right now. Today represents the deadline for a new proposal to be submitted to the creditors, which would form the basis of any possible deal on Sunday. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) if the Greeks do remember to bring it with them this time, the likelihood that it will be enough of a compromise seems decidedly low given the months of fruitless negotiations so far.\" In individual stocks, Italy's Saipem (Other OTC: SAPMY - news ) slumped after the company lost its $2.2bn contract to lay a Russian natural gas pipeline under the Black Sea. \nIn London, Barratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) was on the front foot after the housebuilder said it expects to see a 45% increase in full-year pre-tax profit. \nOnling gaming and betting group Bwin.Party rose after confirming that it has received an improved takeover offer from smaller rival GVC Holdings (Other OTC: GMVHF - news ) priced at 11p per share in new shares and cash that would value it at roughly £900m. \nOn the downside, Balfour Beatty (Other OTC: BAFBF - news ) slumped after it issued another profit warning, saying pre-tax profit was likely to between £120m and £150m lower.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T06:08:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
