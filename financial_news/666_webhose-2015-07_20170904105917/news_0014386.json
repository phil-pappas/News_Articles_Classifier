It has also become something of an embarrassment for the US which announced early on that it would not be joining only to discover that many of its allies had no such qualms. \nAustralia was the first country to sign the agreement at a ceremony in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People. The other 49 countries that signed up — seven others are still waiting for approval from their domestic legislatures — included Germany the UK and South Korea. \nChina has said the bank which will be based in Beijing and is expected to start work by the end of this year will play a major role in speeding up development in a region where some 8 trillion in investment is expected to be required in the next five years alone. It is seen as providing an alternative to US-dominated institutions such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank which some in Asia consider slow to respond to the needs of the region — and as imposing too many conditions on development. \nAIIB which is currently led by Jin Liqun a former deputy finance minister and a former vice-president of the Asian Development Bank will have a capital of 50 billion due to rise to 100 billion. China will contribute almost 30 billion making it the largest shareholder Xinhua news agency reported. \nChina’s voting share in the bank’s decision-making process will be just over 26 per cent — more than the quarter of votes needed to veto projects — followed by India and Russia with 7.5 per cent and just under six per cent respectively. Reuters said Germany would be the fourth biggest shareholder with a four per cent stake. \nNon-Asian countries will be allowed to hold a maximum 30 per cent stake in the Beijing-based bank Xinhua reported and China’s Finance Minister Lou Jiwei who presided over the signing ceremony said recently that developing countries in Asia would make up the majority of its members and enjoy “a bigger voice at the table.” However China has been keen to reassure other nations that in the longer term it “does not seek a veto power in the bank” and expects to lose its current dominance in future as more countries join — in contrast with the World Bank in which the US holds a limited veto power. \n“The AIIB will adopt international good practices and embrace high standards striving to build a professional efficient and clean platform for infrastructure investment” Lou wrote last week. \nOne Western diplomat in Beijing said the US “only has itself to blame” for the establishment of the new institution after blocking reforms of the IMF and World Bank to “take into account China’s role as the world’s second-largest economy” Reuters reported. \nAnd analysts say China’s success in persuading so many major countries to join the bank represented a significant step forward in Beijing’s attempts to present itself as a responsible and constructive member of the international community. \nCountries which have not joined including Japan as well as the US have raised concerns about management of the institution: These range from its requirements on environmental standards — the US has previously differed with the Asian Development Bank over projects including coal-fired power plants and dam construction — to ongoing concerns about corruption in China a nation whose Audit Bureau announced on Sunday for example that 13 out of 14 major state-owned enterprises inspected recently had been found to have “violated rules of procurement and bidding.” \n— (c) Newsweek.
