The vaccine is cheap; two doses cost 3.7 US dollars, around a third of the price of the other licensed vaccine Dukoral.\nShe added that the key to control cholera was clean water and adequate sanitation, which half the developing world lack, but this remained a rather difficult reality for the worldâ€™s poorest nations as well as those affected by climate change, war and natural disasters.\nAccording to World Health Organisation, in India 676 651 cases were reported from 2000 to 2004 and there was a 24 per cent increase in the number of cases during these years.\nThe study is published in The Lancet.\n 09, 2015 12:05 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T01:29:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
