Photo: Louie Douvis\nThe deteriorating health of the Canadian economy provides valuable insight into what Australia's economy will look like soon enough, including a plunging Australian dollar, as similar cyclical forces weigh down on both countries, challenging policymakers.\nAtul Lele, chief investment officer at private bank Deltec, sees global growth booming but not for commodity-focused economies like Australia's .\nLast week, the Bank of Canada cut interest rates to 0.5 per cent in what was only a 50-50 decision and the second cut in 2015, prompted by fresh declines in the oil price and a difficult transition to non-energy-led growth. The central bank denied it was witnessing a recession.\n\"Canada is a fantastic six-month preview of what's going to happen to Australia,\" Mr Lele, an Australian who is based in the Bahamas, said. \"The Australian dollar, it's going below US70¢ in the next six months quite easily. More importantly, it's not bouncing back any time soon. I can easily see a scenario where it goes into the US50s.\nAdvertisement \"It's not that bold a call to say it's going down.\"\nThe currency staged a sharp decline last week amid the rout in commodity currencies, led by the decision in Canada and an unexpected plunge in New Zealand's dairy auction. It last traded at US73.68¢.\n\"I think clearly monetary easing needs to take place. Fiscal easing needs to take place as well – not enough has been done on the fiscal side,\" Mr Lele said.\nSame dynamics \"Australia in some sense is like an emerging market. It's exposed to some of the same dynamics of commodities and fiscal policymakers have not undertaken enough structural reform … it almost has the same problem that emerging markets are facing now.\"\nToday's policymakers were hindered by the absence of action during the boom years, he said.\n\"There's an inevitability around what's about to happen. The Australian economy's going to have to go into recession.\"\nDeltec's third-quarter outlook extends on its long-held view that commodities will struggle, except in agriculture.\nMore optimistically, United States-led growth sets up attractive opportunities in foreign exchange markets, where the greenback should resume its rally, and in the developed equity markets of the US, Japan and Europe.\n\"Developed markets will lead a global growth rebound, aided by lower oil prices, as emerging markets continue to contend with declining US [dollar] liquidity growth and still unresolved structural issues,\" Deltec's latest update to clients advises.\nThe wealth manager also believes risks are rising as liquidity growth slows. That will have huge ramifications for many asset classes, and partly explains its negative view on commodities.\nUnder pressure \"Liquidity and interest rate-sensitive assets are going to be under a lot of pressure,\" Mr Lele said.\n\"All our indicators in US dollar liquidity point to it being in decline. I don't think people fully appreciate this. US dollar liquidity is really starting to move out now.\"\nThe significance of this was that US dollar liquidity was what had funded markets, he said.\n\"The carry trade into commodities is funded by US dollars. Commodities are more sensitive to emerging markets growth and emerging markets are funded by capital inflows moving in. Emerging market growth will slow and that's going to negatively impact commodities.\"\nThe other factor that would challenge commodity prices was that they tended to fall when the US dollar rallied, he said.\nHe urged investors to seek out growth-sensitive assets and avoid liquidity-sensitive exposures.\nWithin US equities, he favours home builders, consumer discretionary stocks, industrials, capital markets and technology plays. Equally, he is cool towards utilities and property trusts – which have attractive yields but are sensitive to rising interest rates – and commodities.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/news/economy/trade/commodities-crash-could-turn-australia-into-a-new-greece-20150719-gifyxh"], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T12:23:12.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
