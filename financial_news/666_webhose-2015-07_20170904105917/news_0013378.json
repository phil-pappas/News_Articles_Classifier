Ryan Stuart Share on twitter by Amanda Saunders China has been rejecting Australian coal cargos that don't pass new import quality restrictions, and the local industry is concerned that the testing is being misused to favour China's struggling coal industry.\nMinerals Council of Australia coal boss Greg Evans has called for the regime to be suspended to give officials from both countries a chance to \"assess the situation\".\nQueensland Resources Council chief executive Michael Roche said some Australian shipments had been redirected following testing he said was inconsistent and did not appear to comply with global standards. China is the world's largest coal market.\n\"Some Australian cargos have been affected … you just need some to create that extra degree of uncertainty,\" Mr Roche said. \"They [the cargos] are redirected to another customer.\"\nMr Evans said the testing protocols were \"not universally applied in a consistent and transparent manner, leading to added costs and uncertainty in the trade\".\n\"We would be concerned if the quality criteria was not applied to Chinese domestic coal in order to help local producers, as this would breach trade rules,\" he said. \"To the extent the trade is disrupted, this redirects coal to other markets, which is not desirable.\"\nThe MCA was working with the federal government to \"understand the rationale for the restrictions and achieve a smoother process for testing, for example whether this compliance aspect can take place in Australia before shipment\".\n\"However, in the interim it would be highly desirable to see a suspension of these arrangements so officials from both countries have an opportunity to assess the situation.\"\n 'Not a level playing field' Mr Roche said tariffs and quality protection in China \"are masquerading as environmental measures\".\n\"There is great concern about the way China is applying the quality testing regime. It seems to vary from port to port; the uncertainties around it are quite large. It is not a level playing field market in China at the moment, and there seem to be a lot of measures being taken to protect inefficient domestic producers in China.\"\nMr Roche said the testing regimes \"do not seem to be globally accredited testing techniques\".\nIn January this year, China introduced new bans covering imports of coal with more than 16 per cent ash and 3 per cent sulphur to two of China's most polluted regions – the Yangtze River Delta, near Shanghai, and the Pearl River Delta, near Hong Kong. The restrictions already apply in the Beijing-Tianjin region.\nImproving air quality is part of the rationale for the change, but some Australian miners suspect the overarching rationale is to help prop up China's struggling domestic coal industry.\nAustralian coal has been tested for elements outside of the sulphur and ash content thresholds announced and some producers have been threatened with penalties, The Australian Financial Review understands. Penalties applied to shipments could become de-facto tariff charges, the MCA has said.\nThe industry at first thought the issues could be teething problems, first flagged by the Financial Review in January, but they have persisted.\nQuality a key differentiator A spokesman for Trade Minister Andrew Robb said the minister was aware of concerns raised by the coal industry \"regarding the potential trade impacts of China's new coal quality standards\".\n\"The government is doing everything reasonable to resolve these concerns, and will work together with China to ensure Australia remains a reliable supplier of high-quality coal,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe regime is creating more uncertainty in an industry battling a prolonged period of depressed prices and increasingly sophisticated attacks from the fossil fuel divestment campaign. Thermal coal has crashed to about $US59 a tonne from more than $US130 a tonne in mid-2011.\nHigher-quality coals were coming into favour in China, but \"it is not an easy market to read at the moment\", Mr Roche said.\nAustralian coal is generally of higher quality than its main export competitors – Indonesia and South Africa – and most domestic Chinese producers.\nQuality is a key differentiator for Australia with Indonesia – the world's largest exporter of thermal coal – given it can't compete on costs. The industry had predicted that if new Chinese quality control was going to hit anyone, it would be the Indonesians, which would work in Australia's favour.\nSome Indonesian shipments have been held back, and orders from China turned down, to avoid falling foul of the new guidelines on poorer-quality coal when it arrives in China.\nAustralia exports about 50 million tonnes of thermal coal to China each year, which is about a quarter of the 200 million tonnes of thermal coal it ships annually. When China unveiled its new quality thresholds, Australia's Bureau of Resource Economics said they could affect up to 25 million tonnes of coal sold each year.\nThe level of ash can be reduced through washing or blending the coal, but it could cost up to an additional $US4 a tonne at a time when the industry is immersed in a sea of red ink.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mandaksaunders"], "published": "2015-07-01T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T05:40:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
