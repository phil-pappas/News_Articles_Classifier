In other news: the retail sales report shows weakness in consumer demand, cutting back second-quarter GDP estimates; Fed Chair Janet Yellen warns that additional Congressional oversight of the Fed would be harmful to the economy; and the Iran nuclear deal hits a roadblock. \nThe Dow and S&P 500 this mid-week rose 1.63 percent and 1.48 percent respectively after two events: Greece capitulates and agrees to the austerity program of its creditors; and China's stock market rebounds . \nGreece's parliament has passed the austerity measures that includes steep spending cuts and tax increases to secure bailout funds. The move has caused riots in the streets and a rebellion within the ruling Syriza party. It is expected that the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will announce a cabinet shake-up to counter the rebellion. \nThe Chinese stock market has pulled out of its three-week tailspin when it rallied last week lifting Shanghai's composite index 4.5 percent reducing the losses by 25 percent. A number of measures were taken by the Chinese government to stem the decline, but the most stringent was banning the sale of shares for six months by stockholders with large positions in listed firms. \nWeak retail sales , together with a softening labor market, indicates that the economy is slowing as households cut back on purchasing autos and other goods. A slowing economy will likely delay a rate hike till December, if not later. Retail sales declined -0.3 percent last month (+0.2 percent expected), the lowest reading since February. Macroeconomic Advisors dropped its forecasted GDP for this quarter to 2.6 percent. \nFed Chair Janet Yellen warns Congress against increasing oversight of the Federal Reserve. Such action says Yellen will cause collateral damage to the broader economy. The Republican Congress wants to limit the autonomy of the central bank, especially its ability to set monetary policy and regulate the financial industry. Given how poorly Congress has handled fiscal policy in the past (closing government for political purposes), Yellen's concerns are well founded. \nAn Iran nuclear deal still has hurdles to overcome . A major dispute regarding the ban on Iran's ability to purchase missile technology and conventional weapons remains to be settled. Under current consideration is an eight-year ban on missile technology and a five-year ban on conventional weapons. President Obama has said that the alternative to a deal would be a steady slide toward war (within a year or two). The goal of the deal is to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and buy time to restructure the relationship; everything else is secondary. \nIf you're trading options, it is suggested trading Put Credit spreads for the remainder of this week at 1.50 standard deviations or greater. Expect the price of the SPX to fall within 2068 and 2148 (2 standard deviations) by this Friday. \nFor more information about options, see the 'Suggested Links' below.
