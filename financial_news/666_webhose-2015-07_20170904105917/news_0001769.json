Indeed, he said he was pretty relaxed with some tinkering of negative gearing as long as it wasn't done in isolation from a broader group of measures around tax.\nIn other words, if tax payments were incentivised in some other way to compensate, then it would probably come under the heading of swings and roundabouts.\nIn this regard, he is singing from the same song sheet as many of the other experts including the Business Council of Australia and the RBA – all of which are looking for some clearly needed taxation reform. Among those that are in need of consideration are the GST, company tax rates and capital gains (especially as it applies to investment in residential property).\nSlater says the government shouldn't just abandon negative gearing without understanding the potential unintended consequences. For example, if the growth in lending to investment in housing dries up, it will have a flow-on effect to the construction industry and employment.\nHaving said that, he doesn't blame the property boom (he doesn't call it a bubble) solely on negative gearing.\nHe says it's about supply and demand – and clearly negative gearing stokes demand. But he reckons record-low interest rates are the major reason. Few would disagree with that.\nBut on the demand side, the increase in foreign buyers is something the banks are particularly aware of.\nIn April, NAB noted that foreign buyers were increasingly active in new-housing markets, comprising 15.6 per cent of all sales. In NSW, foreign buyers number 21 per cent of sales, and 20.7 per cent in Victoria.\nAbout 53 per cent of foreign purchases are apartments, 30 per cent houses and 17 per redevelopments.\nThus, a major part of the cocktail that contributes to the housing bubble is demand from overseas.\nMeanwhile, the RBA is concerned it is the taxation treatment of investment properties that promotes speculation. Not just negative gearing but as much, if not more, about the generous capital gains tax treatment.\nBut NAB believes the discounts that apply to capital gains derived by individuals and trusts should be retained, according to its submission to the tax discussion paper.\nSlater is happy enough to concede that we have a housing affordability problem, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne suburbs that are relatively close to the central city with good access to public transport and schools. But, unsurprisingly, he won't call the market a bubble because this implies it will burst and that is not how the banks are willing to call it.\nSuch an outcome would come about only if there were a precipitous rise in interest rates or unemployment, according to the bank's internal stress testing.\nThanks to a series of interest-rate cuts in the past couple of years, 63 per cent of NAB's mortgage borrowers are a month or more ahead in interest-rate payments.\nBut the banking regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, has made it clear that within the next couple of weeks it will move to beef up the risk weightings around lending – how and by how much remains to be seen.\nThe need to increase capital (for all banks) comes at a cost to the lender and one that most assume will be passed on to borrowers via higher interest rates.\nIn theory, this could curtail some demand for mortgage borrowing but given interest rates are now at historic lows, it might not have a big impact. Much will also depend on whether APRA requires the changes to apply to banks' backbooks (existing loans) or just new loans.\nFor banks, there is a lot riding on the outcome of the tax debate about residential investments and even more riding on how much capital they will need to hold in order to lend for housing.\nDespite recent surveys that proclaim business confidence is improving, the reality is that lending to business remains soft and is showing no meaningful signs of recovering.\nMortgage lending and construction are the two bright spots in the Australian economy that have been driving the earnings for banks. They are getting caught in a pincer between higher capital requirements and potential residential tax disincentives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T12:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:45:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
