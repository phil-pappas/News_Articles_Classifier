One involves the diversity of the three races. While the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes are run on slightly longer-than-average tracks, the Belmont is a mile-and-a-half long, a stamina-testing distance rarely used in American racing today. The composition of the track surfaces also varies quite a bit–the Belmont track is known as “Big Sandy” because of its softer texture, while the Preakness’ track long had a reputation for being hard and fast. When a horse can pass the test on all of these diverse tracks, it is truly a special performer.\nThe story is similar when it comes to stocks. I pick equities using my Guru Strategies, which are based on the published approaches of Warren Buffett , Benjamin Graham and other investing greats. Each of these models uses a unique set of rigorous financial and valuation tests. Getting approval from one of them is hard enough; if a stock can excel on two different strategies, that’s really impressive.\nThen there are the rare occasions when a stock gets approval from three strategies–that’s when I get really excited. These “Guru Triple Crown” winners must excel when looked at from a myriad of different angles. Typically, they will have to meet dozens of criteria to ensure that they are producing solid growth, keeping debt to a minimum and trading at attractive valuations.\nVery few stocks past three of my strategies at a given time–and they often aren’t companies you would expect. Ultra-popular stocks like Twitter Twitter or Facebook don’t make the grade–their sky-high valuations won’t hack it. Sometimes, Guru Triple Crown winners are unloved contrarian picks that are the subject of overhyped fears; often they are lesser-known firms that are flying under the radar.\nFirst Out Of The Gate …\nPage 1 / 2 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/477064622/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://espn.go.com/horse-racing/story/_/id/13025872/american-pharoah-wins-belmont-stakes-claims-triple-crown"], "published": "2015-07-20T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T18:21:21.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
