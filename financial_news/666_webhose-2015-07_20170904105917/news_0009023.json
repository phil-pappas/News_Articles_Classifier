Written by: Eric Reed 07/27/15 - 3:53 PM EDT NEW YORK ( MainStreet ) -- Is America still the land of opportunity? An increasing number of people think the answer to that question might be no… and they're ready to pack up and go. \nAccording to data gathered by TransferWise , a global money transfer company, about a third of Americans say they would leave the U.S. to seek economic opportunity abroad . This snappily named “Anchor Index” found that the issue breaks down along unsurprising demographic lines. Most Millennials said that they would be perfectly happy to leave in search of “a better quality of life” elsewhere. \nIt’s surprising, especially for a nation that has prided itself as the destination for immigrants across the world. From calling for “your tired, your poor, your huddled masses” to today’s debate about walling off Mexico, Americans have always been sure of one thing: everyone wants to get here. Now, it seems, quite a few of us are ready to leave. By the numbers: 35% of Americans would consider leaving to live elsewhere 55% of Millennials would do so 14% would be willing to drop everything and go in the next five years 58% of Americans say that they’re mainly staying just for family or romantic ties \nFor some people, the lure is about finding new places and having new experiences. Indeed, an entire cottage industry of travel blogs exists around this very idea of whistling around the world on a wing and a prayer. Young people in particular are drawn to this, in what Joe Cross, general manager for TransferWise USA, called “a very Millennial mindset.” More Headlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T22:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T23:56:47.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
