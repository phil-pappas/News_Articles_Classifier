The mobile payment service from PayByPhone, the global industry leader in parking payments, is now available in all spaces across the city. Drivers can pay for their parking in the most stress-free way possible – via the PayByPhone app on their smartphones. No longer do they have to scramble to find the right amount of cash to park, with just a few quick taps of the app, it’s all done so they can get on with their day faster. \nThe deployment of PayByPhone across Geneva follows a successful year and a half pilot trial that saw the technology used in 500 spaces across the city. After great feedback from drivers, Fondation des Parkings , the company which handles the parking across Geneva, rolled out the technology city-wide as of June 2015. \nWith PayByPhone, drivers can use the location number on the relevant machine as a reference point to pay for their parking via the PayByPhone iPhone or Android app, or with the internet. With the convenience of mobile payments made available for drivers, the city is hoping to encourage more people to park in the city, which helps support local businesses. \nGeneva is the first city in Switzerland deploying mobile innovation in a traditional cash industry, and the latest in a long line of global cities to use the PayByPhone service. The city follows in the footsteps of others such as London, Boston, San Francisco, Vancouver and Paris to offer seamless, stress-free mobile parking. Currently, PayByPhone has 10 million app users worldwide and offers an array of services to virtualize the parking experience. All with the aim of leveraging innovation to continuously improve urban mobility for cities and city dwellers. \nEarlier this year, PayByPhone was announced as one of only 44 developers to officially launch with the Apple Watch. The watch enabled app effectively personalises time through parking, as users can use the glance feature to check the time remaining on their parking session. \nKush Parikh, President, PayByPhone Global, said: “Geneva is following in the footsteps of some of the world’s biggest cities by offering stress-free, cashless parking for drivers. It’s another big milestone for PayByPhone as we look to globally connect even more cities by helping them efficiently manage their parking assets.” \nAntoine de Raemy, President at Fondation des Parkings, which runs the parking for Geneva said, “ We want to encourage more drivers to park within our city and think PayByPhone is a great way to do that. From the pilot, we saw how much mobile parking payments can reduce hassle for drivers. Thanks to PayByPhone, we’re hoping to see more people have the confidence to drive in our city, safe in the knowledge that their parking is taken care of.” \nABOUT PAYBYPHONE \nPayByPhone is part of PayPoint plc, an international leader in payment technologies.
