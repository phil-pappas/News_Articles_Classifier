Treasury shares are useless in voting as companies cannot vote for themselves. \nThe court has not yet reached a decision on that issue, but said it would rule before July 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T19:25:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
