(“AMB”) ( HOPS ) is proud to announce that it brought home three coveted medals, including one gold, from the 2015 U.S. Open Beer Championship, held earlier this month in Ohio. This year, breweries from 13 countries competed, and nearly 4,000 beers and ciders were entered across 90 different categories.

Additionally, AMB received a silver medal in the “Anything Goes” Specialty Cider category for its Cinful Plum Cider. The Boone, NC, brewery also earned special recognition by the cider judges for its creativity and imagination. \n“We’re incredibly proud to bring three more medals back home to Boone,” said AMB Brewmaster Nathan Kelischek. “We’re deeply grateful to the local High Country community for helping us get to where we are today, and creating great-tasting brews that continue to win awards is just one way we get to show our appreciation for their amazing support.” \nAbout the Award-Winning Beers \nAn ode to the American Blonde, AMB’s light-bodied Blonde Ale is a beer for all seasons, brewed with orange zest to add additional citrus notes to complement the light hop aroma. The clean and crisp mouthfeel is followed by a hint of sweetness from local North Carolina wildflower honey. ABV: 4.9%, IBUs: 19. \nLike Daniel Boone, AMB’s flagship Porter is a legend in the High Country, overflowing with dark aromas and a creamy, persistent, tan head. A perfect balance between traditional English hops and the complex malt flavors, with a smooth balance between chocolate and coffee. ABV: 6%, IBUs: 23. \nAbout the Award-Winning Cider \nWhen you first set eyes on the Cinful Plum, you’ll notice its rosé, plum-blush hue followed by the alluring aroma of cinnamon. Dive into this semi-dry cider, and you’ll enjoy a delicate blend of fruity plum and apple notes with a warm caress of cinnamon in the finish. \nAbout the 2015 U.S. Open Beer Championship \nBreweries from China to the Czech Republic sent in close to 4,000 beers and ciders representing 90 different styles for the 2015 U.S. Open Beer Championship.
