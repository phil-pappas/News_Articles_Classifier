Under new delivery agreements, the air carrier will defer delivery of four 787s to 2017 from 2016 and one 787 to 2018 from 2016. The company is also deferring 10 A320neos from 2017, and 25 A320neos from 2018, to 2021 through 2023. For 2015, American said it expects to take delivery on 75 mainline aircraft, while retiring 104. The company said it has also reclassified 13 aircraft from being temporarily retired to permanently retired. Separately, American said its third- and fourth-quarter outlooks for cost per available seat mile have increased because of lower capacity, the push-back of expenses from the second quarter and increased investment in operations. At the same time, the company said its outlook for cargo revenue has declined given lower yields on international flights.
