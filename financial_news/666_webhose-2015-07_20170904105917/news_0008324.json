Just how tragic her short life really was may not be known for some time. But the details that have recently emerged are nothing short of heart-wrenching, if the allegations of a lawsuit recently filed on behalf of Bobbi Kristina prove to be true.\nAccording to that lawsuit, the multi-million dollar trust fund created through Whitney Houston’s will was at the heart of this tragedy.\nPhoto by: Germana/STAR MAX/IPx 8/16/12 Bobbi Kristina Brown and Nick Gordon at the premiere of “Sparkle”. (Los Angeles, CA)\nIt was on January 31, 2015 that Bobbi Kristina was found unresponsive, unconscious, and face down in a bath tub. That was nearly three years from the day her mother famously drowned, also in a bathtub. Bobbi Kristina was placed into a medically-induced coma and reportedly suffered severe brain damage. While various relatives made contradictory public statements over her condition, they cooperated enough to permit her father, Bobby Brown, and her aunt, Pat Houston, to serve together as Bobbi Kristina’s co-guardians, managing her medical care and decisions.\nInstead of a relative, the court in charge of Bobbi Kristina’s case appointed an attorney from Atlanta, Bedelia Hargrove, to serve as her conservator. As conservator, Hargrove was able to to manage Bobbi Kristina’s finances and make financial-related decisions for her. In late June — just weeks after being appointed in that role — Hargrove started a new lawsuit on behalf of Bobbi Kristina, against Nick Gordon.\nThe lawsuit accused Gordon of assault and battery, fraud, stalking, and more — claiming that Nick Gordon was motivated by the millions of dollars held in trust for Bobbi Kristina through Whitney Houston’s will. Specifically, Hargrove alleged that Gordon perpetrated a “scheme to benefit from her wealth” including “routinely transferring a large portion of Brown’s funds” into his own bank account, without her permission. Gordon questioned Bobbi Kristina’s ability to access the trust money, and also threatened and stalked one of the trustees leading to a restraining order, the lawsuit states. He even allegedly took $11,000 out of her account while she was in a coma.\nThe worst of the allegations involve claims that Gordon engaged in domestic violence against Bobbi Kristina, including the injuries that ultimately led to her death. Hargrove’s lawsuit included claims that Gordon was guilty of assault, battery, conversion and more — and that he should be liable for more than ten million dollars.\nNow that Bobbi Kristina has died, on July 26, 2015, multiple media sources are reporting that Gordon is being investigated for the murder of Bobbi Kristina, with criminal charges expected to be filed. Nick Gordon denies the allegations and reportedly is heartbroken over Bobbi Kristina’s death.\nPage 1 / 3 Continue", "external_links": ["http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/ebb97f77af27477b9b52b25b38918ac2/640x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "published": "2015-07-27T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T23:38:35.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
