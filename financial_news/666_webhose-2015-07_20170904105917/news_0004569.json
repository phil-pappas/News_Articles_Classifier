The Shanghai Composite Index is currently off nearly a quarter from its mid-June high, though stocks have staged a recovery over the past two days thanks to government intervention. \nThrough June, China passenger-car sales rose a disappointing 4.8% to 10 million vehicles, a rate far below the gains seen over several years. \nDemand for cars remains tepid despite auto makers offering price cuts and other incentives. The latest survey by CAAM shows that total inventories of passenger cars have rose to more than 50 days of sales in May, above the group’s warning level of 45 days. \nThe trade organization cut its forecast for China’s automobile market in 2015 to a 3% gain over last year from 7% after sales notched only a 1.2% year-over-year rise recorded in May and a 3.7% increase in April. \nDong Yang, vice president for the auto manufacturers association, said 2015 “will be an off-year for the Chinese car market.” Dealer surveys show customer visits to dealers “dropped sharply in the first half,” Mr. Dong said. \nExecutives and analysts expect the slowdown, which has been ongoing for the past year, to accelerate competition in China between global auto makers and domestic rivals. \n“Demand is clearly slowing in China and there is an oversupply issue with a brewing price war,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak said in a note to investors distributed this week. He said the mix of vehicle sales could favor local players and lead to “domestic Chinese [auto makers] taking share from global” companies who have joint ventures in China. \nThat development would unfold as other important developing markets are already bleeding. \nRussia, once considered the darling of European auto markets, has been in a tailspin amid economic and political turmoil. Brazil and other markets in South America that have long been big contributors for Volkswagen AG VLKAY 2.57 % , Toyota Motor Corp. TM 1.93 % and General Motors Co. GM 1.26 % have been declining sharply. \nThe slowdown in China takes the problem to a whole new level because operations in that country are big profit contributors for Volkswagen, GM and their competitors. In recent years, sales to Chinese buyers have contributed as much as half of the global net profit for the biggest auto makers. \nFor instance, Barclays BCS 4.39 % auto analyst Brian Johnson notes GM—with 15% market share in China—is one of the country’s biggest auto makers, and he estimates 20% of GM’s 2015 corporate profit target depends on China. \n“GM will likely need to reduce its [earnings] targets,” Mr. Johnson said. “We believe risk to GM earnings from China ops may be under appreciated given sharp pricing pressures and soft volumes.” \nMost car makers have reported slowing gains for the first half of this year. GM. reported a 4.4% rise in its China sales, down from a 10.5% increase in the year-earlier period. Ford Motor Co. F 1.05 % saw its China sales largely unchanged from a year earlier, compared with a 35% gain in the year-earlier period. Sales growth at Toyota fell slightly to 10% from 12% over the same period. \nJohn Zeng, an analyst at research firm LMC Automotive in Shanghai, said there was little reason for optimism on China’s car market. \n“The painful market adjustment currently under way is far from over,” he said. —Rose Yu contributed to this article. \nWrite to John Stoll at john.stoll@wsj.com 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T08:39:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
