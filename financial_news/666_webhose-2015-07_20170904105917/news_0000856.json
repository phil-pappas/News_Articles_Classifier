Don Simkovich \nThe minimum wage is rising in cities across the country with Los Angeles leading the way to boost the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020. Mayor Eric Garcetti said at the bill signing in June 2015 that the policy will lift millions of Angelenos out of poverty. \nBusiness owners in and around Los Angeles don't agree that the benefits will outweigh related economic pain. \nThe CEO and founder of New Wave Home Care, a home care agency serving the greater San Gabriel Valley, Sam Gopinathan, MBA, says he appreciates that workers want higher wages. His concern is that policy makers have not shown how the law affects business owners while not giving accurate details about the benefits to employees. \nHome Care Impact \nThe minimum wage law will hurt families providing care for senior loved ones. Critics of the hike say it's a 66.67 percent boost in wages and other expenses will rise along with the income. \n\"We are fast reaching the point where the percentage of retired people in our community will virtually double in the next ten years. If you are hiring a caregiver to provide care for your parents, the cost of the care will now go up by 66.67 percent.\" \nThis will cause money to flow out of retirement accounts at a faster rate than what would have otherwise occurred. \nEmployer Impact \nEmployers will be paying more than higher wages. Workers compensation will spiral upward as well. \n\"Workers comp is calculated based on payroll, even though logic suggests that premiums are based on assessment of risk.\" \nSam broke out how employers in the labor-intensive service industry , hospitality, and entertainment will be most affected. \nA) Wages rise by 66.67% \nB) Increase in payroll taxes, the employers contribution is 16.5%. \n\"The effect of 16.5% on 66.67% equals 11%.\" \nC) Worker's comp premiums go up by 10% \n\"Take a 15% Workers Comp premium, then the net effect on 66.67% increase will be 10%.\" \nThe overall cost to the employer becomes 87.67 percent, according to Sam's calculations. \n\"This would make either the services unaffordable to the consumers or will result in significant increase in cost of living.\" \nRipple Effects \nThe home care industry isn't the only sector concerned about handling the hike. In the entertainment industry, prop houses and caterers and other vendors all add to the cost of production for commercials, television sitcoms and dramas and feature films. \nStuart Waldman, president of the San Fernando Valley-based Valley Industry & Commerce Assn. told Variety . “It just makes L.A. a little less film friendly, a little more difficult. If someone can get catering for cheaper in Louisiana, do they make that decision to shoot there? ” \nThe biggest beneficiary of the increase is the government, says Sam. \"This will increase tax revenues for the government by 30 percent.\" \nSam Gopinathan says the benefits to employees are minimal. \"For a person earning $9 per hour working 40 hours per week, the income tax amount goes up from $ 2,808 in a year to $ 4,680.\" \nHe says it is a \"misplaced notion that increasing the minimum wage will bring back the middle class that is fast vanishing\" and remarked that creating a middle class out of only the service industry is \"futile.\" \nSam Gopinathan and other business owners are concerned that the cost of doing business will rise dramatically and cause employers to look for lower cost alternatives to Los Angeles and California. The net result, he concludes, means fewer jobs and less benefits for workers. \nFor more on Sam Gopinathan and New Wave Home Care visit their webpage .
