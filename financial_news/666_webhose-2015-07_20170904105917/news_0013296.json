The backing of German lawmakers is required even just to restart aid talks, inserting additional uncertainty at a time when trust in Greek intentions is at a low, the second official said. Both asked not to be named discussing government deliberations.\nThe scenarios being debated in Berlin suggest the referendum is only one more stage in the Greek saga rather than an endgame as Merkel’s five-year effort to keep the euro area whole hangs in the balance. A change of government in Athens to restore lost trust would probably speed up the process, according to several German officials and lawmakers.\n“First of all, Greece has to decide what it wants,” German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Wednesday. “Then we have to find serious and sustainable solutions. We have to create the foundation for renewed trust that can’t be wrecked unilaterally.”\nWhile communications haven’t broken down, months of conflicting signals by Greece’s government have left the chancellery unsure of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s intentions, the first official said. If Tsipras called the anti-austerity referendum and walked away from aid talks with the aim of winning more concessions from Greece’s creditors, he miscalculated, according to the official.\nSuspicious Lawmakers Even after the political uncertainty passes, any Greek aid request would face a wall of suspicion in Germany, particularly if Tsipras stays in power, the second official said.\nFinance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said in a Bloomberg Television interview he would resign if Greek voters endorse austerity in the plebiscite. Tsipras took a similar stance, telling a Greek television interviewer he’s “not attached to the chair” and would “respect the will of the people.”\nAfter Greece’s old bailout ended Tuesday without an accord on the way forward, the next bid would have to tap the European Stability Mechanism, which has higher hurdles for aid.\nOne of the first is getting lawmakers in Merkel’s governing coalition, many of whom are fed up with Greece, to approve the start of negotiations. Her government wouldn’t even lobby for talks unless it saw a reasonable chance of a deal, the first official said.\nSummer Recess In that event, Germany’s 631 lower-house lawmakers might have to interrupt their summer recess that runs from Friday to Sept. 4.\n“If the program is rejected for good in the referendum, it’s over,” said Alexander Radwan, a lawmaker from the Merkel-affiliated Christian Social Union party. “It’s up to those who left the negotiating table to return to it.”\nWhile Merkel is leaving the door open to talks after the referendum, she says Greece no longer poses a threat to Europe’s future . That echoes President Barack Obama, who said Tuesday he doesn’t see the risk of “a major shock to the system.”\nFaced with growing headwinds over Greece among German voters and lawmakers, Merkel said she won’t be pressed into helping Greece.\n“We can calmly wait” for any Greek aid request, she said in a speech to parliament Wednesday. “Overcoming Europe’s sovereign debt crisis requires time and staying power.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T19:57:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
