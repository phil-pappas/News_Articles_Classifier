The cash infusions should allow Greece to meet debt repayments, including to the ECB on Monday, reopen its banks and start to repair its economy.\nAn ECB spokesman declined to comment.\nELA was increased by 900 million euros, Draghi said at a press conference on Thursday, adding that the Greek central bank’s request was “recalibrated” over one week.\n“Now things have changed,” he said. “We had a series of news, with the approval of the bridge financing package, with the various votes in various parliaments -– to begin with, in the Greek Parliament -– which have restored the conditions for a raise in ELA.”\nConfounding Colleagues Euro-area leaders seemed confident of a change in ECB policy by midday Thursday, as the Governing Council meeting was still taking place.\n“I would expect that Mario Draghi will consider now turning on the tap to some extent of emergency liquidity,” Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny told broadcaster RTE on Thursday morning. That would “keep the banks in Greece having money for their customers,” he said.\nThe Greek government and Greek central bank are examining how lenders can reopen as soon as possible, a Greek central-bank official said Friday on condition of anonymity. Lenders have been shut and the country has been under capital controls for almost three weeks.\nDraghi has form in persuading the Governing Council, which includes the governors of the euro-area’s 19 national central banks, to take decisions contrary to the institution’s planned course of action.\nAt his first meeting as president in November 2011, when the ECB’s economic staff advised no change in the interest rate, he surprised them and some of the Governing Council turning the debate in favor of a quarter-point cut.\nIn July 2012, as surging sovereign debt yields strained the euro area’s stability, he said at a conference in London that he would do “ whatever it takes ” to save the single currency. The comments, which hadn’t been endorsed by the Governing Council, sparked six weeks of hurried negotiations before the announcement of an emergency bond-purchase program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T17:39:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
