This enables simple and secure credit and debit card payments by connecting to a smartphone using Bluetooth®. The CSR1013 at just 0.35mm is the thinnest Bluetooth Smart System on a Chip (SoC) available in a 2.4mm x 2.6mm Wafer Level Chip Scale Package (WL-CSP). BrilliantTS took advantage of the small footprint, ultra-thin form factor and low power consumption to develop a smart card that is the same size as a standard EMV (Europay, Mastercard, Visa) card, ensuring it is compatible with existing POS and ATM systems. Designed to reduce the amount of cards in a wallet, the All-in-One Smart Card can register over 30 cards. This includes both credit and debit as well as supporting public transport travel, magnetic and near field communications (NFC), one time password (OTP) as well as a wide variety of applications, such as security door keys. Alongside the CSR1013 ultra-thin package, the Bluetooth 4.1 solution also offers low power consumption, 128KB memory and low external bill of materials (eBom). This makes the SoC ideal for next generation payment and security cards and a wide variety of other smart devices such as sports equipment and wearables, and is priced to enable devices at all levels of the price scale. “Customers often need to carry multiple cards around with them, which adds an element of frustration when shopping. We wanted to make this all-in-one card thinner and improve the overall consumer experience,” saidJaehun Bae, CEO at BrilliantTS. “To make this possible we needed to develop a card which was the same size as a standard EMV card and did not need to be constantly charged. CSR1013 helped us to achieve this with the built-in security that Bluetooth Smart provides.” Anthony Murray, Senior Vice President, Business Group at CSR, said: “The IoT is driving a need for smaller devices with low power consumption as developers bring connectivity to everything from mobile phones to watches and smart cards. By taking advantage of the small form factor and high performance of the CSR1013, BrilliantTS is creating an all-in-one, connected, smart card, that brings powerful new functionality to consumers.” The CSR1013 CSP is part of the proven line of CSR μEnergy single-mode Bluetooth low energy platforms. CSR1013 CSP increases application code and data space for greater application development flexibility. The CSR1013 example design is available now and CSR will produce modules that can be used with the existing CSR101x development kits.
