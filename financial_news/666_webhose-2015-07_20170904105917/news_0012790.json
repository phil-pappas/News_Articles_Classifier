Peter Bennetts Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Big designs benefiting ordinary people took out the top architecture awards in WA and SA on Friday, with the Fiona Stanley Hospital and Adelaide Oval redevelopment dominating in their respective states.\nThe $2 billion hospital in southern Perth won the state's top architecture award, the George Temple Poole Award for its design as a flexible facility with one to grow while also protecting the privacy of patients, said jury chairman Brian Wright.\nWhile the hospital has suffered problems including overcrowding since opening in October, the separation from public areas of patients on trolleys, an outdoor space for intensive care patients and distinct entrances for regular patients are some of the features that preserved the dignity of vulnerable people, Mr Wright said.\n\"There is a very clear break between what they call front-of-house and back-of-house,\" he said. \"You can get where need to go and have treatment and don't mix with the general populace going through the main core of the building. It's very clever.\"\nThe $610 million Cox Architecture, Walter Brooke and Hames Sharley-redesigned Adelaide Oval redevelopment won SA's top award for public architecture, along with the Colorbond Award for steel architecture, an interior award and urban design commendation. It also shared the City of Adelaide prize with the adjacent Riverbank Bridge designed by Tonkin Zulaikha Greer, Taylor Cullity Lethlean & Aurecon.\nThe combined works have given new pedestrian access to a better-equipped sporting venue, now the country's third-largest. The University of SA's Jeffrey Smart Building – designed by John Wardle Architects in association with Phillips/Pilkington Architects – won the awards for educational and sustainable architecture and a redeveloped Victoria Square/Tarndanyangga by Adelaide City Council and Taylor Cullity Lethlean also showed how good design served ordinary people, jury chairman David Brown said.\n\"They're pieces of architecture you don't just drive past to look at,\" he said. \"They're part of everyday life.\"\nThe oval redevelopment achieved a further distinction, Mr Brown said.\n \"There are very few people who hate it, which for Adelaide is quite a good thing,\" he said.\nApart from the Fiona Stanley Hospital, which also took out the top WA awards for public and sustainable architecture, as well as an urban design commendation, good design serving the local population came with the Kununurra Courthouse designed by TAG Architects & iredale pedersen hook architects, architects in association, Mr Wright said.\nThe courthouse, in the state's far north, recognised local Aboriginal culture and needs, with artwork imitating the local gorges and rock formations, and by providing spaces for people to gather in family groups.\n\"If families are in dispute, they can get together and remain separate,\" he said. \"It's very clever.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "http://www.brw.com.au/p/professions/looking_to_lord_ashes_pose_test_0YGe5Bixy674yYBkLq55TO", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-07-03T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T08:33:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
