Chips cost so much. Parts cost so much. But in high school I got very good at designing computers and my skills got better.\nIt took huge amounts of hours and effort and weeks and months at first. And finally, I got to where I can design a computer and then I kept redesigning them.\nI could never afford a single chip so I just designed them over and over with pencil and paper.\nI told my dad, by the end of high school, I told him I am some day going to own a 4K [kilobytes of memory] computer, because it takes a 4K computer to run a programming language.\nMy dad said, 'It costs as much as a house,' and I said, 'I'll live in an apartment'.\nThe maker and the marketer JG: You and Steve Jobs had a really formative five years where you were making things together and you figured out what your strengths are.\n SW: We never made things together because Steve didn't have any design or electronics ability. He was more the watcher, but he could always turn it into money because he had worked in stores as a salesman of electronic parts.\nThe computer club inspired me.\nI realised the first night of this computer club, the formula was here to build that 4K computer in a usable form by using a keyboard and a video [display].\nThese people in the club were talking about the social revolution. Once we had our own computers, we were going to communicate faster, educate better and the geek was going to be important.\nI was so excited by the social talk. I wanted to be a hero to them. So I went and built my computer and it became the Apple I eventually.\nI showed it off and I gave out all my designs. I said here, you could all build your own for $300.\nAfraid of politics JG: Apple plateaued in 1980 and I've read that you said around that time Steve's personality or his behaviour started to change.\nSW: Some people talk about it as if Steve Jobs had a hard-driving personality that couldn't really execute and make successes of products before he left Apple and the Steve Jobs that returned was mature.\nI knew a Steve Jobs before that, I knew Steve Jobs just laughing, fun, pranks, all this stuff, going to concerts with him. Then when we started the company, Steve had wanted to find a formula to being an important person in the world.\nHe thought about it all the time. He hadn't really achieved well in school but he wanted to be one of those important people. And he saw this as a chance, big money's coming into a company, and I am a founder, and he wanted to be the leader.\nI really didn't want to be that because I was afraid of politics, people talking behind your back, pushing you out.\nI'm so soft and nice, I'd get pushed out. I'll do engineering. If I do engineering nobody can kick me out, because I'm too good.\nJG: But you didn't tell Steve that you're leaving, he read it in The Wall Street Journal , is that right?\nSW: They made it sound like I was leaving because I was upset that Macintosh was getting all the attention and the Apple II people were being left behind and I was in the Apple II, III division, and people were very, very upset about being maligned.\nThat was true, but that was not why I left. I wanted to be part of a start-up again.\nEngineers rule JG: You once said of Steve Jobs that one of his best qualities was that he listened to good engineers.\nSW: Steve Jobs generally listened to and appreciated people who stood up to him and came from a logical-rational point of view.\nHe liked good engineers. He liked good technologies that you could build products out of. He was always trying to be state-of-the-art in the world, that was important to him.\nSometimes it's not just the ones that have academic-type knowledge to answer questions, sometimes it's the ones who have actually built projects. And you could see the excitement and the passion.\nNo watch JG: You don't appear to be wearing an Apple watch tonight.\nSW: I haven't bought an Apple watch. I haven't ordered one. I want to use it and see if that simplification affects my life.\nBut I have some misgivings too, because I've had some smartwatches and they didn't change my smartphone life. You know, I had them and I wore them and I got rid of them. It just didn't have enough of a 'give me something new I didn't have before', and I'm worried about that.\nIf you buy the gold one for $17,000, you're getting your money's worth. It's like the gold Rolex. You're buying $17,000 worth of prestige.\nBut the other ones, there are 20 models from $500 up to $1100 and the only difference is the band. So I'm wondering if Apple's selling watches or bands.\nIt doesn't seem like the company we started and that moved the world forward.\nI was first in line for every iPhone that came out, every iPad that came out, these were important products to me. I just wanted to have the newest, latest, and try it out and use it for some advantages but it just didn't grab me that much for the watch.\nApple should get into electric cars because a company the size of Apple should only look into markets that are going to be huge, huge, huge and the car market is huge, huge, huge.\nJG: If you were starting out today, what would you get into?\nSW: It might be quantum computing, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars.\nThe computers are now being taught with neural networks to learn and find the methods that solve the problem.\nI really believe that the computers are going to get conscious.\nLife lessons Audience member: What would you say is your legacy that you would you like to create in the next 20 years?\nSW: I don't like to talk about legacy and all that.\nI'm glad to have been a great engineer that knew how to connect chips in a different era of technology.\nI also want to be known as a nice person that has been good and helpful to others throughout my life. I wasn't really seeking some kind of power and glory.\nJG: You said in a commencement speech at Berkley that life has rules if you look for them. What have your rules been in your life?\nSW: I thought mine out from a point of view of logic: how should I plan to behave in this world? What kind of person do I want to be?\nI was already good at electronics and to me electronics, math, science, the things I was tops at, I equated to truth. My father always taught us: 'you are only as good as what you speak as the truth'.\nAnother one is, you will tell the truth and you will not hide things from your parents or other important people in your life that matter.\nI also always wanted to care about others, give to others that don't have as much as me. When Apple went public, I took 20 million of my own stock and gave it to a few people that were in the garaged era, the little guys in the garage. Because if they hadn't been around, would I have even felt like doing what I did and start in the company?\nI feel like everybody who works for a company is like a part of a family, you take care of the one next to you.\nI believe in these principles. They were very much a part of the Hewlett-Packard that I worked for, they helped influence me and my own values.\nAlso, never to take advantage of anybody for money.\nI didn't want to be one of these super-high wealthy. I didn't want to be super poor, you know â€¦\nBut personal ethics and business ethics are different. In business ethics you've got to survive first. You've got to make a profit and I totally buy into that.\nNext gen JG: We need to encourage more of our kids to do science subjects. Would you go on a roadshow sponsored by Australia's big companies to go and talk to schoolkids?\nSW: Of course, I would be delighted to, but you know what, a lot of times what you are good at, you think 'oh, this is what we've got to bring more of to the kids' and there is no technology really taught in schools, none of the things that I learnt that made me great were taught in any of my schools.\nAnd you think we've got to educate teachers in programming. They could teach kids to program and that sort of thing.\nBut I don't think a little programming for a couple of days really goes very far.\nIt's a difficult one to grab, but the future is going to be the information technology.\nResource-driven countries are all trying to find ways to get into the information economy as the future for their people. And I see a lot of countries kind of going faster than Australia.\nSteve Wozniak appeared as a guest of the Melbourne Business School Dean's Leadership Forum.\nBoss magazine is out on July 10.\nLike Boss on Facebook .
