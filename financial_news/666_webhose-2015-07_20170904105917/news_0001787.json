But trust us, it’s worse for the financial reporters who write those stories, sweating to get the most important numbers to readers as quickly as possible. \nAnd, boy, do companies not help. \nFor the uninitiated, earnings releases are a headache. They’re full of jargon, vacuous quotes from executives, numbers that don’t add up, numbers that are missing, tables that are confusing and boiler-plate legalese that’s endless. \nCompanies go to extraordinary lengths to conceal bad news — including such measures as putting the big profit warning in the very last sentence of a 12-page release. \nWe are not joking. \nThe MarketWatch team has been covering earnings for decades, and the contortions we are put through every quarter can be exhausting. \nWith the latest earnings season now upon us, we’ve decided that, instead of expressing our frustration in our usual manner — filling our newsrooms with loud and colorful swear words — we should address the problem head-on, by telling companies, with examples, what enrages us the most about earnings reports. Our hope is that PR and finance teams read this and change their ways. Think about it, people: You don’t really want angry coverage. \nThe following are the most infuriating things that companies do in their earnings releases ... Getty Images Artwork is nice, but give us the numbers — fast. Slide 2 of 11 Making the numbers hard to find \nA growing number of companies have stopped publishing results in press releases that run on news feeds, forcing reporters to click through multiple links to find the data they need. \nFor example, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s WMT, -0.19% most recent release gave only minor details of quarterly results , before directing readers to click on a “ Smart News Release ” link via Business Wire. Then, to see the full multimedia result, you had to click on an image . \nA Wal-Mart representative told MarketWatch that the company had chosen to release its news this way to provide a more colorful and visual format, conceding, though, that “some outlets may not be able to accept the visuals and the graphics.” \nFor a reporter trying to get important news to the public as quickly as possible, this method not only added extra steps but forced him or her to contend with a website that slowed significantly as multitudes of people clicked the links at the same time. \nSo why not release the news both ways, so the public can get the news quickly and/or visually? \n“We support the use of multimedia assets as enhancements to the presentation of corporate information, but continue to strongly believe that the market is best served by the simultaneous push of full-text material information to all market participants,” a Business Wire representative said in an emailed statement to MarketWatch. “This allows for the fastest and widest dissemination, consumption and redistribution of a company’s market moving news.” \nUPDATE: Netflix Inc. NFLX, -2.23% was the most recent offender on Wednesday. It took more than ten minutes of frantic clicking to even see their earnings, a ridiculous rigmarole for a report in which they actually beat estimates. Bloomberg Slide 3 of 11 Flipping the table \nSodaStream SODA, -1.51% was an offender in this category this earnings season. Instead of starting its table of results with the current quarter, followed by the previous one, its table started with the year-earlier period. Reporters regularly jump straight to this table to start sending headlines — and this one often catches them out. \nRemember: The newer number is the news. Put the news first. Wal-Mart Stores Slide 4 of 11 Way too many numbers \nSometimes, the hunt for the numbers that really matter to investors can make a reporter’s eyes blur. \nIt’s hard enough to sort out earnings based on generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and non-GAAP earnings, which exclude nonrecurring items and which are what usually compare with the consensus analyst estimates. But where does “income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interest” fit in? \nThere’s nothing wrong with disclosing all the numbers in a financial table at the bottom of a news release. But in the spirit of full disclosure, why not just tell reporters and investors upfront what the so-called bottom-line number is, so the company doesn’t have to call the reporter later to complain that the comparable earnings number was reported wrong? The market is eventually going to figure it out, anyway. Getty Images Stop trying to hide the bad news. Slide 5 of 11 Burying the lead \nDo companies really think they can hide bad news by burying it near the bottom of a news release, or releasing it just as reporters and investors are shutting down for the weekend? \nApparently so. \nEtsy Inc., for example, saw its stock ETSY, +1.88% tumble after the online marketplace operator reported a big loss per share , compared with expectations of a break-even quarter. And the first mention of its loss in the news release came in the ninth paragraph, well below a table the company provided highlighting growth in merchandise sales, revenue and active buyers. \nPerhaps Etsy should be given the benefit of the doubt, since this was the first earnings release since the “benefit corporation,” which allows management to care as much about the social good as shareholder value, went public barely a month ago. \nDon’t miss: Etsy becomes largest B Corp to go public \nBut what about the 100-year-old filtration company Donaldson Co. DCI, -1.11% which cut its sales outlook at 4:31 p.m. Eastern time on Friday, May 1? That didn’t keep reporters from reporting the news, or investors from punishing the stock, which tumbled 5.2% the following Monday to close at the lowest level in 20 months, at the time. It just made them mad. Getty Images Slide 6 of 11 Including a lame executive quote \nAlmost every company in the U.S. is guilty of this one — an executive quote smack in the middle of the earnings release that is pure hot air. \n“We had another fabulous quarter because we are fabulous,” is just not going to cut it. Reporters will only use a quote that says something forward-looking or explains what happened in the quarter. A generic and vague comment, like this one from the head of General Motors Co. GM, -1.07% is a waste of space: \n“Our results in the first quarter provide a solid foundation to achieve our financial commitments for the year,” said GM Chief Executive Mary Barra. \nCompare that with this refreshingly honest and to-the-point quote from the CEO of handbag retailer Vera Bradley VRA, -2.26% : \n“We are not attracting enough new customers to the brand, and traffic and sales are still very challenging,” Robert Wallstrom said in the retailer’s first-quarter statement. \nWell, that’ll do it. Bloomberg Slide 7 of 11 Expecting reporters to do their own calculation \nFull disclosure: Many financial reporters are innumerate. Some can barely add and subtract. Which is why asking them to do their own calculation can only end badly. And yet a number of companies demand exactly that. \nUntil recently, AOL US:AOL was the worst offender. The company would regularly put out earnings in which a table on Page 9 included an “impact per diluted common share” as an item impacting comparability that had to be added back to the diluted EPS number on Page 1 to get an adjusted number that matched the consensus. \nSeriously. \nEvery quarter, the company’s PR team would call to explain that the GAAP number was not an apples-to-apples match with the consensus. Raising this question: Then why didn’t you just put the comparable number on the first page? \nCue the loud swearing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T23:55:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
