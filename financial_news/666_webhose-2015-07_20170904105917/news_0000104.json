Alkis Konstantinidis Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett The Greek parliamentary vote on the German version of economic reform is likely to lead to the collapse of the Syriza government relatively soon.\nIt's obvious now to every shop owner, student protester or aggrieved pensioner in Greece that attempted defiance has ended in humiliating defeat for Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras – and for the country. The violent demonstrations outside the Greek Parliament and the denunciations inside from Tsipras' own party for selling out demonstrate the political cost to the Prime Minister's reputation. That is despite the strong vote in favour of the deal – 229 out of 300 MPs.\nThe combination of tax increases, cuts in spending, privatisation, labour market reform and changes to the pension system is still considered a better option than the only available alternative – virtual economic collapse.\nTsipras said he signed up to something he \"did not believe in\" to avoid disaster. Any faith in his tactics, so enthusiastic in the Greek community a mere 10 days ago, is shredded now. His domestic political opponents and supporters can agree on one assessment – Tsipras has made Greece's economic situation worse rather than better as promised when Syriza won government in January, right up to when he took the country to a referendum.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel is receiving plenty of criticism internationally for Germany's uncompromising position. She will still claim political vindication for a tough European price being exacted as the basis for any third bailout.\nBut there's no such economic vindication for this Greek \"cure\" beyond the certainty that dire conditions in the country will continue to deteriorate over several more years at best.\nThat actually will not matter too much to the rest of Europe, given the minuscule size of Greece's contribution to European gross domestic product, now and in the future.\nFrustrated antagonism It also puts into context the typically exaggerated warnings by former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis that this is like the Treaty of Versailles, which forced crushing reparations on Germany after the First World War. There can be no Greek revenge, although it will certainly foment the popular but frustrated antagonism there and elsewhere to Germany's control of the eurozone.\nThe overwhelming support of Syriza's traditional party opponents overcame divisions within the Greek government – at least for the urgent parliamentary vote demanded by eurozone leaders as part of the deal finally agreed last Monday. That sense of national unity is unlikely to last despite the continuing crisis. Only 32 of the 149 Syriza MPs voted against the terms of the deal but it's still likely that such arguments, given the certainty of further economic misery ahead, will lead to new elections sooner rather than later.\nFor other European governments, however, a much larger and more threatening crisis is narrowly averted now. The risk of market contagion is delayed ,if not banished – at least until the next time. Yields on Italian bonds hit six-year lows even while the Greek parliamentary debate was continuing – a sign other potentially vulnerable European economies remain in investor-safe territory.\nThat's despite the overhang of debt that still stalks most European governments. In countries like Ireland, Spain and Italy, the level of debt to GDP remains much more than 100 per cent. This is not anything as bad as the Greek debt figures, which are approaching 200 per cent of GDP and climbing, but it demonstrates just how much the rest of Europe needs higher economic growth to have any chance of avoiding a similar debt dead-end. There have been increasing signs of that growth over 2015 in several countries, adding to the determination to avoid having Greece derail momentum and confidence.\nSo the real political tussle in Brussels will be over how to mask the obvious – that there's no hope of Greece paying the debt back, including the proposal for the new €86 billion ($127.77 billion) worth of cash assistance for the next three years.\nThe International Monetary Fund is arguing the need for what is effectively a massive write-down of much of the Greek debt, naturally cloaked in more palatable terminology like debt restructuring and debt relief and debt re-profiling. IMF suggestions such as Greece delaying any repayments to its European creditors for 30 years is the financial equivalent of \"let's play pretend\". But Germany and others are still insisting they won't countenance any official write-down of the debt despite the IMF warnings they need to go \"far beyond\" existing estimates of debt relief.\nImmediate emergency That argument will be delayed while European leaders focus on the need to get through the immediate emergency of funding Greek banks about to run out of money, along with the political need to get support for the deal through their own parliaments. There will be endless more meetings of finance ministers and detailed agreements negotiated.\nGermany's Bundestag is due to vote on the plan on Friday (European time), after the French government, naturally, scheduled its vote immediately, insisting this was the only way out of the problem.\nThe proposal is for various governments to contribute between €40 billion and €50 billion, along with contributions from the IMF and the sale of Greek assets. The Greek assets to be privatised will be put in a special fund worth up to €50 billion, with a proportion of the money going to re-capitalise Greek banks.\nThe IMF is still insisting that the price of its participation must include a way for European creditors to reduce the burden of Greece's debt. Tsipras will be just as anxious to claim some sort of win over that issue as the German government will be determined to prevent it.\nIt's the modern version of a Pyrrhic victory.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-07-16T12:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:07:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
