A source close to the deal said it was around 200 million.\n\nArcapita bought the asset from Mubadala Development, an Abu Dhabi state-owned fund with a mandate to develop the emirate's economy, Arcapita said.\n\nThe asset includes three low-rise buildings in a gated community and is under a three-year master lease to Tourism Development & Investment Co, an Abu Dhabi state-owned investment fund. It features 285 one- to three-bedroom apartments.\n\nArcapita is an active player in global property markets. Last month, it said it had sold its real estate portfolio of retirement communities across the United States to NorthStar Healthcare Income Trust for 640 million.\n\nThe firm expects to complete additional investments during 2015, Atif Abdulmalik, Arcapita's chief executive, said.\n\nIt is the company's first investment in Abu Dhabi. Saadiyat is a 27 square kilometre mixed-use development in the emirate.\n\n\"Abu Dhabi provides real estate investors with exposure to the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) region, while offering steady and stable growth prospects,\" said Martin Tan, Arcapita's chief investment officer.\n\nThe company said last month it had given 3 billion in exit proceeds to its investors in the last two years but did not give a breakdown of profits for its real estate portfolio exit.\n\nIn November, Arcapita completed a 100 million fundraising, a little over a year after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. - Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T07:35:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
