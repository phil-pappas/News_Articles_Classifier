(Photo by Dominic Lorrimer/Fairfax Media) Dominic Lorrimer by Sarah Danckert and Simon Johanson The Australian Workers Union under Bill Shorten's stewardship cut a controversial enterprise deal with a company that had no employees run by the man whose $40,000 election campaign donation Mr Shorten forgot to record for eight years.\nCourt records show Edward \"Ted\" Lockyer's Maintenance Resources Engineering brokered a pay deal for workers at Shell's Geelong refinery with the AWU in 2002.\nThe deal was cut despite Maintenance Resources Engineering employing no staff at the time of the wage agreement.\nMr Shorten has come under intense scrutiny in the Abbott government's Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption after unexpectedly revealing that Mr Lockyer, an elusive former bankrupt, hired young Labor member Lance Wilson to work on his 2007 election campaign.\nMr Lockyer's association with the AWU goes back to 2002, when he helped the Shorten-led AWU use a loophole to get AWU access to the Geelong refinery during a dispute between Transfield and the CFMEU.\nThe AWU case was supported by an affidavit from Cesar Melhem, then the assistant secretary of the AWU's Victorian branch, who was recently stood down as Victorian government whip after revelations in the royal commission.\nMr Melhem did not return Fairfax Media's calls yesterday\nThe Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union failed in its legal action before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to intervene in the AWU agreement.\n Mr Shorten has come under pressure in recent months after Fairfax Media revealed the AWU cut sweetheart deals with major corporations to the detriment of members of the union when he was federal secretary between 2001 and his election to Parliament in 2007.\nThe joint-venture builder of the $2.5 billion East Link tollway in Melbourne's eastern suburbs, Thiess John Holland, made large payments of nearly nearly $300,000 to the union after Mr Shorten struck a workplace deal that cut conditions and saved the company as much as $100 million on the road project.\nIt can also be revealed that Mr Lockyer, a native of Tauranga, New Zealand, has an outstanding tax debt of $711,615 for his business Unibuilt.\nAnother company, the strikingly similarly named, Unibilt, was the labour-hire firm that donated $40,000 for the services of Mr Shorten's campaign manager.\nA court-appointed liquidator to Unibuilt in 2010, Pitcher Partners administrator Gess Rambaldi, declined to comment on Wednesday when contacted by Fairfax Media.\nEven more embarrassingly for Mr Shorten, CoInvest – a union-backed company that allows workers to transport their long-service leave between different employers – is also owed $14,193 by Unibuilt.\nRepresentatives for CoInvest did not return calls yesterday.\nBankruptcy records show Mr Lockyer was bankrupt for four months in 1993. Neither Mr Lockyer nor his former trustee in bankruptcy returned calls.\nThe mysterious Mr Lockyer has left behind him a trail of deregistered companies, many of which are subject to strike-off actions by the corporate regulator. Most of the companies were labour hire firms: Capital Site Services, Maintenance Resource Engineering, National Site Services, Manpower Labtrobe Valley and National Workforce from Malvern.\nMr Lockyer and his Tasmanian-born wife Karen own a two-hectare, three-bedroom country retreat at Cape Schanck on Victoria's leafy Mornington Peninsula.\nNo one appeared to be at home when Fairfax Media visited Mr Lockyer's gated property on the Mornington Peninsula on Thursday evening. Mr Lockyer's semi-rural estate in Cape Schanck is surrounded by six-foot high fencing tipped with barbed wire. A sign warns trespassers that the property is alarmed and monitored by a private security firm.\nThere is a large padlock on the front wooden gate with horses head sculptures on either side. A neighbour said he believed the house was a holiday home.\nLetters from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission sent to another address used by the couple in Grosvenor Street, South Yarra, have been returned unopened.\nAnother former business associate, Luvio Zotti – who owns the home where Unibuilt was registered for seven years between 2003 and 2010, and where Unibilt was registered in 2005 – claimed to have had no contact with Mr Lockyer \"for years\".\nAdditional reporting by Beau Donelly", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T21:10:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
