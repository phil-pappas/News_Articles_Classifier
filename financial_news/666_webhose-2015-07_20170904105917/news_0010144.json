It also gives Asos the ability to adjust prices as local currencies fluctuate in value. \nThe move has drastically improved international sales, which grew 16pc in the period to £227.6m. \nHowever, there were pockets of weak trading and in some international markets, growth appeared to have stalled. In Russia, Asos has been forced to drop prices by as much as 40pc to offset the fall in the value of the rubel currency. \nMr Robertson said that international sales would continue to be “challenging” as a result of Russian troubles, but that it would be offset by strong performances in France and Germany. \nThe Asos chief said that there were no plans to quit Russia as they had “no physical presence to pull out of, we operate a website and we ship goods there\". \nNick Robertson (centre) \nAsos has recently started stocking items by rival online retailers Boohoo.com and Missguided, although it insists that it acts as a platform for 850 different brands. Mr Robertson said that sales continued to be split evenly between Asos own-label products and other brands. \nGeorgina Johanan at JPMorgan (LSE: JPIU.L - news ) called Asos “more than just a clothing retailer”. \n“It offers a unique combination of over 800 third-party brands, an own-label product that has been developed into a dynamic brand in its own right, and rich-media content designed to promote its status as a fashion destination for its target audience. \n\"Combined with an attractive delivery proposition, this has driven rapid sales growth, enabling Asos to further invest in customer service and marketing and to secure incremental brands and drive further traffic.” \nHowever, some City analysts have raised questions over the high levels of sales returns at Asos. \nMr Robertson said that the average returns rate had inched higher to around 37pc of total sales, from 35pc the year before. But he said this was driven by strong sales in Germany, where the typical rate of returns averages around 65pc of all sales. \nHe also dismissed concerns over the issue, saying it was evidence of consumers \"becoming more familiar with the ease with which they can buy and return goods to Asos\", stressing the comany was still selling clothes at a profit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T02:04:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
