June was the fourth straight month of annual increases in bank repossessions, which remained far below the peak in September 2013, when lenders reclaimed 102,134 properties.\nForeclosure starts fell 4 percent to 49,105 in June, but were up 4 percent from the same period last year, RealtyTrac said.\nAtlantic City, New Jersey's financially distressed gambling hub, experienced the top metro foreclosure rate in the first half, with a foreclosure filing for 1.70 percent of housing units, or one in every 59.
