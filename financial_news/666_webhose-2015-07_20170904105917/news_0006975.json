Gentlemen, Start Your Budgeting Written by: Brian O'Connell 07/24/15 - 11:12 AM EDT More Headlines Discover Ordered To Pay $18.5 Million For Illegal Student Debt Collection \nNEW YORK (MainStreet) -- NASCAR is a huge, pedal-to-the-metal deal to a wide swath of America, with 70 million fans nationwide . And it's not just gear-head men; women comprise 37% of this fan base that's looking to enjoy the racing without wiping out their budget. This weekend, the Brickyard 400 at the world-famous Indianapolis Motor Speedway takes place, with 90,000 fans attending the event and tens of millions more watching the race on television or online. If you're going, it's not exactly a budget-friendly event unless you're careful. According to WalletHub's 2015 Brickyard 400 By the Numbers Report , it cost $1,650 for a table for six at the Brickyard Club on race day -- although you do get a \"premium buffet and an open bar.\" That said, actual ticket costs for the general public are reasonable - you can get an admission pass for as little as $30. Travel to and from the event, hotel stays, food, beverage and swag at the racetrack can cost $1,000 or more in aggregate. But if you're creative, you can slice some significant cash from that amount, race experts say. \"The best way to save at any NASCAR event, especially Brickyard, is going the camping route instead of splurging for a hotel,\" says Jill Gonzalez, a spokesperson for WalletHub.com. \"The nearby RV parking, tailgating and camping area by the IMS -- otherwise known as the 'Coke Lots' because of their proximity to the Coca-Cola plant -- offers cheap spots for a tent and grill.\" \" Glamping was also offered during the Indy 500 for the first time this year in the 'Snake Pit' - or the infield of the racetrack - but it was much more expensive,\" Gonzalez says. This year's downmarket accommodations are more palatable to the budget conscious. You can bring your own food into the Brickyard, as well. \"A lot of patrons don't realize that you can even bring your own food, beverages and coolers - and grill - into the Speedway itself,\" says Gonzalez. \"This saves on the overly price concession the track offers. One thing to keep in mind is that once you're inside of the track premises, you can't leave and come back in. So make sure you have all of your condiments before entering.\" Racing veterans advise keeping costs down by knowing what the track will allow you to bring inside. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T18:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T18:24:53.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
