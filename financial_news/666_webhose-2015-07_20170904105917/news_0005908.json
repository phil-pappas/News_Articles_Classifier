A journal on the Zimbabwean political economy was produced thereafter which dissected the issues and proffered recommendations on the rising political and socio-economic challenges. \nThe civic forces that historically have been the vanguard of the democratisation agenda are showing surmountable signs of re-awakening. \nThey are beginning to re-mobilise and re-engage ordinary citizens in social democratic processes that address issues of access to and resource allocation and make government accountable on the provisions of basic livelihood questions. \nActivities of the National Vendors Union of Zimbabwe (Navuz) are commendable in that the organisation has identified the new political battleground, a new social base emerging from the informalisation of the economy that requires critical advocacy work. \nThis is a highly contestable area where political patronage by the ruling Zanu PF party and the government through local authorities is rife yet it is now becoming a huge source of livelihoods for millions of unemployed people. How people get allocated areas to operate their small businesses require transparency by local authorities and that all kinds of discrimination on the basis of political affiliation are avoided. \nNavuz has become relevant and a thorn in the patronage system of the governing party and its surrogates because it is mobilising and organising vendors to become citizens with urgency and not mere subjects that can be tossed around, bribed and corrupted by the land barons, mostly in urban areas. \nIt allows citizens to demand accountability and transparency to the local government authorities in the allocation of vending spaces and the creation of facilities to do their business in an orderly way. \nAlthough the ruling party, Zanu PF, consolidated its hegemony of the policy after the 2013 elections through a landslide victory, the economy is experiencing rapid deterioration and poverty is on the increase. \nThe opposition has imploded and the absence of a viable political alternative and the collapse of labour unions have militated against citizen mobilisation and citizen agency, which has given birth to citizen despondency. The rise of such groups like Navuz gives ordinary citizens a coordinated platform to address their socio-economic. \nAs industrial capacity utilisation continues to plummet, more and more people are being forced into the informal sector with vending being one of the most lucrative activities. Labour unions such as the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) are encouraged to have organised desks in these new social bases where they recruit members, do advocacy and unionise the sector and address the socio-economic needs of these people. \nAs Zimbabwe approaches 2018, Navuz working together with ZCTU need to go beyond just protests and seek to inculcate programming that is in line with the shifting political economy and the livelihoods questions of informal sector workers. \nThere is urgent need for civil society organisations to represent other branches of the informal sector such as artisanal miners, new farmers in their programming. These are new social bases that could be manipulated by political players as the country drifts towards the 2018 elections. \nProgramming in the usual areas, particularly the limited focus on civil and political rights would not be adequate to address substantive democratisation issues in the wake of rising poverty and unemployment in Zimbabwe. \nCitizens in these sectors need to be cautioned against abuses by powerful political forces. \nThus the informal sector is potentially emerging as the critical theatre of Zimbabwe's struggle towards democracy especially at the time of electoral contests where political parties would move to manipulate and abuse the poor through patronage activities. \nThere is need for civil society and community based organisations to harness their efforts towards creating citizen agency through these theatres. In the absence of a formidable opposition, it is critical that civil society occupy these theatres of the struggle and provide the necessary direction. \nThe Zimbabwe Democracy Institute is a politically independent public policy think-tank.
