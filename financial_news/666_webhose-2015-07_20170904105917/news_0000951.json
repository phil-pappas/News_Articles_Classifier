The stock is just moving elsewhere,\" the trader said. Storage costs in Asia outside Japan, are cheaper.\nBanks' buying has flared as financing has become profitable again.\nThe low risk strategy relies on purchasing aluminium, while simultaneously selling it forward for a profit, having locked in cheap finance and storage costs.\nThe gap between cash and three-month prices on the LME (LME) CMAL0-3 reached its widest in one year this week.\nQuarterly premiums for July-September shipments to Japan were mostly set at a six-year low of $100 a tonne as swelling Chinese exports piled more pressure on an already swamped market.\nTraders said some term shipments had been done in other parts of Asia at $95 a tonne over LME spot.\nThe nearly $300 drop in Japan premiums between the second and third quarters, the sharpest such decline on record, was in line with a global slump triggered by higher aluminium supply partly after the LME forced warehousing companies to shorten delivery times.\n(Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T09:53:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
