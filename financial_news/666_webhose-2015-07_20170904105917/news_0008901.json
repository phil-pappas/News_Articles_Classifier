Bloomberg Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires The renewed volatility in China's mainland sharemarkets has investors gritting their teeth, but long-term, bullish fund managers are seeing only an upside as China's reforms take hold.\nGlobal asset manager AllianceBernstein's white paper Future Shock says global investors have been \"understandably transfixed\" by China's equity market gyrations.\n\"Add to this the fact that the country's growth continues to slow and the government faces immense challenges in implementing its reform programme,\" Asia Pacific fixed income director Hayden Briscoe, who led the team behind the paper, said.\n\"There can be little doubt that China poses short-term risks to investors.\"\nThe latest bout of volatility began on Monday, when the Shanghai Composite Index shed 8.5 per cent, its biggest one-day fall since 200 7. In early trade on Tuesday it fell another 4 per cent.\nBut Mr Briscoe said the biggest risk stemming from China's market volatility was that investors might ignore China's potential.\nBeijing's reforms were moving towards a more stable economy with growth figures of 5 and 6 per cent, well below previous double digits but ultimately proving more attractive to foreign investment, he said.\nInvestment case 'has not changed' Market Vectors Australia managing director Arian Neiron agreed and said the volatility was not necessarily related to China's underlying economic and structural fundamentals.\n\"The fundamental investment case for China A-shares has not changed. Equities still play a small role in the mainland financial system,\" he said.\nChina's sharemarket represented a third of its gross domestic product, which was tiny compared with developed economies, many of whose stock markets exceed their GDP, he said.\nBut as Beijing moved to open its markets to foreign investment, the importance of China's sharemarket was beginning to rise in global investing consciousness, he said.\nMarket Vectors China AMC A-Share ETF, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the CSI 300, an index of the biggest and most liquid shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen indices, launched on the ASX on June 26 amid a 30 per cent correction on the Shanghai index.\nMr Neiron remains bullish and said Australian investors were well placed to take advantage of the corrections and incrementally increase their exposure to Chinese shares.\n\"The panic which swept through equity markets has more to do with herd behaviour than with the underlying fundamentals represented by Chinese assets,\" particularly given a large proportion of Chinese shares were state-owned enterprises, Mr Neiron said.\nUpside is a long-term game But as bullish investors seek to increase holdings before China's inclusion into global indices in the next two to three years dramatically raises their standings, any potential upside is a long-term game.\n\"Over the longer term Chinese capital markets will benefit from monetary easing and financial and fiscal reforms in the country,\" Mr Neiron said.\nBut AllianceBernstein's paper said the bulk of reforms that would prove \"globally disruptive\" could take a decade or longer to complete.\n\"We believe that the best way for investors to position themselves ahead of such an event is to devote even more effort to researching the risks and opportunities that China represents.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-07-28T12:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:10:10.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
