The airline released the figures as part of its fourth quarter trading update.\nVirgin said that on an underlying basis — stripping out “one-off” items — it expected to post a $49 million loss when it reports its full-year financial results on August 7.\nThat will beat the $65 million loss tipped by analysts.\nVirgin said its yield — a reflection­ of its return on fares — improved in the domestic market during the fourth quarter.\nChief financial officer Sankar Narayan said there was more blue sky ahead, claiming the airline’s performance was continuing to improve on the back of cost-cutting efforts and its targeting of the lucrative business traveller market.\n“The result represents a significant­ year-on-year improvement in performance for the seasonally weaker June quarter and we expect to see a continued positive trajectory,” he said.\n“The key highlights in this result have been our performance on non-fuel costs, success in attracting high yielding market segments and the improved­ performance of Tiger­air Australia.”\nTigerair, which Virgin bought out in February, recorded a pre-tax underlying loss of $9.8 million for the quarter, an improvement on its $25.8 million loss at the same time last year.
