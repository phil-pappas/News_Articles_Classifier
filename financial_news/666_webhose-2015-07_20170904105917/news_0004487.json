But commentators including the Institute for Fiscal Studies called out the chancellor’s claims on helping low-income groups and decried his failure to address complexity in the tax system. \nFT Money reporters assess how a landmark Budget will affect your earnings, assets and financial prospects. Taxation \nMr Osborne confirmed plans to take family homes worth up to £1m out of the inheritance tax net, painting the measure as a matter of fairness. \nUnder the current regime, which effectively affords couples a tax-free allowance of £650,000, the number of estates expected to pay so-called “ death duties ” was due to double by 2020. “It’s not fair and we will act,” said Mr Osborne. \nFrom 2017, an additional allowance for family homes will be gradually introduced on top of the existing tax-free band, which is frozen at £325,000 per person until 2021. \nBy the time the tax break — which will be transferable between spouses like the existing allowance — rises to £175,000 per person in 2020-21, it will cost the Exchequer £940m a year. \nIt is not universal, however. Estates valued above £2.35m will not receive any of the benefit, and it will be tapered away above £2m. \nDavid Kilshaw, head of private client tax at EY, said the new tax-free allowance — which also includes a provision for couples to now downsize their home without losing any allowance — introduces “an unnecessary level of complexity” to the tax system. \nThe chancellor announced parallel measures to ensure more UK homeowners pay IHT, which is levied at 40 per cent on assets above the so-called nil-rate band threshold. \nThe most expensive tax break announced in the Summer Budget was an innocuous sounding £400 increase to the personal allowance, which will rise to £11,000 for the 2016-17 tax year at a cost of more than £1bn. \nThe threshold at which the higher 40p rate of income tax becomes payable will also rise to £43,000, up from £42,385 this year. \nTaken together, the two measures mean higher rate taxpayers will pay £203 less income tax than this year. Basic rate taxpayers will gain £80 from the personal allowance changes. \n“These changes will reduce the drag of people into the higher rate band, which had increased from one in 10 to nearly one in five [during] the coalition government,” said Patricia Mock, tax director at Deloitte. \nThese thresholds will however have to rise more steeply in coming years if the Conservatives are to deliver their pledge of a £12,500 personal allowance and a £50,000 higher rate threshold by 2020. Non-doms \nAs part of a package of policies that target “non-domiciled” residents, from April 2017 IHT will be payable on all residential properties regardless of the owner’s tax residency. The clampdown, which is expected to generate £100m a year by 2018-19, will apply to properties held indirectly via offshore companies or partnerships. \nOf greater concern to many long-term UK residents who exempt their overseas earnings from UK tax will be the chancellor’s pledge to “ abolish permanent non-dom tax status ”. \nFrom April 2017, anyone who has been living in the country for more than 15 of the past 20 years will become a UK tax resident, and therefore liable for tax on their global income. Currently, someone in this position could pay a charge of up to £90,000 a year to avoid this. \nWhile some tax professionals, including Simon Baylis, a partner at Moore Stephens, expressed concern that the move — which falls short of Labour’s call for complete abolition of non-dom status — could prompt many wealthy foreigners to leave the UK , others were more sanguine. \nSophie Dworetzsky, a partner at law firm Withers, said that the changes appear “rather superficial” on reflection. “The fact is the UK [tax regime] remains incredibly attractive.” More video Pensions \nThe government is pressing ahead with restrictions on pensions tax relief for those with adjusted incomes over £150,000, Mr Osborne confirmed. \nBut advisers warned that higher rate earners on lower salaries of £110,000 could be hit by the £5bn raid. \nThe measure — to fund the increase in the inheritance tax limit to £1m — was far more broad ranging than originally trailed. Before the Budget the government suggested only those earning £150,000 or more would see their annual allowance tapered. \n“Not just top rate, but also high rate earners will be affected by this measure because the definition of ‘earnings’ is broader than just salary,” said Jason Butler, chartered financial planner with Bloomsbury Wealth. \n“What an employer pays in pension contributions, and the employee’s own, will also count towards the £150,000 definition of adjusted earnings. So this could mean that someone earning more than £110,000, with a maximum annual pension contribution, could be caught.” \nUnder the changes, to come into force from April 2016, the rate of taper reduction is £1 for every £2 that the adjusted income exceeds £150,000 subject to a maximum reduction of £30,000. Those with income, excluding pension contributions, below the £110,000 threshold would not be subject to the taper. \nSeparately, the government made technical changes to “pension input periods” to align them with the tax year, easing the introduction of the taper. \nExperts said the new tapered allowance would make it much harder for higher earners to plan their pension saving. \n“First, they won’t know their income until the end of the year, so they won’t know how much they can save without incurring tax penalties,” said Stephen Green, a senior consultant at Towers Watson. \nHe added that cutting back on pension contributions to avoid penal rates of tax may be unwise: “It can mean losing matching contributions from the employer — though we expect that many employers will respond to this change by offering cash alternatives to affected staff.” Investment \nThe big news for high income investors was the rewriting of the rules on the taxation of dividends paid to individuals . This is expected to result in higher bills for people with large equity portfolios or entrepreneurs who pay themselves dividends from a company. \nThe move will replace the system of dividend tax credits with new dividend tax rates and an annual tax free allowance of £5,000. \nDividends from investments held within a tax wrapper, such as a pension or an individual savings account, will not be affected by the change. But dividend payments above £5,000 on investments outside these wrappers will now be taxed at 7.5 per cent for basic rate taxpayers, 32.5 per cent for higher rate taxpayers and 38.1 per cent for additional rate taxpayers. \nAlex Henderson, tax partner at PwC, said there would be “big losers” from the move, particularly among entrepreneurs who pay out dividends in companies they own. “One consequence is that it becomes relatively more attractive for entrepreneurs to sell up their business and retire as it could reduce their tax rate by between 10 and 18 per cent,” he said. \nOther measures aimed at investments included an introduction of investment restrictions to both venture capital trusts (VCTs) and enterprise investment schemes (EISs). The annual cap for money raised under VCTs or EISs has been reduced to £12m from £15m. \nNew qualifying criteria will be introduced that limits relief on investments in companies that are labelled “knowledge intensive” to within 10 years of their first commercial sale, and seven years for other qualifying companies. \nThe Summer Budget also proposes new rules to prevent EIS and VCT funds being used to acquire existing businesses. Jason Hollands, managing director of Tilney Bestinvest, said the changes were potentially problematic for VCTs and EISs. “The tighter requirements will inherently limit the range of investment opportunities available, so that may mean lower fundraising and more competition for deals,” he said. \nPositive investment measures announced included confirmation of a new ‘ innovative finance Isa ’ to be created from the next tax year which will allow peer-to-peer investing to be held inside the wrapper. This third category of Isa will sit alongside cash Isas and stocks and shares Isas and will allow investors to earn interest from P2P loans tax free. Audio Budget special: Buy-to-let, tax on dividends and inheritance tax How will the measures in the first Conservative Budget since 1997 affect your finances? Jonathan Eley unpacks the policy details with the help of Nimesh Shah, partner at Blick Rothenberg; Jason Butler, founder of Bloomsbury Wealth, and Claire Evans, partner at Deloitte. \nDownload Property \nMr Osborne handed out sobering news for buy-to-let investors, who were told tax relief on their mortgage interest payments will be limited to the basic rate of income tax. \nThis ends what he called a “huge advantage” for landlords in the property market, where wealthier landlords could claim back as much as 45p for every £1m paid in interest. The relief will be phased out over four years from 2017. \nIn another blow for buy-to-let , he announced landlords would no longer be allowed to automatically deduct 10 per cent from their annual taxable profits for “wear and tear”. Instead, only the costs they actually incur will be deductible, starting from April 2016. \nLandlords warned the measure would exacerbate the housing crisis by forcing owners to increase rents or sell up. But campaigners for affordable housing said it was a welcome step towards allowing more people to own their own homes. \nBuy-to-let mortgage brokers said the measure would prompt some landlords to transfer ownership to corporate structures, which continue to benefit from relief on mortgage interest payments. But such structures come with extra costs such as legal set-up and administration fees and could lead to double taxation unless carefully handled. \nTina Riches, national tax partner at Smith & Williamson, said: “The changes may encourage landlords to hold their buy-to-let properties in a corporate structure — particularly with the promise of reduced rates of corporation tax down to 18 per cent — which further increases the difference between income tax and corporation tax.” \nMr Osborne also attempted to ease the housing supply crunch with plans announced on Friday to lessen delays in the planning system. Developers will automatically get planning permission to build on brownfield sites under a zonal system to be set up by the government. Consumer finance \nCar owners were given good and bad news after the chancellor announced that fuel duty is to remain frozen this year but drivers of the most expensive cars will be hit by a “premium” annual road tax bill to fund a significant roads building programme. This vehicle excise duty will be split into three bands: zero, standard and premium for new cars only. Mr Osborne said the standard charge of £140 would cover 95 per cent of all cars. \nThere was also news of a rise in Insurance Premium Tax (IPT) from 6 per cent to 9.5 per cent from November. The British Insurance Brokers’ Association said the move will result in rises for 20.1m households with contents insurance, 19.6m with motor insurance and 17m with buildings insurance.
