Based on forecasts and actual reports, companies in the index are expected to see a 1.5 percent decline in profits. <p>Stocks that can bite!</p> <p>Scarier than &quot;Sharknado?&quot; Richard Ross, Evercore ISI managing director, looks at names that can attack your portfolio.</p> \n\"At the very least, I think it does put valuation under a microscope. This is an area we've been able to tiptoe past and not worry about if other data's grabbing the headlines,\" said Jack Ablin, CIO of BMO Private Bank. \"Earnings season forces us to focus on values, earnings and revenues, and if they're coming through flat or slightly above zero, that's just not the ingredients of a rally.\" \nStocks dropped Wednesday, with Apple dragging down the major indexes, after disappointing guidance and iPhone sales in its Tuesday afternoon earnings. The tech giant was down 4.2 percent and was responsible for half of the Dow's losses. The Dow closed down 68 at 17,851. \n\"I don't think the market's going to plunge right now as a result of (earnings). I just think it's one of the biggest headwinds the market faces this year,\" said Ablin. \nAnalysts have been concerned by a lack of revenue growth, but 55 percent of the companies beat revenue forecasts so far, according to Thomson Reuters. \nRead More US equities hold lower as tech earnings disappoint \nMarkets are also paying close attention to the selloff in commodities, with some traders clearly thinking the Fed might pass on a rate hike in September if the selling continues, reducing inflation. Oil was down more than 3 percent Wednesday and WTI futures closed below $50 for the first time since April 2. \nGold meanwhile fell below $1,100 an ounce, and it is now down 6 percent over the last 10 sessionsâ€”its longest losing streak in more than 10 years. \n\"It's hard to like anything. The dollar is so strong. it just cast a pall against all commodities,\" said Dennis Gartman of the Gartman Letter. Other metals and agricultural commodities were also weaker. \n\"This is not one asset class. They're all acting on their own but right now, they're acting in concert, one to the other, the dollar being the large implication,\" he said. \nAs for stocks, Gartman said the market's poor breadth and narrow leadership makes equities look vulnerable. \n\"I would hesitate to make the leap saying that commodities are telling us that the world is going into the dinger, and that equities prices are going to sell off ... nonetheless the equities market doesn't act very bullish to me at all,\" he said. \nAblin said he expects commodities to become a contrarian buy, but not yet. \"It's a trend we want to get out of the way of,\" he said. \nRead More Gold is doing something it hasn't in 20 years \nCaterpillar, McDonald's and General Motors report before the bell, while Amazon.com's release is after the close.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T02:36:27.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
