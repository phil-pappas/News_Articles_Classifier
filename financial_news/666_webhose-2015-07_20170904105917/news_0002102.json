In the JV, Religare holds 90 per cent stake, and PSU lenders Corporation Bank and Union Bank holds 5 per cent each. The company has a share capital of Rs 375 crore as on March 31, 2015. It has earned a gross premium income of Rs 276 crore in the last financial year mainly focusing on retail and micro and small enterprises. Around 60 per cent of the portfolio is coming from retail and the rest from MSME. \"Risk selection is more important than pricing,\" said Anuj Gulati managing director and CEO Religare Health Insurance. \"We have laid down practises on what we would accept as risk and we will not.\" The company plans to break-even in the sixth year of operations or FY 17. For instance the standalone health insurer is likely to launch a new product which will cover declared pre-existing diseases after 2 years with a certain co-payment share. The Rs 22,000 crore health insurance industry is expected to grow at 20 per cent-25 per cent on a year on year basis. There are five standalone health insurance companies. In its initial years of operation, the company has high management expense. The combined ratio for the insurer rose to 140 per cent at the end of March 31, 2015. It has an accumulated loss of Rs 225 crore. During the last fiscal the company had posted loss of Rs 90 crore. The Insurance Act passed by the Parliament in March 2015 has identified health insurance as a separate category. The insurance regulator is working on separate set of guidelines for health insurance companies. One of which is lower capital requirement for setting up a standalone health insurance company. This is expected to be lower by as much as 33 per cent given that claims liabilities in the sector are lower than those for automobiles or factories.
