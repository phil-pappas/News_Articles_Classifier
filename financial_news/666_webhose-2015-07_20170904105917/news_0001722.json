Sky (Other OTC: BSYBF - news ) led gains on the back of an upgrade out of analysts from Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) . Meggit's shares also found some traction following a report in the Financial Times that a merger with Cobham (Other OTC: CBHMY - news ) might be on the cards. FTSE 100 (NasdaqGS: Z - news ) up 15.80 to 6,753.75. \n1513: Austrian parliament will vote on Greek deal on Friday. \n1500: US business inventories expanded by 0.3% month-on-month in May, as expected by economists. 1413: Shares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in JP Morgan and Wells Fargo are set to start the day lower after their latest quarterly numbers missed forecasts. \n1330: US retail sales volumes declined by 0.3% month-on-month in June (consensus: 0.3%). \n1305: The last two weeks of shuttle negotiations or haggling between Athens and Brussels left the Greek economy in a wreck, according to a confidential report from the International Monetary Fund seen by Reuters. As a result, the member countries of the Eurozone were left facing a stark choice between annual transfers to the Mediterranean country's budget or \"deep up-front haircuts\". \n1111: The timing for an increase in bank rate is edging closer, the Governor of the Bank of England said on Tuesday. In an immediate reaction cable jumped to 1.5603 and as of 11:05 was trading up by 0.68% to 1.5585. \n1000: The Eurozone's industrial production dropped by 0.4% month-on-month in May (consensus: 0.2%).

There is obviously the risk that there could be another very brief dip into deflation if oil prices extend their current softening,\" Dr.Howard Archer, chief UK+European economist at IS Global Insight is telling clients. Archer also points out that flat prices together with the \"clear improvement\" in earnings growth means that consumers' purchasing power is in \"rude health\". \n0841: Stocks are flatlining following four straight days of gains and despite an advance overnight on Wall Street. Chinese stocks also took a breather, closing down by 1.16%. All eyes are on Athens and whether or not it manages to pass the reforms asked of it by creditors by Wednesday's deadline. There are signs of opposition to the possibility of a third bailout, as might be expected. Despite that, \"in light of broad support from the political parties domestically, we think that risks of a Greek exit have reduced in the short term,\" Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) explained to clients in a note sent yesterday. The country's interior minister has already come out saying there is no chance that Tsipras will not be backed in parliament.
