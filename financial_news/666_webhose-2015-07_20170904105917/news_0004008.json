Paulo newspaper whether reducing the surplus target now could mean deeper spending cuts in the future, Levy said that \"no doubt about it, it will bring about more costs\" for the country.\nBrazil needs to signal to investors that it will continue to trim budget spending until confidence returns, the newspaper Quote: d Levy as saying.\nThe government was \"not undertaking a colossal fiscal adjustment,\" he said, adding that the flagging economy was a result of declining consumer and business confidence, and not because of lower government spending.\nLevy is spearheading efforts to increase one-time revenues, such as the sale of stakes in several state companies, to help mitigate the spending reductions, Folha said.\nAnalysts at Moody's Investors Service visited Brazil in recent days to conduct a review of Brazil's credit rating, currently at Baa2 with a negative outlook.\nAsked whether Moody's was poised to cut Brazil's sovereign rating, Levy said that \"in the absence of an adjustment, that possibility increases.\"\n\"It depends on how much adjustment we do,\" he added.\nA Finance Ministry spokeswoman confirmed Levy's comments to Folha.
