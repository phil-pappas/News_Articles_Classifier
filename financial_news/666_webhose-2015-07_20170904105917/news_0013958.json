The safety of our passengers is our main concern and until the situation in the area is normalised, Putco buses will make use of alternative routes,\" said Pisapia. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T17:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T13:51:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
