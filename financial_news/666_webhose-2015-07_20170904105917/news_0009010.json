Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle Bill Shorten's opening address to the ALP National Conference was not just a reflection of the tightrope he must walk internally on a range of difficult issues for the Labor Party, but of how the acrobatic options have shrunk for all political leaders in the tougher times the country now faces.\nThe really tough, detailed debates and battles of this conference – on issues like asylum seekers – are still to come.\nThey are not, and never really have been, the stuff of a leader's opening address.\nInstead, this is the place, or the stage, where leaders can try to refashion the image the party has of itself and which it will take into the next election.\nShorten's vision of the Labor Party? Its points of difference with the Coalition?\nKeep in mind that a first term opposition leader must seek to move his party on from the one that was rejected by voters at the previous election, but also find some on-going principles with which the party faithful can recognise continuity.\nLittle difference Bill Shorten's speech suggests there is little he can find worth holding on to from Labor's last period in office. His only clear point of policy difference laid out in his conference address was on climate change.\n Even here, Labor's history – as far as many voters is concerned – is fraught. True Believers may reassure themselves that at least on this, the party is holding ground. But to do so invites memories of the disaster of how it dropped the ball on the greatest moral challenge of our time in 2010.\nFor the non-believers, it only opens the opportunity of a scare campaign about a carbon tax, no matter how much any emissions trading scheme proposal by Labor in 2015 is likely to be a mere shadow of what was once proposed in government.\nLabor in 2015 does not dare differentiate itself boldly on anything even vaguely in the national security space and that, unfortunately, has come to include asylum seeker policy.\nThe Opposition still seems trapped by its history on fiscal policy and the budget: it must proclaim its fiscal credentials when voters don't credit them; talk of its ability to find savings when the creeping consensus of the past 18 months is that the period of finding big savings is past; reject the goods and services tax and suggest closing corporate tax loopholes can solve more problems than they possibly can.\nNo clear plan, no clear money There were the usual claims to ownership and history of the policy ground in areas like education and health. There was a pledge that Labor in office would undo university deregulation.\nBut there is no clear plan here, and no clear money.\nA Labor Party figure observed last year that the best thing going for Bill Shorten was that, unlike most first term opposition leaders, he actually believed he was going to win the next election.\nThe past month or so has seen the inevitable blowtorch of scrutiny turn on him savagely and he has not fared well as a result.\nThere were repeated references in the warm up to the Opposition Leader's speech on Friday morning to the unexpected first term victories of the Queensland and Victorian Governments. It was an attempt to inspire the faithful to believe that this remains a possibility for federal Labor, despite its leaders' failure to inspire voters.\nBut the truth of those victories remains that they were classic cases of spectacular government loss, and not opposition win.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/latingle", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559"], "published": "2015-07-24T10:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T20:05:15.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
