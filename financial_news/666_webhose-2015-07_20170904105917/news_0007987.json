IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde softened that stance last month, saying that the fund can keep supporting Ukraine even if an accord with creditors “cannot be reached in a timely manner.”\nUkrainian bonds rallied earlier on Friday after the government said it made an interest payment on time, showing debt-restructuring negotiations are making progress. The nation’s debt maturing July 2017 rose to a five-month high.\nThe IMF loan program assumes the debt restructuring will save the Ukrainian government $15.3 billion by 2018. In addition to generating the projected savings, the fund wants a debt deal to lower Ukraine’s debt-to-GDP ratio to below 71 percent by 2020 and keep the gross financing needs of the government’s budget to an average of 10 percent from 2019 to 2025.\nSatisfactory Progress With Ukraine having fulfilled its reform promises to the fund’s satisfaction, IMF officials have been sufficiently encouraged by the pace of talks to recommend release of the $1.7 billion installment, the person said. IMF managers see Ukraine and its creditors as on track to satisfy conditions of the fund’s bailout, hopefully before the second review of the program is completed, according to the person.\nThe discussions affect $19 billion in international debt held by investors such as Franklin Templeton.\nThe country and its creditors have been making “good progress” in discussions on a debt deal, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said separately Thursday at a regularly scheduled briefing in Washington.\nThe government and a group representing creditors agreed in a joint statement July 16 to work on “narrowing the gaps” between their proposals after meetings in Washington attended by Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko.\nLawmakers in Kiev last week passed laws on utility prices, anti-corruption efforts, deposit guarantees and improvements in the ability of the state energy company to collect receivables.\nAfter completing a staff mission to Ukraine in May, IMF officials revised down their economic projection for the country to a contraction in output of 9 percent this year.", "external_links": ["http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2015/cr1569.pdf\\"], "published": "2015-07-24T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T18:58:40.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
