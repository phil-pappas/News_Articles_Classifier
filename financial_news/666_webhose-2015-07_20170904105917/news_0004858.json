Photo: Supplied\nA plunge in liquefied natural gas prices following last year's dive in oil prices has driven Woodside Petroleum's second-quarter revenues down 46.5 per cent, in line with market expectations.\nJune quarter sales were $US898 million in the June quarter, down from $US1.68 billion in the same period a year earlier. A 14.5 per cent decline in production contributed to the drop in revenues as the Pluto LNG venture was shut for maintenance work and the North West Shelf venture was hit by an unplanned shutdown.\nThe quarterly revenues almost exactly matched UBS's estimate of $US899 million.\nOutput was 20.1 million barrels of oil equivalent in the June quarter, down from 23.5 million in the same three month period in 2014. Production slid a more modest 7.8 per cent from the March quarter.\nAdvertisement Woodside noted that LNG revenues for the quarter slid 36 per cent from the March quarter, due to the circa four month lag between LNG prices and the Japanese crude import price on which LNG long-term contracts are based.\nLNG revenues from the $15 billion Pluto venture more than halved to $US346 million, from $US712 million in the first quarter of 2015.\nThe drop in total revenues would have been sharper were it not for added oil production Woodside secured as a result of its acquisition of Apache Corporation's stake in the Balnaves oil field off Western Australia, which contributed $US40.8 million of revenue in the June quarter. Completing the maintenance work at Pluto 10 days ahead of plan also reduced the impact of the shutdown.\nWoodside kept its full year production target unchanged at between 86 million and 94 million boe, including the assets acquired from Apache.\nLast year's near-50 per cent drop in the oil price has added to market concerns about the profitability and timing for Woodside's Browse floating LNG venture off WA, but the company on Thursday reiterated its target for a final investment decision in the second half of 2016.\nWoodside noted that it would receive a benefit on petroleum resource rent tax of between $US70 million and $US110 million for the first half, to be reported in its interim earnings statement on August 19. It also said it had secured a $US1 billion syndicated loan earlier this month, with the funds to be used to prepay the drawn-down part of a $US1.1 billion loan taken out in December 2010.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/energy/gas/energy-players-woodside-oil-search-to-reveal-hit-to-lng-revenue-20150713-giach9"], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T05:06:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
