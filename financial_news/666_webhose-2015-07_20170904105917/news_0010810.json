Apple Pay will support contactless transactions for up to £20 at launch, rising to £30 in September in line with the overall payments industry. \nThe 9to5mac report also stated that staff in Apple Stores will start receiving training on Apple Pay and how it works from 12 July, so that they can explain the service to customers. \nApple's move into the electronic payments space is seen as major moment in the market, and banks are expecting it to help make digital payments an accepted form in the minds of consumers. \nLloyds' payments and technical services director, Mark Curran, said at an event last week : \"Apple Pay brings something new to the market, no question. It will have a significant impact, and you don't do anything with Apple in a guarded way. \n\"You just have to look at their reach, at the type of customers they've got, the number of customers. And the service is pretty good, so I think it will take off.\" \nApple has managed to convince most of the banking world in the UK to embrace Apple Pay, but one holdout is Barclays, which appears keen to forge its own path with the launch of new contactless payment items last week. \nThese compromise a key fob, sticker and wristband , allowing people to load the item with a cash balance and use it to pay for goods at contactless terminals.
