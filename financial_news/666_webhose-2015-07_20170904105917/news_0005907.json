Dr Hewson, who was leader when Ms Bishop was a senator, said she set a pretty tough standard in those days for accountability and transparency, but is now “ducking and weaving” that the same standards are being applied to her.\n“It’s amazing how history bites you in the bum,” he told Sky News.\nQuizzed by reporters in Sydney today, Ms Bishop said she was under no particular pressure to resign. Having repaid the money, she said she felt no compulsion to say sorry.\nShe was annoyed when asked to explain the difference between her case and that of Mr Slipper, who while an independent MP, stood aside as Speaker during the Gillard government when $900 of cab charges were investigated.\n“Totally a different matter altogether and you know it,” she said.\nMadam Speaker Bronwyn Bishop says she made an ‘error of judgment’. Picture: Adam Taylor Source: News Corp Australia\nWhen asked if the use of the helicopter to fly to an event was an example of “grandiosity”, Ms Bishop relied: “Grandiosity is quite right. That’s why I repaid the money.\n“That (matter) is now with the Department of Finance so I don’t think that it is appropriate to talk about it any further,” she said.\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott has so far stood by his speaker, despite a pending investigation by the Finance Department into the chartering of the helicopter and two more chartered airplane flights.\nFairfax media also reported on Sunday that she spent $1000 per day on limousines during a $90,000 trip to Europe.\nMrs Bishop said this amount was similar to what other presiding officers had spent on similar trips.\nAsked if she was getting a reputation as a “big spender” Mrs Bishop said: “International travel is expensive and it is important for Australia to be represented at international bodies”.\nDr John Hewson has spoken of his shock over Bronwyn Bishop’s helicopter ride. Picture: Eugene Hyland Source: News Corp Australia\nFormer Labor trade minister Craig Emerson also asked what other revelation the prime minister needed to understand the seriousness of this issue?\n“Tony Abbott can never again credibly argue ... that people at the lower end should have their benefits cut, when Bronwyn Bishop at the top end is protected,” he told Sky News.\nGovernment frontbencher Greg Hunt said Ms Bishop’s decision to take a helicopter to the Liberal fundraiser was wrong, and believes it was right for her to pay back the $5227 plus a penalty.\nHe said Labor MPs were “absolutely entitled” to refer the matters to the Australian Federal Police as they had, but warned the opposition to tread carefully when pursuing the AFP for its decision not to investigate the matter.\n“None of us, anywhere, in parliamentary life should try to influence the process, conduct or outcomes of an AFP investigation,” he told ABC television.\nMr Hunt refused to comment on whether Mrs Bishop’s case differed to that of former speaker Peter Slipper, who was investigated and later cleared in court over allegations he misused $900 worth of cab charges.\n“That’s entirely a matter for (the AFP),” Mr Hunt said.\nGreg Hunt, Minister for the Environment, calls for Source: News Corp Australia\nToday, Treasurer Joe Hockey said he believed the issue over Ms Bishop hiring a helicopter to attend a Liberal party fundraiser is “sucking up too much oxygen” of the nation’s time.\nMs Bishop derided Mr Hockey yesterday while defying pressure to apologise over taxpayer-­funded helicopter ride from Melbourne to Geelong.\nShe broke her silence on Saturday over the crisis, dubbed “Choppergate”, and revealed she had taken two other charter flights to speaking events last year.\nThe embattled Ms Bishop said she was entitled as Speaker to catch chartered flights to Liberal Party fundraisers, ­including the one at Clifton Springs Golf Course near ­Geelong, because her speech discussed the role of Parliament.\nEDITORIAL: BISHOP MIGHT HAVE TO GO\nBISHOP REFUSES TO STAND DOWN OVER CHOPPER FLIGHT\nJOE HOCKEY INTERVIEW 9:48 Play video\nThe Treasurer on Bronwyn Bishop's dodgy expenses - has the Speaker been sucking up too much oxygen?\nnews.com.au 19 Jul 2015 News/Bolt Report But she said the high cost of that 100km Victorian jaunt had caused her to rethink the journey.\nShe had decided it was an “error of judgment”, and that the other charter flights would be looked at by the ­Department of Finance.\n“The fact of the matter is, it was done within entitlement, but as I said, the amount of money was clearly far too large and that’s why I’m paying it back,” she said.\nMs Bishop took aim at Treasurer Hockey, who had questioned her use of entitlements last week, saying her colleague said “funny things sometimes”, including that “poor people don’t drive cars”. This was a reference to Mr Hockey’s gaffe last year.\nDuring a tense press conference yesterday, Ms Bishop was unable to nominate any other reason why she was in Victoria, which raises further questions about whether her original flight from Queensland to Melbourne should have been billed to taxpayers.\nFrom Melbourne, Ms Bishop took the helicopter to the party fundraiser at the Clifton Springs Golf Club.\nMs Bishop declined an ­opportunity to apologise over her expenses, and earlier in the day described the issue as a “political beat-up”.\nPrime Minister Abbott stood by the Speaker, saying: “The important thing is that Bronwyn’s admitted that it was probably an error of judgment and she’s repaid the money.”\nMr Abbott rejected assertions that he was holding different standards for Ms Bishop compared with former speaker Peter Slipper, who was investigated by police over entitlement use.\n“The Department of ­Finance will have a look at it, and if they think there’s anything else to do, well, that will be done,” Mr Abbott said.\nMs Bishop took aim at Treasurer Joe Hockey. Picture: Gary Ramage Source: News Corp Australia\nOpposition Waste Watch committee chair Pat Conroy said police must probe Ms Bishop’s spending, after the AFP initially said it would leave a preliminary investigation to the Department of ­Finance under parliamentary protocol.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten said Mr Abbott and Ms Bishop had shown “breathtaking” arrogance. “This is becoming a test of Tony Abbott’s leadership,” he said.\nMs Bishop refused to provide details of fixed-wing charter flights she took last year, other than to say, “I think one was to Nowra and I think one was to Young”.\n“They were certainly public meetings, there could have been a fundraising as well. As I said, that is not improper.”\nShe ruled out stepping down as Speaker. “One doesn’t resign for an error of judgment when it’s within the guidelines,” she said.\nANALYSIS: CHOPPERGATE CAUSES INTERNAL LIBERAL STINK\nBESIEGED Bronwyn Bishop spent most of her press conference staring down criticism of a $5227 helicopter jaunt to a Victorian Liberal Party fundraiser.\nWith her back so firmly against the wall, Ms Bishop seemed relieved at one point to deflect the heat to a colleague for just a minute.\nWhen asked about Treasurer Joe Hockey’s decision to weigh into the entitlements debate last week, when he agreed with a radio presenter that Ms Bishop’s travel costs had failed “the sniff test”, she stuck the boot in.\n“Joe says some funny things sometimes, doesn’t he?” she said.\n“I think he said poor people don’t drive cars or something.”\nIn 2014, Mr Hockey said “the poorest people either don’t have cars or actually don’t drive very far in many cases”, when discussing the impact of a fuel tax ­increase on struggling families. Liberal tensions are already ­running high over Ms Bishop’s helicopter flight, now being referred to as “Choppergate”.\nBy taking a pot shot at the Treasurer, drawing Australians’ attention back to one of his most embarrassing gaffes, Ms Bishop has not helped the situation.\nIn 2014, Mr Hockey resisted apologising for his poor people gaffe for days, and was only shamed into saying sorry after Prime Minister Tony Abbott ­entered the debate.\nCabinet ministers have already begun to waver in their support of Ms Bishop — although Mr Abbott remains firmly loyal to his political mentor.\nLabor is salivating over the constant heat on Ms Bishop, who it believes is a biased Speaker.\nFor the Liberals, it is an unfortunate distraction from its attack on Opposition Leader Bill Shorten and his trade union royal commission woes.\nMs Bishop even acknowledged that distraction during her press conference, and when she was doorstopped at a sporting event earlier in the day.\nBut when given an opportunity to put the issue to rest at that sporting event, Ms Bishop declined and instead said it was a “political beat-up”.\nLater, Ms Bishop was given a clear opportunity to say sorry.\n“I think the biggest apology one can make is to repay the money,” she said.\nIt remains to be seen if that passes the sniff test.\nmatthew.johnston@news.com.au\nOriginally published as Bishop accused of ‘ducking and weaving’", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/19/1227447/709111-169c86ba-2dac-11e5-a7c2-8f56938fe831.jpg", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/bronwyn-bishop-choppergate-two-new-charter-flights-queried-as-speaker-snipes-at-treasurer-joe-hockey/story-fni0fiyv-1227447404721", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content6.video.news.com.au/05bjNidjqeouFKUZ51Ztx-AR15xqU53I/promo261540538&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/18/1227447/404695-cdfc488e-2d22-11e5-b1cd-9e9b6c3a6bac.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/19/1227447/709554-085d5b92-2dac-11e5-a7c2-8f56938fe831.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/19/1227447/842908-1e20bcb8-2d24-11e5-8333-417e4c2de3cb.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-19T20:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T11:31:18.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
