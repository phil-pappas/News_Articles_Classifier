The replacement cost profit measure takes into account fluctuations in the price of oil reconciling it against takings, and is used across the US dollar sensitive oil and gas industry to report earnings. \nAfter allocating another $7.5bn towards costs relating to the 2010 oil spill, the company recorded an actual loss of $6.26bn. \nOn 2 July, BP reached an $18.7bn settlement with US Department of Justice over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, with disbursal of the said amount spread over 18 years. The development prompted ratings agency Moody's to upgrade its outlook on the company from 'negative' to 'positive'. \nWith BP budgeting for a $60 a barrel oil price for the next three financial years, headline capital expenditure is expected to be less than $20 billion for the current year. However, cash costs for the year to date, currently $1.7bn below the corresponding quarter last year, as cost cutting continues. \nSociete Generale (Paris: FR0000130809 - news ) argued that while the headline numbers missed consensus, this was due to a material non-cash exploration write-off of circa $800m, half of which was due to force majeure events in Libya. \"Thus underlying upstream performance, adding back the write-offs, was of the order of $1.2bn-$1.3bn and thus ahead of consensus.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T17:52:26.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
