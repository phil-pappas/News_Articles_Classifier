The non-E-ZPass vehicles' owners will be billed by mail, based on the vehicles' license plates.\nThat is the harbinger of the future.\nThe new Delaware River Bridge \"open road tolling\" gantry will be followed later next year by a similar all-electronic toll facility on the Beaver Valley Expressway northwest of Pittsburgh.\nThose two pilot projects will be studied by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission before all-electronic tolling is installed elsewhere on the 552-mile-long network, turnpike spokesman Carl DeFebo said Wednesday.\nTurnpike officials want to see how successful they are at collecting tolls by mail from non-E-ZPass users and will evaluate \"employee issues\" with the all-electronic tolling, DeFebo said.\nAbout 750 toll collectors could lose their jobs when cash tolls are fully phased out, although the Turnpike Commission has promised none will lose their jobs during the two pilot projects next year.\nToll collectors cost the turnpike about $70 million a year.\nIt would cost about $320 million to install all-electronic tolling all along the turnpike network, according to a 2012 study for the turnpike commission.\nThe same study said all-electronic tolling would take 52 months to 64 months to install throughout the network, although DeFebo said Wednesday no timetable has been set for getting rid of all cash tolls.\nOne issue for the turnpike will be the ability to enforce pay-by-mail tolls.\nIf motorists don't pay toll notices received by mail, the charges will be turned over to a collection agency, DeFebo said.\nBut the turnpike commission has no authority to block a motorist's vehicle registration or driver's license for failure to pay.\nDeFebo acknowledged \"there will be some leakage\" in pay-by-mail tolls, but he said most motorists are expected to pay.\npnussbaum@phillynews.com\n215-854-4587\n@nussbaumpaul", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T04:25:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
