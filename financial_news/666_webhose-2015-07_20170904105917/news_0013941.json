Other companies are also understood to be in discussions with Iran, but Glencore is the first commodities trader confirmed to have visited Tehran close to the deadline for a nuclear deal. \nWestern sanctions have cut Iran's oil exports by more than half to around 1.1 million barrels per day from a pre-2012 level of 2.5 million bpd, with the loss of oil income making it difficult to invest in new development and pay for the equipment and services needed to keep its production operating smoothly.
