Picture: Christian Gilles Source: News Corp Australia\nMozo spokeswoman Caroline Thomas concedes that savings accounts are doing very little for customers so it’s critical to take the time to find the highest rate possible.\n“Standard savings rates are far from delivering big returns, so accounts with an introductory or bonus rate is where the best deals are right now,’’ she says.\n“In fact, you could double your interest by taking up one of these offers.”\nThen you can move to another account once the introductory rate ends.\nBut for savers who also have a home loan or other debts, she says they are far better off parking it in a mortgage offset account to reduce the mortgage interest costs or use the cash to pay down debts.\nThis is because the amount of interest payable on a mortgage or credit card far outweighs the amount you can earn from a savings account.\nSolicitor Antonia Quinlivan, 26, is moving out of her mother’s home next month and says she’s been sticking to a strict savings plan despite only reaping small returns on her cash.\n“My goal was to save about $3000 so I could afford to move out of home so I was putting about $600 to $1000 away every month,’’ she says.\n“I’m only getting about 2.25 per cent on my savings, I went with an account my friends recommended.”\nShe says if she had a day-to-day account with the same bank as well as her savings account and deposited a minimum of $1000 into the account each month she would get a higher rate.\nTOP FIVE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Hunt+around+for+a+decent+savings+deal&c=FALLING+interest+rates+on+savings+accounts+means+those+with+cash+in+the+bank+really+need+to+hunt+around+for+a+decent+deal.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-home-in-on-your-savings-plan-with-fallnig-interest-rates/story-e6frfmdr-1227444672591?sv=979c9079e8457a2340986460bba952d", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/savings#itm_t=story&itm_l=hunt-around-for-savings", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-home-in-on-your-savings-plan-with-fallnig-interest-rates/story-e6frfmdr-1227444672591?sv=979c9079e8457a2340986460bba952d&h=Hunt+around+for+a+decent+savings+deal", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-home-in-on-your-savings-plan-with-fallnig-interest-rates/story-e6frfmdr-1227444672591?sv=979c9079e8457a2340986460bba952d&title=Hunt+around+for+a+decent+savings+deal", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-home-in-on-your-savings-plan-with-fallnig-interest-rates/story-e6frfmdr-1227444672591?sv=979c9079e8457a2340986460bba952d&title=Hunt+around+for+a+decent+savings+deal", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-home-in-on-your-savings-plan-with-fallnig-interest-rates/story-e6frfmdr-1227444672591?sv=979c9079e8457a2340986460bba952d", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/guide/high-interest-savings-accounts#itm_t=story&itm_l=hunt-around-for-savings", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-home-in-on-your-savings-plan-with-fallnig-interest-rates/story-e6frfmdr-1227444672591?sv=979c9079e8457a2340986460bba952d"], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T10:22:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
