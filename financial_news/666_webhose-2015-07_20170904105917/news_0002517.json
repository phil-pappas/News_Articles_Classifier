The Templeton Russia and East European Fund, which Mobius manages, has declined 38 percent over the past five years through July 23, compared with a slump of 25 percent in the MSCI country benchmark. The assets have shrunk to $58 million in June from $394 million in October 2007. The closed-end fund will be liquidated before the end of this year pending investor approval, the firm said last week.\nTRF US Equity GP\nThe closure of the fund, started in June 1995, is the latest sign that global investors are abandoning Russia as it heads toward the first recession since 2009. Capital outflows may reach $90 billion in 2015 after last year’s record of more than $150 billion amid punitive measures linked to the Ukraine conflict along with a rout in oil prices that has stalled the ruble’s recovery.\nAlso influencing the move to shut down were “the constraints that we suffer from as a result of these limitations” on investing that have been imposed through sanctions by the U.S. and European authorities, Mobius said by phone from Italy. “The inability to invest in a number of companies” is “a problem.”\nFund Discount The fund traded at a discount of 12 percent to its net assets last week before the announcement. It invests at least 80 percent of its holdings in Russia or Eastern European countries and has stakes in companies such as Magnit PJSC, the country’s largest retailer, and OAO Sberbank.\n“We are still invested in Russia,” Mobius said. Mining and raw materials producers along with consumer stocks are the most interesting sectors in the market, he said. “Some of the oil and gas companies are very interesting, but most of them are subject to these limitations and constraints that we have, and we can’t buy.”\nThe Templeton Russia and East European Fund slid 1.6 percent to $10.54 in New York on Thursday, cutting its advance this year to 17 percent. The MSCI Russia Index has gained 20 percent in 2015. A Bloomberg gauge of the most-traded Russian stocks on U.S. exchanges fell 1.1 percent to a two-week low. The Market Vectors Russia ETF, the biggest exchange-traded fund tracking Russian stocks, dropped 1.7 percent to $17.25 for the third retreat in four days. Futures on the RTS Index expiring in September slid 0.7 percent to 87,460 in U.S. hours.\nThe closure is another letdown for Mobius, who is credited as a pioneer in emerging-market investing. The 78-year-old investor will retire in October as the lead manager of one of the oldest developing-nation stock funds after trailing his benchmarks in recent years. The Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust, a 1.9 billion pound ($2.9 billion) fund traded in London and New Zealand, has selected Carlos Hardenberg to take over, it said in a filing on July 13.\nMobius will support Hardenberg as a portfolio manager and remain chairman of the Templeton Emerging Markets Group, which oversees about $39 billion in assets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T08:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T05:01:18.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
