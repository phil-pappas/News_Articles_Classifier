Glenn Hunt by Carrie LaFrenz The board of takeover target Kathmandu has advised shareholders to take no action in relation to the surprise $324 million bid from New Zealand's Briscoe Group.\nBriscoe currently holds a 19.9 per cent stake in Kathmandu after silently buying shares since February. This week, it said it will offer five Briscoes shares for every nine Kathmandu shares, plus a cash amount of $NZ0.20 ($0.17) per share. This equates to an offer price of $NZ1.80 per share.\n\"At this stage, Kathmandu is not in a position to comment further,\" the dual-listed company said in a statement to the ASX.\n\"The Board of Kathmandu will meet shortly to consider the takeover notice and draft offer in detail. Until the Board of Kathmandu has given further guidance, shareholders are strongly advised to take no action in relation to Briscoe's notice of intention to make a takeover offer.\"\nUnder the deal, Briscoe managing director and major shareholder Rod Duke's 78 per cent share will be watered down to 55.1 per cent.\nHowever, analysts have said the scrip component will likely be an issue for shareholders.\n\"The proposal does have some attractive aspects to Kathmandu holders,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note to clients.\n\"A merged group provides diversification benefits with less volatile earnings and will have a significantly stronger Briscoe than Kathmandu.\n \"The heavy scrip component, however, is likely to be an issue especially for holders of the ASX listed securities, although Briscoe intends on applying for a listing of the combined group on the ASX. The large holding of BGR's MD is also a potential issue, with Rod Duke's holding in the combined group at 55 per cent.\n\"The main drawback of the scrip bid, however, is the significantly altered exposure that shareholders will have, moving from a specialty adventure wear retailer (with potential turnaround upside), to a diversified retail group.\"\nThe analysts added that the timing of the bid is opportunistic coming after a year of disappointing results and coinciding with the new chief executive second day on the job, but it is unlikely that Kathmandu will see a rapid turnaround in its business with the first half showing a sharp deterioration in Australia.\nKathmandu's long-standing sales model is centred on three key sales periods a year, but has not resonated with Australian consumers over the last 12 months, creating a serious issue for the incoming CEO, Xavier Simonet.\n\"The company is part way through its most important sales period of the year and a trading update will be crucial in assessing the extent of the issues in the business, and hence central to any view on fair value,\" the analysts said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T05:43:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
