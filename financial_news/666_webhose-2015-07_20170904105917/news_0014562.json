Retirees who received lower cost-of-living increases mandated by the law would also be owed money.\nThe law required Chicago and affected workers to increase their pension contributions and replaces an automatic 3 percent annual cost-of-living increase for retirees with one tied to inflation. Those increases are also skipped in some years.\nThe cash-strapped city is betting that the state supreme court will overturn Novak's ruling, which rejected Chicago's argument that the 2014 law results in a net benefit because it will save the retirement systems from insolvency.\nThe high court in May found public sector workers have iron-clad protection in the Illinois Constitution against pension benefit cuts. That decision came in litigation over a 2013 law that reduced benefits for workers in state retirement systems.
