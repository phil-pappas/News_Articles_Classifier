To add to that list, the New York Stock Exchange halted trading for several hours due to technical difficulties. With the NYSE's bump in the road earlier this week, we decided to check Quant Ratings for exchanges to buy.These are all exchanges where commodities, interest-rate contracts, bonds, stocks, and derivatives of these assets such as futures, ETFs, are traded. These exchanges earn a percentage of the volume of trades executed on the exchanges. Even though many started out as member-owned marketplaces, the exchanges now operate as for-profit publicly traded businesses. As such, they stand to gain extra revenue if they make available for trading new types of securities. So their going public has coincided with the proliferation of securities traded on these exchanges, domestically and internationally. They also generate revenues by leveraging their trading platforms for use by other exchanges in the U.S. and abroad. \nSo, what are the best exchanges investors should be buying? Here are the top four, according to TheStreet Ratings , TheStreet 's proprietary ratings tool. \nTheStreet Ratings projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and dividends. Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings.

NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. Rating: Buy, B Market Cap: $8.3 billion Year-to-date return: 2.6% \nThe NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. provides trading, clearing, exchange technology, regulatory, securities listing, information, and public company services worldwide. It operates in four segments: Market Services, Listing Services, Information Services, and Technology Solutions. \n\"We rate NASDAQ OMX GROUP INC (NDAQ) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its reasonable valuation levels, good cash flow from operations, solid stock price performance and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: Net operating cash flow has increased to $231.00 million or 26.22% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, NASDAQ OMX GROUP INC has also modestly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of 20.99%. Looking at where the stock is today compared to one year ago, we find that it is not only higher, but it has also clearly outperformed the rise in the S&P 500 over the same period, despite the company's weak earnings results. Turning our attention to the future direction of the stock, it goes without saying that even the best stocks can fall in an overall down market. However, in any other environment, this stock still has good upside potential despite the fact that it has already risen in the past year. NASDAQ OMX GROUP INC has experienced a steep decline in earnings per share in the most recent quarter in comparison to its performance from the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, NASDAQ OMX GROUP INC increased its bottom line by earning $2.39 versus $2.24 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($3.25 versus $2.39). NDAQ, with its decline in revenue, underperformed when compared the industry average of 7.0%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 4.5%. Weakness in the company's revenue seems to have hurt the bottom line, decreasing earnings per share.
