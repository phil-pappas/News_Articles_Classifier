In a mock interview with rapper Eminem, aka Marshall Mathers, Colbert advised, “You need to think 10 years down the line.” \nAs the rapper looked on in confusion, Colbert added, “You’ve just gotta make plans for when you just … when the dream dies. You know.” \n“I’m very serious,” he continued. “If you don’t have a retirement account by the time you’re 50, you’re dead in the water. There’s nothing to be done at that point. You’re a greeter at Wal-Mart WMT, -0.03% at that point.” \nThrough the humor, it is advice we can all heed. \nThe video is here (with the retirement discussion starting around the 27:18 mark). For the rest of us, retirement news and advice is just one click away .
