Its not at all possible for them to deliver without making huge losses. They must leave that space for the telecom companies,\" Mittal said at the IBM ThinkForum here.\n\nPayment banks will provide basic savings, deposit, payment and remittance services to people who currently do not have a bank account, including millions of migrant workers. Such banks will not lend money. Meanwhile, RBI has not said how many licences it will issue.\n\nMittal, Chairman of Bharti Enterprises, said telecom companies, with their huge network of stores, are well positioned to deliver services to help drive the government's financial inclusion agenda.\"We alone have 1.6 million outlets in the country...,\" he said.\n\nCiting examples from Kenya, where Vodafone's m-pesa is a dominant player, Mittal said almost the entire economy of the African nation is dependent on m-pesa (Vodafone) and it is more efficient to move money around and make payments.\n\n\"Technology exists (to make payments) in a very secure way, cost is a fraction of what banking industry can do, including micro finance,\" he said.\n\nPayment banks can offer payment and remittance services and issue ATM and debit cards, but not credit cards. They can also distribute simple financial products such as mutual fund units and insurance products, according to RBI.\n\nAccount balances in such banks will be limited to a maximum of Rs 1 lakh.\n\nMittal said the Reserve Bank has been taking \"measured\" steps and the central bank will process the applications early and allow mobile companies to participate in the financial inclusion initiatives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:10:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
