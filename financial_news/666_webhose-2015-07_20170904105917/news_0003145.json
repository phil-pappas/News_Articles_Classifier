Adjusted earnings translated into $1.98 per share, much below the $3.89 projected by analysts. \nThe investment bank had $1.45 billion in legal and regulatory costs, up from $284 million last year. \nRevenues slipped 0.6 percent to $9.07 billion, topping market estimates of $8.78 billion. \nGoldman cited mortgage-related litigation as a source of the elevated costs. Goldman is in talks with regulators to pay $2-3 billion to resolve issues related to the financial crisis, according to people familiar with the matter. \nGoldman reported a 28 percent drop in trading revenues for fixed income, currency and commodities to $1.6 billion. That was partially offset by a 63 percent rise in equity trading revenues to $787 million. \nRevenues in three of four Goldman's operating divisions rose. This included increases for financial advisory services amid strong merger and acquisition activity. \nRevenues also rose for both equity and debt underwriting. \n\"We are pleased with our performance for the quarter,\" said Goldman chief executive Lloyd Blankfein in a statement. \n\"While uncertainty in the EU weighed on investors' level of conviction, many of our businesses continued to benefit from generally improving economic conditions and healthy client activity.\" \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in Dow member Goldman fell 0.8 percent to $211.25 in pre-market trade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T16:01:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
