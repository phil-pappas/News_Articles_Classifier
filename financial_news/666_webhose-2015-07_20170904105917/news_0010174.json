Photo: Sam Bennett\n More and more young workers are choosing to switch out of industry superannuation funds and into the retail funds marketed to them directly by their bank, lured by the convenience of integrated online and mobile platforms.\nA new generation of retail funds marketed directly to banking clients by large financial institutions – namely BT Super for Life, ANZ Banking Group's Smart Choice Super and Commonwealth Bank of Australia's Essential Super – are \"punching above their weight\" in terms of attracting new members, opening close to 180,000 new accounts in the past year, according to the the largest annual survey of Australian super fund members.\nIf they become customers for life, like transactional banking customers have been, then these funds could transform the Australian superannuation space quite radically.\nIrene Guiamatsia, analyst National Australia Bank is the only one of the big four retail banks that does not have a \"direct to client\" super product. \"The banks have been very successful at using their retail banking channel to grow a base of young members,\" Investment Trends analyst Irene Guiamatsia said.\nThe report, titled Investment Trends 2015 Member Sentiment & Communications Report , found that one in 10 members switched super funds in the financial year ended June 30, 2015, the highest level of switching since 2010.\nAdvertisement About 1.5 million Australians switched super funds in the past year, Investment Trends estimates. The report, conducted from April to June 2014, is based on a survey of 16,049 super fund members.\nDirect to client funds attracted 12 per cent of all switchers, appealing to a youthful demographic with half of those who switched into one under 30.\n'Appealing' proposition \"BT Super for Life, ANZ Smart Choice and CBA Essential Super have all invested heavily over the past couple of years in their marketing campaigns using outdoor advertising, radio and television. But overwhelmingly the biggest driver of their success in gaining new accounts has been direct marketing to banking clients,\" Ms Guiamatsia said.\n\"The proposition of being able to view your super through the same log-on as your internet banking account has proven very appealing. If they become customers for life, like transactional banking customers have been, then these funds could transform the Australian superannuation space quite radically in the next few decades.\"\nThe trend looks set to continue. The proportion of people surveyed who said they \"definitely intended\" to switch funds in the year ahead increased to 5 per cent, up from 3 per cent in 2014.\nThe proportion of members using the internet who said they used a smartphone or a tablet to access information from their super fund was 20 per cent, up from 16 per cent in 2014. Another 12 per cent expect to start accessing their super account via a smartphone or tablet in the year ahead, up from 10 per cent last year.\n\"ANZ Smart Choice, Commonwealth Essential Super and Cbus are the undisputed leaders in uptake of mobile super platforms industry-wide, although, when it comes to satisfaction with the content delivered, ESSSuper, AMP and Cbus received the highest members' ratings,\" Ms Guiamatsia said.\n\"Mobile technology is becoming a powerful tool for driving engagement among younger members. Many funds now support mobile redirection and scalability of their website, but only a handful have a dedicated app.\"\nAustralianSuper reports third year of double digit returns As the non-profit super sector comes under increasing pressure to ramp up marketing and investment in new products and services to retain members, peak body Industry Super Australia is keener than ever to cite statistics that show the investment returns from industry super funds tend to outperform their retail rivals over the long term.\nOn Monday AustralianSuper, the nation's largest industry fund managing $90 billion on behalf of one in 10 working Australians, reported a return of 10.9 per cent from its balanced investment option for the financial year ended 30 June 2015. It was the third consecutive year of double digit investment returns from the option, in which more than 80 per cent of AustralianSuper's more than 2 million members are invested.\nSuper ratings agency Chant West has estimated the average return from super fund balanced investment options for the 2015 financial year will be 9.5 per cent. Meanwhile leading industry advisers Towers Watson have warned that average returns are likely to be closer to 5 per cent over the coming years .\n\"Superannuation is a long-term investment and members must be mindful of year-to-year fluctuations and remain focussed on the long term performance,\" AustralianSuper deputy chief executive and chief investment officer Mark Delaney said.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/warning-super-funds-likely-to-miss-longterm-return-targets-20150703-gi270a"], "published": "2015-07-06T17:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T00:58:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
