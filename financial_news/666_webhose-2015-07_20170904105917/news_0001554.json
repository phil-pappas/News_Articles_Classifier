He said follow-on public offers and capital infusion by the government are two ways to raise the capital. Last week, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan had said banks should have enough capital so that they can use a part of it for cleaning their balance sheets. \"The way to get out of financial stress is to address the problem early... and some of the banks may need some capital to do that. Hopefully this capital infusion will help,\" he had said. Earlier, Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha had said the government is assessing fund requirements of staterun banks over the next three years and will provide the required capital as part of a comprehensive package to strengthen them. \"We are working and trying to understand exactly what the capital requirements are going to be in the next 2-3 years for (public sector) banks,\" he had said, adding that the government has put in place a comprehensive package to strengthen them, which involves governance changes relating to role of MDs, the board and the like. For the current fiscal, the government has allocated Rs 7,940 crore in the Budget for capital infusion in state-owned banks but it has pledged to provide more this year. Last month, after the annual performance review of PSBs, Finance Minister Arun Jaitely had said that there was \"merit\" in the case presented by public sector banks for additional capital infusion and the government will seriously look into it. \"The final decision on the issue would be taken by the Cabinet,\" he had said. Finance Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi has said that the government aims to infuse about $3 billion in the current year and $9 billion next year. Sinha along with senior officials of the finance ministry has reviewed the presentations made by banks on their capital needs.
