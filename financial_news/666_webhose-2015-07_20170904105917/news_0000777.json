Photo: New York Times\nRejection hurts. But proving someone wrong can be equally sweet. Just ask the founders of Airbnb.\nIn June 2008, an American entrepreneur named Brian Chesky was formulating an idea for a website that would basically serve as a marketplace for accommodation: people could advertise rooms or entire houses on the site that others could rent at rates more affordable than hotels.\nAs you probably know, that site is Airbnb, and today it's one of the hottest start-ups on earth with a multi-billion valuation to boot.\nAirbnb chief Brian Chesky was willing to sell a 10 per cent stake in his company for $150,000 in 2008 - it is now valued at around $US25b. Photo: Medium.com\nBack then, Chesky needed $150,000 to fund his fledgling operation, and he was prepared to give up 10 per cent of the company to secure it (valuing his company at $1.5 million).\nThrough a well connected friend, Chesky was introduced to seven \"prominent investors in Silicon Valley\", he recounted on the blogging site Medium on Monday morning (AEDT). As Chesky explained in the post, two didn't even bother to respond. The other five replied with short emails with words to the effect of \"thanks but no thanks\" - as an excerpt of these (incredibly patronising) responses shows.\nChesky's message to entrepreneurs? \"Next time you have an idea and it gets rejected, I want you to think of this email\", he writes in the blog post.\nSilicon Valley was not impressed by Airbnb ... at first. Photo: Medium.com\nThe maths around start-up valuations is notoriously dubious , but it is clear that the investors who said no thanks to Airbnb in 2008 missed out on an absolutely incredible investment opportunity. Last month Airbnb raised a further $1.5 billion in funds, at a reported valuation of around $25 billion. So in simple terms (the reality is a bit more complex), 10 per cent of of Airbnb in 2008 would have cost $150,000. Today 10 per cent of the company would be worth up to $2.5 billion.", "external_links": ["https://medium.com/@bchesky/7-rejections-7d894cbaa084", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-17/the-fuzzy-insane-math-that-s-creating-so-many-billion-dollar-tech-companies", "http://recode.net/2015/06/28/capital-gains-airbnbs-billion-and-a-half-dollar-funding-round-and-more/"], "published": "2015-07-13T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:55:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
