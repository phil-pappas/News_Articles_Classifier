Both the government and Europeans had brought the country to a stalemate, he argued, as he was asked to move over. He said they were too young to remember what the country was like when the drachma was in circulation before Greece adopted the euro in 2001.\nWith the country’s place in the euro now at stake after a lifeline that kept it afloat since 2010 expired and the banks closed to stem deposit outflows, some hoped that voting for “no” wouldn’t mean an exit.\nVoting “no” to a set of budget cuts and tax increases after five years of harsh austerity may at least pave the way for a different solution, said Marios, 29, who works in the shipping industry.\n‘Better Future’ “I think it will bring better days,” he said. “Things will be difficult for us, whether we vote ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ But at least our children may have a better chance. We have to stop being slaves to the demands of the European Union, and the International Monetary Fund,” he said referring to the two institutions, which along with the European Central Bank make up the country’s international creditors.\nOurania, 32, a graduate of the London School of Economics who works as a consultant for small businesses, said she was also planning to vote “no” before she headed into a voting booth in Halandri.\n“My logic and fear tell me to vote ‘yes’,” she said. “But I’m voting ‘no’ because I think that even a small rupture is worth the risk for a better future.”\nIn a sign of the split that the vote has caused among the population, she asked for her last name not to be used because of family concerns. “I went to the ‘yes’ rally with my husband who is voting ‘yes’. There is a lot of tension within families right now but I hope it will blow over from Monday.”\nTwo women were in a discussion outside the same polling station, still trying to make up their mind minutes before they headed inside.\nBailout Extension “I can’t decide whether to vote ‘yes’ or ‘no’,” said Stavroula, 35, who has been unemployed for about one and a half years. “‘Yes’ will just prolong the same unbearable situation. And ‘no’, what does that mean? I don’t even know what ‘no’ means.”\nShe said she hadn’t read the documents accompanying the referendum question, two drafts on proposed aid terms and an analysis on the country’s debt that were proposed by the creditors for an extension of the bailout that has since expired.\n“This vote is a test of our collective IQ,” said Hara Nikolou, a retired biochemist who lives in the island of Serifos, before casting her “yes” vote. “If our society opts to turn this country into Balkan wasteland, I don’t want to continue living here.”\nYannis, 33, who lets rooms to tourists on this Cycladic island, was worried that the damage to the country’s tourism industry would be irreversible if “no” prevails.\n‘Breathing Space’ “Until last week, reservations were even better than last year’s record,” he said as he sipped his iced coffee at a cafe at the port of Serifos. “Now, everyone is canceling.”\nHe said that he voted “yes” because it will give the country some “breathing space, a life extension.”\nThe mood appeared to be leaning more in favor of a “no” vote among people questioned at the working class suburb of Petropouli, west of Athens.\n“This is a historical chance for Greek people to stand against the euro zone, the EU and the IMF,” said Nikos, a 26-year-old data analyst who didn’t want to give his last name. “Right now that’s the fight. We are saying no to more austerity.”\nKostas Panazios, 50, a teacher in a cafe across the road from the polling station in Petroupoli, said most of his friends and family are voting ‘no.’\n“We love Greece and our history. The government will get a better deal this way,” he said.\nOthers were still unconvinced, saying that the country was doomed no matter how they voted.\n“Tell me which kind of poverty to chose,” Dimitris Thivaios, a 63-year-old pensioner asked his friend Kyriakos Perrakis, a gardener, back in the Halandri polling station.\n“Well, do you want to be killed once off by a meat cleaver or you want to have your skin peeled off bit by bit?” Perrakis answered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T15:47:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
