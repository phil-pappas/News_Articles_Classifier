But in any case, he said: \"We are saying that we cannot go to our board unless we have a solution to this problem.\" \n\"We are asking the Greeks to do very, very difficult things. We are asking the Europeans to do things that are very, very difficult for them also.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:57:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
