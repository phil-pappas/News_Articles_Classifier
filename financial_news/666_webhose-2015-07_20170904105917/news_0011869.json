While freelancing provides a great degree of flexibility in how you work, it also provides none of the traditional benefits Americans have become accustomed to, including retirement. That's all up to you. So how do you go about saving for retirement when you don't have a \"real job?\" \nYou Have Many of the Same Options As Traditional Employees... \n\"What a lot of people probably don't know is that even when you're self-employed , you can set up the same accounts companies set up,\" says Craig Brimhall, vice president of retirement Wealth Strategies with Ameriprise. Your options include SEPs , 401(k) plans , profit-sharing plans and IRAs. \"Basically anything a corporation can set up, you can set up.\" \nIn fact, Brimhall says that one of the problems you might encounter is the sheer number of options. \"The menu has been so enlarged, and that's what it makes it tough,\" he says. He divides retirement plans for freelancers into two broad categories: profit-sharing plans that offer lots of flexibility in terms of contributions and plans that allow for virtually no flexibility, which are usually defined benefit plans. \nHow Much Do You Need to Say... \nBrimhall says that if you save 10% of your income starting with your first job, you're probably going to have adequate money for retirement . In fact, if you save 10% early on, you're probably going to have more money than someone who saves a higher percentage of their income, but at a much later point in their life. \"You have more time to save,\" he says, adding that \" the numbers get really difficult when you wait too long .\" \nIn fact, Brimhall says there are two benefits to saving early and often. The first is the compound interest , which is going to leave you with a pile of money, even when you don't save that much of your income. The other is the financial discipline that comes along with saving a chunk of your income. \"There's always reasons not to save, whatever age you're at,\" he says. But when you start early, you're used to living on less, which is going to make it easier to live on less as you get older and closer to retirement. \nWhat Are Retirement Accounts For?... 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T21:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T12:03:53.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
