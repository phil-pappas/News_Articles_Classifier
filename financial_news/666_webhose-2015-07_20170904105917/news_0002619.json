Financial advisers were responsible for just 7 per cent of new industry super fund ­clients last year.\nThe research, released on Thursday, also found “tied” financial advisers are increasingly recommending in-house products, despite reforms to ensure recommendations are only in the best interest of clients.\nIt found 77 per cent of clients who went to an adviser owned by one of the big financial groups were placed in an in-house super fund or product, compared with 76 per cent the previous year and 75 per cent in 2012.\nWestpac and BT Group had the highest proportion of clients directed to in-house super funds at 82.4 per cent, up from 79 per cent the previous year. However, the Commonwealth Bank and CFS group advisers had the biggest increase at 71 per cent, up from 64 per cent.\n“Despite the financial advice reforms, financial planners associated with the big financial groups are still more likely to recommend their own products,’’ Roy Morgan spokesman Norman Morris said on Thursday.\nAccording to independent researchers Chant West and SuperRatings, industry funds have outperformed retail funds in almost every time period during the past 15 years.\n Advisers still push in-house products", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/financial-advisers-recommending-retail-super-fund-despite-reforms/story-e6frf7jo-1227435832008"], "published": "2015-07-10T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T05:28:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
