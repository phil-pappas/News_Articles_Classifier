He wants to help the workers, the poor people . . . but the creditors will not let him.\"\nSwept to power in January by Greeks tired and angry after five years of punishing austerity, Mr Tsipras promised an end to cost-cutting and the legislative oversight from the EU, ECB and IMF, together with a repeal of measures taken by previous governments that slashed public sector jobs and wages.\nAris Messinis | AFP | Getty Images Municipality employees shout slogans against the Greek Government in front of the Greek Parliament during a demonstration as Greek lawmakers prepared to vote late Wednesday on a controversial new austerity package involving a huge shake-up of the civil service with thousands of jobs on the line. Those hopes ended in the early hours of Monday morning after 17 hours of bruising negotiations in Brussels, when Greece's prime minister agreed to the most intrusive reform and austerity program ever demanded by the EU in exchange for cash to keep his county from going bankrupt and exiting the euro zone.\nMr Tsipras will on Wednesday evening seek parliamentary approval for the exacting terms required for the international bailout, despite fierce opposition from more than half of Syriza's central committee - who have signed a letter decrying the deal as a \"coup\".\nMore from the FT Merkel's tough tactics prompt criticism in Germany and abroad\nTsipras wins Greek vote backing bailout\nThe end of an affair for France and Germany\nYanis Varoufakis, Mr Tsipras' former finance minister, said it was akin to \"a new Versailles Treaty\", a reference to the onerous settlement imposed on Germany after its defeat in first world war, while Panagiotis Lafazanis, Greece's energy minister, said it was \"unworthy of being credited to a radical party like Syriza\".\nThe sacked Mr Alexiou, 34, was just one of thousands of former public sector employees who had put their faith in Syriza to get them back to work.\nLena Economou, a former president of a trade union that represents public sector cleaners, spent months camped outside the ministry demanding they be reinstated - even sleeping in a tent on the pavement some nights.\n\"Syriza supported us a huge amount. They lobbied for us in parliament even before they were in power,\" she says.\nHer fight looked to have paid off when the government on July 1 agreed to give 200 government cleaners she represents their jobs back, at least until the end of the year.\nBut the new measures have ripped up that decision. \"[The deal] is very, very bad . . . We have been thrown to the garbage,\" she says. \"We feel like we are the lowest category of people in Greece.\"\nUnder pressure from its creditors, Greece between 2010-14 cut 280,000 public sector jobs and slashed salaries, reducing the total headcount by about 30 per cent and the wage bill to 15.8 billion euros from more than €25bn previously.\nMost of the job losses were those on fixed-term contracts, such as cleaners and administrative staff. Their positions were often taken by people hired through outsourcing companies or third-party employers.\nSitting in front of a large banner comparing their treatment to the crucifixion of Jesus, Mr Alexiou and Ms Economou voted \"No\" in last week's referendum on whether to accept a more lenient austerity package proposed by creditors.\nThat position was supported by 62 per cent of Greeks, including the tens of thousands who took to central Athens that evening to celebrate their rebellion against EU leaders who are despised by average Greeks.\nBut despite Mr Tsipras' apparent volte-face, with his acceptance of a tougher deal, the prime minister retains the support of the majority of Greeks, many of whom are more afraid of losing the euro than they are of further austerity.\n\"We hope Syriza will look after us,\" says Ms Economou, clutching the crucifix that hangs around her neck. \"As long as I live, I hope.\"\nAdditional reporting by Eleftheria Kourtali", "external_links": ["http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d533aa6e-2afe-11e5-8613-e7aedbb7bdb7.html#axzz3g2uYSSh1", "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/08728bce-2a42-11e5-acfb-cbd2e1c81cca.html", "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/db4d2f04-2b05-11e5-8613-e7aedbb7bdb7.html"], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T23:19:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
