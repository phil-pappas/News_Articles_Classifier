But products that communicate only with a single authenticated server allow the company that owns the server to compile a raft of information about the user, increasing privacy concerns, Weaver said. \nEd Skoudis, an expert in securing connected devices, said the fact that the recall came so soon after publication of the FCA cybersecurity issue \"is a shot across the bow of other IoT manufacturers that this could cost them a lot of money.\" \nThe recalled vehicles include some of the top-selling FCA products including the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Cherokee SUVs from model years 2014 and 2015 and 2015 Dodge Challenger sports coupes, among others (Eduardo Munoz/Reuters) \nSkoudis said he hoped companies would reconsider what they spend on security earlier in the design process in order to avoid similar recalls, lawsuits and the threat of increased regulation. \nAutomakers have until now sought to play down the threat that hackers could gain control of a vehicle using a wireless connection. While hackers had previously demonstrated the ability to tamper with on-board systems using a physical connection to the car's diagnostic system, the researchers were able to control the Jeep Cherokee remotely. \nU.S.-traded shares of Fiat Chrysler closed 2.5 per cent lower at $15.15 on Friday. \nThe NHTSA and members of Congress have expressed concern about the security of Internet-connected vehicle control systems. \nTwo Democratic Senators introduced a bill on Tuesday that would direct the NHTSA to develop standards for isolating critical software and detect hacking as it occurs. \n\"We have said that cars today are essentially computers on wheels, and the last thing drivers should have to worry about is some hacker along for the ride,\" Fred Upton, the Republican chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the committee's ranking Democrat, Frank Pallone Jr of New Jersey, said in a statement on Friday. \nSome carmakers, including BMW (Swiss: BMW.SW - news ) and Tesla Motors Inc (Xetra: A1CX3T - news ) , can update car software over the air, as Apple Inc (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) does with its phones. But others do not, and the Senate bill would not require that. \nThe recalled vehicles include some of the top-selling FCA products including the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Cherokee SUVs from model years 2014 and 2015 and 2015 Dodge Challenger sports coupes, among others. \nFCA said it would mail a memory stick to affected customers to upgrade vehicle software and add security. A spokeswoman for FCA said the USB sticks would be mailed to customers \"as soon as possible.\" \nThe company also said it had already deployed a fix with its telecommunications provider to block remote access of the kind the researchers used. \nFCA declined to comment beyond the statement it issued on the recall. The company did not respond to queries on whether the USB devices to be mailed to customers are on hand or have to be manufactured. \nAn NHTSA official said the investigation would also look at \"how quickly they (FCA) are able to complete the recall.\" \nIn broad terms, \"this is another example of a problem with an embedded system, some computer that is something that is not really a computer from a user perspective but is built to make something else work,\" said Steven Bellovin, a professor of computer science at Columbia University. \"I suspect we're going to need some kind of regulatory frameworks.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T18:25:46.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
