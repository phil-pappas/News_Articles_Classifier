The company, controlled by real estate investment firm Colony Capital and Qatar Holding, a unit of the Gulf State’s sovereign wealth fund, is interviewing banks, the people said.\nThe film industry is experiencing a resurgence, with 2015 expected to be a record year at the box office. Investment in the sector, which ebbed during the financial crisis and after, is returning. The proliferation of digital platforms such as Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc. has also led to increased demand for content.\nMiramax’s owners may be betting that the company’s high-quality film library, which includes titles including “No Country for Old Men” and “Good Will Hunting,” will be attractive to potential buyers.\nInvestor Group In 2010, an investor group including Ron Tutor, Qatar Holding and Colony Capital purchased Miramax for $660 million from Walt Disney Co. Tutor later sold his stake to Qatar Holding. Thomas Barrack Jr., founder and chairman of Colony Capital, is also chairman of Miramax.\nMiramax has already had discussions with at least one potential buyer, one of the people said.\nThe studio was founded in 1979 by brothers Harvey Weinstein and Bob Weinstein. The Weinstein brothers, who left in 2005 when the company was owned by Disney, reconnected with Miramax in 2013 to produce and distribute films and TV shows based on the studio’s library content. They now run The Weinstein Co., a New York-based film studio.\nDisney bought Miramax from the Weinsteins in 1993.\nKat Kleiner, a spokeswoman for Miramax, declined to comment. Kristin Celauro, a spokeswoman for Colony Capital, declined to comment. A representative for Qatar Holding didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside regular business hours.", "external_links": ["http://www.miramax.com/\\", "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/business/media/weinsteins-to-reunite-with-miramax.html?_r=0\\"], "published": "2015-07-18T04:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:33:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
