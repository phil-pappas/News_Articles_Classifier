I diligently went to visit five financial advisers and was horrified with the resulting advice which, for the record, was to sell my direct shares and properties and buy managed funds. I did not follow the advice.\nOne of the core reasons in establishing a self-managed super fund is to increase control and to gain flexibility in how your superannuation is invested. Secondary objectives are lower fees and higher returns. No one wants to pay someone to manage their money if they can't add value and many of my clients rather cynically tell me that if someone is going to lose them money it may as well be them!\nBut the real problem was illustrated to me at last weekend's Retirement and Lifestyle Expo in Sydney. I asked the crowd, \"How many of you have a financial adviser?\" About 20 per cent of the audience raised their hands.\nI then asked, \"How many of you are cynical about the financial advice profession?\" The remaining 80 per cent of attendees somewhat enthusiastically raised their hands.\nWho can blame them in the current environment, where many of our major financial institutions are being rapped over the knuckles. It's difficult to find someone you can trust.\nMy final question to the crowd at the expo was: \"Who would take advice if they knew they could trust the person they would get it from?\" Nearly everyone raised their hands. In all fairness, I didn't ask at what cost, but I'll assume they'd like advice at a reasonable cost for a reasonable return.\nThe key issue is that Australians are desperate for good advice but lack trust. With the take-up of transition to retirement strategies at only 7 per cent and with a relatively poor understanding of the contribution laws, withdrawal rules and investment regulations on super, never before have we seen such a clear need for good advice.\nLet's face it, the tax legislation and the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act are not an exciting reading. Therefore, most SMSF trustees don't know and are not expected to know all the rules and regulations with respect to tax, investing and superannuation. Many advisers and accountants miss the mark, too.\n Where to go The SMSF Association suggested that about 60 per cent of SMSF trustees get their financial advice from the media. Only about 20 per cent of the population has a financial adviser and more than 90 per cent have an accountant to do their tax returns and administration. Costs generally should be between about $2000 and $3500 a year, including the audit. If you're paying more for your tax, you're probably paying too much. Financial advice will be additional and in the vicinity of between 1 and 2 per cent of funds under advice.\nSo where do you go for your advice? Here are a few resources to help you.\nBecome familiar with the Australian Taxation Office's website as a first port of call. R unning a Self-managed Super Fund and Thinking About Self-managed Super are free booklets downloaded from the website. I urge you to read them so you understand the operation and obligations of your fund. You will note the compliance obligations sit with you and not your accountant or adviser – it's the trustees who will be fined if the fund is not compliant.\nWhile you're at the website, check out the new videos the ATO has recently added to help you understand your SMSF better.\nAnother great resource is the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) consumer website, moneysmart.gov.au . The website has endless tips on scams to look out for, questions to ask financial advisers, licence searches and calculators to help you understand your investments and advisers.\nWith respect to investments, I'd visit the ASX website and download some of their free materials on subjects such as shares, exchange-traded funds, instalment warrants and listed investment companies. They also have educational resources that will help you augment your understanding of markets and products.\nIf pension age is approaching, then the Department of Human Services website is an essential destination. You'll find a host of information on the age pension assets test, income test, deeming, gifting, health cards and calculators. You should also call 13 23 00 and see a financial information service officer to see how they can help you maximise your age pension.\nThese are just some of the basic resources at your fingertips. There are many more, not to mention all the corporate newsletters, software providers and share trading platforms. If all else fails, find a trusted adviser or accountant – and hold on tight when you find them.", "external_links": ["http://www.moneysmart.gov.au/"], "published": "2015-07-27T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:52:17.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
