At the same time, outflows from municipal mutual funds swelled to $1.2 billion in the week through July 1, the most in 18 months, according to Lipper US Fund Flow data.\n``It&apos;s a very interesting dynamic: you&apos;ve seen successive weeks of outflows,&apos;&apos; and yet yields have dropped, said Jeff Lipton, head of municipal research in New York at Oppenheimer & Co. ``We&apos;ve seen a flight to quality, and a lot of that has to do with Greece.&apos;&apos;\nPuerto Rico Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla&apos;s abrupt announcement last week that he wants to restructure the junk-rated commonwealth&apos;s debt coincided with an escalating crisis in Greece. The euro-zone tension sent investors into safer assets, with 10-year U.S. Treasury yields plunging 0.15 percentage point on June 29, the most in three months. The highest-quality state and local debt also rallied.\nAbout 40 percent of the fund outflows last week were from high-yield funds, which are the most likely to hold Puerto Rico&apos;s bonds. Commonwealth securities have plunged 7.2 percent since June 26, the last trading day before Garcia Padilla&apos;s announcement, S&P Dow Jones Indices data show.\n The ratio of 10-year muni interest rates to those of Treasuries, a measure of relative value, is about 102 percent, up from 97 percent on June 26. A higher figure signals tax-free bonds have weakened relative to their federal counterparts.", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iI15yLcM3DnY/v1/460x260.jpg\\"], "published": "2015-07-09T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:45:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
