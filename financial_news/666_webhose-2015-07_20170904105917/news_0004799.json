The losses were only staunched by strict government measures introduced last week to prevent a meltdown. \nThe positive sentiment lifted US traders. The Nasdaq surged 1.26 percent to a new record, the Dow rose 0.39 percent and the S&P 500 gained 0.80 percent. \nOn oil markets US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for August rose 21 cents to $51.12 a barrel, while Brent for September, a new contract, advanced 24 cents to $57.16. \nGold fetched $1,143.97 compared with $1,144.42 late Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T05:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T06:40:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
