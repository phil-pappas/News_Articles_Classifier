We decided to keep our production at 30 million barrels a day, the same as before. We are not ready to reduce our production,\" Badri said after a meeting in Moscow with Russia's energy minister. \nOil prices recently dropped to their lowest levels in months on the back of concerns over a global oversupply. \nThe fall followed a recovery in prices after a steep slump last year. Prices continued a slight rebound on Thursday following reports of a drop in US stockpiles. \nOPEC and Russia said in a joint statement after Thursday's talks that indicators pointed to a possible \"more balanced situation on the oil market and its stabilisation\" in 2016. \nAnalysts have said that the return of oil from Iran following the landmark nuclear energy deal with world powers this month could create fresh tensions within OPEC. \nThe accord paves the way for the removal of sanctions and the gradual return of Iranian oil to the global market next year. \nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries -- whose 12 members including Iran pump one third of global oil -- is mindful that Iranian oil could worsen a global supply glut and depress oil prices further. \nBadri, however, insisted that OPEC welcomed the lifting of sanctions on Iran and would be able to cope with any increased volumes. \n\"We are really happy that sanctions are on their way to be over for Iran. Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) we don't have any country under sanctions in our organisation,\" he told journalists. \n\"I think the quantity that is in question, I think our group will accommodate them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T19:16:56.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
