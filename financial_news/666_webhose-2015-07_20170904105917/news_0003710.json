The sting of 2008 still hurts, however, and more than half (54%) of affluent investors are concerned about losing money again due to market turbulence, according to a new Wells Fargo Affluent Investor survey conducted by Harris Poll. The survey, which focused on investors between the ages of 30 and 75 who have $250,000 or more in investable assets outside of their retirement and property holdings, highlights the vacillating investor psychology that swings from greed to fear, assuredness to timidity. \nMen are more likely than women to report confidence in their ability to navigate investment choices. Nearly half (49%) of affluent women do not trust themselves to manage their own investments during uncertain market conditions. An expert opinion, as such, can go a long way in boosting confidence. \"A financial advisor's ability to recognize and acknowledge a client's natural response to market volatility is the key to making sure that rational perspective prevails, and that's something that investors say they appreciate,\" said Joe Nadreau, head of innovation and strategy for Wells Fargo Advisors. With a median investment portfolio of $450,000, two-thirds of affluent investors turn to their advisor as a trusted source for financial guidance. \nTechnology has become more important to the investment advisory process, but three-quarters of affluent investors say that automated investment advisory services (robo-advisors) could never take the place of their financial advisor. \"While investors recognize that technological tools are important and they're willing to embrace them, an advisor's ability to relate to a client on a human level adds a dimension that online tools alone can't match,\" Nadreau said. Many affluent investors are interested in using online tools, but only with the help of their financial advisor.
