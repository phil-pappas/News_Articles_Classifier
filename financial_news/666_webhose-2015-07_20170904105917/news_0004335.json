Bloomberg Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Joe Hockey has declared \"game over\" on plans to expand the GST after Victorian Labor Premier Daniel Andrews reiterated that he would not be supporting any increase to the rate or broadening of the base.\nThe Treasurer used a speech in Melbourne on Wednesday to urge the states to consider raising extra revenue as part of a federal government push for them to fully fund services which they administer, primarily public schools and hospitals.\nMr Hockey mentioned the GST and the imposition of property taxes as two of the more obvious avenues but stressed again the federal government would not move on the GST unless it had the support of federal Labor and every state and territory government.\nFollowing Mr Andrews' comments, the Treasurer said he would waste no more effort arguing for a tax change from which the Commonwealth would not be a direct beneficiary, as all the GST revenue goes to the states.\n\"The federal government is not going to be arguing for a tax change that the beneficiary doesn't actually want,\" he told the PwC lunch following his speech.\n\"If the beneficiary of the reform doesn't want it, it's effectively game over.\"\nWestern Australian Premier Colin Barnett said on Wednesday he would not even contemplate changes to the GST unless his state received at least 50c in every dollar it paid.\n\"Unless that is agreed by the Commonwealth and the other states there won't be changes to the GST,\" he said.\n Mr Barnett also killed off any prospect of a property tax along the lines of that in operation in the ACT which has seen rates almost double in three years.\n\"I don't support that. A broader property tax means a tax on the family home. That's not in the interests of this country or this state. I don't think anyone in Australia would want their family home taxed as has been proposed,\" he said.\nMr Hockey further poured cold water on changing the GST, saying broadening the base or lifting the rate was the \"lazy approach to tax reform\".\nHe said the GST was already under threat from the increasing mobility of goods and services.\nNo silver bullet Earlier Wednesday, Mr Hockey told ABC TV that if the GST were to be increased, low and middle-income earners would require compensation and the federal budget could not afford that.\n\"The silver bullet in tax reform is not increasing or broadening the GST, it's about having a considered approach to the entire tax base,\" he said.\n\"If you were to increase the GST and the benefit went to the states, the commonwealth would have to find the money to compensate people.\"\nShadow finance minister Tony Burke said a GST increase would have to be \"massive\" to replace withdrawn federal funding in schools and hospitals.\nThe states and the Commonwealth are committed to applying the GST to imports valued at less that $1000 and bought over the internet.\nMr Hockey said that as a result of consultations with the United Kingdom and a number of other jurisdictions he believes it is possible to collect the revenue using OECD methodology and that will be rubber stamped when he meets the state treasurers in August.\nHe was more favourable disposed towards the imposition of property taxes. The ACT is reducing stamp and insurance duties while increasing rates and other property taxes.\nPrime Minster Tony Abbott, who will meet the Premiers next week at a two-day summit called to try and find solutions to funding schools and hospitals, declined to engage on either the GST or property taxes, saying \"what the states do is a matter for the states.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-15T12:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:58:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
