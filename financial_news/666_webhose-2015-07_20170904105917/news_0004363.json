So we go to where the people are, provide them with convenience in banking, we provide them with the safest way to keep their money and we pay the highest interest rate on savings,” he stated. \nMr. Manu spoke to Luv Biz at the opening of the KNUST office of Gold Coast Fund Management, a member of the Groupe Ndoum. \nNii Quartey Niiquaye, General Manager at Groupe Ndoum in charge of regulated investment companies, says the company has a development objective to give Ghanaians financial freedom with options to choose qualitative investing and savings. \nAccording to him, there could be no better time to invest than now. \n“I do think it’s a good time to invest; in terms of investing in equities, people should always invest for the long term and I think that the stock market is the best chance for them to get the best out of returns for the long,” he said. “If you are investing for income, treasury bills rates are 25 percent on a three months basis and there are lots of fixed deposit accounts there are paying over 30 percent.” \nStory by Kofi Adu Domfeh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T13:38:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
