(AP) - A 10-member Vermont panel is going to be meeting for the first time to work out issues related to the siting of solar power projects.\nOn Tuesday, the Solar Siting Task Force will begin the process of looking at the design, siting, and regulatory review of solar electric generation facilities.\nThe panel was created as part of a comprehensive energy bill passed this year. It's designed to address concerns raised by some municipalities and others about the fast growth of solar power projects around Vermont.\nThe panel will report back to the General Assembly with proposed legislation and provide the rationale for any proposals it makes.\nThe Tuesday session is slated to be held from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. at the Department of Public Service in Montpelier.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
