Gippsland Times by Phillip Coorey Primrose Riordan A belated apology by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Bronwyn Bishop, and her pledge to repay more travel expenses has done little to quell the political brawl and left Coalition MPs facing the prospect of voting in Parliament to ensure she keeps her job.\nAfter almost three weeks of refusing to apologise or answer questions over mounting reports of various travel claims, Ms Bishop said she acted within the guidelines but it \"just doesn't look right\".\n\"I want to apologise to the Australian people because I feel I've really let them down. I won't be resigning but I will be working very hard to ensure I mean my apology to the Australian people.\"\nMrs Bishop accepted she should have said sorry three weeks ago. The Labor opposition dismissed the apology and will continue with a no-confidence motion in her on Tuesday, August 11. Parliament resumes on August 10 but proceedings will be suspended out of respect for a West Australian MP, Don Randall, who died suddenly last week.\nIf the no-confidence motion is passed, Mrs Bishop would have to stand down as Speaker. Coalition MPs, many of whom are livid at the reputational damage caused to the government by her, will have to vote to save her.\n\"Mrs Bishop is apologising to save her job. Mrs Bishop is not apologising because she understands she's done anything wrong,\" Labor leader Bill Shorten said.\nPosition 'untenable' \"Australians know, a lot of her colleagues know, and Labor believes that her position as Speaker is untenable.\"\n Mrs Bishop has repaid, with a penalty, the $5200 cost of a helicopter she took from Melbourne to Geelong for a Liberal Party fundraiser. On Thursday she agreed to repay several hundred dollars she claimed to attend weddings of two colleagues.\nIn both latter instances she claimed the trips were associated with official business in her then-capacity as chairwoman of a parliamentary committee.\nMs Bishop said she had asked the Department of Finance to audit all her travel records. This was done on the order of Prime Minster Tony Abbott who, for the third day in a row, avoided the media and avoided being asked about the issue.\nParliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer said the department's findings would be made public. Departmental secretary Jane Halton, who on the weekend was reported as dismissing the story as based on sexism, declined to comment on Thursday.\nLiberal sources said Mrs Bishop's defiance and Mr Abbott's decision to stand by her would ensure the issue continued to interfere with the government's messages and overshadow the resumption of Parliament.\n\"Bronwyn Bishop and Labor are setting the agenda,\" the source said. \"The government is not in control of the national conversation. It's becoming a referendum on the Prime Minister's management.\"\nIf Ms Bishop resigned or was removed, it would provide Mr Abbott with a trigger to reshuffle his frontbench in the lead-up to the next election. Defence Minister Kevin Andrews is the name most mentioned as likely replacement Speaker although he was only recently appointed after David Johnston was sacked, and has a white paper to deliver.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:08:51.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
