Nevertheless, we are leaving value on the table and a new approach is required,” Mr McFarlane said on Wednesday. \n“As a group, if we aspire to bring shareholder returns forward, we need to be much more focused on what is attractive, what we are good at, and where we are good at it.\" \nBarclays established a non-core unit last year, into which it placed a broad range of loans and businesses accounting for more than £100bn of risk-weighted assets. \nIt has since sold a number of them, including its retail operations in Spain, which were acquired by CaixaBank (Other OTC: CAIXY - news ) , the country’s third-biggest lender, last year. \nThat deal incurred a substantial writedown for Barclays, underlining the turbulent state of much of the Eurozone’s banking sector. \nAllies of Mr Jenkins said after his departure was announced that he had been surprised by the board’s decision, particularly because Mr McFarlane had signalled that there would no change in the company’s strategy. \nThey acknowledged that there had been tensions between Mr Jenkins and Tom King, who runs Barclays’ investment bank, over the poor returns generated by the division. \n“It is easy to forget just how bad things were three years ago both for our industry and even more so for us,” Mr Jenkins said. \n“I am very proud of the significant progress we have made since then. Our capital position is much stronger, our business model is more balanced, we are much more disciplined on cost management, we have made good progress in rebuilding our reputation and we are seen as a leader in the application of technology to our business. \nA number of candidates to replace Mr Jenkins are already the subject of City speculation, including Barclays’ finance director, Tushar Morzaria. \nMr McFarlane said it was important to make “the right decision, not a quick one”. \nBarclays declined to comment on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T13:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T15:31:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
