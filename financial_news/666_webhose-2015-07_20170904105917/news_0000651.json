Jessica Shapiro Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe The US S&P 500 rose about 8 per cent over the last 12 months, outperforming the developed and emerging market averages.\nYet many money managers on Wall Street struggle to see how US stock indexes can rise much further from here, given stock prices are hovering close to all-time record highs.\nThe Federal Reserve's looming first rate rise in almost a decade is front and centre in the minds of investors, who have also been keeping a nervous eye on Greece's debt negotiations .\nFed watchers are tipping that Janet Yellen will probably begin to tighten rates from September, with December the other favoured possibility.\nWhether it is a gentle gradual tightening, as Yellen has pledged, or more rapid rate rises in the event that wages and inflation spike, will heavily influence the direction of the share market.\nHistorically, Wall Street has not suffered when the Fed embarks on a rate tightening cycle. That is the lesson from the Fed's last three tightening cycles in 1994, 1999 and 2004.\n\"History suggests that while Wall Street usually reacts negatively within the first few months of the start of a Fed tightening cycle, stocks are usually higher within 6 to 12 months,\" said David Bassanese, chief economist at BetaShares Capital.\n\"It is only in the latter stages of the tightening cycle – when interest rates become restrictive – that stocks can often tip into bear market territory.\"\n The difference this time around is that rates will be taking off from an unprecedented artificially low level – zero .\nRates about nought Rates have been about nought since late 2008, so there is bound to be some disturbance across financial markets when they start to rise.\nBond investors are probably the most exposed, given the exuberance in the issuance of high-yield paper in the ultra loose monetary policy environment. Bond yields and prices are inversely related, so when rates rise, the face-value of bonds fall.\nAny knock on effect on shares is uncertain. Investors are already bailing out of higher yielding stocks like utilities and real estate investment trusts, in preparation for higher rates.\nOne school of thought is that gyrations in bond markets will cascade through to equities and cause the first 10 per cent US share market correction in four years.\nThe cost of borrowing will rise, making repayments more difficult for highly leveraged companies struggling with cash flows.\nOn the other hand, more bullish analysts believe equities investors could take the Fed tightening in their stride.\n\"One reason why Fed tightening may not rattle the US stock market is that the price of equity is currently low compared to that of debt,\" Capital Economics said.\nStock prices not overly expensive \"Bond yields could rise significantly in response to tighter monetary policy without making the prospective return on equities appear unreasonably low.\"\nRelative to uber expensive bonds, stock prices do not appear overly expensive.\nStill, the absolute price level of shares is indisputably high. The Shiller cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio stands at 27, well above its average of 16. However, it is below the peak of 44 recorded during the technology dotcom bubble in 2000.\nWells Fargo Securities is one of the more upbeat investment houses, outlining a 12-month fair value S&P 500 estimate of 2222 points. It is overweight technology, health care, materials and industrials and underweight financials, telecom and discretionary stocks.\nFor such a positive scenario to play out, Deutsche Bank equity strategist David Bianco says the labour market must not overly tighten and spark inflation.\n\"The Fed's latest step toward a slow and limited hiking cycle is exactly the bullish case for equities we have been highlighting.\n\"However, for this scenario to play out the labour market must not overly tighten and spark unit labor cost inflation. The Fed would then find itself behind the curve and need to hike faster and higher,\" he said.\nRecent economic data shows the performance of the US economy is varied. The economy contracted in the first quarter, but appeared to be making ground in the June quarter.\nAmong a slew of mixed figures, wages and inflation appear to be picking up. While the price pressures from stagnant low levels are a positive development, any unexpected jump in coming months will spook the Fed and equity investors alike.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-06-30T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T00:07:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
