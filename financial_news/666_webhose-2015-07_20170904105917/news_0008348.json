Exports were 3.020 million barrels a day in June, he said.\n“We are increasing exports every month,” Yassin said. “The figure is a record.”\nIraq, the second-largest OPEC member, is boosting shipments as a global glut driven by a U.S. shale boom prompts producers to pursue strategies to defend market share. Brent oil has fallen about 50 percent from last year’s high in June as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries refrained from cutting output amid the highest level of American supply in more than three decades.\nThe semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government started to bypass the central government for all crude oil exports in June for the first time amid a dispute over revenue sharing, KRG Spokesman Safeen Dizayee said in a July 13 interview. Oil producers in the Kurdish region, including DNO ASA and Genel Energy Plc, are caught in the dispute between the Iraqi central government and the Kurds, and are struggling to extract payments for their oil shipments.\nKurdish Exports The KRG region is exporting 600,000 barrels a day from the Kurdish region and the neighboring Kirkuk area independently from the central government’s oil marketing company, Ali Hussein Balou, an adviser to KRG natural resources minister Ashti Hawrami, said in a phone interview on Monday. The KRG will continue to export crude independently until a deal is reached with the central government, he said.\nIraq’s minority Kurds, who historically have resisted control by Arab-dominated governments in Baghdad, are independently developing oil reserves they say may total 45 billion barrels, equivalent to almost a third of Iraq’s deposits, according to BP Plc data. The Kurds operate a separate military force, which last year occupied the long-disputed, oil-rich territory around Kirkuk as the Iraqi army fled from Islamist militants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T18:05:37.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
