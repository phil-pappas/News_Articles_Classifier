She had become India’s first woman player to win a Grand Slam when she won the Australian Open with compatriot Mahesh Bhupathi in 2009.\nShe later added the French Open (2012 with Bhupathi) and US Open (2014 with Bruno Soares) to her mixed doubles collection.\nIn yesterday’s match, it was a remarkable turnaround for the top seeds as they were trailing 2-5 in the deciding set but made a stunning comeback to reel off five straight games to clinch the issue.\nVesnina was all fired up and her smashing volleys at the net put Sania and Hingis in a lot of trouble. The Russian was left distraught at the end of the proceedings as she had quite literally played out of her skin.\nIt was the third time in recent times that Sania and Hingis played the two Russians in the finals –Indian Wells and Miami — and asserted their supremacy again.\nSania was broken in the very first game of the match when Vesnina hit a volley winner from the net but the top seeds immediately broke back to avoid falling behind.\nIt was a remarkable lob from Hingis that gave them two break chances and they converted the second.\nSania and Hingis put tremendous pressure on their rivals but the two Russians responded well and it was 5-5.\nHingis was broken in the 11th game at love after a terrific rally of powerful ground-strokes from left-handed Makarova. Vesnina pounced on one return from the Swiss and hammered the volley winner close to the body of Sania.\nMakarova served for the set and it was Vesnina’s smart play at the net that sealed them the opening set.\nIt was the first set that Sania and Hingis had dropped in this tournament.\nThe top seeds had two chances to get an early break in the second set on Makarova’s serve but the Russians fought off both the chances to hold on.\nThere was no break of serve in the second set which was decided via tie-breaker. Sania and Hingis raced to a 4-1 lead before the Russians fought back to reduce the margin.\nWhen Vesnina served at 4-5, Hingis sent a stunning backhand winner down the line to earn the set point which Sania converted with a powerful forehand winner.\nThe second seeds broke Hingis in the fourth game of the decider to take a commanding 3-1 lead. Yet again it was Vesnina, who was electric at the net as she sank a winner after the longest rally of the match.\nA strong hold by Makarova made it 4-1 for the Russians. Sania and Hingis had a great opportunity to make a comeback when Vesnina went down 0-40 in the seventh game but they could convert none of the three chances and fell behind 2-5.\nMakarova served for the match in the ninth game but the top seeds brought the match back on serve, albeit after squandering three break chances.\nSania hit a stunning service return winner to earn the fourth break point and Hingis’ volley converted the chance. From 2-5, they won four games in a row to be in a position to serve out the match, which they eventually won.\nFirst Published on July 12, 2015 9:37 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T13:58:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
