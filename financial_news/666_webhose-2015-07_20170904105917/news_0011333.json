Having been involved with British companies over many years, I applaud how well their economy has done.\nA feature of the week will be a dinner with our very successful high commissioner Alexander Downer at Stoke Lodge in London. It being the Wimbledon week and being on the board of Tennis Australia, Rod Laver, Neil Fraser, Fred Stolle, Mark Woodford and their wives will join me.\nBut important things have to be done before you can travel overseas and in my case I had to ensure that my two lifelong companions, Lucy and Lilly, were going to be OK while I'm away. Before you rush to conclusions I should say that they both weigh about 3&frac12; kilos and yes, they do sleep with me.\nSo it was off to the vet in one of our classy inner suburbs. Rod the vet is a shining example to every shopkeeper and service provider. He runs an enormously efficient veterinary practice with an electronic data control system that matches anything ASIO has. It knows everything about the pet and even more about the owner.\nHe knows it's all about service, so if you wait any more than three minutes in his reception, he apologises profusely and when you get into the examination room, the first five minutes are taken up with \"how are you?\" – not \"how's your pet?\" He remembers all the details of your last conversation with him as well as anything that's been in the news about your public life.\nPeople looking after humans could take a lesson or two from Rod. In fact I was starting to think I should get my own annual check-up with him.\nBut we were there because of Lilly's cough. I didn't want to be away for seven days only to find that my little West Highland terrier had come down with the doggy flu.\nSo Rod pops Lilly up on the examination table and gets the thermometer in one hand and the canine lubricant in the other. Lilly fixes me with that \"oh no, not again\" look and I quickly revise any thoughts of switching from my GP.\nA frown comes over Rod the vet's face. \"[It's] 39.7 – anything over 39 and we're in real trouble.\" he extols with some gravity. So he prescribes a course of tablets.\nHe's a class act and he chats on and on because he knows that in the world of pets, the customer is paying for the service, not the one receiving it. His website announces that his epithet is going to be \"Here lies Rod, delightfully flawed, like the rest of us\".\nA little later we get the bill. We too are floored – but well looked after and happy. But hats off to Rod, he is a highly trained vet, a qualified lawyer and a really nice bloke.\nLilly went back again three days later and you'll be pleased to know her temperature was back to normal. She won't take another chance with that thermometer.\nThis pet industry is worth looking at. We have 23.9 million pets in Australia. That's nearly as many as we have people. The estimated size of the pet-care retail market is $3.5 billion, which will soon match the size of the Greek economy. But unlike Greece, it really works; we know the value of a pet and they are certainly good for humanity as the 1980 Brooklyn College study showed – they lower our blood pressure, reduce our trips to the doctor by 20 per cent and make us less prone to depression.\nSome 95 per cent of pet owners talk to their pet, with just on 60 per cent confiding their innermost secrets to their dogs and cats. One of the significant US studies showed that having a dog decreases heart attack mortality and those who might have a heart attack will recover more quickly than people without a pet.\nSo my thanks to Rod the vet for getting my little Lilly back on track so that I can travel without any worries, and report to you in a week's time on business and the economy in Britain and Europe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T16:16:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
