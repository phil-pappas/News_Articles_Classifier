A plan that already covers calls to Canada, Puerto Rico, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands and American Samoa. The change comes at no additional cost, has the potential to save users hundreds of dollars each year and connects nearly half the world’s population. \n“Staying in touch with family and friends is important, regardless of geography. But sometimes even the shortest phone conversations can get expensive,” said Patti Loyack, vice president of Broadband Voice for Comcast . “We hope the changes we’re making to Xfinity Voice Unlimited helps more people stay connected for less money.” \nUnlimited international calling is just one way families are saving money. In fact, customers can also use the Xfinity connect app to make and receive calls and texts for free from a smartphone, tablet, or device connected to Wi-Fi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T19:51:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
