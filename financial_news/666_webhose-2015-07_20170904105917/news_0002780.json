Western Cape rolls out e-learning to improve schooling Ramaphosa hopes ICT solutions will be used in schools in other provinces In this article Companies and organisations: Democratic Alliance People: Mmusi Maimane GAUTENG MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi on Monday delivered good news on e-learning and sanitation for some Soweto schools, but the future for other children in the township did not look so bright.\nWhile their peers heard that they would be getting tablets with unlimited data for their education, pupils at Megatong Primary School still have to learn in unsanitary conditions.\n\"The MEC’s vision of paperless classrooms in all schools without fixing the basics such as electricity and working toilets will not succeed,\" said Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane.\nMr Maimane, who visited the school on Monday, said the opposition party supported innovative teaching programmes but basic infrastructure should be sorted out first.\nThe DA would continue to conduct inspections across the province to ensure pupils all have access to quality education.\nSpeaking at Grace Bible Church in Pimville, Mr Lesufi said, \"It doesn’t have to be where you come from that determines the education you can access.\"\nHe said the time for children to rely on social grants and later queue for RDP housing were over and they would now have a better future with the e-learning tools they would be receiving from his department.\nFrom today 375 pupils across Gauteng will move from chalkboards to smartboards. Matric pupils will have access to e-books and other multimedia learning tools on their tablets which have been fitted with tracking devices in case of theft.\nBut they will only be able to use the unlimited data on educational sites. Social media and pornographic or inappropriate sites will be blocked.\nThe project has cost the department R1.2bn so far and the department plans to roll it out to all schools.\nMr Lesufi also addressed the media on the sanitation issue that has been dogging the department since the beginning of the year after an media expose of appalling school toilet conditions.\nHe said with 222 contractors the department had completed work on 50 schools out of 472 with 222 to be completed by the end of August.\nThe department has also set aside a budget of R750m for schools to see to the buying of cleaning supplies and cleaning of their schools.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T02:04:37.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
