AP The US dollar is on one side of 87 per cent of foreign exchange transactions, makes up 63 per cent of global foreign exchange reserves and it is used to settle half of world trade, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).\nRising rates are expected to add to the upward momentum in the US dollar. Over the past year, the US dollar has experienced one of the largest and fastest appreciations on record, surging about 15 per cent in trade-weighted terms.\nThat has been a good thing for Australian investors with unhedged exposures to offshore earnings through companies such as Macquarie Group, CSL, Amcor, Ansell and Westfield Group.\nOffshore earnings an important consideration That exposure to offshore earnings will continue to be an important consideration for investors this financial year as the Australian dollar comes under downward pressure toward US70¢.\nRising US interest rates will be felt around the world because about $US9.5 trillion ($12.4 trillion) in US dollar lending is to non-financial borrowers outside the country.\nBut judging by the record levels of mergers and acquisition activity, there is no shortage of cheap debt to fund takeovers. In the six months to June, the half-year records for M&A activity in healthcare and oil and gas were smashed, according to Dealogic.\nM&A activity in technology, media and telecoms is the highest since the height of the dotcom boom in 2000.\nThe flip side of the surge in global M&A is the freeing up of liquidity in the hands of fund managers. The 31 per cent rise in M&A in the first half to $US2.19 trillion means fund managers are looking for new places to invest that amount of money.\nThe optimism in capital markets induced by booming M&A has not stopped the glass half-empty brigade from worrying about other issues.\nA common concern is that rising US rates and a rising US dollar will cause upheaval in emerging market economies (EME). But it is hard to find a global strategist tipping a crisis in emerging markets.\nEME growth outstrips developed economies Emerging market economies are not growing as fast as they did in the lead-up to the financial crisis, but growth in the EME outstrips developed economies. India is this year expected to grow faster than China.\nAlso, emerging market economies have several lines of defence against financial stress, according to the BIS. These include foreign assets held by the private sector equal to 45 per cent of GDP and foreign currency reserves equal to 30 per cent of GDP.\nIrrespective of what the Fed does, the world remains flush with liquidity. The European Central Bank is acquiring a monthly average of €60 billion ($87.5 billion) in public and private sector securities and that is slated to continue until September 2016.\nThe Bank of Japan is targeting an annual expansion of its money base of ¥80 trillion ($840 billion). Its purchases so far lifted its balance sheet to about 65 per cent of GDP.\nBut all that liquidity has not stopped the Chinese economy from slowing faster than anyone expected this year.\n\"The situation in China poses greater risks than either the Fed or Greece, partly because it is so difficult to assess the extent of the economic slowdown there and also because of China's importance to global growth: China is now the world's second-largest economy, whereas Greece's is less than a quarter that of Los Angeles',\" according to the latest Barclays global outlook.\n\"Our forecast is that the economy will rebound in the second half of the year, as policymakers have the resources to spend additional money on infrastructure even as the credit channel does not work as well as it used to.\nDoubt that China's 'out of the woods' \"That said, we doubt that the market would conclude China is 'out of the woods', given the challenges inherent in the process of restructuring the economy away from its overdependence on credit, investment and exports.\"\nChief economist at The Financial Times , Martin Wolf, warned at the James Strong Dinner – a Writer's Festival event in Sydney last week – that this restructuring of the Chinese economy would inevitably involve several years of much slower growth.\n\"China clearly has a large debt overhang problem, a very large credit boom and they will resolve that without a crisis – the Chinese government has all the levers it needs to avoid a crisis,\" Wolf said.\n\"It can't let this happen again and it won't let this happen again, so the growth model can't be the same credit-driven and investment-driven model. So they have to shift the economy in a very radical way to a different sort of structure.\n\"This is doable; they have the levers, but it is going to be incredibly difficult because I think their core risk is that they have to get consumption growing fast enough to offset what I think will be a longish-term weakness in investment (by Chinese standards). That's a very tricky adjustment process.\n\"I would be very surprised if there weren't some years when properly measured growth was really low. That is not a crisis. In fact, my view is that properly measured growth is really low for one, two or three years in the next five, six or seven would be a good thing, because it indicates they are making the adjustment.\nLong-term optimist, short-term pessimist \"The final point to make is that if China does reasonably well, then they should have about another 10, 15, maybe at best 20 years, of rapid growth, but to do that they have to get through this transition to the different model.\n\"They are engaged in that, but I believe during that transition there will be a period of really slow growth and you will feel that in the rest of the world.\"\nWolf closed his remarks by saying he is a long-term optimist on China but remains pessimistic in the short term.\nLast weekend's rate cut in China showed that the central government will act when necessary in response to slower economic growth.\nEconomists at BNP Paribas last week raised their second-half growth forecast for China to 7.1 per cent on the back of the infrastructure stimulus packages announced in the past month.\n\"This seems to run counter to rebalancing the economy, but propping up growth is the authorities' top priority,\" the BNP Paribas economists in China said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T00:05:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
