A decision regarding the awarding of the project is expected to be handed down in July and while the Crown/Greenland consortium could be successful, Echo shouldn't be written off.\nDeutsche Bank said the group remained well positioned with its tender, given it would seek to include its existing facilities in the project rather than seeking additional gaming machines. The fact that it will have a stronger focus on tourism than the competing tender is expected to work in its favour.\nTo exclude this level of uncertainty from its valuation, in the process of revisiting its full-year projections for Echo, Deutsche Bank reduced its revised valuation by 1.5 per cent to reflect the probability of the group not being awarded the Queen's Wharf project.\nTaking these adjustments into account, the broker upgraded its net profit forecast for fiscal 2015 by 5 per cent to $214.1 million and increased the 12-month price target from $5.10 to $5.35. This partly reflects industry strength in domestic gaming, as well as market share gains.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T09:01:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
