Brendon Thorne by Edmund Tadros Misa Han The buying power of smokers, parents and cheese lovers has shrunk in the past decade while gadget lovers, drivers and homemakers are getting more bang for their buck.\nThe consumer price index, released on Wednesday, rose by 1.5 per cent from a year earlier . The index is calculated by tracking the cost of a selected \"basket\" of goods and services.\nSince 2005, the cost of the basket has increased by 30 per cent overall. So while it would have cost $100 in 2005, the same basket would now cost $130.\nThe Australian Financial Review 's analysis 10 years' worth of CPI data reveals which goods and services in the basket were hit harder by inflation than others.\nCheaper: Imported goods While the overall price of consumer goods and services rose by 30 per cent over the past 10 years, most manufactured goods like clothes, appliances and toys are actually cheaper now than they were 10 years ago. HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham says a fall in the price of manufactured goods globally and the rise of China meant some products escaped inflation, at least for now.\n\"A key low frequency trend has been the continued fall in prices of manufactures globally, while locally provided services, such as education and health, have been the key rising prices over the past decade,\" he says.\nGood news for technology junkies and gadget nerds: the price of audio, visual and computing equipment actually fell by 74 per cent over the past 10 years.\n Motor vehicles are also about 11 per cent cheaper than they were 10 years ago.\nCheap imports from China also means cheaper clothes, toys and household appliances like toasters. The price for toys and whitegoods dropped by 15 per cent, while the price of clothes and footwear all fell by between 4 and 14 per cent since 2005.\nBut Mr Bloxham says as China's economy becomes more advanced consumers should be prepared for a price hike in manufactured goods.\n\"China has been a key contributor to these trends, although as China moves up the value-add chain and labour costs rise, manufactures from China may contribute less local disinflation in the future,\" he says.\nMore expensive: Bills, school fees, cigarettes There is bad news for smokers: the price of tobacco products more than doubled since 2005, thanks largely to the tobacco excise which went up to 47 cents a cigarette now from 23 cents 10 years ago. Today a packet of 25 Marlboro Reds will set you back about $26, nearly $12 of which makes up the excise tax.\nAll the essentials like electricity, water and gas bills also doubled, while rent went up by 54 per cent.\nThe CPI is also bad news for parents, particularly if they have teenagers. The price of secondary education went up by 87 per cent while the price of pre-school and primary education rose by 68 per cent. But the price of childcare only rose by 16 per cent, significantly below the benchmark CPI.\nThe price of beer also increased by 44 per cent over the past 10 years, ahead of the 30 per cent benchmark CPI increase. So it may be time to tap into home-brewed beer, which is exempt from excise tax .\nMixed: Dairy lovers The CPI is mixed news for dairy lovers. The price of cheese went up by 48 per cent over the past 10 years, while the cost of milk only went up by 5 per cent, which is well below the 30 per cent benchmark increase.\nThe increase in cheese price may be due to the change in consumer taste. Rabobank dairy analyst Michael Harvey says Australian consumers have ditched plain block cheese for more sophisticated products.\n\"The long term trend has been for Australian consumers to consume more European style cheeses. We have been moving away from processed cheese and basic cheddar cheese to higher value products,\" he says.\n\"We eat more bries and camembert, and with basic cheese we don't buy it in blocks as much as we used to. It's the same product but it might be presliced and precubed, and consumers pay for that convenience.\"\nMeanwhile, supermarkets and fresh milk producers are still feeling the hangovers from the $1-a-little milk war between Coles and Woolies . Mr Harvey says supermarkets has used fresh milk as a loss leader for some time which explains why it managed to escape inflation.", "external_links": ["https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Excise-and-excise-equivalent-goods/Excise/Excise-rates/", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/milk-wars-likely-to-claim-more-victims-yet-20150124-12wirn.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/cpi_baskets_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-07-22T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T12:08:13.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
