Thousands of Lightning Deals will be offered as well as 7 Deal of the Day items and free unlimited shipping for Amazon Prime members. Image courtesy of Amazon \nOn July 15, 2015, Amazon will celebrate its first-ever Amazon Prime Day by offering more deals than they offered on Black Friday according to a press release by the company. The difference between Prime Day and Black Friday is, shoppers typically have about a week to take advantage of Black Friday deals offered by Amazon whereas they will only have one-day to take advantage of the Prime Day sale. Also, this sale is exclusively for Amazon Prime members so non-Prime members will not be able to take advantage of the huge sale. \nThe Amazon Prime Day sale will feature new deals every 10-minutes in the same manner as they are offered during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sale. Shoppers will also be able to take advantage of 7 different Deals of the Day and unlimited free shipping during the sale. There will be thousands of Lightning Deals available starting at Midnight EST and lasting throughout the entire day on July 15. \n“Prime Day is a one-day only event filled with more deals than Black Friday, exclusively for Prime members around the globe. Members tell us every day how much they love Prime and we will keep making it better,” said Greg Greeley, Vice President Amazon Prime. “If you’re not already a Prime member, you’ll want to join so you don’t miss out on one of the biggest deals extravaganzas in the world.” \nAnyone who is not currently an Amazon Prime member will be able to get started with a free 30-day trial of Prime and be able to get the great deals that are only available to Prime members. Other than being able to snatch up some great deals and get free unlimited shipping, Amazon Prime members will be able to watch thousands of unlimited movies and TV shows from several different devices as well as get borrow books from the Kindle Library for free. In addition, Prime members will be able to stream music from the Amazon music library. \nDuring the one-day sale, shoppers will be able to shop deals from several popular categories including: electronics, toys, movies, clothing, patio, lawn and garden, sports and outdoor items and more. Whether it’s back-to-school, summer adventures, to-do lists, or even early Christmas shopping, savvy shoppers will be able to save a lot of money on things they need. The best news is, Amazon has optimized their shopping platform to allow shoppers to grab deals on any device they want to use. No matter if it’s a Smartphone, tablet, or desktop, deals will be accessible across all devices. \nAmazon Prime Day will kick off on the Amazon Prime Day page of the Amazon website at Midnight on July 15 and run the entire day. Anyone who wants to take advantage of more deals than Black Friday should definitely cash in on the bargains that are being offered during the Prime Day sale. Make sure to start a free 30-day trial of Amazon Prime before the sale begins to unlock the savings that will be available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T03:48:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
