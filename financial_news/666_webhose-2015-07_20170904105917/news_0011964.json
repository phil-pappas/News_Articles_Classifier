Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. tumbled to the lowest since its initial public offering, while JD.com Inc. sank a record 9.4 percent.\nThe stocks plunged after the Shanghai Composite Index sank for the fourth time in five days as measures to stabilize the market failed to stop a rout that’s erased more than $3.2 trillion of value in less than a month. They have included a pledge by state-run financial firms to buy $19 billion worth of shares and a halt to initial public offerings.\n“Investors are fleeing anything associated with China, they don’t want to have anything related to China in their portfolio,” Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at Krane Fund Advisors LLC in New York, said by phone on Tuesday. “Investors are reading the risks around China, and there is a spillover effect in the U.S.-listed stocks.”\nThe Bloomberg US-China Equity Index fell 8.4 percent to 111.14, the steepest drop in four years. The Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF, the largest exchange-traded fund tracking mainland shares in the U.S., fell 9.2 percent to $37.53, the lowest since March. Alibaba plunged 4.9 percent to $76.32.
