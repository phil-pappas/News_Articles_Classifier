For example, they now have control over the temperature of the goods while in transit from the supplier to the outlet. \nThe main driver for expansion of franchise operations remains the attractive growth of African economies and the linked increase in levels of disposable income. In countries like Namibia, Zambia and Botswana, the food services sector has shown very strong growth during the last few years. \n“Botswana, as reflected in a recent announcement by a major South African franchise group, has seen a big increase in franchised food service outlets industrywide in the past five years,” said Myburgh. \nOther attractions in African markets include positive political changes, the rate of foreign direct investment, lower tax and sales tax rates, and increasing political and economic stability in the fastest growing territories. \nHowever, there are challenges such as lack of infrastructure in some markets, difficulties with logistics outside major urban areas, lack of retail skills amongst staff, rising costs of training and regulatory issues among others. \n“Franchising in Africa remains a challenge. Nonetheless, the sheer size of the opportunities on the continent will see progressively more franchise operations looking for opportunities. There is no doubt that, for those taking cognisance of local requirements and establishing the correct partnerships, the rewards can be worthwhile,” Myburgh. \n– CAJ  //cajnewsafrica.com/?p=7092   29 2015.
