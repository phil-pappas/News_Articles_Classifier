Bush hasn’t been shy about criticizing Trump, either. On Saturday, Bush called Trump’s remarks about undocumented immigrants “extraordinarily ugly.”\nGun-shaped iPhone case ripped: The New York Times writes an iPhone case that looks like a handgun is drawing warnings it could be too easily mistaken for a real weapon. Police departments across the U.S. have been delivering that message for weeks, and on Tuesday, New York Sen. Charles Schumer said sales of the cases may be illegal . The Democrat urged online retailers including Amazon AMZN, +0.16% and eBay EBAY, +0.36% to stop selling them. The Times reported that an Amazon spokesman said Tuesday evening that the item was no longer listed for sale on the site. Schumer said a federal law requires toy or imitation guns to feature a highly visible orange mark at the end of the barrel. But the phone case doesn’t have the marker, so Schumer said he would work with customs officials to block their import and sale. Here’s what the cases look like, as tweeted by a New York City police account.\nI would NOT suggest purchasing this cell phone case, which was designed to look like a firearm. #BeSmart #BeSafe pic.twitter.com/swsWzD1sdY\n— NYPD 112th Precinct (@NYPD112Pct) June 30, 2015 White House slams climate bill: The Obama administration is ripping a Republican spending bill that would gut the Environmental Protection Agency and threatens to undermine the president’s climate change agenda. The Washington Examiner writes the White House says the measure would inhibit the EPA’s regulations for existing power plants, known as the Clean Power Plan, stall newly finalized water quality rules and undermine the agency’s ability to push through stricter ozone rules. White House Office of Management and Budget chief Shaun Donovan told reporters the bill is “irresponsible.”\nKasich courts Washington: Ohio Gov. John Kasich , who is expected to launch his presidential campaign in two weeks, returned to Capitol Hill Tuesday to rally support for his long-shot candidacy. Former Rep. Kasich, writes Politico, spent several hours in meetings with lawmakers and top staffers, hoping to win their support and make the case for why there should be another contender in the GOP presidential field. In one meeting, Kasich called himself “the most experienced in the field with a record that no one can match,” according to a person in the room.\nPolicing the geese: You may not have heard of the Geese Police . But the federal government has. This spring, the Washington Post writes, the National Park Service enlisted Geese Police DC to clear the National Mall of Canadian geese. The aim: scare the geese away so they don’t leave feces all over areas heavily trodden by tourists. The annual contract for Geese Police DC is $28,000, the Post writes. The Geese Police bring in trained border collies to scare the birds away.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/BeSmart?src=hash", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/us/gun-shaped-iphone-case-is-a-terrible-idea-police-officials-warn.html?partner=socialflow&smid=tw-nytimes&_r=0", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/07/08/federal-government-invests-in-goose-poop-prevention-on-its-land-around-its-buildings/?tid=hpModule_ba0d4c2a-86a2-11e2-9d71-f0feafdd1394&hpid=z9", "http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/white-house-slams-gop-spending-bill-targeting-climate-rules/article/2567784", "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/john-kasich-back-on-capitol-hill-fends-off-doubts-about-2016-119829.html?hp=lc2_4", "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/247165-trump-mocks-bush-over-common-core-immigration", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BeSafe?src=hash", "http://t.co/swsWzD1sdY", "https://twitter.com/NYPD112Pct/status/615979286718251008"], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T15:55:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
