Finance ministers gather at 1 p.m., preparing the ground for leaders to start a meeting at 6 p.m.\nEuropean leaders must decide whether they can negotiate with Tsipras, who blindsided them by walking out of talks on June 26 to call the referendum, or prepare for the first departure from the currency bloc founded 16 years ago.\n“Financially, the euro area has nothing much to salvage in Greece and therefore has even less reason to compromise,” Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at Peterson Institute in Washington, said in a blog post.\nGreece has been in uncharted economic territory since its bailout package expired at the end of June, forcing the government to implement capital controls and close the banks. The European Central Bank tightened the screws late Monday by making it harder for Greek banks to access the emergency loans that have kept them afloat.\nStrengthening the hand of European leaders, financial markets have shown a muted reaction to Greece’s predicament. The euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.1029 at 8:15 a.m. in London, while the Stoxx 600 Index was little changed at 379.53. The Athens Stock Exchange has been closed since capital controls were introduced on June 29.\n‘Iron Chancellor’ European leaders have all made clear the onus is on Greece to explain how it plans to pull itself out of the crisis. Merkel called the offer from creditors before Tsipras called the referendum “very generous,” while European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker described the question put to the Greek people “irrelevant.”\n“I shall therefore be calling on the Greek prime minister to explain the Greek vote because the question is irrelevant, as anybody familiar with the negotiating process knows,” Juncker said at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.\nMerkel has to contend with a German public becoming increasingly frustrated with the Greek stance. Bild, Germany’s biggest-selling newspaper, urged Merkel to\nremain tough and offer “no new billions for Greece.”\n“Today we need the Iron Chancellor,” ran the tabloid’s front page headline alongside a picture of Merkel with a spiked helmet as worn by Otto von Bismarck, the Prussian statesman who united German states into an empire and became Germany’s first chancellor in 1871.\nObama’s Call Euro region finance officials on a Monday conference call made little progress towards bridging the gap between Greece and its creditors, two people involved in the talks said. The call took place in preparation for Tuesday’s round of talks.\nGreece made a pre-emptive concession to creditors with the resignation of outspoken Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis who clashed with his counterparts from other countries, especially Germany’s Wolfgang Schaeuble. Varoufakis was replaced with Euclid Tsakalotos, a long-time ally of Tsipras.\nThere are still some signs that a compromise may be achievable.\nU.S. President Barack Obama spoke by phone with Hollande and the two agreed on the need for a way forward that’ll allow Greece to resume reforms and return to growth within the euro area, according to a White House statement. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew spoke with Tsipras and new finance chief Tsakalotos and urged a constructive outcome.\nTsipras can claim a strong domestic mandate to negotiate after 61 percent voted “no” to the latest creditor proposals. The endorsement came even after banks had been closed for a week, causing widespread lines at ATM machines as Greeks waited to withdraw a daily maximum of 60 euros ($66) each.\nUnless it finds a solution to its cash crunch, Greece could drift toward a euro exit. Without funds to pay salaries and goods, the government could eventually be forced to issue IOUs or some other medium of exchange, which might gradually evolve into a parallel currency.\n“The negotiations can keep going until July 20,” Mark McFarland, Hong Kong-based chief economist at Coutts & Co., said on Bloomberg Television, referring to the deadline for Greece to pay 3.5 billion euros back to the ECB. “Ultimately you have a binary outcome: Either Greece leaves the eurozone or some sort of deal is done with the eurozone and the IMF.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T11:14:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
