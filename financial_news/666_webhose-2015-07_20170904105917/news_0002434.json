The law, expected to go into effect this year, obliges organizations to protect personal data and data processing practices while doing business within the EU. \nMorf Media Inc., today announced it is developing cost-effective enterprise compliance training on GDPR with Morf Learning™. Purpose built for enterprise compliance training, Morf Learning delivers the courseware, the metrics and the reporting for companies to prepare and implement procedures for the new regulation. The course includes the following: What the EU Data Protection Regulation is How the new regulation will likely change the level of security or protection of personal data across EU member states How the EU's Data Protection Directive foresees specific rules for the transfer of personal data outside the EU to ensure the best possible protection of exported data How US businesses will be impacted by new demands from individuals in the EU regarding use of their personal data \n“Every day within the EU, businesses, public authorities and individuals transfer vast amounts of personal data across borders,” said Angela Bazigos, CCO at Morf Media Inc. “Conflicting data protection rules in different countries can disrupt international exchanges. Morf Learning delivers the training on the common EU rules that have been established to ensure that personal data has a high standard of protection across the EU. The course also provides the training on rights to complain and obtain redress if data is misused in any of the EU member states.” \n“The benefit of GDPR combines modernized data protection rules with reporting consolidation,” said Axel Von Schubert, Morf Media Inc. member of the board and director of international business development. “It’s purported to simplify oversight and points to the need for enterprise-wide management, training and reporting. Morf Learning is designed to do just that by delivering compliance training for the mobile workforce across the borderless enterprise.” \nMorf Learning, provides one to one digital training on mobile devices.
