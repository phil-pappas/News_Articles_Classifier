Lee Besford Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Sally Patten The outlook for superannuation fund returns went from bad to worse last week.\nReserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens suggested that the economy's long-term \"trend\" growth rate might be closer to 2.75 per cent than the 3 to 3.25 per cent it has been in the past .\nMr Stevens went on to note that there would be implications for retirees.\n\"If there are assumptions about absolute growth rates embedded in business or fiscal strategies, or retirement income plans, they would need to be re-examined,\" the governor said.\nA couple of weeks ago asset consultant Towers Watson warned that super fund returns could be up to 2 percentage points lower than the long-term return projections over the next decade.\nMore recently a survey by actuarial firm Rice Warner found that super funds' long-term return expectations had more than halved for some asset classes over the past three years â€“ indeed in some cases over the past year.\nRetirement schemes expect international bonds to return 2.1 per cent a year on average over the next decade, down from an expectation of a 4.8 per cent return a year ago and 4.9 per cent three years ago.\nAustralian shares are now expected to gain 7.1 per cent a year over the 10 years, down from a forecasted return of 8.8 per cent last year and 9.7 per cent in 2012.\n International shares are a similar story. On a hedged basis, the asset class is forecast to return 7.4 per cent annually over the next decade, against 2012 and 2014 forecasts of 9 per cent and 8.8 per cent respectively. Cash is forecast to return 3.3 per cent over the next 10 years, not the 4.9 per cent funds were expecting in 2012.\nSubdued returns But the RBA is suggesting that in the case of Australian assets, returns could be subdued over a much longer period, given the growth outlook.\n\"We've got a longer term problem as well,\" says Andrew Boal, Towers Watson's Australian managing director.\n\"We have a short-term issue, but over the longer term returns could be lower as well,\" he says.\nThis of course will have implications for the federal budget on several fronts, including the prospect that the government will face a higher pension bill as individuals save less in super.\nAs for super fund trustees, they face two stark choices: either they find alternative ways to source investment gains and yield, or they lower their return objectives and inform members.\nSeveral avenues worth exploring Given the outlook, it should come as no surprise that super funds and their advisers are looking for ways to mitigate the impact of the weaker outlook on members.\nThere are several avenues worth exploring, according to the experts. One option under consideration is a move to active, rather than passive management, on the grounds that underlying markets performance is expected to be lacklustre.\nGraeme Miller, head of investment in Australia at asset consultancy Towers Watson, predicts that international and long-short managers are likely to be the beneficiaries of any such move, rather than local active funds. This is because of the small, highly concentrated nature of the local bourse.\nAnother beneficiary could be so-called smart beta strategies, or strategies that aim to exploit certain investment factors or market inefficiencies in a systematic way.\nThere is also evidence of a trend towards \"multi-asset strategies\". These funds provide exposure to a broad mix of investments, which are dynamically managed.\nIn 2014, 13 per cent of global searches by a pension or superannuation scheme for a fund manager were for a multi-asset fund, up from 10 per cent in 2013 and 6 per cent in 2008, notes Simone Bouch, head of Australasian business at Standard Life.\nStandard Life has seen this shift first hand.\nLast year the size of Standard Life's global absolute return strategies (GARS) product grew 20 per cent to $75 billion (Australian dollars). The GARS fund aims to return 5 per cent more than inflation each year, with between one-third and one-half of the volatility of equities.\n\"Discussion has really picked up pace over the past 12 months,\" says Bouch.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/106598404524016074873/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/sallympatten"], "published": "2015-07-26T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T00:47:54.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
