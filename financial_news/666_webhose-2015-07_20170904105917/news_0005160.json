Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Elise Shaw Commonwealth Bank is maintaining an \"overweight\" recommendation on gold miner Newcrest ahead of its 4Q production report due on July 23. It pegs catalysts for stock upside and has a price target of $14.34 a share. \"We expect Lihir to continue its positive turnaround with milled throughput and improved head grade driving higher production. We forecast Lihir output to grow to over 900koz by FY17, representing 37 per cent of NCM's production. While gold has traded between $US1230 an ounce to $US1150 an ounce since February 2015, the AUD gold price has remained elevated and in line with gold price highs of CY2011-12. For the 1HCY15, gold has averaged $1543 an ounce vs $US1206 an ounce. We expect AUD gold prices to remain at these levels for the medium term and in combination with declining AUD cost base impacts, provide margin support and relative earnings advantage compared to NCM's international peers.\" Financial results are expected August 17.\nWilson HTM has a \"hold\" on Sedgman and a price target of 85¢. \"Sedgman's transition to a multi-disciplinary EPC [engineering, procurement and construction] contractor appears complete. Over the past year, Sedgman has won a number of contracts across a broad spectrum of resources projects. The diversity of contract wins signals to us that Sedgman has moved away from its historic coal focus. The company is now demonstrating its ability to deliver processing and associated infrastructure across an array of resource projects. Furthermore, the stock continues to be underpinned by a solid cash backing of around 39¢ a share. Notwithstanding a range of positive attributes, we see the stock as fairly valued, hence our 'hold' rating and 85¢ a share target price.\"\nMorgans backs BHP Billiton as a \"high conviction buy\" saying recent share price weakness to a around a six-month low is \"overdone\". \"We think events in Greece and China are affecting equities demand more than commodities demand. We aren't suggesting these issues are not worthy of concern, but we note that everything has a price, and that fearful markets are prone to over-reaction. BHP's current discount to valuation is comparable to levels seen during the last Greek crisis (2012) and the GFC [global financial crisis]. BHP's weakness looks well overdone and we retain it as a 'high conviction buy\", particularly as a Greece solution now looms.\" BHP Billiton will take a $US2 billion write-down on its US onshore gas business , after the oil price collapse.\nRBC Capital Markets retains an \"outperform\" on APA Group with a $9.25 price target. \"An analysis of the economics of the NT Link suggests a high probability of proceeding, with APA at a competitive advantage to secure the rights. We see APA's growth profile as underappreciated and with an ability to surprise on the distribution over time. This reinforces our positive view on APA. APA remains one of our strongest calls. We lower near-term earnings as a result of updating for finalised BG pipe metrics and slightly higher interest/tax assumptions. We lift growth capex to $500 million per annum, lowering near-term cash flows, but this adds to value. Our valuation moves to $9.20 (+5cps) which forms the basis of our unchanged price target of $9.25. We view APA as a strong investment with an underappreciated growth profile, strong cash generation with ability to surprise on the distribution and attractive valuation metrics.\"\nBroker Watch: Rio Tinto, Horizon Oil, Greencross, SEEK Broker Watch: CSR, Aristocrat Leisure, Northern Star Broker Watch: Iron ore majors, Aurelia Metals, Alcoa, Gryphon Minerals Broker Watch: Gold stocks, insurance sector, Incitec Pivot Broker Watch: Crown Resorts, Aurelia Metals, Orica, Amcor Broker Watch: Asciano, BlueScope Steel, James Hardie, Cue Energy Broker Watch: Energy sector picks, REA, PacBrands, Treasury Wine Broker Watch: James Hardie, Brambles, Recall Holdings, GPT Group Broker Watch: Air New Zealand, Scentre, Aurizon, Transurban Group Broker Watch: Wesfarmers, Myer, Sandfire Resources, Sydney Airport Broker Watch: Brambles, Arrium, Tabcorp, Monadelphous Group Broker Watch: Origin Energy, Flight Centre, iSelect, Dexus Property Group Broker Watch: Fletcher Building, IAG, BT Investment Management, CSR Broker Watch: Woolworths, CSL Ltd, Metcash, Scentre Group Broker Watch: Sydney Airport, Resmed, Challenger Financial, Arrium Broker Watch: TFS Corporation, Western Areas, NAB, Spark Infrastructure Group Broker Watch: Primary Health Care, Metcash, Ten Network, Sonic Healthcare Broker Watch: Cover-More, SCA Property Group, Telstra, Boral Broker Watch: Federation Centres, Rio Tinto, CBA, Alexium International Broker Watch: Goodman Group, QBE, Adelaide Brighton, Seven Group Holdings Broker Watch: Eclipx, Independence, Alumina, ANZ Banking Broker Watch: ERA, Mirvac, Qube, DUET Broker Watch: QBE, Goodman, Seven, TPG Broker Watch: Greencross, Qantas, South32, Woolworths Broker Watch: Mesoblast, APA Group, Recall, Iluka Broker Watch: AGL, AWE, Qube, Nine Broker Watch: Metcash, Fleetwood, Otto Energy, McPherson's Broker Watch: BHP, Newcrest, Yowie, REA Broker Watch: Virtus Health, CSL, Spotless, Crown Broker Watch: Slater & Gordon, UGL, Flight Centre, Sirtex Broker Watch: Ardent, BWP Trust, Domino's, DUET Broker Watch: AGL, ALS, Ramsay, DuluxGroup Broker Watch: Woodside, Adelaide Brighton, Programmed, Brambles Broker Watch: BHP Billiton, WorleyParsons, Telstra, St Barbara Broker Watch: Ramsay Health Care, WOW, Dulux, Spark ​ ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/104280172644175237870", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Washseile"], "published": "2015-07-16T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T00:12:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
