In recognition of Independence Day they have announced a new special. Their 4th of July coupon allows people renting an inflatable to save $10 off the overall price. The deal expires on July 31, 2015 and it can be applied to any inflatable rental but it is not applicable toward other party rentals like chairs. “We wanted to do something special for the Independence Day holiday,” says Barney Race, President of Bay Area Jump.\nThese San Jose bounce house rental experts are trying to set a record this July. “Traditionally it is one of our busiest months of the year, and this year we want to rent more jumpers than ever before. We believe this new coupon for $10 off an inflatable rental will help us get there,” says Race. Bay Area Jump handles more jumper rentals in San Jose than any other company and they guarantee on time delivery of all equipment so that the party happens as planned. “We don’t want our customers waiting around for the party supplies they ordered. We deliver on time and have everything professionally set up.”\nThere are many companies to choose from for bounce house rentals in San Jose . Bay Area Jump is different because they have the widest selection of jumpers with over 400 to choose from. “We have a huge warehouse filled with jumpers. We also change our jumper selection frequently to make sure we have the latest character jumpers. We understand that kids generally want a jumper themed around the latest Disney, Princess, Marvel or Nickelodeon characters or movies.” Bay Area Jump keeps their entire online inventory updated on their website so people can see what is available.\nAnother important factor that people should consider is cleanliness according to Race. He says that they clean every jumper after every use. This is important because germs and other contaminates accumulate quickly when a large group of adults or children play in the jumper. “We have a team of highly trained experts that are dedicated to cleaning the equipment every time it returns to the warehouse. We want to provide the cleanest and most up to date inflatable rentals available.” Bay Area Jump has received the Best of The Bay Award multiple times from KRON4 because they adhere to a higher standard.\nBay Area Jump also offers bounce house rentals in San Francisco and throughout the entire Bay Area. “We have been providing reliable jump house deliveries in SF for over 10 years and we are the largest inflatable rental company serving the Bay Area. If you need a jumper rental anywhere in SF please call us now. We have trucks delivering inflatable rentals and other party rentals daily throughout the summer,” says Race.\nTo learn more about bounce house rentals in San Jose or to learn more about Bay Area Jump please visit their website.
