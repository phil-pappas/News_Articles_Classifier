Michael Carne was moved to both as he battled to make sense of his online electricity account. PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Mon, Jul 20, 2015 GETTY Michael was left confused over whether he had to pay £1,100 \nAs huge credits turned into alarming debts he stayed the course with Co-operative Energy, paying £150 a month by direct debit. He even tolerated the digital slap on the wrist when he tried to put in his meter readings. \n“I got this message back saying that if my numbers were lower than the estimated bill I had received, my figures would not be accepted,” he told Crusader.In April Michael, from Northamptonshire, was £900 in credit and asked for a refund. He sent more meter readings and was rewarded for his efforts with a massive £1,100 bill.“I called and emailed Co-operative Energy but with no response,” he continued. \n“It was such nonsense that I applied for a lower rate tariff and stopped my direct debit.“Apart from saying it would register me for the new tariff I heard no more.”We asked the energy company, part of the Midcounties Co-operative, to recredit him, give him a current bill, start the new tariff and throw in a goodwill gesture for the upset.
