We have not felt a recovery in domestic markets related to private consumption either,\" said one chemicals producer.\nThe downturn in China's economy, which is on course to grow at its slowest pace in over two decades this year, has continued to hurt exports and manufacturing across much of Asia. In Japan, data in the past few weeks showed shipments and output weakening, but capital expenditure climbing solidly.\nThe recent stock market rout in China, Greece's debt woes and sluggish global growth have added to the uncertainty over Japan's economic prospects.\nThe Bank of Japan trimmed its growth forecast on Wednesday but held off on offering fresh stimulus, convinced that an expected pick up in consumption will help accelerate inflation toward its 2 percent target next year.\nThe Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers held steady at 14 in July as declines in materials sector including steel and textiles/paper firms offset gains in processing industries. The index is seen inching up to 15 in October.\nThe service-sector index tumbled from a record high of 36 in June to 24, the biggest decline since May 2014 when a sales tax hike dealt a blow to consumers.\nThe Reuters tankan had further bad news, with retailers' mood plunging from over one year highs seen in June, weighing on the overall service sector mood.\nIt bodes ill for private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of the economy and is needed to pick up to cement a recovery from an expected slowdown in growth in the second quarter.\n\"Customers are staying away due to an unusually rainy weather and summer goods sales are slumping,\" said one retailer.
