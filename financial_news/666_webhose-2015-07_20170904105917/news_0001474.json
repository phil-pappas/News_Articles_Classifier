Peter Rae Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Indigenous leader Noel Pearson says he may as well have stayed at his beach house instead of attending Monday's meeting, billed as a \"historic\" gathering of indigenous leaders and the government, labelling it as \"highly stage-managed\".\nHe said the outcomes, to establish a referendum council, parliamentary discussion paper, and community conferences were pre-determined by Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten.\n\"I thought it was an important event, highly stage-managed I might say.\n\"It was very clear at the end of it that the outcome had already been nutted out by Bill Shorten and Tony Abbott prior to the meeting,\" he said.\nIndigenous leaders Noel Pearson Left) and Pat Dodson arrive at the meeting at Kirribilli on Monday. Peter Rae Mr Abbott said the goal was to hold a referendum in May 2017 , the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum, with community consultations on what will be in it to begin this September.\nMr Pearson said while it was \"a good chance\" to hear indigenous leaders' stances on constitutional recognition and everyone was allowed their say, he may as well have sent a \"cardboard cut-out\" of himself.\n\"In terms of input to the process going forward, the exercise was largely redundant,\" he said\nStronger stance Mr Pearson has argued for a stronger stance on recognition, saying it must also involve a constitutional body to provide Indigenous representation on Indigenous issues to Parliament.\nAddressing Mr Pearson's comments, co-chairman of the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples, Kirstie Parker, indicated there was a difference between what was announced and what was talked about at the meeting.\n\"There is a disconnect between what the leaders communicated and what was communicated afterwards by the Prime Minister and Opposition Leader,\" she said.\nNot all leaders had the same concerns.\nSpeaking of the summit, Indigenous leader Patrick Dodson said it was \"a great occasion, a great event: historic and terribly meaningful in the context of what we're trying to do around a very complicated matter\".\nNorthern Land Council chief executive, Joe Morrison, said while he understood Mr Pearson's comments, leaders were \"buoyed\" by the meeting.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-07-07T08:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:57:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
