The perspective behind this decision is that if everyone accepts Hindi to be the language of communication, no one will leave it out. The subject that are neglected by students because they do not aid in employment, should be made compulsory,” the draft document said.\nWhile interacting with reporters here, the outfit’s Joint Organising Secretary Mukul Kanitkar said students often are quick to learn languages of commercial use.\n“The policy is based on the belief that a treasure trove of knowledge and values is present in our classical languages and it is very crucial for a healthy social life,” the draft says, adding it aims at strengthening the “emotional integration in our national life”.\n 10, 2015 5:35 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T13:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T01:24:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
