Phil Carrick Share on twitter by Stephen Cauchi Gold has failed as a safe-haven commodity despite a plethora of global economic woes, Barclays says, as the precious metal slides towards a six-year low.\nBullion spiked to $US1301 an ounce in January but at Thursday's level of $US1146.81($1558.76), was trading just a few dollars above the six-year low of $US1132.36 it plumbed in November.\nIn contrast, in the bull-market days of 2011, gold reached all-time highs of $US1900 an ounce.\nUnfortunately for bullion fans, things aren't likely to improve any time soon, Barclays says.\nGold, traditionally a commodity that investors flock to in troubled times, has \"failed to garner safe-haven interest\" despite the recent unrest in Greece and China, Barclays said in a research note.\n\"Although gold's losses have been modest in comparison to commodities, other safe havens have outperformed gold in its role as a currency.\n\"Gold has also had to perform its duty as a liquid asset to meet margin calls elsewhere.\n\"Further, the market is focused on the timing and likelihood of a US rate hike.\"\n Barclays said the 2015 third quarter was \"likely to be the weakest quarter for gold\" with a price target of $US1150.\nIt said despite the collapse in the Chinese sharemarket , the correction in stocks had not led to a strong rotation into gold, and it do not see a correction as being the main driver for gold demand growth, particularly given the local market preferred to buy into a rising trend.\nSeveral headwinds would force gold lower during the quarter, including stronger United States economic performance and bearish investor flows.\nA strong US economy would also support the US dollar , which is the preferred safe haven for investors.\n\"Constructive US data, together with the renewed weakness in commodity prices and continued nervousness around China and Greece developments, should continue to support the US dollar,\" said Barclays.\n\"Even though recent external events could potentially delay the long-awaited normalisation of monetary policy in the US, we remain confident that they would prove to be way more damaging to other economies.\" This would keep demand for the safe-haven US dollar strong, said the bank.\nInvestor flows were bearish, said Barclays, with net redemptions of gold exchange-traded products and speculative investors wary of stepping in. Data for the first week of July showed \"net fund length is at its lowest since the start of 2014 while gross shorts are closing in on record highs\".\nThe only good news was from retail coin sales, which had \"stormed higher\" from year-on-year sales of 7 per cent.\nOn the supply side, there had been mixed results among some of the world's top producers, said Barclays. Peru's 2015 production so far was up 8 per cent year on year but South Africa's had fallen 8.3 per cent.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/currencies/australian-dollar-hits-sixyear-low-as-janet-yellen-signals-us-rate-rise-20150715-gidc93.html", "https://twitter.com/@cauchis"], "published": "2015-07-16T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:09:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
