Far harder is to buy equities. And ever harder is to stay in equities.\nBy now it is wildly understood that if you \"time\" the market, you will fall behind by missing just once, or at the most twice, a major up move. The Nasdaq 100 Index is moving out to new highs. The NDX 100 exceeds March 2000 levels, or does it? (The NDX 100 is not the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is 7.8 percent of the Dow; Apple Inc. is a massive 13.8 percent of the NDX 100. Apple is in the DJIA with a lesser weighting of 4.8 percent. In the past decade, the DJIA is up 8 percent per year, with dividends reinvested. The 500 of the Standard & Poor&apos;s 500 Index are up 7.6 percent per year. The NDX 100 is up 11.9 percent per year. Apple has a lot to do with this. Apple distorts.)\nOn an unlogged basis, the Nasdaq 100 is at record highs and is working ever higher. (Thank you, number 36 of 100, Netflix Inc.) Life is good.\nThe NDX 100: This is the chart that the media loves. Regular arithmetic charts make for pointy mountain tops. In bull markets they make for added excitement.\nOn a semi-logged basis, the Nasdaq 100 looks much different.\nThe NDX 100 (semi-log): The adult chart. Adjusted for inflation, the index has not breached the March 2000 level.\nThis is an adult chart: Life is good. It is just not the nirvana of the unreal space. This is the \"real NDX 100,\" the series adjusted for inflation and set at a July 2015 value. A few things to note: The two-decade trend is in red. Even after the post-2000 collapse, the recent lift has provided return. The \"post-Lehman\" bull market trend is in yellow. It is way steeper (with a semi-log chart, slope matters). Critically and evident is the spike of 1998, 1999 and into 2000 during the dot-com bubble. The 36-month moving average was \"fitted\" (which is math talk for eyeballed) to equate 2015 with the last bull market, the small circle. On a three-year smoothed basis, adjusted for inflation, we are back to 2000, the blue line . The recent sustained move has \"equaled\" the spike-like surge of the 1990s. Again, slope matters; this bull market is a more measured bull market.\nThe major message is that the yellow trend is modestly above the two-decade trend.\nThe minor message is beware the intricacies of indexes. They are quirky beasts. The NDX 100 is Apple to the core.\nHere are two books to advance your stock of equity knowledge.\nThe adult book on value.\nI love this book. It&apos;s adult, dense and hugely smart. It will redefine how you use the word \"value.\" Warning: After you read Richard Bernstein, you will break TV screens throwing shoes at idiots blathering about P/E-to-growth ratios.\nBy far the single must-read in equities. Should be reread every five years, then every six years, then every seven ...\nEvery part of economics, finance, investment and international relations has a must-read. Equities is the easiest to choose: This is it. One evening nine or 10 presidents ago, my mother threw The Intelligent Investor at the TV and hit me instead. She screamed, \"Read this!\" I beg: Memorize Chapter 5, \"The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks.\"\nDiscuss.", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i1hXdmgIUjRw/v1/-1x-1.gif\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i7B.b9QqaVzw/v1/460x260.jpg\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i9DcPn9qlMTU/v1/460x260.jpg\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i9WzISfCUokE/v1/-1x-1.gif\\"], "published": "2015-07-20T22:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T17:30:30.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
