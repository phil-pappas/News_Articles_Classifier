(the \"Company\") entered into a term credit agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") among the Company, Mylan Inc. (the \"Borrower\") and The Bank of Tokyo â€“Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, DNB Bank ASA Grand Cayman Branch, and PNC Bank, National Association, collectively, as lenders, and PNC Bank, National Association as the administrative agent (in such capacity, the \"Administrative Agent\"). The Credit Agreement provides for a delayed-draw term loan credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\") under which the Borrower may obtain loans up to an aggregate amount of $1,600,000,000, consisting of (i) a closing date term loan (the \"Closing Date Loan\") in the amount of $1,000,000,000, borrowed on July 15, 2015, and (ii) a delayed draw term loan (the \"Delayed Draw Loan\", and together with the Closing Date Loan, the \"Loans\") in an amount up to $600,000,000, which may be borrowed on or before September 15, 2015. Also on July 15, 2015, the proceeds of the Closing Date Loan were applied by the Borrower to redeem all of the Borrower's outstanding 7.875% senior notes due 2020. The proceeds of the Delayed Draw Loan may be applied primarily to repay the Borrower's 3.75% cash convertible notes due 2015. To the extent that proceeds of the Loans are not applied in the manner described above, they may be used to refinance other debt under the Company's and/or the Borrower's credit facilities. \nThe Loans will bear interest at LIBOR (determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement) plus 1.375% per annum, if the Borrower chooses to make LIBOR borrowings, or at a base rate (determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement) plus 0.375% per annum. The applicable margins over LIBOR and the base rate for the Loans can fluctuate based on the long term unsecured senior, non-credit enhanced debt rating of the Company by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group and Moody's Investors Service Inc. \nThe Borrower has the option to designate the Company as a co-borrower or a successor borrower under the Credit Agreement, upon satisfaction of certain conditions set forth therein. The Loans will be unsecured and will be guaranteed by the Company and each subsidiary of the Company that guarantees (or is otherwise a co-obligor of) third-party indebtedness of the Company in excess of $350,000,000. As of July 15, 2015, no subsidiary of the Company is required to provide a guarantee of the Credit Facility. \nThe Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants for facilities of this type, including, among others, covenants pertaining to the delivery of financial statements, notices of default and certain other material events, maintenance of corporate existence and rights, business, property, and insurance and compliance with laws, as well as customary negative covenants for facilities of this type, including, among others, limitations on the incurrence of subsidiary indebtedness, liens, mergers and certain other fundamental changes, investments and loans, acquisitions, transactions with affiliates, payments of dividends and other restricted payments and changes in the Company's line of business. The Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring maintenance of a maximum ratio of 3.75 to 1.00 for consolidated total indebtedness as of the end of any quarter to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four quarters. This financial covenant will first be tested at the quarter ending September 30, 2015. Following certain qualifying acquisitions (other than the acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Perrigo Company plc (\"Perrigo\")), at the Company's election, the maximum ratio in the financial covenant will be increased to 4.25 to 1.00 for the three full quarters following such qualifying acquisition. In addition, (i) for the four fiscal quarters following the closing of the Company's offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Perrigo, the maximum ratio in the financial covenant will be increased to 4.75 to 1.00, (ii) for each of the subsequent two fiscal quarters, the maximum ratio in the financial covenant will be", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T09:25:52.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
