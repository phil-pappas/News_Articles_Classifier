This should come as no surprise since the U.K. club has been a very successful and recognizable name across the world with numerous successful seasons in the U.K. Premier League and in the Champions League. \nThe performance of AC Milan in recent years has not been on par with the club’s glorious past. The team finished 10-th in the Italian Serie A, but despite this still has a loyal worldwide fan base. The club is not participating in any European tournaments this year due to its poor performance on a local level. \nwe will be delivering a number of key initiatives over the coming months \nWith 24option sponsoring the standing Italian champion , Juventus, the Italian Serie A will deliver a sort of a rivalry between brokers in the industry which are sponsoring different teams. \nThe CEO of GKFX Serkan Arli, elaborated on the partnership, “We plan to continuously celebrate our partnership with AC Milan, a significant and historical football club, with a global and incredibly loyal fan base, by delivering a number of key initiatives over the coming months. I am confident that this strong partnership will result in a bright success, enhancing both our brands and presence in respective markets.” \nThe Italian team is going on a Chinese tour in the coming weeks, which is a testament to the global reach of the AC Milan brand. \nCommenting on the announcement, the controversial CEO of AC Milan, the daughter of Silvio Berlusconi, Barbara Berlusconi said, “We are delighted to welcome GKFX as our first ever partner in the online FX trading sector. Our objective has always been to partner with companies that are consistently competing at the highest level and we look forward to a mutually beneficial relationship.” \nMrs Berlusconi has been repeatedly doubted to be able to carry out her duties by the club’s fans ever since her appointment to the Board of Directors by her father Silvio.
