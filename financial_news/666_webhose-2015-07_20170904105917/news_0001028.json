Edwina Pickles Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Two Labor leaders have broken away from their federal counterparts and given conditional support to a GST increase following a call by NSW Liberal Premier Mike Baird to lift the rate to 15 per cent in return for tax cuts and other compensation for lower-income earners.\nSouth Australian Premier Jay Weatherill, who already supports extending the 10 per cent consumption tax to financial services, and ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr both said they would be open to the increase, worth about $30 billion a year, should the compensation be adequate.\n\"What I've always said is that GST is an unfair tax. It places the highest burden on the lowest income earners,\" Mr Weatherill said. \"If we can find a way of grappling with that, I'm open to this discussion.\"\nMr Barr praised Mr Baird's \"courage\" and said he would consider a GST hike in the context of broader tax reform and if there was compensation.\nJay Weatherill says he's open to the discussion. The positions of Mr Baird and the two Labor leaders have lifted the stakes on tax reform ahead of a two-day summit between Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the state and territory leaders starting in Sydney on Wednesday.\nAs of Monday, just two of the eight state and territory leaders – Victoria's Daniel Andrews and Queensland's Annastacia Palaszczuk – remained flatly opposed to increasing the rate or broadening the base of the GST.\n'Very sensible' Mr Abbott, who has pledged no change to the GST without the support of all states and the federal opposition, called Mr Baird's proposal \"very sensible\" and \"very constructive\" and urged other leaders to keep an open mind.\n West Australian Liberal Premier Colin Barnett was open to change, as long as his state received a greater slice of revenue. The Tasmanian Liberal government and Northern Territory Country Liberal government were reluctant but open-minded.\nThis week's summit was called to seek a long-term funding model for public hospitals and schools. This was thrown into turmoil at the 2014 federal budget when the federal government withdrew $80 billion in funding over a decade with the edict that the states should find the revenue themselves, given they administer the services.\nFormer Victorian Labor premier John Brumby, who has backed a GST increase for more than a year, told The Australian Financial Review the rate should be lifted to at least 15 per cent and the tax applied more widely.\nMr Brumby said the fiscal position of the states over the medium to long term was unsustainable because of what he called the triple pincer: growing health costs, infrastructure demands and cutbacks in federal funding.\n\"The options are bigger deficits, ballooning debt, slash and burn spending cuts, increasing inefficient taxes like stamp duty, then the least worst option is to increase the GST,\" he said.\nEschew political expediency The Business Council of Australia and the Australian Council of Social Services issued a joint call for leaders at the summit to be open-minded and eschew political expediency.\nThe federal government, which signalled on the weekend it would take income tax cuts to the next election, would be able to afford such cuts should a GST increase enable it to withhold health funding to the states. Presently, the federal government spends about $18 billion a year on public hospitals.\nSocial Services Minister Scott Morrison was cautious, saying voters would want to see tax cuts before they would accept an GST increase.\nThe federal Labor Opposition remained hostile to any GST change. Leader Bill Shorten said it would drive up the cost of living for families while shadow treasurer Chris Bowen called Mr Baird's plan \"a kick in the guts\" to voters.\nMr Bowen said Mr Baird had \"capitulated\" to the plan set in the 2014 budget when the government used the $80 billion in cuts to force the states to reconsider the GST.\nHe said Mr Abbott, who promised no GST increase before the election, should have the courage to advocate the change himself, not hide behind the states.\nMore revenue would be needed Mr Baird said the budget shortfalls faced by all states could not be made up through efficiencies, and further revenue would be needed. Compensation would be directed to households with combined incomes under $100,000.\nHe said NSW government modelling revealed annual budget deficits across the Commonwealth and states are expected to total $45 billion by 2030, $35 billion of which relates to health spending.\n\"We need revenue. I know it's not popular, but the best way of dealing with it that I see is to increase the GST … and put all the dollars raised into health,\" he said.\nMr Baird did not support applying the GST to to fresh food, education or childcare.\nMr Andrews said increasing the GST would be paying for Mr Abbott's \"lie\". He proposed increasing the Medicare levy instead of the GST.\nActing Greens leader Scott Ludlam said the Greens remained opposed to a GST increase and would hold Mr Abbott to his promises.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-20T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:57:59.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
