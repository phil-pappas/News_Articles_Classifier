Bloomberg by Paul Tugwell and Eleni Chrepa Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras replaced some ministers in a cabinet reshuffle after almost a quarter of his lawmakers rejected measures he agreed on with creditors to keep the country in the euro.\nThe prime minister's office said Friday that Panagiotis Skourletis will replace Panagiotis Lafazanis, who heads the Left Platform fraction of Tsipras's Syriza party, as energy minister. George Katrougalos will succeed Panagiotis Skourletis as labour minister.\nThe Greek parliament in the early hours of Thursday backed the deal with creditors, needed to unblock further financing aid, with decisive votes from the opposition. With 38 of 149 Syriza lawmakers refusing to support further spending cuts and tax increases, that marked a blow for Tsipras, who came to power on an anti-austerity platform in January.\nTsipras told his associates after the parliament vote that he would be forced to lead a minority government until a final deal with creditors is concluded. The European Union finalised a â‚¬7.2 billion bridge loan to Greece on Friday that will help provide the debt-ravaged nation with a stop-gap until its full three-year bailout is settled.\nIn all, 64 of the parliament's 300 lawmakers voted against the bill. Half of the \"no\" votes came from Syriza, including from Lafazanis and former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis.\nFinance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos, called in by Tsipras to replace Varoufakis before the final bailout negotiations, discussed on Friday with Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel-prize winning economist, about the difficulties expected in the implementation of the deal with Greece's creditors.\nThe deal \"has an ownership problem for Tsipras and the Greeks in general,\" said Paolo Manasse, a professor of economics at the University of Bologna, Italy. \"It's a liberal program to be carried out by a radical-left premier and imposed on a country that's just voted no in a referendum.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T08:16:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
