Photo: Glenn Hunt\nThe liquidator of one of former coal billionaire Nathan Tinkler's horse farm companies estimated he could potentially claw back $1.5 million through legal recoveries in a best-case scenario in a creditors' update in June.\nLiquidator Tony Matthews said on Tuesday that was still the expected outcome should he pursue legal action over the $5.5 million owed to creditors, including the Australian Taxation Office and WorkCoverSA, as negotiations between lawyers for the liquidator and Mr Tinkler's new lawyer Greg Griffin continued.\nThe negotiations came a day after Judge Steve Roder made an order in the Supreme Court of South Australia that a warrant be issued for \"the arrest of Nathan Leslie Tinkler\" , so he could be brought before the court to be examined about the affairs of Patinack Farm Administration Pty Ltd. That is one of the entities of his former thoroughbred horseracing and breeding business Patinack Farm on the Gold Coast.\nPatinack Farm was sold in March 2015 to Hong Kong billionaire Tony Fung.\nThe arrest warrant is yet to be signed and sealed by the court, and requires that extra step before a physical pursuit of Mr Tinkler by a sheriff and authorities can occur.\nMr Tinkler built a coal empire worth more than $1 billion between 2006 and 2012, at a time when coal prices were soaring. Mr Matthews and his firm Anthony Matthews & Associate were appointed as liquidators to the Patinack Farm Administration entity in November 2012.\nA report lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in mid-June 2015 by the liquidator estimated that potential legal recoveries could bring $1.5 million in a best-case scenario. Along with $183,390 in funds held by the liquidator and $300,000 in sundry debtors, the estimated net asset recovery total was listed at $1.98 million.\nMr Matthews said on Tuesday those estimates were still valid. He said there had been phone calls between the lawyers for both parties on Tuesday. \"We've put our position,\" he said.\n\"We are looking for some comfort from Mr Tinkler over security of assets.\"\nMr Griffin is a prominent Adelaide lawyer who is also the chairman of the Adelaide United soccer club, which plays in the A-League national soccer competition.\nMr Tinkler relinquished control of the Newcastle Knights National Rugby League team in May 2014, after hitting financial strife, and in May 2015 soccer's governing body in Australia, Football Federation Australia, stripped Mr Tinkler's Hunter Sports Group of the licence to operate the Newcastle Jets team in the A-League.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/legal/nathan-tinkler-denies-running-from-liquidation-hearing-20150720-gigkh9"], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T15:17:38.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
