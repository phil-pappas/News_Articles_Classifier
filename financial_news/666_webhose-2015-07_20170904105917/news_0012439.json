It is therefore important that decisions made are conducive for sustained growth of the sector and national wealth,\" says Kundhavi Kadiresan, the World Bank's Country Director for Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi. She adds that tax regimes ought to also consider the stage at which a mine is in its life cycle and how revenue could be affected by price fluctuations on the global market. \"This also requires that Government has adequate capacity to deliver on all these issue and that the mining companies take part and disclose the necessary long term planning information required to undertake the necessary analysis.\" adds Kadiresan. \nIn making mining work for Zambia, the brief also considers issues of environmental and human health. It looks at implications for licenses, regulations, and laws governing mining activities. \"It is critical that governance systems mitigate the environmental and health spillovers from mining - especially where local populations are more vulnerable to these impacts due to poverty,\" says Martin Lokanc, the Bank's Mining Specialist and co-author of the Brief. \nThe Brief also analyses the country's recent economic developments. Zambia's economy continues to grow at a rate faster than that of the sub-Saharan Africa region. In 2014, the economy grew at around 5.5- 6.0 percent. Although this was a slight dip, the economy still remained strong. \"The main challenge the World Bank sees for Zambia is strengthening fiscal policy so it firmly buoys inclusive growth and poverty reduction,\" says Philip Schuler, the Bank's Senior Country Economist for Zambia and co-author of the Brief. The brief observes that in recent times, government spending has been rising, resulting in budget deficits of at least 6 percent of GDP. The Brief recommends containing the growth of spending on salaries and subsidies to create fiscal space for programs that reduce poverty. \nThe series of Economic Briefs that the Bank publishes are intended to stimulate dialogue and inform decision making to help Zambia further improve her economy as a lower middle income country.
