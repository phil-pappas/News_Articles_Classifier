There was no fire. \nHe said repairs to the track were under way and BNSF expected to re-open it to traffic late Friday or early Saturday (Shenzhen: 002291.SZ - news ) . \nHe also said the railcars were of the latest design adopted by the industry in October 2011, known as CPC-1232s, and not older, less fortified DOT-111s. \nThe U.S. Department of Transportation said late Friday that the train was loaded with crude by Savage Services in Trenton, North Dakota, and that about 35,000 gallons, or 1,100 barrels, of oil leaked. \nCompanies like Savage take samples of crude slated for rail transport and test it to ensure it meets North Dakota's limit of 13.7 psi. Symons said Statoil's shipment met that threshold. \nNorth Dakota imposed the vapor pressure rule to lessen likelihood of a fire or explosion in a derailment after a spate of fiery crashes. \nDOT in May issued new rules for more fortified railcars carrying crude and ethanol for the same reason. \nNew (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) railcars built from October this year on must have thicker hulls and more reinforcements than CPC-1232s, but thousands of CPC-1232 cars on the rails have several years to undergo retrofits to meet the new standards.
