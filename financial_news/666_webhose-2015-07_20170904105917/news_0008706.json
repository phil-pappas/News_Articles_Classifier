Lender Emirates NBD, down 2.3 percent, was the main drag on the index and the most traded stock. It had risen 10.4 percent last week on strong second-quarter results.\nAir Arabia was one of the few gainers, climbing 1.2 percent. The low-cost carrier, which has yet to post quarterly earnings, may benefit from cheaper oil and fuel.\nAbu Dhabi's market slipped 0.2 percent and Abu Dhabi National Energy Co (TAQA), vulnerable to oil's fresh weakness, tumbled 4.2 percent.\nBrent and U.S. crude futures on Friday posted their fourth straight weekly decline as weak economic data from China and a rise in U.S. oil drilling rigs applied pressure.\nTelecommunications firm Etisalat, however, edged up 0.3 percent after announcing that its board would discuss second-quarter results and the dividend on Tuesday.\nQatar's index edged down 0.2 percent as blue-chip lender Qatar National Bank fell 0.8 percent.\nOman's market was flat, while Kuwait inched up 0.1 percent.
