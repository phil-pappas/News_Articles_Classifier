(Staff photo: Bill Klotz) St. Paul sets framework for Gold Line station areas By: Cali Owings July 14, 2015 7:06 am 0 \nThe city of St. Paul is calling for higher density development at five future bus rapid transit stations along the Gold Line to Woodbury in recently released station area plans . \nTo encourage denser transit-oriented development, the city wants to rezone hundreds of parcels near Mounds Boulevard, Earl Street, Etna Street, White Bear Avenue and the Sun-Ray Shopping Center. A public hearing on the station area plans and the rezoning is scheduled next week. \nBuses will travel between Woodbury and downtown St. Paul’s Union Depot in their own dedicated lane near Interstate 94. But the area is a less defined corridor than University Avenue or West Seventh Street, for example, because it’s more spread out and not as dense, said Gary Leavitt, transit-oriented development manager for the city. \nThe city will likely see the most “bang for the buck” at the Sun Ray Shopping Center along Hudson Road, Leavitt said. The shopping center property is owned by a division of Blackstone Group LP , a New York-based real estate investor. \nThe site is already one of the largest, most dense station areas on the future line and there’s room for more services tailored to transit riders, he said. \nA future bus rapid transit station would be near the western portion of the shopping center. The city’s plans recommend a 350-stall parking structure behind the shopping center building with first-floor retail or other active uses. Plans call for short-term improvements to the street grid within the shopping center lot to create better access for bikes and pedestrians through the site. The full build-out of the street grid would accompany additional private development. \nThe White Bear Avenue Station and Sun-Ray Shopping Center area are expected to see the most intense development, according to a market analysis by HR&A Advisors . The areas are categorized as medium for short- and medium-term destination retail potential and high for convenience retail in the analysis. \nConsultants noted that residents in the area are visiting retail centers outside of St. Paul that could be captured through new retail development at those sites, said Bill Dermody, city planner. Vacant land and surface parking lots near White Bear Avenue and in the Sun Ray Shopping Center would make easy redevelopment sites. \nAll of the station areas were rated medium for future residential development and low for office space. \nWhile the city sets the stage for new development by laying out community ideas in the station area plans and rezoning, Leavitt emphasized that any changes will be market-driven. Adding transit to the corridor helps to create a market for redevelopment where there isn’t one today, he said. \nThe station area plans are a conversation starter for property owners near stations to begin thinking about the “highest and best use” of their sites, he said. They’ll ask questions about the city’s plans, other sites that could be assembled, and potential private partners. \n“They come to us with ideas. … That’s when the deal starts to take place,” he said. \nThe city plans to rezone 246 parcels, which are largely single-family residential and community business, to allow for transit-oriented development. The new zoning allows for a mix of uses. Leavitt said the neighborhood and market will determine which particular uses are built around the stations. \nThe two stops on Earl and Etna streets will be designated for medium-density transit-oriented development on a neighborhood scale and continue to serve as “neighborhood centers.” The residential Mounds Boulevard station would be the lowest intensity of transit-oriented development in the plans. The area is limited due to the Dayton’s Bluff Heritage Preservation District, which guides new construction to fit in with the size of the neighborhood’s predominantly two-story buildings. \nWith the Gold Line’s alignment running north of I-94 in St. Paul, the route presents challenges for access and development near the future station areas. There are currently eight places to cross the interstate along the corridor. \n“I-94 presents a major barrier that will need to be overcome for the bike and walk infrastructure,” Dermody said. \nWhile the west side of the corridor has amenities for cyclists and pedestrians, there are gaps toward the east end, he said. Those connections are important because most of the stations in St. Paul will be walk-up or bike-up stations without parking. Only the Sun Ray station is expected to offer a park-and-ride for transit users. \nThe plan calls for building two new I-94 crossings at Etna Street and at Kennard Street, west of a station at White Bear Avenue. Other crossings need wider sidewalks, protected bike lanes and improved signals, according to the plan. \nThe public hearing for the station area plans and proposed rezoning is set for 8:30 a.m. on July 24.
