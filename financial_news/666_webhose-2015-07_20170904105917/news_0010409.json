Louie Douvis Mr Neilson said while the manager is mindful of the significant level of volatility experienced by the Chinese A-shares market in recent months, he believed this short-term turbulence will not materially affect the long-term growth prospects of those companies that have solid business fundamentals and good starting valuations.\n\"While some investors may be concerned about the slowing pace of China's economic growth, the manager is optimistic about the ability of the Chinese government to transform the country's economy from one that is concentrated on secondary industries such as manufacturing and investment to one that is more focused on tertiary industries such as services and consumption,\" he said.\nChinese, Indian sharemarkets most compelling Mr Neilson said opportunities in the Chinese and Indian sharemarkets were the two areas that offered the most compelling investments among the Asian countries the new fund will invest in, which also include Hong Kong, Malaysia, Pakistan and Vietnam.\n In his note Mr Neilson took a swipe at the negativity from the global investment community surrounding the Chinese sharemarket, and Asia generally, following the plummeting of the A-shares market.\n\"The re-emergence of Asia is still coloured by notions of backwardness, deprivation and overbearing interventionism,\" Mr Neilson said in the opening comments of his note.\n\"The central case [for Asia] rests on the energy and ingenuity of the people of this region, which hosts about half the world's population and yet is conspicuously under-represented in most global portfolios,\" he added.\nHowever, Mr Neilson's views have become increasingly lonely, with a number of investors citing the unpredictability of the Chinese government's meddling as the major concern.\nShanghai equities suffered their greatest one-day fall since 2007 of 8.5 per cent on Monday, before falling a further 2 per cent on Tuesday.\n'No safe places to invest' Raymond Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund, said in a note his views about China had turned negative. The $US169 billion ($232 billion) investment firm founder, renowned for taking positions based on macro-economic trends, said in a note last Friday: \"There are now no safe places to invest.\"\nStill, Mr Neilson said Platinum had a strong belief that the far-reaching reforms currently taking place in many of the countries in the region provided \"outstanding investment opportunities and that Asian securities bought now will provide attractive long-term investment returns\".\nOf the $26.9 billion Platinum had under management at the end of June this year, Mr Neilson estimated about a quarter of that total was in Chinese companies, either invested on the Shanghai or Shenzhen exchanges or listed on other exchanges such as the Hong Kong stock exchange or on the NYSE.\nCurrently 37 per cent of Platinum Asia Fund's assets are invested in Chinese companies, the largest country position within the portfolio, according to the unlisted fund's June update.\nAccording to the LIC prospectus, the portfolio of the soon to be listed Asia Fund will start out looking somewhat different to Platinum's existing unlisted Asia Fund but will gradually look the same over time.\nPlatinum has said it will hope to raise up to $500 million via the prospectus offer, with the potential to raise up to $600 million if there is excess demand. The allotment of the offer is expected to occur on September 15 and begin trading on the ASX six days later. The LIC structure will ensure the manager won't need to liquidate stock positions should investors seek to redeem their money, as is the case with the firm's existing unlisted trust structure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:10:28.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
