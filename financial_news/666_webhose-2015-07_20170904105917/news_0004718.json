Written by: Gabrielle Pickard Whitehead 07/17/15 - 2:34 PM EDT \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) –- This month Barclaycard , the leading credit card issuer in the U.K., released its full-scale launch of three smart payment devices that enable customers to pay without using cash or credit cards. Barclaycard, which is part of Barclays Retail and Business Banking , believes its cashless payment system is part of the \"sweeping change in the way payments are made.\" But are consumers and experts as impressed? \nOne of the series of high-tech payment devices is a wristband, which cost £24.99 (about $39.00) and is now available for shoppers to buy. Equipped with a chip that connects to an app, with the band securely around their wrist, consumers merely have to wave the gadget at a contactless payment pad instead of fumbling in their wallet for cash or cards. Intent on being a pioneer of contactless payment innovation, Barclaycard released a similar key fob that costs £19.99 ($31.20) and a £14.99 ($23.40) sticker, both of which are also flapped in front of a payment pad in exchange for consumer goods. \nBarclaycard’s smart sticker can be placed on any device, such as a watch, tablet or smartphone, which can then be used as a contactless payment gadget. The high-tech gadgets are known as the bPay system. It was designed primarily so that athletes, drivers and cyclists could pay for items with ease instead of having to carry bulky cash with them.
