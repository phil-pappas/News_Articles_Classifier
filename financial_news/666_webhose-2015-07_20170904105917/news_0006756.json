Get Outta Here! \nFrom the Americans we can learn quite a bit. President Obama has showed his commitment to inspiring a new generation of innovators for the American people. \nHe has taken it a step further, and through the Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship initiative sends out American entrepreneurs to all the continents to promote a brand of entrepreneurship that can only be American globally. \nIn addition to creating opportunities for the American people, steps such as these stamp American business and economic influence everywhere these ambassadors set foot. \nAmerica is not about to give up its status as a superpower and in 20 years, the results of this initiative will be an international force to reckon with. \nKenyans are spending their time whining about traffic jams instead of looking at this opportunity for what it is - a chance to bring together American entrepreneurship with a Kenyan brand of the same. \nOne of the immediate learning points from GES2015 is that the government should encourage the youth and women to get together as a national brand and exert their influence in the East African region, where I can comfortably say Kenya is a leader on innovation and enterprise development by any standard. \nHOME-GROWN INDUSTRY \nSetting aside a quota of government tenders for women and youth is positive but perhaps short-sighted, given that the government procurement system remains the primary channel for ill-gained economic advantage by politicians and every other aspiring lawbreaker and purveyor of corruption, witch hunting, bootlegging and influence peddling. \nWhile we are encouraging our women and youth to look inward, there is a whole world out there and Americans are ahead, making their mark. \nMeanwhile, real initiatives, such as inclusion of women and the youth in financial accessibility continue to lag behind, yet they are the basis on which true equity can be promoted and achieved, with less intrigue minimum bias and much more objectivity than government procurement. \nIn any case, when the entire government, governors, senators, MPs, women representatives, MCAs and their relatives have had their way, the public is usually left with little or no say. \nThe summit will be complemented by an Expo at KICC from July 22 to 24, where we ought to display our very own home-grown industries and ideas, such as crafts, the arts, matatu and transport industries and even maize-roasting and shoe-polishing. \nIt is Kenyans in this category that most need to meet leaders in business and governments from across the world from whom they can learn, and who are willing to support and help grow their enterprises and ideas. \nIt is such ideas, in turn, that will change the lives Kenyans living in poverty . Let us get out of forever supporting those who already have the means and ability to access the global market with their ideas and innovations. \nSince the summit brings the global market to our shores, how about we present those who cannot access the world outside Kenya for various reasons? \nALERT COUNTY GOVERNMENT \nThe hosting of the global summit has also made several revelations about the Kenya people. We are a people of faith. \nThe Talmud, the Jewish book that has documented the peoples oral laws, culture and customs for eons, says that there is an angel for each blade of grass whispering for it to grow, and we have watched the county government whispering to grass to grow along Uhuru highway for the last two weeks. To each their faith. \nThe city is suddenly being better swept and cleaned every morning. My observation, at least along Limuru Road, is that this is not a 'Kazi kwa Vijana' initiative.The workers look older, like they have been on government payroll a long time. What do they do on a regular basis? \nWhat has inspired the Nairobi County government to do what it should have been doing all along? The global summit and Obama are the excuse, but hopefully senseless expenditure in the millions is not the only inspiration for the sudden awakening of staff from slumber. Kenya \nFriday will not be a public holiday despite the expected disruptions as US President Barack Obama arrives in Kenya for … see more » Copyright © 2015 The Nation. All rights reserved.
