Downing (D- Pittsfield), who filed the bill. Benjamin B. Downing \nBill S.574 , \"An Act relative to equitable healthcare pricing,\" would prohibit payments that are 20% higher or 10% lower than the average payment for similar settings. The ceiling wouldn't apply to certain specialty or geographically isolated hospitals. \n\"My thinking, generally, was related to some of the issues that I've seen in my district,\" Downing says, referring to the sudden and shocking closure last year of the financially beleaguered North Adams Regional Hospital. \n\"This bill by no means would have solved all of those problems,\" Downing acknowledges. But he says the way that healthcare is paid for now \"drives costs up and drives people away from settings where they could get just as high-quality [care] and be closer to home.\" \nHe adds that making payments more evenly distributed would not only help ensure access to care, but also stabilize communities and \"anchor institutions\" that are major employers in some of the state's most economically challenged places. Moreover, he says, they're providing high-quality care, but being paid much less for it. \n\"We are blessed to have remarkable academic medical centers\" in Massachusetts, he says. \"The question is, do we need to rely on them for as much care as we do?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T15:27:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
