The man was conscious throughout the procedure but had been given a powerful anesthetic.\nAfter the leg was removed, the man was taken to the nearest trauma center at Aria Health Torresdale Hospital. His medical condition was not immediately clear.\nDoolittle said the train continued on its way about 6 a.m. (Editing by Laila Kearney and Lisa Lambert )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:16:00.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
