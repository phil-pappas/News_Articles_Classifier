Simon Schluter by Sue Mitchell Coca-Cola Amatil and Pepsi/Schweppes are under pressure to step up investment in healthier beverages as consumers turn their backs on sugary soft drinks.\nIn a worrying sign for the major beverage bottlers, the shift away from sugar and low-sugar soft drinks is most pronounced in their target market, 18 to 34 year old consumers, despite new pack sizes, products and social media campaigns directly targeted at millenials.\nAccording to a survey of more than 1500 consumers conducted in May by investment bank Morgan Stanley, 48 per cent of respondents do not consume or have cut back on consumption of carbonated soft drinks, or \"CSDs\", as they are known in the industry, over the last 12 months, compared with 45 per cent in 2013.\nAmongst millenials, 40 per cent of respondents said they did not consume or had cut back on consumption of CSDs in the last 12 months, compared with 33 per cent in 2013.\nThe launch of new low-calorie soft drinks like Coca Cola Life has failed to lure consumers back to the CSD category. According to the survey, 55 per cent of respondents have cut back or do not consume low-calorie CSDs, up from 54 per cent in 2013, with 18 to 34 year old consumers cutting back at a faster rate than any other age bracket.\nThe survey was released as the The Coca-Cola Co's latest sales figures showed that still beverages such as water and iced tea are growing much faster than sparkling beverages and as a new study in the UK linked soft drink consumption to diabetes.\nAccording to Food Navigator, a review of 17 independent studies by researchers at the University of Cambridge and published in the British Medical Journal estimated that a daily serving of sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with an 18 per cent increase in Type 2 diabetes, or 13 per cent adjusting for other risk factors such as obesity.\nArtificially sweetened beverages were associated with an 8 per cent increase in diabetes and juice a 7 per cent increase.\n Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath said the major driver of declining CSD consumption was awareness of sugar content - even with low calorie CSDs.\nMore than 60 per cent of respondents cut back full-sugar CSDs because of the sugar content and 30 per cent of consumers cited sugar as the reason they cut back on low-cal CSDs.\nConsumption of sports drinks and cordial has also fallen because of sugar concerns.\nBottlers such as Coca-Cola Amatil and Asahi Australia, which makes Schweppes and Pepsi, have stepped up investment in healthier beverages such as bottled water, coconut water, sports drinks, flavoured milk, ready to drink tea and mid-calorie colas sweetened with plant-based stevia to counter the long term decline in CSD consumption.\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, one-third of households (and 49 per cent of millenials) had tried stevia-sweetened Coca-Cola Life, which has 35 per cent fewer calories than classic Coke.\nHowever, 55 per cent said they considered it a substitute for Diet Coke and Coke Zero, suggesting that the new brand will cannibalise sales of low-calorie colas rather than generate incremental sales growth and restore volume growth to the brand, as Coca-Cola Amatil hopes.\n\"The biggest impediment to higher Coke Life consumption is that people think that it is unhealthy,\" said Mr Kierath.\nIn May, Coca-Cola Amatil dismissed suggestions that Coke Life had failed to hit the mark with consumers, saying repeat purchases were higher than Cadbury's popular Marvellous Creations chocolate bars.\nAfter a horror year in 2014, when profits fell 25 per cent, Coca-Cola Amatil is reinvesting $100 million from cost savings into product innovation and marketing and is confident that earnings per share will stabilise this year before returning to mid-single-digit growth over the next few years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:40:40.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
