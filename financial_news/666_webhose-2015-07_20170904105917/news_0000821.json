Christopher Pearce Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Far from clearing the air, Bronwyn Bishop's press conference on Saturday afternoon will only intensify the calls for her to quit or be removed as Speaker of the House of Representatives.\nBishop was neither apologetic nor contrite for spending $5200 on a helicopter ride to attend a Liberal Party fundraiser.\nShe contended repaying the money was apology enough for what she said was \"clearly an error of judgement\".\nBishop only repaid the money after being prevailed upon to do so by Tony Abbott and hung out to dry by her colleagues, including Treasurer Joe Hockey, who said the chopper ride did not pass the sniff test.\nAnd when she did stump up the cash, she released a two paragraph statement claiming she had done nothing wrong. It was an act performed under sufferance.\nOn Saturday, she not only stuck by that view, but said she would keep using taxpayers' money to attend party fundraisers, something that is clearly unacceptable, regardless of whether it is within some nebulous guidelines or not.\nAnd as for the sniff test, Bishop could not disagree more.\nHockey, she told the press, \"says some funny things sometimes\" and then reminded all present of the Treasurer's 2014 brain snap regarding poor people not driving cars.\n Investigation as good as killed off Bishop's message was that she had done nothing wrong in principle and would keep on doing it. Her colleagues and the outraged public were clots.\nShe was sorry only for the saga taking the spotlight off Labor and its supposed plans for a \"double whammy carbon tax\". That statement alone shows Bishop has never grasped that her role is supposed to be apolitical.\nBishop is off the hook regarding Labor's referral of the matter to the Australian Federal Police. The AFP, which went after Peter Slipper for the dodgy use of $900 in Cabcharges, has dogged it on Bishop and left it up to the Finance Department, led by Secretary Jane Halton, to investigate the mater. That as good as kills it off.\nWe may never now know whether Bishop declared the chopper ride as \"official business\". She won't release the form and Finance is unlikely to do anything to hurt the government.\nAbbott is fiercely loyal to Bishop and Bishop has never ben one for turning. He handpicked her as Speaker and he has backed her solidly since, despite her egregious bias which has only further traduced the office after its treatment during the Labor years.\nBishop and Abbott have once more prevailed. But if the public anger does not subside, and there is no reason that it should after Saturday's debacle, then she becomes Abbott's problem as well.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-18T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T03:08:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
