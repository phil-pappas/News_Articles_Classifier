A one-off charge of 570 million euros brought the loss to more than the 195 million-euro average of eight analysts compiled by Bloomberg. \nTechnip confirmed an outlook given earlier this month and said its order intake fell more than four-fold to 1.5 billion euros during the period. \n“The oil and gas industry is likely to be adversely impacted for longer than anticipated by the downturn,” Chief Executive Officer Thierry Pilenko said in the statement. The company has started a “major restructuring plan across the group to address the challenging market outlook.” \nThe slump in oil prices has led customers to cut new projects and put pressure on suppliers like Technip to decrease costs on existing ones, Chief Financial Officer Julian Waldron said on a conference call. Prolonged and Harsh \nTechnip last month unveiled a plan to take a 650-million writedown and cut 6,000 jobs amid an industry slowdown that Pilenko has called “prolonged and harsh.” \nTechnip said it would cut 16 percent of its workforce and more than a third of its fleet of oil-service ships to yield cost savings of 830 million euros through 2017.
