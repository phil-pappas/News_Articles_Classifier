Oman set the trend when in 2002 it became the first country in the region to issue a corporate governance charter for joint-stock companies.\nIn a statement to ONA the CMA chief said OGSC will help raise awareness of the regulatory frameworks for the governance of companies and social responsibility in the sultanate. 'The Centre will ensure that all public joint-stock companies or private companies abide by best practices especially with growing interest in corporate governance due to its economic legal and social impact. \nHe added that there is growing interest in the mechanisms standards and applications of governance as they contribute to enhancing economic growth and progress. The Centre will also integrate this concept to develop the capital market in the sultanate and help it become more efficient and competitive.\nH E Salmi said he is optimistic of the role the OGSC will play in enhancing the status of the sultanate which has been known for adopting practices that safeguard the rights of investors and their investments. 'The Centre will also enhance Oman's investment status and investors' confidence in the market.'\nHe said the CMA adopted the Oman Social Responsibility Initiative comprising the Authority and a number of leading public private and families companies following growing interest in social responsibility. 'This has played an important role in conceiving the Centre.'\n\"Corporate social responsibility starts with abiding by laws and regulations especially those related to labour rights and maintaining environment and community development\" H E Salmi added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T17:16:36.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
