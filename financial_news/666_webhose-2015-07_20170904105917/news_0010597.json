Motorists pay different rates based on vehicle size at the country's toll gates set up by the government between major towns and cities. But the revenues are largely bankrolling the lavish lifestyles of officials, who awarded themselves unapproved \"holiday allowances\", Chiri said. \nThe report came as the Minister of Transport Obert Mpofu announced more toll gates will be set up across the country to add $200 million a year to the government's revenue collection base and finance planned infrastructure improvements. \nAt least $5 billion is needed to repair Zimbabwe's roads over the next decade, according to official estimates. \nNeither Zinara nor Mpofu have responded to requests to comment on the report's findings. \nToll on lives \nMeanwhile, police statistics reveal another toll from the disintegrating highways. In just 12 days last December, 82 people died from 1,012 road accidents, up from 822 accidents during the same month the previous year. Overall, the number of road accidents rose 9 percent in 2014 to 41,000, the latest data available. \nThe cost comes not only in lives lost. The health ministry said that one in four people treated in the hospitals for disabilities last year were the accident victims. \nMaravanyika, the cab driver, is not surprised. \n\"The money is not paying for the repair of these roads. These people eat our money,\" he said as he dodged oncoming traffic after encroaching into the opposite lane to avoid potholes. \nDespite the AG's blistering report, Zimbabwe oppostion legislator James Maridadi offered little hope the problems will be fixed soon. \nHe told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that it is up to the Transport Ministry to act on Chiri's findings, and the AG reports are of no consequence because they are merely \"recommendations\". \n\"They are a waste of parliament's time because the parent ministries where these corrupt officials are housed are not willing to act on these reports,\" Maridadi said. \nAllegations of rampant corruption at Zinara are not new. \nLast year, the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission named top Zinara officials in a $2 million road rehabilitation tender scam, prompting the country's legislators to demand their imprisonment. \nBut the police, who respond to criminal complaints from the ministries, have brought no charges nor made arrests. \n\"Ministers cannot act on corruption because they are themselves benefitting from it,\" Maridadi, the opposition legislator said.
