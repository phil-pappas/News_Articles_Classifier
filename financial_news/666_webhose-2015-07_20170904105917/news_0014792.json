They are working day and night under extreme circumstances. They have made a lot of progress. They have mechanically completed the work on the compressor. \n'After the mechanical completion of work on the compressor, they will proceed with the testing of the system,' he added. \nDr Sipa-Yankey said that the gas processing plant at Atuabo was ready to receive gas for onward transmission to VRA. \n'If tomorrow Tullow resumes export of gas, we are ready to receive gas and process for onward transmission to VRA,' Dr Yankey emphasized. \nHe indicated that since the plant has to continue running for a stipulated number of hours, the engineers were running it. \nCharles Darko, CEO of Tullow Ghana, earlier indicated that production volumes had reduced from 110,0000 barrels per day to approximately 65,000 owing to the development. \nHe emphasized that the reduction in production had affected the company's projections and 'that is why we are all working to ensure that we get back in line as quickly as possible.' \nFrom Emmanuel Opoku, Takoradi Other Stories Follow Us If a heart is not at a right place,there is nothing that heart will receive if it asks.
