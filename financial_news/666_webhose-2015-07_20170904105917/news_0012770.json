The bank was fined £21m this year for poor PPI complaints handling. \nBut Clydesdale's pitch tries to assure investors that these problems are on the decline, while it plays up the bank's case that it is well placed to take advantage of regional economic growth in the UK. \nSince 2012, it has re-shaped its loan book to strip out commercial real estate completely, and it has increased the secured retail largely mortgages component of its loans from 46pc of its book to 69pc. \nThe presentation to investors is also a chance to introduce its new chief executive David Duffy to shareholders. Mr Duffy took over in June, after leaving his job at the top of Allied Irish Bank another major challenge, as the bank had been bailed out in the financial crisis. \nThe Clydesdale’s presentation notes that it is the biggest of the UK’s mid-sized banks, with £28bn of loans, just above Virgin Money’s £23bn and TSB’s £22bn. \nThe Clydesdale calls itself “the only UK mid-market bank which has material scale, full service capabilities and [a] substantially standalone IT platform”, drawing a contrast with the others in the same size bracket, which also includes The Co-operative Bank and the forthcoming RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) spin-off Williams & Glyn . \nAlthough it only has 3.1pc of the UK’s personal current account market, the bank has 9.3pc in its core markets in Scotland and northern England. And the Clydesdale highlights the increasingly competitive market, with the seven-day current account switching scheme and the emergence of several high-profile entrants to the market encouraging customers to shop around. \nThe Clydesdale has a 1.6pc share of the UK mortgage market, and a 3.9pc share in its core markets. Mortgage lending volumes have risen by 15pc over the past three years, to 1.2 million transactions in 2014. The bank predicts sustained house price growth, and tells investors that the growth should be particularly strong outside London and the South East (HKSE: 0726.HK - news ) , and so relatively stronger in its core markets. \nIts IPO will follow those of TSB last summer , Virgin Money in November 2014, Aldermore in March 2015 and Shawbrook Bank in April .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T16:16:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
