The Franco-Dutch group said “exceptional volatility” in fuel process and currency exchange fluctuations, plus pressure on unit revenues, led to the increased losses.\nRevenue in the first half rose 2.4% to €12.3 billion, while passenger numbers were up 1% at 42.6 million.\nASKS rose a slim 0.3% year-over-year due to strict capacity discipline in the first half, while RPKs increased by the same amount. Plans to grow capacity 2.3% over the winter 2015-16 period have been reduced to 0.3%.\nLoad factor for the half-year was unchanged at 83.8%.\nAF-KLM plans to accelerate its Perform 2020 initiative, with new negotiations imminent with Air France’s trade unions to help turn around the Group’s figures.\nGroup chairman Alexandre de Juniac said in the first half the Group’s results were “characterized by exceptional volatility in exchange rates and fuel prices, and by ongoing pressure on unit revenues.”\nHe added: “The lack of results improvement leads us to implement immediate additional adaptation measures including, in particular, the closure of heavily loss-making routes, the downward revision in capacity for the forthcoming winter season, together with acceleration and an increase in the magnitude of our cost-saving initiatives.”\nDe Juniac said that following the agreement signed by KLM with its unions, “the rapid conclusion of the negotiations with the Air France unions is key to re-launching the results turnaround.”\nCFO Pierre-François Riolacci said that—while results on North American routes remains bullish and Europe is stable—services to Brazil have suffered as a result of that nation’s “very sluggish” economy, while recent terrorist incidents in Europe and North Africa has had a dramatic effect on traffic between Japan and Europe, which dropped by up to 20% year-over-year.\nOn the brighter side, he said, the Ebola crisis in Africa is no longer a problem.\nForeign exchange factors—notably the strengthening of the dollar against the euro—has been a “very significant factor,” given that some 40% of the Group’s costs were denominated in US currency.\nAmong moves to cut costs, the three constituent companies of Air France’s HOP! regional subsidiary—Airlinair, Brit Air and Régional, which have been run as separate entities under the same brand but with their own air operator’s certificates—will be brought together in a single company with 245 redundancies.\nAF-KLM is calling for stronger support from European governments to help it weather the squalls, said de Juniac, notably in a reduction of regulatory constraints that impose additional costs for European airlines.\nHe also wants the European Commission to “negotiate a balanced agreement with the Gulf countries ” on air services and said he would favor some form of international arbitration mechanism to address matters such as “unfair competition and subsidies.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T12:31:25.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
