(AP) - Police are trying to figure out who shot a rifle at a car and at several businesses in two Vermont towns.\nPolice responded in Barnet late Friday to a vehicle stopped in the middle of the travel lane of Interstate 91 in Barnet. They found a woman in the median who gave police several conflicting statements, such as someone at her car was trying to harm her, or she thought she was the victim of a joke.\nThey found the car with several bullet holes. Some spent shell casings and high-powered rifle were inside, near the center console. They later received word that several businesses were vandalized by someone shooting a high-powered rifle in Bradford Village.\nThe woman was taken a hospital for an evaluation; she hasn't been charged.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
