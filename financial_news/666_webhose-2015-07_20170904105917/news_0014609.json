New York Times Share on twitter by John Stensholt There's nothing like a visit from Rupert Murdoch to get the fine denizens of News Corp all excited.\nSo get your diaries at the ready because the great man will be back in Australia in a couple of weeks.\nWord has reached us that Rupert will, among other matters no doubt, be hosting a gathering of big advertisers in Sydney on August 11.\nNaturally we hope Hamish \"Hammer\" McLennan gets invited to that gig too after being allowed through the door on Thursday night for a big briefing the company held for the troops and advertisers too, even after he left Network 10 on Monday .\nRupert's visit will, as always, come at an interesting time. There's that whole 10 and Foxtel thing, bit of stuff going on in the political world, perhaps some TV broadcast rights to discuss with Dave Smith at the AFL and the AFL's Gillon McLachlan , and probably some News editors to sack as well.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt"], "published": "2015-07-30T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:04:16.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
