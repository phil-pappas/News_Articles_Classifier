BENGALURU: Prime Venture Partners, the seed stage fund formerly known as AngelPrime, has raised Rs 300 crore in a funding round led by Palo Alto-based The Social+Capital Partnership. Several institutional investors from the Silicon Valley , New York, Hong Kong, Europe and Singapore also participated as limited partners in the fund. \"I am excited about their approach and their ability to tap into the explosive growth in India,\" said Chamath Palihapitiya, founder and managing partner of The Social+Capital Partnership. Managing partner Sanjay Swamy said their original intent was to raise a fund of approximately Rs 150 crore. \"However, we received significant interest from investors and decided to extend our fund size to Rs 300 crore,\" he said. Previously, the firm invested $500,000 (about Rs 3 crore) each in early-stage companies. The new fund, which is six times as large as their old fund, will allow them to make seed-stage investments up to $1 million, and reserve capital for subsequent rounds as well. Fintech, financial services, consumer internet, internet of things, Aadhaar and healthcare are some of the sectors that the firm wants to focus on, said Amit Somani , managing partner of the firm. \"Entrepreneurs who want to make disruptive category creating companies are what we are looking for,\" said Shripati Acharya, the third managing partner at Prime Venture Partners. The four-year-old firm has so far invested in missed call service enabler ZipDial, mobile point of sale device Ezetap and recruitment firm HackerEarth, among others. \"I have been a limited partner and advisor to AngelPrime since their inception. I plan to get even more deeply involved with Prime Venture Partners as they continue to build out more path-breaking companies,\" said Rajesh Mashruwala, partner emeritus of Prime Venture Partners. Mashruwala is a former vice president of TIBCO Software. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!
