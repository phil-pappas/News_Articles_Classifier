The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index closed up 1.51%, Germany's DAX ended 1.24% higher and France's CAC 40 finished 1.94% firmer. \nIn the periphery, Italy's FTSE Mib rose 2.21% while Spain's IBEX 35 closed up 1.32%. \nMeanwhile, the single currency slipped 0.52% to $1.1084, having spiked higher earlier in the day on the reports. \nIn a two-page letter sent by Tsipras to heads of the European Commission, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank, obtained by the press, the Greek PM said Athens will accept all the reforms of Greece's VAT system with one change. Tsipras requested that a special 30% discount for Greek islands, many of which are in remote and difficult-to-supply regions, be maintained. \nAlthough the bailout's expiry at midnight Tuesday night means the extension is no longer on the table, investors were hopeful that Tsipras's letter could serve as the basis of a new bailout in the coming days. \nAs far as pension reform is concerned, Tsipras asked that a change to move the retirement age to 67 by 2022 begin in October, rather than immediately. \nHe also requested that a special solidarity grant for poorer pensioners be phased out more slowly than creditors want. \nDespite the upbeat tone in markets, analysts were wary, noting that Greece had backed down only on minor changes and pointing out that the referendum will still go ahead. \nWhat's more, the terms of the deal were still far from certain, with Germany insisting that it would not negotiate while the country was headed for a referendum. \n\"We have to wonder what has prompted such sudden concessions from Tsipras' government,\" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda . \"Do they suggest that they believe the Greek people will vote in favour of the bailout terms on Sunday, giving them little room for further negotiations? Or do they fear a banking collapse if they reject it and the ECB pulls the plug on emergency liquidity assistance to Greek banks.\" He added: \"This then begs the question, if the institutions smell blood, will they be willing to compromise at all or will the just go for the kill? Then there are the questions of what the rest of the Syriza party will think of what Tsipras is offering. Many rebelled against his offer early last week which was rejected by the country's creditors and the latest offer would certainly amount to concessions being made.\" In a televised address late on Wednesday, Tsipras urged the Greek people to vote 'no' in Sunday's referendum but said he has no plans to lead the country out of the Eurozone. \nThe leader of the ruling leftist Syriza party said Greece will continue to negotiate with its creditors and suggested that by voting 'no', the country would achieve a better deal from creditors. \nOn Tuesday, Greece put forward a new bailout proposal that would use funds from the European Stability Mechanism to cover the country's entire financial needs for the next two years, along with a debt restructuring plan. But Eurozone ministers rejected his plan and Greece became the first advanced economy to default on a loan with the International Monetary Fund. It had been due to repay the IMF â‚¬1.6bn. \nOn the corporate front, Airbus rose after China's state aviation supplies holding company placed an order for dozens of wide-body jets in a multi-billion dollar deal. \nIn London, shares in Tullow Oil (LSE: TLW.L - news ) rallied after the company raised its production forecast following a solid performance from its field in Ghana. \nSerco shares rocketed after the company said trading in the half-year had been a little better than it anticipated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T21:41:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
