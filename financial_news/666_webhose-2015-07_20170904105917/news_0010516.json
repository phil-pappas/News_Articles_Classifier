Knowing when voters are most receptive to persuasion messaging has been shown to allow political advertisers to better target swing voters. In a recently released study , Rocket Fuel found that 36% of voters in five key swing states voted after viewing an online ad. The findings reinforce an increasingly ‘digital first’ political campaign focus and highlight how digital ads play a prominent role in the outcomes of elections. \nRocket Fuel’s politics and advocacy group works with digital political consultancies, on both the right and the left, to drive market-leading performance using Moment Scoring™, its real-time calculation of every moment of influence that optimizes programmatic decisions and learns how to improve them over the life of campaigns. Moment Scoring™ uses Rocket Fuel’s massive Big Data architecture and voter data partner partnerships to access detailed, anonymous information about an individual -- at a precise moment in time when they are most likely to respond to an ad. \nRocket Fuel’s politics and advocacy team is led by recently appointed National Director of Politics and Advocacy J.C. Medici, who has more than 10 years of experience working with top political clients and Fortune 100 brands. Reporting to him will be Director of Strategic Accounts Amanda Whiteman, who has deep online advertising and politics and advocacy experience having worked for Microsoft, AOL U.S. presidential campaigns. \n“The positive impact programmatic technologies have had on the success of political and advocacy campaigns is staggering, and our nation’s most influential political think tanks are now turning to Rocket Fuel as their trusted technology partner as they determine their campaign tech strategies,” said Rocket Fuel President Richard Frankel. “We are building out our team in D.C. to support these efforts during the 2016 election and into the future.” \n“We have experienced a tremendous uptick in interest in our programmatic solutions among political and advocacy consultancies, driven by broader adoption of programmatic advertising on the consumer marketing front and awareness of the power of programmatic when used in political and advocacy campaigns,” said J.C. Medici, National Director of Politics and Advocacy for Rocket Fuel. “Rocket Fuel is an attractive solution because it remains politically neutral while processing staggering amounts of data and delivering the right ad, in the right context, at the right time - at scale.” \nAbout Rocket Fuel \nRocket Fuel combines the science of Artificial Intelligence with the scale of Big Data to improve the effectiveness of programmatic marketing.
