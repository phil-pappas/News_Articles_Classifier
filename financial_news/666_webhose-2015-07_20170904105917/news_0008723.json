This suggests Mugabe's measures are either coming in the wrong dosage, or are the wrong prescription altogether. \nThere are dire consequences for all stakeholders in this disaster, not least of all government whose revenue shortfalls will worsen as the tax base shrinks further owing to further de-industrialisation and informalisation -- the new economy, government calls it. \nImplicit in the fallout from the judgment is the need to balance the interests of the employer and employee who, now more than ever before, is particularly open to unfair labour practices given the scarcity of jobs. The two should be able to meet each other roughly halfway, in a give-and-take compromise. \nAs pointed out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the termination of an employment relationship is likely to be a traumatic experience especially for the worker as the loss of income has a direct impact on his or her family's well-being and self-esteem. \nIt warns as more countries seek employment flexibility, as is the case with Zimbabwe which is currently reforming its labour laws, and globalisation destabilises traditional employment patterns more workers are likely to face involuntary termination of employment at some point in their professional lifetime. But at the same time, the flexibility to reduce staff and dismiss underperforming workers is a necessary measure for employers to keep enterprises productive. \nThe task is thus, the ILO says, to strike a balance between maintaining the employer's right to dismiss workers for valid reasons and ensuring such dismissals are fair and are used as a last resort. \nSadly, the dismissal rush cannot be said to be \"fair\" and will condemn more Zimbabweans to rising poverty.
