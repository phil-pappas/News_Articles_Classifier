AP by John Kehoe Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has attacked US presidential candidate Donald Trump for being \"wrong\" on immigration, after the real estate tycoon tagged Mexican arrivals as criminals and rapists.\nMr Murdoch, the Australian-born executive chairman of global media and entertainment giants News Corp and 21st Century Fox, lashed out at Mr Trump on social media. Weighing into a contentious presidential election debate, Mr Murdoch pointed out that Mexican immigrants were less likely to commit crimes than American-born citizens.\n\"Mexican immigrants, as with all immigrants, have much lower crime rates than native born,\" Mr Murdoch Tweeted on Sunday night in the US.\nHe labelled the US-Mexico border city of El Paso - where 81 per cent of the population is Hispanic - as the \"safest city in the US\", adding: \"Trump wrong.\"\nMexican immigrants, as with all immigrants, have much lower crime rates than native born. Eg El Paso safest city in U.S. Trump wrong.\n— Rupert Murdoch (@rupertmurdoch) July 12, 2015\n Mr Murdoch is considered a conservative political kingmaker via his vast media empire spanning the New York Post , The Wall Street Journal and right-wing cable channel Fox News .\nMr Trump has shot to the top of Republican presidential polls following his ongoing tirade against immigrants.\nRace and immigration are touchy issues for the conservative Republican Party because many grass-roots supporters are older, white voters who are circumspect of immigration.\nThe Republican National Committee is worried Trump could hurt the chance of other Republican candidates in next year's presidential election .\nThe party's pro-business wing favours immigration as a source of valuable labour. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney lost the 2012 election to Barack Obama after only attracting only 27 percent of the Hispanic vote.\nThe barrage of racially-laden comments by Mr Trump began last month when he said Mexico was \"not sending their best\" people over the southern US border.\n\"They're sending people that have lots of problems. And they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists.\"\nMr Trump, who backed up the explosive initial remarks on the weekend by telling a conservative rally \"we have to take back the heart of our country\", is striking a chord with conservative voters worried about the large inflow of illegal immigrants over the US-Mexico border.\nA Pew Research Centre poll in May found that 63 per cent of Republican voters believe immigrants are a \"burden\" on the country because they take jobs, housing and health care.\nPresident Barack Obama wants to grant up to 11 million undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship. A watered down overhaul that seeks to approve 5 million illegal immigrants is being challenged in the courts by conservative opponents.\nDemocratic presidential Hillary Clinton, in a major economic speech on Tuesday, endorsed overhauling immigration laws to provide a pathway to citizenship.\n\"Bringing millions of hard-working people into the formal economy would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated $700 billion over 10 years,\" she said in New York.\nMr Murdoch, along with the big business community and Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush who is married to a Mexican immigrant, favours bipartisan immigration reform to give undocumented arrivals a path to citizenship.\nBusiness organisations including broadcaster NBC, retailer Macy's and the Professional Golfers' Association of America have cut commercial ties with Mr Trump in recent days.\nMr Murdoch's pro-immigration sentiments and criticism of the host of game show The Apprentice , appear to be at odds with Fox's high profile commentators. Fox News anchor Bill O'Reilly earlier defended Mr Trump saying he was \"highlighting a problem ... that is harming the nation\", while Sean Hannity declared: \"I Agree With Mr Trump.\"\nMr Trump also seized on the weekend escape from prison in Mexico by notorious drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman to attack Mrs Clinton and Mr Bush for supporting immigration.\n\"Can you envision Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton negotiating with 'El Chapo', the Mexican drug lord who escaped from prison?\" Mr Trump tweeted.\n\"Trump however would kick his ass!\"\nCan you envision Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton negotiating with 'El Chapo', the Mexican drug lord who escaped from prison? ....\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 13, 2015\nBacking up Mr Murdoch's retort, the Texas city of El Paso has ranked as the safest city in America for the fourth year in a row according to a study by CQ Press, a independent research firm.\nSuch is his support for immigration, Mr Murdoch advocated before Congress in 2010 in support of granting citizenship to illegal arrivals and penned an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal last year.\n\"One of the most immediate ways to revitalise our economy is by passing immigration reform,\" Mr Murdoch wrote.\n\"I chose to come to America and become a citizen because America was—and remains—the most free and entrepreneurial nation in the world.\"\nHe has praised Republican libertarian presidential contender Rand Paul for his pro-immigration stance.\nAlso on Sunday night, Mr Murdoch send a second tweet to challenge Mr Trump's claims\n\"So FBI says 267000 illegal aliens incarcerated. Who are the other two million presently incarcerated?\" Mr Murdoch tweeted.\nSo FBI says 267000 illegal aliens incarcerated. Who are the other two million presently incarcerated?
