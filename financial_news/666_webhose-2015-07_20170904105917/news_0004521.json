Soon, the IPO market may witness the frenzy seen in previous bull markets of 1994, 2000, 2007 and 2010. We have emphasised, time and again, that the basic objectives of IPOs and investors are divergent. Investors have no control over the time and price fixed for the public issue of equity. These are decided by companies to their best advantage; you, the investor, are not at the core. This is why IPOs rarely come cheap. The result, as Moneylife ’s analysis finds, is that most investors land up with overpriced stocks that go downhill for a long time. In our Cover Story, we take a look at some of the IPOs planned to be launched. The list includes some big names like Indigo Airlines, RBL Bank, Café Coffee Day, Matrix, etc. Are these worth it? Turn to page 28, to find out. The Supreme Court has pronounced three important judgements in July which expose the terrible enforcement record of the executive arm of government. The first order is on the high-profile betting scandal of the Indian Premier League involving Gurunath Meiyappan and Raj Kundra. The second delivered a sharp rap on the liquor baron, Vijay Mallya, for misusing the judicial process. Mr Mallya repeatedly evaded summons by the enforcement directorate in the case relating to a $200,000 payment to Benetton Formula. In the third, the apex court turned into an auctioneer and doubled the value of Sahara’s 47-acre property. It seems that, of the four pillars of democracy, citizens can look up only to the Supreme Court, to take on the high and mighty. As Greece and China roil global markets, on 29th July, come and hear Prof R Vaidyanathan, who has taught at IIM Bangalore for over three decades, at a special event titled—‘Coming Global Economic Crisis—Will India Go Down’ hosted by Moneylife Foundation.
