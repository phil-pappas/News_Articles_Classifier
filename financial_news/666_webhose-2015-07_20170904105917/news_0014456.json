Getty Images by John Kehoe A trio of international events pose the biggest risks to global stockmarkets in the coming days and weeks – Greece's debt standoff, a wobbly China and looming US interest rate rises. Australia is far from immune, judging by the Aussie dollar's fall to a fresh six-year low of US75.10¢ entering the weekend.\n\"If Greece contagion surprises to the downside or China's stock market decline takes on a life of its own, then the risks of a global recession would rise significantly,\" says Jay Pelosky, principal of US-based J2Z Advisory.\n\"Ditto for the outcome of a Fed-led policy mistake in the US.\"\nWith US stock markets closed Friday for Independence Day celebrations, European stocks tumbled to their worst weekly loss for the year. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.5 per cent, slumping 3.4 per cent for the week, as nervous investors fretted about the outcome of the scheduled Greek referendum on Sunday.\nEarlier, the equities rout in China rolled on, forcing authorities to reportedly introduce new restrictions on short selling. The Shanghai Composite Index plunged 5.8 per cent to 3686 on Friday. Over the past week, China's benchmark index has dived 12 per cent, the biggest loss in 23 years.\nChina, Australia's largest export market, is suffering a bear market in equities, even if the value of stocks more than doubled over the past year.\nOnly about 10 per cent of Chinese households own stocks, so the direct wealth effect on citizens is limited. But the gyrations in equities risk denting broader confidence and cast fresh doubt on the government's ability to persist with difficult economic reforms. China's economy is slowing and the price it pays for Australia's biggest export commodity, iron ore, is tumbling.\nThe iron ore price dived more than 10 per cent in the past week, to sit around $US55 a tonne on Friday.\n The commodity beating, uncertainty about China's economy and financial system and weak local retail sales figures published this week, pushed down the Australian dollar to its lowest level since 2009. The dollar was sitting around US75.15¢ on Saturday at around 6am Australian eastern standard time.\nMeanwhile, the immediate focus for global investors is the referendum in Greece on Sunday. Citizens will vote on whether to accept harsh spending cuts and tax rises demanded by European creditors. An outcome is too-close-to-call. A no vote increases the likelihood of Greece defaulting on its ballooning debts and potentially exiting the eurozone. Although events in Greece are expected to drive short-term volatility, most analysts believe any contagion will be contained.\nBarclays head of asset allocation Jim McCormick says direct exposure to Greece is not generally a concern.\n\"While we believe that contagion can probably be contained, we say it with some caution given that time and again, markets have underestimated the negative outcomes on Greece,\" McCormick says.\nFor Australia beyond the immediate ructions from Greece, the main game is still likely to be the unfolding events in China and actions by the US Federal Reserve.\nA \"Grexit\" alone is unlikely to deter the Fed from raising interest rates, unless – against expectations - events in Greece cause turmoil in international financial markets that spills over into the US.\n\"The Fed would, of course, be reluctant to hike rates for the first time since 2006 in the midst of another global financial crisis triggered by a Greek exit from the euro,\" says Capital Economics chief global economist Julian Jessop.\n\"However, we do not expect contagion from developments in Europe to be severe enough to prevent the US central bank from pressing ahead with a September lift-off, provided domestic fundamentals continue to strengthen.\"\nIn the US over the past four trading days, the S&P 500 dropped 1.5 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.2 per cent.\nThe selling pressure came despite consumer spending jumping the most in nearly six years (up 0.9 per cent in May) and consumer confidence leaping. The solid 223,000 jobs added in June was slightly below expectations.\nWeak wages and soft inflation indicate the Fed will not be a in a hurry to tighten policy, but if inflation rears its head sooner than expected, the fallout in bond and currency markets is likely to be felt globally.\nAt home in the week ahead, the Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to leave interest rates at a record low on Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T21:58:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
