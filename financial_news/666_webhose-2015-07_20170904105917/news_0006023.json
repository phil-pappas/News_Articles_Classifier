Finalizes a Waiver to Reduce Base Management Fee to 1% on Future Equity Raises July 14, 2015 08:00 ET | Source: Fifth Street Finance Corp. \nGREENWICH, CT, July 14,   today announced that it has finalized a waiver with its investment adviser, a subsidiary of Fifth Street Asset Management Inc. (NASDAQ: FSAM ) (\"FSAM\"), in which FSC's investment adviser has agreed to waive a portion of its base management fee for increases in capital relating to issuances of new equity. Under the waiver, the fee related to new equity will be 1%. The initial term of the waiver is effective until January 1, 2017, at which point it is the intention of FSAM to renew the waiver annually. \nAssuming new shares are issued, the blended fee, which will be between 1% and 2%, will be applied in the same manner as currently applied under FSC's investment advisory agreement. All shareholders will be treated equally in the benefit of the fee reduction, regardless of when they invested. \n\"We are pleased to announce that we have finalized a waiver with our investment adviser that reduces management fees related to future growth,\" stated Todd G. Owens, Chief Executive Officer, adding, \"We believe that by reducing fees on any new share issuances, this both creates additional operating leverage and allows our shareholders to benefit from economies of scale as FSC continues to grow.\" \n  as of March 31, 2015   Acquisitions.
