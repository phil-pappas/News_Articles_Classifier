Chelsea pet parlour launches doggy gelato for parched pooches By Rebecca Burn-Callander | Telegraph – 1 hour 33 minutes ago 274.10 -13.90 \nA nutritious ice-cream for dogs is now on the menu at Pet Pavillion - and owners can eat it, too \nPet Pavillion, the upmarket pet store, has launched a range of dog-friendly iced treats at a pop-up doggy gelateria in front of its store in London's Chelsea Farmers Market. \nThe quirky ice-cream parlour sells three kinds of ice-cream for hot and bothered dogs: strawberry and apple; apple, banana and carrot; and the bestseller, banana and honey. \nThe pots, which sell for £3 each, went on sale a fortnight ago, and have proved popular with pampered pooches. \n\"We noticed so many dogs roaming round the King's Road, panting away, so we decided we would give them a fun, iced treat to cool them down,\" says Alex Saville-Edells, 32, the son of Pet Pavillion founders Andrew and Jenny Saville-Edells. \nThe iced treats do not contain any dairy, wheat or refined sugar, and are 100pc vegetarian, he said. \"Humans can eat them, but they probably won't taste that nice,\" he added. \nThe treats also contain aloe vera and flaxseed oil to cool down the dog, he claimed. \nA pot of dog ice-cream from Pet Pavillion \nThese frozen treats are manufactured by Billy & Margot , the natural dog treat company that secured funding from Deborah Meaden on Dragons' Den back in 2012. Ms Meaden still owns 30pc of the business. \nThe company supplies a number of independent pet stores around London but Pet Pavillion is the first to open a bespoke doggy ice-cream parlour. \n\"It's a way to attract people to the store,\" said Mr Saville-Edells. \"We hand out samples and when people get an ice-cream at the artisan gelateria next door, they will come and buy one for their dog from us.\" \nIn 2009, rival iced treat maker Wagg Foods launched, Frost & Hound, a frozen yoghurt for dogs . * The Barkley luxury pet hotel for pampered cats and dogs in California * Luxury animal terminal opened for animals at JFK airport in New York * Posh dog nosh spurs sales at Pooch & Mutt Luxury treats for pets that are based on human food are all the rage, according to Mr Saville-Edells. \n\"It's not the dog picking out the food, it's the owner, and pet food manufacturers are increasingly marketing ingredients for the owners' taste buds,\" he claimed. \nBestselling brands at Pet Pavillion include premium dog food Lily's Kitchen, with dishes such as slow-cooked lamb hotpot for dogs, and venison and wild boar terrine. \n\"People think, I'd eat that so my dog will like it,\" said Mr Saville-Edells. \nPet Pavillion was founded in 1995 and has always specialised in luxury products. It has four stores around West London. \nVisitors to the upmarket Cheslea Farmers Market like to pamper their pets \nUK consumers are also buying dog foods that contain local British produce, mirroring their own grocery shopping habits. \n\"Canagan has a free-range chicken food, which only uses British meat, and that's been very popular,\" he said. \nPets at Home (LSE: PETS.L - news ) , one of the UK’s largest pet product retailers, has also profited from the surge in sales of high-end products. \nThe company announced revenues of £224.2m for the first quarter of this year, mostly driven by growth in its high-end food, treats, and grooming services. \n“Our core strengths in advanced nutrition, vet and grooming services have continued to deliver in the first quarter, underpinned by our VIP loyalty club,\" said chief executive Nick Wood. \nLike-for-like revenues for the 16 weeks to July 16 were up 1.7pc, the company said, with the grooming, pampering and services arm of the business up 28.6pc to £23.5m. \nPet Pavillion, which has increased revenues by 30pc in the past year, said that much of its growth has been driven by its grooming services. \n\"We have customers that come in for a dog bath every two weeks, and they will often buy a blueberry facial for their dogs at the same time,\" said Mr Saville-Edells. \nThe all-natural blueberry facial costs between £20 and £30. \"People are spoiling their pets now that we're coming out of recession,\" he added. \"It's a huge market.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T09:49:09.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
