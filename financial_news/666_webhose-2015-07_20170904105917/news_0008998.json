The Chinese dramatic fall was all the more surprising because more than half of its shares were in a government-imposed trading ban.\nThe ASX fell 2 per cent on Wednesday, as China's wild plunges weighed on sentiment. Photo: Reuters\n\"You could argue that China's financial market is becoming more integrated in global investor sentiment,\" Commonwealth Bank China and Asia economist Wei Li said.\n\"Panic starts to feed on itself. There may not be any direct relationship between [the markets] but they affect each other,\" he said.\nThere was certainly concern from the Chinese market regulator that fear was feeding some of the trading.\nSource: Bloomberg\n\"There is panic in the stockmarket; irrational sell-offs have increased greatly and that has led to liquidity tension,\" a spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission said.\nThe ASX was not the only market slugged, with about $500 billion wiped from regional Asian markets by late afternoon on Wednesday before a late rally. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell more than 7 per cent at one point, its biggest post-financial crisis fall.\nFor the first time since the Shanghai Composite Index began a plunge after an 18-month long, 160 per cent rally, Australian investors are beginning to take the once isolated and volatile market seriously, and Macquarie division director Martin Lakos said events in China were \"the primary driver\" of the Australian sharemarket.\n\"Because China is in a local time zone it's very visible for us. In terms of our market it's certainly having an impact.\"\nIG chief markets strategist Chris Weston said the Chinese equity falls were still a long way from having a material impact on economics.\n\"Predominately because only 20 per cent of the Chinese household portfolio is in equities, but had the falls been in deposits then things would look a lot worse,\" he said in a note.\n\"Still, it does feel that moves in Chinese equities are having a bigger impact of regional sentiment than they did say a week ago or so.\"\nCredit Suisse analyst Damien Boey said investors were worried that if the People's Bank of China started directly or indirectly buying shares to support the sharemarket, \"you're printing money and putting downward pressure on the currency\".\nMr Boey also said that iron ore was \"clearly overbought\" in earlier months, resulting in the current correction which has hit the big mining stocks. Iron ore sank 5.1 per cent on Wednesday to $49.60 a metric tonne, around 22 per cent down since June.\n\"If China is taking extreme measures, what investors are suspecting is that the economy is really weak and there's not a lot they can do about it,\" he said.\nBut Mr Lakos said the Chinese sharemarket was not representative of the broader Chinese economy and therefore not a direct drag on iron ore prices.\n\"It's not fully representative of the Chinese economy. It's not broad, it's not developed, it's not deep,\" he said.\nThe Australian dollar also felt the pressure from the Chinese sell-off. The Aussie fell as low as US73.91¢ after the market's opening, and was buying US73.92¢ in late trade. The last time the dollar traded below US74¢ was in 2009.\n\"Investors see Australia as a country extremely dependent on the fortunes of China,\" ANZ interest rates strategist Martin Whetton said.\n\"In a situation where Chinese capital markets perform badly, specifically equities or property, it would be the Australian dollar that gets sold off on sentiment,\" he said.\nThe global drama is also changing minds on interest rates. Market pricing suggests that there is now a 100 per cent chance of the Reserve Bank of Australia cutting interest rates by next April. On Tuesday, the number was 92 per cent, and just a month ago it was only 68 per cent.\nOn the ASX on Wednesday, banks and miners took biggest hit. ANZ fell 2.3 per cent to $32.27, Commonwealth Bank slipped 2.2 per cent to $85.77, National Australia Bank tumbled 2.6 per cent to $33.33 and Westpac fell 1.8 per cent to $33.16.\nAs commodity prices plunged, all mining stocks were heavily sold off. BHP tumbled 3.1 per cent to $25.43 and Rio Tinto crumbled 3.2 per cent to $50.06. Fellow blue-chip Telstra also had a poor day, weakening 1.7 per cent to $6.16.\nPureplay iron ore miners were hardest hit, with Fortescue crashing 6.1 per cent to a fresh six-year low of $1.67. Even gold stocks performed poorly, with Newcrest shedding 3.8 per cent to $12.59.\nThe fall in the oil price hit local energy stocks with Woodside slipping 2.9 per cent to $33.62, Santos falling 3.2 per cent to $7.45 and Oil Search dipping 2.4 per cent to $6.83.\nConsumer stocks weren't as badly affected but were still sold off, with Wesfarmers dropping 1.5 per cent to $39.72 and Woolworths shaving off 0.3 per cent to $27.32.\nMark Lennox, senior private adviser at HC Securities said Wednesday's ASX fall was also a function of yesterday's strength, when the market climbed 2 per cent on \"virtually nothing\".\n\"There's more fearmongering happening, people don't know what the flow-on effects of a raise in US interest rates could be. There are those investors who won't go near anything until there's clarity from Greece or the timing of the interest rate hike,\" he said.\nCommonwealth Bank's Mr Li said he wasn't concerned about the Chinese sharemarket crashing further, and said Beijing had \"the stability to revive the market if it really wants to\".\n\"The more immediate concern from my perspective is there is no sign of economic improvement, and I think the crash in the stockmarket is healthy from a longer term perspective after the strong rally,\" he said.\nMr Li said it was possible the falls could last another two to three weeks until the Shanghai Composite Index returns to where it began some 18 months ago, but was not likely.\nBut Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts warned the worst was yet to come.\n\"The ripple effect from the market correction has yet to show up,\" they wrote in a note.\n\"We expect slower growth, poorer corporate earnings, and a higher risk of a financial crisis,\" they said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T04:55:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
