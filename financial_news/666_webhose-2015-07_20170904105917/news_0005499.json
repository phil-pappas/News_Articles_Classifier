This week was meant to be all about the Italian black grape sangiovese's tribulations – and occasional triumphs – in Australia. But at the end of a recent blind tasting, with the 2012 Castello di Gabbiano Chianti Classico coming up trumps, my mind inevitably drifted to its heartland in Tuscany, where I stayed with my family for 10 days late in 2014 – in Florence and in the dreamy, late-autumn Chianti countryside south of the city.\nNot that the 2012 Gabbiano Chianti Classico is the greatest example that I tasted on my Italy trip – because those from the same vintage of Poggerino, San Giusto a Rentennano, Isole e Olena and Fontodi were superior – but it was exactly as I recall it tasting at the Castello in the cellar door. The wine is sealed with a Diam-lookalike closure made by Portuguese cork giant Amorim. It appears to be doing a good job because I've broached several bottles now without any perceptible variation.\nBut what sealed the story deal was a traffic infringement and fine that I've just received in the mail. The envelope was marked as being from the Polizia Municpale Firenze, and my violation was for \"Circulating in a limited traffic area without an authorisation\". The fine? A curious figure of €105.71 ($156.73), discountable to €81.71 if I pay within five days.\nI know exactly when and why this occurred. It was the last day of our stay in Chianti before heading north to Bologna* in the afternoon. But we wanted one last lunch in Florence and Francesco Berardinelli, head chef at Gabbiano's excellent restaurant, Il Cavaliere, recommended Da Ruggero. \"But you must go early, or some of the best things may be gone,\" he confided at dinner.\nBerardinelli had just prepared one of the best meals I've ever eaten in Tuscany – beef carpaccio liberally topped with Umbrian black truffle, fettuccine with artichoke, and roast guinea fowl with more black truffle (all were immaculate) – so we were definitely going to take his recommendation.\nLocal-traffic-only Unfortunately he didn't give us explicit directions and I got bamboozled in Florence's one-way system and ended up in the local-traffic-only zone on Via Romana, so the infringement notice tells me. On the positive side my wrong turn did take me in the direction of another restaurant on the south side of the Arno that I'd made a note of. As it turned out Il Santo Bevitore provided a fantastic last lunch in Florence. Da Ruggero will have to wait for us (and you).\nBut back but to Gabbiano and its castello, which is owned by our Treasury Wines Estates via its US offshoot Beringer. We booked an apartment on the property for five nights but stayed for seven, and each morning woke to a view of the castle that was beautifully different from the previous day: in late-autumn sun, rain, mist. You can also stay in the castello proper, which has just been sensitively renovated and the rooms are spacious and beautiful. But that view from the apartment window is pretty unbeatable.\n And the thing is, it is not an expensive place to stay. To put it in perspective, the month before our visit to Europe I was billeted at Grandma's B&B in Watervale (Clare Valley). The views were to the Main North Road and, from the bathroom, the forecourt of the Camilleri family's Watervale Garage. The cost: about the same – $200 a night out of season. And a bottle of the house Chianti Classico costs just €11! Oenologist Federico Cerelli is making some delicious wine.\nAnd from the front gate of Gabbiano it's easy driving distance to Siena, San Gimignano, and several beautiful golf courses, while the shopping in Florence isn't bad either – just don't take the car where you shouldn't. And it's really easy – and affordable – to get sidetracked by lots of good glasses of sangiovese.\n* We drove from Florence to Bologna – in teeming rain – and it is not an experience I ever want again. The autostrada is two lanes pretty much all the way and chock-a-block with trucks throughout. Take the train.\nWHAT TO DRINK: REDS OF TUSCAN PERSUASION\nGabbiano Chianti Classico 2012 (Tuscany, Italy)\nCedary, cherry stone, terra cotta stuff, a sniff of fennel with air – sangiovese through and through. Succulent plummy tastes up-front on the tongue, and easier tannins than expected, before bitter orange and black cherry to finish. Has that Chianti cut. Toothsome red. 91/100, $30\nPizzini Il Barone 2012 (Beechworth & King Valley, Vic)\nDark plum pudding, baked fruit on the nose, unfolds well in the glass – gets really deep. Has considerable fruit-power in the mouth, with fruitcake and gentle spice, and chiselled coal tannins. There's blackness but also brightness. A few more years to show its best. 93(94)/100, $45\nZonte's Footstep Canto di Lago Sangiovese Barbera 2012 (Adelaide, SA)\nMaraschino cherry smells, gets black plummy as it opens. Smells Italianate. There's a decent belt of dark fruit on the palate and it builds very sangiovese tannins. Has lip-smackingness and that bitter orange-peel tightness. Bitey at the back. 90/100, $17.99 (Nicks)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:06:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
