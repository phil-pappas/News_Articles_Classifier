Ms Relief and Mission is a contracted passenger transfer services provider by the Kenya Airports Authority vide letter Ref; KAA /JKIA/752 dated 9th May, 2014,\" the letter stated. \nThe letter further indicated that the bus was cleared to be imported duty free. \n\"They are importing an apron bus for conveyance of passengers at the runway. Details of the consignment are contained in invoice No:- 290028733 dated 20th June, 2014. You are therefore advised to allow clearance of the equipment on duty free basis in accordance with the provisions of the 5th schedule Part B item 1 (b) (iv) of the East African Community Customs Management Act, 2004,\" it stated. \nThe saga has cost three top KAA officials their jobs, including Lucy Mbugua who was sacked from the Managing Director's post. \nThe contract for the buses operation at the airport was cancelled last week by KAA Chairman David Kimaiyo. \nOn Tuesday, Kihara said the concessionaire did not pay the requisite duty to the Kenya Revenue Authority. \nKihara said one shuttle bus made by Portuguese manufacturer - Cobus Industries - costs about Sh45 million, according to copies of invoices and Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) tax receipts. \nHe told the Parliamentary Transport Committee, that the sacked MD did not also get approval of the board in undertaking the project. \nKAA Chairman David Kimaiyo told the committee that the concessionaire - Relief & Mission Logistics - had invoiced the authority some Sh42 million. 1 | 2 \nMbugua was fired last week, alongside two other senior officials, including the General Manager of Finance, John Thumbi and the acting airport Engineer, Christopher Warutere. \nThe move came after President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered the arrest of those involved in the leasing of the five-ramp passenger buses at Sh10 million per month. \nThe buses whose tender approval was sought and granted in 2011 were acquired through an open tender later awarded to Relief & Mission Logistics at cost of $120,000 per month. \nThe need for the special buses was heightened after the airport design changed when remote stands were constructed following the August 2013 inferno. This meant that all international arrivals had to be bussed. \nIn the arrangement, KAA would charge the airlines for the use of the buses and any deficit between the collections and the amount payable to the concessionaire was to be financed by the authority from the budget provision of Sh75 million throughout the eight-year concession period.
