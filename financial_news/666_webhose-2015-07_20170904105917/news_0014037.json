You may have to pay 55pc tax on your pension HMRC has disqualified thousands of overseas pension schemes that could previously accept transfers from British schemes The number of qualifying Australian schemes has been decimated from 1,600 to just one. Photo: Alamy Comments \nThousands of Britons who move abroad each year may struggle to take their pension with them without suffering a 55pc tax charge after HMRC slashed the number of overseas schemes authorised to take their money. \nHMRC has published an updated list of \"qualifying, recognised overseas pension schemes\" (QROPS) which showed a drastic reduction in the number available to savers. \nThis is particularly true of Australian schemes which have plunged in number from 1,600 to just one. \nThe number of Swiss schemes has fallen from 100 to one, French from 34 to four, Spanish from 16 to two, and American from 12 to two. In total, the previous list of around 3,800 schemes has been cut to around 660. \nSavers who transfer their pension to a non-qualifying scheme will face a 55pc tax charge, imposed by HMRC, on the money in the pot. \nEarlier this year HMRC wrote to overseas schemes that accept UK transfers warning that they must comply with the new pension freedom rules which came into force on April 6. \nUnder the new rules, which allow savers to take their whole pension pot as cash, pension schemes must prohibit members from accessing their savings before the age of 55, unless the member is retiring early due to ill-health. \nMany overseas schemes allow under-55s to take some of their funds early in some circumstances, such is if they are suffering financial hardship. They are unlikely to change their rules to accommodate the UK requirements because this would disadvantage their local members. \nSchemes had until June 17 to respond and last month HMRC suspended the list of qualifying schemes due to concerns that many breached the new rules. \nJames McLeod, of financial advice firm AES International, said anyone who transferred their pension prior to April 6 will not face the tax charge. \nThose who initiated a transfer after April 6 should contact their QROPS provider and ask whether the tax charge will apply. In some cases there may still be time to cancel the transfer. \nThe Australian Treasury is understood to be involved in detailed discussions with HMRC about relief for transfers completed after April 6 but not later than April 17, when HMRC first wrote to schemes about the changes. The two parties are also discussing the options for schemes that want to requalify but can't meet the age 55 rule. \nJon Greer, pensions technical expert at Old Mutual Wealth, said he expects a lot of the schemes that have been cut from the list to reappear in the coming weeks and months. \n“It appears that providers have been caught off guard with limited time to make the required changes,” he said. “I’m sure providers will accommodate HMRC’s requirements where feasible, and if they can’t accommodate the changes, possibly due to the impact on other scheme members, they may look for alternative solutions, such as creating a new recognised overseas pension scheme where the scheme rules limit access in line with the minimum age requirement.” What is a QROPS? \nA qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme is authorised to accept transfers from UK pension schemes. There are currently more than 3,500 QROPS schemes around the world. \nThey are popular with British expats who move abroad permanently and a large number are based in Australia and New Zealand. \nMost pensions can be transferred to a QROPS as long as an annuity has not been purchased or, if it’s a final salary scheme, the pension has not commenced. You cannot transfer British Government or State pensions. \nYou will almost certainly need advice from a specialist in moving pension savings, who would up-to-date on which schemes would and would not incur a tax charge. \nQROPS allow savers to make the most of valuable tax reliefs while working and saving into their pension in the United Kingdom, then if they move abroad for at least five years they pay income tax on their pension at the local rate, which is often lower than in the UK. \nExpats must be careful when moving their money however. If they transfer their UK pension savings to an unauthorised scheme they will have to pay up to 55pc tax on the transfer. \n>> The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter \n>> Sending money overseas?
