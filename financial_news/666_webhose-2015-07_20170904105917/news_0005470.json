Outflows are now running at 8 per cent of GDP, a swing of 14 per cent of GDP. \nThis suggests that even a strong rebound in oil prices might not be enough to prevent further falls in the country’s FX reserves.

Rather obviously revenues have been hit by oil prices falling below the $105 a barrel Riyadh needs to balance its books. \nHowever expenditure has also been pushed up by bonus payments handed out to state employees and the military by the new king, Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, who was crowned in January. \nThis at least gives hope that the budget deficit will be somewhat smaller in 2016, assuming the handouts are not repeated. \nBeyond that, Mr Tuvey believes Riyadh can ride out low oil prices for two or three years, and can therefore afford to tighten fiscal policy relatively gradually, rather than dramatically slashing spending as it did when oil prices tumbled in the 1980s. \nHe also believes there is room for tax rises. At present Saudi nationals pay no income tax, other than a mandatory charitable donation of 2.5 per cent of their wages, known as zakat. The kingdom also has no valued added tax, despite periodic talk of a Gulf-wide system being established. \nWhen it comes to spending cuts, he sees the axe falling on capital expenditure, which accounts for about a third of public spending, just over 10 per cent of GDP. \nRiyadh has form here. In the early to mid-1990s it slashed capital spending by 98.6 per cent in the wake of the first Gulf war. \nJohn Sfakianakis, director for the Gulf region at Ashmore Investment Management, agrees with this prognosis, but says Riyadh should also cut down on military expenditure, which accounts for a further 34 per cent of government spending. \nWhether this will happen at a time when Saudi Arabia is engaged in military action in Yemen, when Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, known as Isis, is operating close to its borders, and when Iran may be newly strengthened by rapprochement with the west, is a moot point. \nThe Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, the central bank, did reveal on Sunday that the government had issued its first bonds since 2007, raising $4bn from local investors. \nThe country has ample room to go down this route, with gross government debt standing at just 1.6 per cent of GDP at the end of last year, a far cry from the 100 per cent-plus levels reached in the 1990s. \nThe small size of the bond issuance, set against a projected budget deficit of $130bn, though, raises questions of its own. \nMr Sfakianakis believes part of the purpose is to help create a yield curve for corporate debt issuance. But Sama has yet to reveal either the yield or tenor of the debt, rather defeating this purpose. \nMr Sfakianakis speculates the paper was of “medium to long-term” duration and was snapped up by banks at a yield of about 25-30 basis points above US Treasuries. \nHe suggests the bond issuance may also have been designed to take “a little bit of excess liquidity” out of the banking system, to fulfil a promise from the ministry of finance that it would issue bonds this year and to “test the market” for future issuance. \nMarios Maratheftis, chief economist at Standard Chartered, believes Riyadh will go further and issue bonds to international investors, building on the government’s recent move to start opening its equity market to outsiders. \nWhatever happens, Mr Tuvey foresees the likelihood of growth slowing to 1 per cent or less, from its current level of 2.4 per cent, barring a rebound in oil prices. \nWith its population growing at almost 3 per cent a year, this would equate to a fall in living standards and potentially increase unemployment, currently at 11.7 per cent. \nGiven the long-term shadow the spectre of climate change casts over oil producers, some will worry what the future holds if a young, fast-growing, religiously conservative population finds its economic options limited. \nFollow us on Twitter @em_sqrd Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
