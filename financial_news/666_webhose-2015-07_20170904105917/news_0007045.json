Ray Boulger of mortgage brokers John Charcol says an investor with a five-year fixed-rate mortgage of £120,000 against a buy-to-let property worth £200,000 could see their profits evaporate almost entirely. He suggests that if the rent is around £750 a month, and the landlord is also paying letting agency fees and putting aside money for repairs and renewals, the annual profit under the new tax regime will collapse from £1,322 a year to just £472 – a fall of 64%.\nOther figures for typical buy-to-let mortgage deals prepared for Guardian Money by London & Country Mortgages and SPF Private Clients also show similar steep declines in landlord returns.\nThe tax changes make the underlying “yield” on buy-to-let worse than leaving the money in the bank, even with the current miserable returns on deposit accounts. In the example above of the £200,000 house, where the investor has stumped up £80,000 as a deposit, Boulger calculates the annual return after tax at just 0.6%, which is substantially below current “best-buy” savings accounts paying 3% interest (equal to 1.8% a year for a higher-rate taxpayer).\nBoulger reckons investors will switch to cheaper, but riskier, two-year fixed-rate deals to cut interest costs.\nOthers are recommending investors avoid tax by placing their portfolios inside limited companies. Simon Checkley of brokers Private Finance says: “Long-term buy-to-let investors might decide to build their portfolio within a limited company structure, although there are financing [fewer lenders] and tax issues to be considered.” Those landlords who are able to may also shift the ownership over to a spouse, who may enjoy a lower rate of tax, says David Lawrenson of Letting Focus.\nOlder investors who have been considering using new freedoms to use their pension cash as they like, may now be deterred from investing in buy-to-let. One major investor in London buy-to-let, LCP, says: “The tax will cause some landlords to offload stock and discourage new ones from entering the market. It could lead to property prices falling.”\nWill rents simply rise to pay for the loss of tax relief, as suggested by many other major landlords? Betsy Dillner, director of campaign group Generation Rent, says: “Because of the housing shortage, landlords are already charging the highest rents they can get away with, so the market won’t bear any attempt to push them up any further.”\n‘It will drive rents up,’ says millionaire landlord\nRents will rise because of the buy-to-let changes, says Fergus Wilson, Britain’s most controversial big landlord who at one time owned more than 1,000 homes in the Maidstone and Ashford areas in Kent.\n“The reduction [in tax relief] is effectively an increase in my mortgage payment, but direct to Mr Taxman rather than the lender. It will put some intended buy-to-let investors off completely, but the large investor will take it in his stride and I suspect it will drive rents upwards to compensate.\n“It will always be a case of supply and demand, and with an ever-increasing volume of tenants the rent will go up. There is only one answer to the country’s problem and that is to build more houses.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Multi-property owner Fergus Wilson. Photograph: Rex Features “If a landlord purchases a house suitable for letting he is depriving a young couple and their child [from buying the home], but is renting to a young couple and their child. Buy-to-let does not put any more properties in to the marketplace, nor does it take them out of the marketplace.\n“In Maidstone I have no houses available to rent. I would say 80% of my Maidstone houses are rented to Hungarians, with the other 20% to Romanian, Latvian, Polish, Estonian and other east Europeans.\n“As far as Ashford is concerned there is a shortage of properties for sale either for owner-occupation or buy-to-let.”\nLast year Wilson caused uproar after it was revealed he was evicting tenants on housing benefit .\nBut he remains unrepentant. “If you are on housing benefit then I suggest you get yourself off, otherwise the house choices are greatly diminished. Make sure you qualify for a rent guarantee. Being on benefits is no longer a career option. If you have a zero-hours job, get another job!”\nWilson also offered advice to Guardian readers who want to become property investors. His top recommendation? Keep the local estate agents sweet by paying them a large “tip”. He told us: “Go to your friendly estate agent and tell them you want to know about any two-bed mid-terrace house in Park Farm [the estate in Ashford where Wilson began his property empire] immediately after they take instructions. Say: ‘I have £500 in readies for your pocket!’\n“That is what I used to do in Ashford in 2002-2007. I paid the market price but gave a £500 tip. Also, I said: ‘If you cross me and sell me a pup, there will be no more £500.’ Now Mr and Mrs Guardian Reader, I am a telling you the tricks of the trade. If you want to get anywhere in life, jingle the coins. I am sorry if it offends, but money talks.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Osborne+drops+tax+bombshell+that+will+wipe+out+bulk+of+buy-to-let+profits&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4agy6%2Fstw%23img-1", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Osborne+drops+tax+bombshell+that+will+wipe+out+bulk+of+buy-to-let+profits&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmoney%2F2015%2Fjul%2F11%2Fbuy-to-let-budget-tax-profits-mortgage&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F10%2F1436543443956%2F06a48ecb-d42c-4b45-b874-1553962656d5-1360x2040.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4agy6%2Fsfb%23img-1&ref=responsive"], "published": "2015-07-11T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T09:15:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
