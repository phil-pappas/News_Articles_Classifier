More Volkswagen sales nudge past Toyota \nThe $1bn plan is the largest investment by a global auto group in India since 2011, and makes GM the latest player to double down in a market that is set to become the world’s third largest by volume over the next decade. \nIndia represents one of the biggest challenges in Ms Barra’s plans to keep pace with rivals Toyota and Volkswagen by promoting GM's Chevrolet brand in fast-growing developing nations. \nThe US-based group’s market share in India sank from 4 per cent in 2011 to just 2 per cent last year, despite having invested $1bn in the country since 1996. It has endured a string of sales flops with mid-market vehicles that failed to chime with budget-conscious Indian customers. \n“GM cannot remain a global leader without making a serious commitment to expanding our presence in growth markets like India,” Ms Barra said. \nThe group plans to launch 10 “locally produced” Chevrolet vehicles in India over the next 5 years, while moving to close its facility at Halol in the western state of Gujarat by the end of 2016. \nIn its place, GM will expand its plant in the neighbouring state of Maharashtra, increasing capacity from 130,000 vehicles to 220,000 by 2025. About a third of that production will be exported, as the group seeks to turn India into a production base for other emerging economies around Asia. \nAlthough rivals including Ford and VW have also struggled to recoup their heavy investments in India , GM’s performance has been “by far the worst” of the global car groups, according to Deepesh Rathore, co-founder of New Delhi-based research group Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors. \n“There is something fundamentally wrong with the Chevy brand in India, which customers just aren’t connecting with,” he said. “That is something the company can’t fix overnight — it will have to be a long, steady fightback.” \nWednesday’s announcement marks the latest stage in dramatic changes to GM’s global production plans, as it pulls back from smaller markets such as Indonesia and Thailand, and refocuses on larger nations, notably Brazil, China, Mexico and India. \nGM said it aimed to double its market share in India by 2020, a goal that would in effect only see it make up ground lost over the past five years to more successful rivals such as Honda of Japan and Hyundai of South Korea, which produce smaller, cheaper vehicles more suited to Indian tastes. \nIt also plans to cut costs by “localising” production through increased use of domestic suppliers, while expanding its domestic dealer network to improve customer service levels — an important consideration for customers on India’s bumpy roads.
