Operating profit fell 7 percent to 76.56 billion yen ($619 million) from the same period a year prior, compared with the 92.7 billion yen average estimate of 19 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.\n\"Overall, we have a good impression of corporate earnings,\" said Kazuhiro Miyake, chief strategist at Daiwa Securities. \"We expect that Japanese companies' April-June profits will see 20 percent increases on the year on average.\"\nBrokerages were higher as well, with Nomura Holdings rising 5.0 percent and Daiwa Securities adding 6.5 percent after reporting strong quarterly results.\nThe broader Topix rose 1.1 percent to 1,651.63, with 31 of its 33 subsectors rising.\nThe JPX-Nikkei Index 400 advanced 1.1 percent to 14,900.84.\n(Reporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Eric Meijer)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T05:36:43.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
