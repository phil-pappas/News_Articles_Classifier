Bloomberg But the certainty of iron ore's return to an orbit of its long-run average pricing has been baked into long-run business plans at the Australian majors for at least three years and that is why they are so far ahead of the structural price and cost deflation that is currently being expressed across a broad spectrum of the minerals and metals sector.\nThere is no reason to doubt that there is a connection between the wild retreat of the Chinese equity markets and these precipitous times in the bulk commodities and terminal traded metals markets. Where we see only industrial raw materials, Chinese operators see solid forms of US dollar denominated liquidity that can be traded with a whole lot less state oversight than the currency itself.\nWhen sharemarkets go bung, there are always some speculators left in very urgent need of capital. That inevitability is rather amplified when a government intervenes in the market to prevent the sale of some classes of assets. If you need cash and you can't sell equities, then you will exhaust other options.\nThis is the point of contact where the gyrations of China's equities has infected other markets that might well be built on foundations more solid than the untrammelled animal spirits of China's newly urbanised punting classes. China's attempt to recover control of its bursting equity market bubble has merely spread the pain.\n There has been speculation aplenty over recent days that a large class of independent Chinese industrial entrepreneurs has been caught very short by the turmoil in local and regional equities markets and, as a result, long positions in raw materials like iron ore, copper and aluminium are being liquidated without prejudice.\nThe new normal But it needs to be understood that, as much as Wednesday's 10.1 per cent fall in the price of iron ore illustrates this contagion classic effect , it stands, too, as an expression of the recovered normal for Australia's most important export.\nFrom August 2012, the folk at BHP have been talking about price-mean reversion. Well, this is what reversion looks like. Iron ore has smashed through previous historic lows in the post-annual pricing market that began in 2009. Market theory would suggest it is likely to go further yet and to linger at lower levels for some time.\nAfter a period of spectacularly high prices there is no other way to recover long-run means without overshooting on the downside.\nAnd what is that long-run mean? Well, about $US55 a tonne.\nCiti has forecast that iron ore will trade at a quarterly average of between $US42 and $US38 over the next six quarters. There is no particular reason to question that possibility.\nIn its third-quarter commodities wrap, Citi offers some seriously informative studies on the current standing of Chinese steel demand, supply and the profitability of the steel makers. Each serves to explain the structural rather than the momentary pressures in the raw materials markets.\nMeasured month on month, Chinese steel demand has fallen back to 2011 levels. Demand in April was 10 per cent lower than in April last year. As a result Chinese steel production has fallen. Through May and June it has tracked 2013 volumes. Through March and April it drifted all the way back to 2011 levels. But the net result is that China is producing ever more steel than it needs and that product is seeping onto export markets, and margins for rebar and hot roller coil have, as a result, fallen off a cliff.\nLast October we asked BHP's iron ore president Jimmy Wilson where we might expect the iron ore price to end up given the certainty that the market was headed into an extended period of over-supply. Wilson advised us to study the cost curve, to identify the highest cost major producer and to work on the basis that future pricing would be set by the cost of its most marginal tonnes.\nThere remains live debate over what that marginal cost is and who owns it. The Australian candidate is Fortescue Metals Group. The other contender is Brazil's iron ore monster Vale.\nVale is expected to produce about 340 million tonnes this year at an average cost of maybe $US43 a tonne. Fortescue will run its spanking new system at about 165 million tonnes this year and it claims a break-even price of $US39 a tonne.\nThe first point to make about those numbers is that both would have higher-cost tonnes in their portfolios and those tonnes would be extremely marginal at Wednesday's closing record low of $US44.59 a tonne.\nThe second thing is that Vale is about to enter a new lower-cost era through the introduction of about 90 million tonnes of exceptionally low-cost tonnes from its S11D expansion. That will likely leave Fortescue the owner of the most marginal tonnes among the majors.\nTheoretically at least, there is a considerable dilemma in being the highest cost producer at a time of structural over-supply. The risk ahead is that Fortescue's cost of production becomes a very transparent price floor for the market and that all the benefits of the Third Force's cost cutting leach directly to the customer.\nThere is evidence enough out there to suggest that this is something more than theory. This potential would certainly explain, for example, Andrew Forrest's agitation at the determination of Rio, BHP and Vale to stick to their individual plans to ramp up production in the face of obviously slowing Chinese demand.\nFrom the majors' perspective, the strategy is all about driving to the lowest point of the cost curve and the best way to do that is to run mines, trains and ports at designed capacity. As a result Rio and BHP will collectively add maybe 60 million tonnes to annual output over the next three years while Vale will grow its net output by 70 million tonnes by 2018. Over that time Fortescue will do well to just to sustain itself at 165 or so.\nAs for the rest, well, no one in the industry wants to say it, but there will doubtless be blood on the floor before mean reversion runs its course.\nTake plucky Atlas Iron, for example. Having done a deal with its service providers, Atlas has somehow managed to drive its break-even production price from $US85 a tonne last year to $US51 a tonne now. Chief executive David Flanagan has said the business can survive a $US46 a tonne price. But both the current market and the likes of Citi are saying that will not be enough.\nFlanagan is presently attempting to raise $180 million in new capital to sustain a business that owes $340 million and that briefly suspended production in April when iron ore slipped through the $US50 a tonne threshold.\nApparently Flanagan is talking up India as the next big hope of the Australian industry, saying it will start driving a recovery in seaborne demand in three years. There are informed counter-views that suggest India's steel intensity is unlikely to reach anything likes the heights traditionally associated with economic progress.\nBut, even if Flanagan is right, you really have to wonder whether Atlas and that fleet of fellow boom-time juniors such as BC Iron, Arrium and Mount Gibson will have the financial staying power to see that new dawn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:05:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
