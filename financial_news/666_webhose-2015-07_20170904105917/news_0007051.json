This process of emotional restoration increased players’ enjoyment of both games. However, those players who highly enjoyed the violent game showed a tendency to perceive the world in a more hostile way than those who played the nonviolent game.\nThe findings suggest that video games can be used to manage negative emotions, but doing so with violent games might be problematic. If video games are going to be sought for emotional release, the authors recommend players seek out nonviolent games.\nThe results are published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior.\n 11, 2015 6:25 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T04:53:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
