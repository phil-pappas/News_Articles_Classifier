Dominic Lorrimer by Ewin Hannan Workplace editor Tony Abbott is spending tens of millions of taxpayers dollars on a royal commission that is designed to politically damage Bill Shorten and the ALP as well as weaken unions. That is a given.\nBut the commission is also shining light into the cosy and questionable dealings between some of the nation's leading companies and more prominent unions.\nSecretive agreements involving hundreds of thousands of dollars, disguised employment arrangements, and apparently bogus union invoices willingly paid by employers were features of the commission's cross examination of Shorten this week.\nMany of these practices would sit uneasily with voters who would regard them with scepticism, if not suspicion. Of course, this is the Coalition's intent as it pursues its publicly-funded crusade to discredit unions and reinforce negative perceptions about Shorten's union past. But what is less discussed is how employers enter into arrangements that directly benefit unions and not necessarily the company employees who are union members.\nUnibilt disclosure Shorten was embarrassed after the disclosure he failed until this week to declare payments of up to $63,777 from a labour hire company, Unibilt, to pay the wages in 2007 of his campaign director, Lance Wilson.\nShorten depicted the arrangement as the result of just another company wanting to make a political \"donation\" to his campaign to enter politics. Nothing to see here apparently.\nBut Shorten's union, the Australian Workers Union, drew up a contract wrongly describing the political staffer as a Unibilt research officer, while payment of Wilson's wages was later made via the AWU issuing invoices.\n The deal was only declared by Shorten once he knew he would be questioned publicly by the commission.\nThe most generous interpretation is that it was unorthodox and lacked transparency. Another suggestion made by the commission is that Shorten used his position as a union leader for financial advantage by allowing a private company to help pay for his campaign to enter Parliament. Unsurprisingly, Shorten vehemently rejected the suggestion.\nTelling insights Much of the case being pressed against Shorten involves the payment of hundreds of thousands of dollars by companies to the AWU during his time as the union's Victorian and then national secretary. After being rebuked over his evidence by royal commissioner Dyson Heydon, Shorten did provide some telling insights into how employers and unions do business.\nGrilled by counsel assisting the commission, Jeremy Stoljar, about $300,000 in payments made to the AWU by Thiess John Holland, the joint venture builder of the $2.5 billion Eastlink project, Shorten said: \"What I can guarantee you, Mr Stoljar, is that anything which I would have done on that site or any site would be to make sure we were providing services for our members and it is absolutely standard practice to seek employers to pay for services that unions provide to their members.\"\nSo according to the Labor leader, it was \"absolutely standard practice\" to try and get employers to give vast amounts of money to a union. But it was also a practice that lacked transparency and exposed him to conflict of interest claims, a charge again denied by Shorten.\nIf was all above board and \"standard practice\", shouldn't such arrangements be detailed in the relevant enterprise agreement? Would it not be appropriate for members affected to be directly consulted and be asked to vote on such arrangements?\nDeal struck Based on what has emerged thus far, documents suggest Thiess John Holland and the AWU struck a deal at the start of the Eastlink project in 2005 where $100,000 plus GST would be provided annually to the union for three years. The way it worked was that the AWU would send invoices for various \"services\" as a way of the joint venture builder paying the annual global amount in instalments.\nOne of the problems for Shorten is that it appears, in some cases, that Thiess John Holland paid money for services that were not delivered. A notable example is that the AWU invoiced $30,000 to back injury research. There has been no documentary evidence provided to show the research was done.\nIn an email to Shorten's successor, Cesar Melhem, in March 2008, Thiess John Holland provided a breakdown of the \"agreed amount\" of $110,000 including GST. Tellingly, it said it was paying the union $10,082 for Red Card training despite acknowledging that \"it would have cost us nothing because John Holland run it\". In other words, the company paid the union for a service that was not provided by the union.\nUnion dues Shorten was also questioned, albeit briefly, over why a builder, Winslow Constructors, had paid the union dues of workers to the AWU under his leadership. This was not a company paying dues after deducting them from the pay of employees, rather it was the builder providing a direct financial benefit to the union by paying the dues of employees directly to the union.\nIt is in the industrial and political interests of unions to have higher membership. It gives unions aligned to the Labor Party greater influence in the ALP.\nBut employers are not funding union memberships, and making significant payments to unions, out of a sense of solidarity with organised labour. Thiess John Holland wanted to deal with the AWU rather than the more militant Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union that it feared would more likely disrupt the Eastlink project. Other civil construction companies paid AWU membership dues because they wanted to keep out the CFMEU from their workplaces.\nAll this feeds into a long-held perception that bosses preferred to deal with the AWU because they were regarded as more industrially compliant. The commission is working away at portraying Shorten as being a beneficiary of opaque and dubious dealings when he was AWU leader. But couldn't the same charge be levelled at the employers involved? If these employers ever take the stand publicly, and, for instance, Stoljar implies they are engaging in commercial bribery, will Dyson Heydon respond to any evasive answers by reprimanding them for not being credible witnesses?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T14:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:03:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
