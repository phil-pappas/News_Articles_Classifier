Supplied Share on twitter by John Davidson The way I see it, there are two equally grave risks attached to borrowing a Leica Q to test drive.\nOne is that it slips out of your hands and you smash it on the ground – it's not the easiest camera in the world to grip – leaving you on the hook for the $5900 it costs to buy a replacement.\nThe other is that you fall in love with it and have no choice but to buy it, leaving you on the hook not just for the $5900 but also for the $500 or so for the suite of leather cases that this old-school camera richly deserves and badly needs due to that aforementioned lack of grippiness.\nA week into our test drive, we haven't dropped our Leica Q, touch wood. But if we don't send it back soon, we'll be stuck with that $6400 bill. Where's the courier when you desperately need him? Get thee behind me, Leica!\nThe Leica Q, a full-frame digital camera designed to operate much like the legendary Leica rangefinder cameras of yesteryear, is brilliant. It's the camera we hoped last year's Leica T would be, but wasn't. It's the camera we're dying for Fujifilm to make (for half the price), by putting a full-frame image sensor and a slightly faster lens into its terrific X100T.\nBut saying that it's brilliant, and suggesting you should run out and buy one, are two quite separate things. Even ignoring the price tag, the Leica Q is quite a niche camera. It's got a wide-angle, 28mm f1.7 lens, which encourages a candid, \"street\" style of photography that involves the photographer getting closer to the action than a lot of people feel comfortable with. It's got a set of controls that, despite the camera's full set of automated options and its impressively fast autofocus, encourages a slower, more thoughtful approach to photography that simply won't appeal to a lot of users.\nThat said, all you have to do is borrow one for a few days, and you start to come around to the thoughtful style of photography that the Leica Q encourages.\nAs I mentioned, the Leica Q has got the usual array of modern \"portrait\" and \"sports\" modes that you'll find on most cameras nowadays, but on this one they feel like an after-thought, so much so that in our tests they didn't seem to have much effect – portrait mode and sports mode took pretty well identical photos, with the same ISO, the same shutter speed and the same aperture setting, when you might expect at least some of those settings to differ – and so much so that, when we asked a Leica product specialist to help us figure out why the various pre-programmed auto modes weren't working as we expected, he confessed he had never used them.\n It seems Leica is expecting you to leave the camera into PASM mode – program, aperture-priority, speed-priority and manual – and then use the old-style aperture and shutter speed dials, and the old-style focusing ring on the lens, to select just how manually you want to shoot. Leica Q is very much about good old-fashioned photography where you know what is needed and how to achieve it, and in this regard the camera absolutely excels.\nThe controls on the camera are marvellous. Manual focus is achieved by turning a focus ring on the lens that is so perfectly damped down, manually focusing feels like a first class citizen again. Of course, you still get the modern focusing aids, such as peaking and magnification, though it does sadly lack the split-image focusing that Fujifilm has been adding to its old-school cameras.\nThere's also a focus guide on the lens, just like in the old days, that tells you what depth of field you will get at a given aperture setting. This guide is more useful than you might think – autofocus isn't always the best option, you know! – especially when you consider that the rear LCD screen on the Leica Q doesn't tilt up, or down, or in any way whatsoever. If you want to shoot subtle street photos from hip height – something the almost completely silent camera also encourages – there's no way to check the focus by looking at the screen, so you have to rely on that focus guide on the lens, just as photographers did for generations. It's not hard, and in a week of shooting plenty of photos from the hip, it never let us down.\nComposition from the hip is made easier by that 28mm lens, which is the perfect length for quick snaps due to its wide, wide angle that captures just about everything in the general vicinity of the front of the camera.\nSuch a short lens won't exactly be everyone's cup of tea, of course, especially if you're looking for a camera to shoot portraits of your family and friends. At a 28mm focal length, heads can end up looking positively bulbous if you're not careful, and noone in your family will thank you for your handiwork. That said, I used to own a Ricoh GR1 film camera, which also had a 28mm lens, and many of my favourite portrait shots from that part of my life were shot with that camera rather than the more portrait-oriented, medium-format gear I owned. There's something intimate about such a short focal length, something journalistic, and if you use the Leica Q right the results can be one you will treasure.\nIf you don't treasure the photos, you can always offload the camera on me. The couriers will be here any minute and I'm sending my one back before it's too late.\nLikes: Back to basics controls are spot on. Brilliant electronic viewfinder.\nDislikes: Twice ran flat overnight after automatic power down.\nPrice: $5900 plus leather cases.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DLLabs"], "published": "2015-07-15T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:06:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
