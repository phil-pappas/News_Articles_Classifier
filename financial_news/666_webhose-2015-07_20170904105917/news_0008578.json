Santander beat competition from Wall Street firms including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley, said people familiar with the talks, and will work alongside UBS Group AG and Bank of America Corp.\n“If we had not been a long-standing partner, we would never have got the mandate,” said Georg Orssich, Santander’s global head of corporate and investment banking. “It’s a deal with an unusual amount of visibility. There is a very strong relationship there.”\nSantander’s late chairman Emilio Botin and Luca di Montezemolo, the former chairman of Ferrari , signed a deal in Monza, Italy, six years ago allowing the lender, which shares the same red corporate livery as the “scuderia,” to have its brand name displayed on the marque’s racing cars.\nIPO Challenge The partnership -- for an undisclosed amount -- is now paying off in a business dominated by investment banks that dwarf the Spanish competitor.\nSantander ranked 28th in managing global equity offerings over the past decade, paling in comparison with its partners on the deal. The bank has managed 128 stock sales to underwrite stock for $31 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nUBS has worked on more than 2,100 offerings for $387 billion and Bank of America has worked on about 1,800 deals for $287 billion in the same period.\nFerrari shares are set to begin trading in New York later this year.\nWhile the bank is close to Spanish companies and deals in its home country, where it plays an active role, getting a major mandate in deals outside Spain, Portugal, the U.K. or Brazil remains a challenge, people familiar with the bank said.\n“We also bring to the table some regions where we can place this Ferrari paper that some others were not able to -- mainly Latin America, Europe and I would also say the Middle East,” Orssich said.\nSantander was one of the bookrunners on the $4.8 billion IPO of Aena SA in January and the $6.6 billion sale of Iberdrola Renovables SA in 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nA spokesman for Ferrari declined to comment, as did officials for JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.\n‘Deep’ Tie Santander renewed its sponsorship of the Ferrari brand with its storied prancing horse symbol in 2012 through 2017.\nWith its shared brand color and association with sometime Ferrari drivers from two of its main markets in the Brazilian Felipe Massa and the Spaniard Fernando Alonso, the sponsorship deal lured Santander and its Formula 1-mad late chairman Botin.\nFerrari tweeted its condolences to Botin’s family when he died and a racing car stands outside Santander’s sprawling corporate offices outside Madrid.\n“I would assume there was never any question that Santander was going to have a role on the IPO,” said Ricardo Wehrhahn, a managing partner at Intral Strategy Execution, a banking and business consulting firm in Madrid. “The relationship they have is very deep.”\nWhether it leads to Santander winning more global IPO mandates is uncertain, as large companies look for investment banks able to tap investors from Asia to the U.S.\nSantander has also explored strategic options for its equity brokerage business that could lead to the sale of part or all of the division, people with knowledge of the matter said in June. An exit from broking would affect how the bank sells stock on IPOs in the future.\n“It will be hard for them to jump ahead in the league table just by winning a role in this deal,” said Amiyatosh Purnanandam, professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. Still, it “highlights an interesting aspect of IPO business -- banks with prior relationship with the brand might have an advantage in landing a role in the syndicate when the brand goes public.”", "external_links": ["http://formula1.ferrari.com/en/partners/banco-santander/\\"], "published": "2015-07-29T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T17:09:31.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
