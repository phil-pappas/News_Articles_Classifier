By Ben Wright | Telegraph – 34 minutes ago Print \nSyriza has long wanted a political solution to the crisis. One way or another, it is about to get one. \nIt is entirely possible to argue, without diminishing the symbolism of the overwhelming No vote in the Greek referendum and the resignation of Yanis Varoufakis as finance minister, that very little has changed in the last 24 hours. \n• Greece crisis live - EU and ECB set to decide Greek's fate \nAfter all, we already knew that Greece was fed up with austerity and the demands of its creditors. That is why the country elected Syriza in January on a vow to renegotiate the country’s bail-outs. Equally, while European politicians may be glad to see the back of Varoufakis, who they branded an amateur and a gambler, it is worth remembering that he stepped back as Greece’s chief negotiator in April to be replaced by Euclid Tsakalotos . \nThe Oxford-educated economist may look and sound very different from Varoufakis but he is no new broom. He has been a member of the Syriza party for more than a decade and an MP in the Greek parliament since 2012. That year he gave an interview in which he said: “I don’t think any monetary union can work if there isn’t some kind of subsidy to poorer regions.” \nAnd there you have it. \nEuclid Tsakalotos \nYes, Greece’s debt burden is unsustainable and, yes, it needs to be restructured. But to do so would be to turn the currency bloc into a transfer union in which taxes raised in better-off countries pay for the benefits in less well-off countries. \nIt is hard to argue that the currency union would make more economic sense if it was also a transfer union; it is impossible to argue that Greece would be better off if that was the case. \nThere are just two small problems none of the other eurozone countries agree with this analysis (publicly at least), and the current rules and treaties don't allow for it. \nThis is why Greece has tried to bypass the Troika, marginalise the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers and appeal directly to heads of state (and Angela Merkel in particular). Equally, it is why those heads of state hid behind institutions such as the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund which don’t have the political authority to change the rules or even to bring the crisis to a head. \nThe result was a series of deadlines so flexible as to be non-existent and the can being kicked so far down the road that it has circumnavigated the globe and ended up back at the start line. \nAngela Merkel \nSo now we are faced, as we were 24 hours ago, with three choices: the first is that Greece concedes defeat and accepts the creditor demands; the second is that the creditors cave in and the eurozone becomes a transfer union; the third is that Greece leaves the euro. \nBut it would be churlish to argue that the resounding No vote changes nothing at all. It makes the first of those three options far less likely it would be borderline impossible for Syriza to back down now. \nThis means that, by definition, it more likely that the eurozone is on the brink of being irrevocably altered: either the rules will change or one of its members will leave. The referendum result places the ball even more firmly in the court of Angela Merkel and the other heads of state. They can't continue to hide. \nSyriza has long wanted a political solution to the crisis. One way or another, it is about to get one. \n• Nigel Farage: The EU is dying before our eyes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T14:25:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
