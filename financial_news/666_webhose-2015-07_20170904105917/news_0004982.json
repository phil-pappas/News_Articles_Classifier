People are cottoning on to the idea that helicopter's the way to go, because you can get back into the city in five minutes,\" Heli-Serv event manager Ashleigh Romanjuk said.\nTravel by chopper may be a questionable indulgence for an MP on the way to a party fundraiser at taxpayers' expense. But for those who can pay for themselves – or even better, put it on the corporate AMEX – it is becoming an affordable luxury. Helicopters are becoming the new limousines.\nIn an average week, Sydney HeliCharter does about 10 flights for corporate clients. Owner and pilot Michael Twigg said while chartered helicopter rides are not cheap – a return trip from Sydney to Newcastle for up to four people costs between $2000 and $3000 – it is an effective way for highly paid executives to travel without writing off the whole day.\n\"Say if you had a Sydney-based managing director of a supermarket chain and he had to go to a store opening in Newcastle, and he only needs to spend an hour there, he's got two alternatives. He can spend a couple of hours in the Sydney traffic, or he can get in a helicopter and we can have him in Newcastle in 40 minutes.\"\nOr you can save money and fly one yourself. Harry Debney, chief executive of ASX debutante Costa, used to cut short his 90-minute daily commute from Mornington Peninsula to Melbourne CBD by taking 15 minute helicopter rides when he was at the helm of Visy . He declined to comment on his current commuter habits.\n On a jet plane For longer flights, private chartered jets are also gaining in popularity. Bankstown-based Red Baron chief pilot Joel Haski recently noticed many corporate jets arriving at the Bankstown Airport on the night of the State of Origin. \"Corporate jets flew in every two minutes. I have never noticed it before and I have been a pilot for 25 years.\"\nAlissa Hildebrand, chief executive of luxury travel agency Valet Private, said she has seen a 15 per cent increase year-on-year in demand for chartered private jets.\n\"It's not seen as just an indulgence any more – it's about convenience. We can pick them up from their house and five minutes later they will be on private jets.\"\nHildebrand said chartered jets were getting more affordable. A return trip from Sydney to Melbourne on a private jet will cost between $10,000 and $12,000 for up to four people, in comparison to a business flight which could cost around $1700 per person.\n\"At the end of the day it's not the money, it's the outcome and the ease of getting somewhere.\"\nRomanjuk said the company operates between six and eight helicopters at the same time, to meet the demands from corporations that want to do something special for racing events. \"They do have the money to spend and they're happy to do something a bit different.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/06/22/1056220478750.html", "https://twitter.com/misahan"], "published": "2015-07-24T10:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:04:56.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
