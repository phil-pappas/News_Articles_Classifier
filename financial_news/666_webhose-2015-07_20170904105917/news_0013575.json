According to the Treasury Department's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, July is the last of the peak summer months for beer sales. Shipments that fester around 14 million to 15 million barrels through spring suddenly jump to about 18.5 million barrels in May and June before settling in a 18 million or so in July. By August, it's down to roughly 17 million barrels before collapsing to as low as 13.6 million by December. \nBrewers know you'll drink summer beers as long as you have that warm sun and vacation time to look forward to. That's why summer styles will show up in late March or early April when drinkers are just starting to unfreeze. When back-to-school shopping begins, brewers who started their summer beer push early watch their Labor Day summer beer supply shrink with demand.

Larger craft brewers are still producing the seasonal variety packs that make up nearly 10% of all craft beer volume, but those packs are going to get darker and maltier almost as soon as July 4th weekend ends. \nWith that in mind, we point you to the the most patriotic summer beers that craft brewers have to offer. Yes, there are some red, while and blue cans in the mix, but there's also a whole lot of U.S. history that doesn't require a lot of fireworks to celebrate: \nHomefront IPA \nLeft Hand Brewing Co. (Longmont, Colo.), Cigar City (Tampa, Fla.), Perennial Artisan Ales (St. Louis), Center of the Universe Brewing Company (Ashland, Va.), Fremont Brewing Company (Seattle), 21st Amendment (San Francisco), Palmetto (Charleston, S.C.), Maui (Lahaina, Hawaii) and Stone (San Diego) \nSure, multinational brewers like A-B InBev and SABMiller swaddle their beers in red, white and blue every summer under the pretense of helping U.S. troops. But each Memorial Day, small brewers do their bit as well. \nIn 2011, Fremont Brewing in Seattle and Center Of The Universe Brewing in Ashland, Va., came up with the idea to make a summery American IPA infused with orange zest and aged on Louisville Slugger maple baseball bats. They donated the proceeds to Operation Homefront, which offers assistance to families of military members and wounded service men and women and raised more than $18,000 for the nonprofit last year alone. \nThis year, that citrusy IPA was brewed by 11 breweries with donations from Hops Direct (hops), Cargill (malt), Crown Packaging (cans) and Louisville Slugger (bats). Available in 12-ounce cans -- which can be a hard find this late in the year -- Hops For Heroes not only delivers a a refreshing, thirst-quenching, 6.6% alcohol-by-volume IPA, it raises funds for wounded soldiers and their families through Soldiers' Angels . 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T15:28:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
