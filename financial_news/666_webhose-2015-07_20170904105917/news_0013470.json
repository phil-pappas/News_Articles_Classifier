If we followed this logic, there would be no rights for consumers in the entire EU.\" \nFacebook's legal team was not immediately available for comment. \nThe case has been brought against Facebook's European headquarters in Dublin, which registers all accounts outside the United States and Canada -- making up some 80 percent of Facebook's 1.35 billion users. \nSchrems was able to file his action against the Irish subsidiary at a court in Vienna because, under EU law, all member states have to enforce court rulings from any other member state. \n- David v Goliath - \nOften described as a David-versus-Goliath battle, interest in the case has been overwhelming. \nJust days after Schrems launched the suit in August last year, thousands of people -- mostly based in Europe but also in Asia, Latin America and Australia -- signed up. \nIn the end, the Austrian limited the number of participants to 25,000 but a further 55,000 have already registered to join the proceedings at a later stage. \nEach of the plaintiffs in the case is claiming a symbolic sum of 500 euros ($540) in damages. \nSchrems said his interest in European privacy laws was sparked four years ago when he spent a semester at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley. \n\"The general approach in Silicon Valley is that you can do anything you want in Europe\" without serious consequences, he said. \nIn parallel with the class action suit, Schrems and the EvF have also filed several complaints against Facebook in Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) . \nThat case was referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) after Irish authorities refused to launch an investigation. \nThe ECJ's decision, expected in 2016, could have wide-ranging implications for US tech companies operating in Europe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T13:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T13:50:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
