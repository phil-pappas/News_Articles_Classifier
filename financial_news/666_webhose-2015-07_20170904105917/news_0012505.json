YVES HERMAN Defaulting on its debts means Greece will need to soldier on without the support of international lending institutions, including the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\nIt will be cut adrift and in that case anything is possible, including civil unrest as people get used to their circumstances in a mendicant country whose lines of credit have been severed.\nReturning to a devalued drachma as a parallel currency to the euro during a transitional phase is unlikely to provide a palliative to Greece's woes.\nA mess This is a mess, made worse by the collapse of the Greek economy. Greece's gross domestic product has shrunk by 25 per cent – and is continuing to shrink – unemployment stands at 25 per cent, youth unemployment is a shocking 50 per cent, or worse, and public sector debt to GDP stands at about 180 per cent.\nHow then should Europe and the rest of the world, including Australia, view this weekend's events in Greece? The short answer is: with alarm.\nIt is hardly productive to engage in a discussion about how Greece was allowed to lie its way into joining the eurozone in the first place, under the terms of Europe's Stability and Growth Pact following the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 that formally created the European Union.\nThose glibly arguing for Greece to be cut loose tend not to consider, or at best brush over, the geopolitical consequences of Greece's exit from the eurozone, leaving aside lessened risks of financial contagion.\nHowever, beyond risks of contagion – these are both economic and political in the sense Syriza stands as a model for strengthening anti-austerity movements across Europe – is the spectre of a shifting, multi-polar world in which powers are rising, and falling.\nWhat is required is a clear-eyed perspective on the consequences of a weakening of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) member Greece's ties with the Western alliance.\nImportant to Western interests In this regard, Greece's location in the Mediterranean, adjacent to the Balkans and Turkey and just across the water from Israel and the Arab Middle East could hardly render it more important to Western interests. This at a time when Russia is asserting itself, China is pushing against the West, Iran is rising, and the Levant and indeed the entire Middle East is in turmoil.\nIn that context, consider these irresponsible remarks by Greece's Defence Minister Panos Kammenos that sounded suspiciously like blackmail: \"If Europe leaves us in crisis, we will flood it with immigrants.\n\"And it will be even worse for Berlin if in that wave of millions of economic immigrants there will be some jihadists of the Islamic State, too,\" he said.\nBear in mind NATO bases in Greece are a critical component of the Western alliance at a time of flux globally. Nor should we overlook Russia's overtures to Greece in this latest period, including offers of financial assistance.\nRussia is constantly on the lookout for berthing rights in the Mediterranean for its Black Sea fleet, especially since its facilities in the Syrian port of Tartus are hardly secure.\nRobert Kaplan, of the Centre for a New American Security, makes some useful points in an article entitled \"The Greek crisis is about more than money\".\n\"If Greece does leave the eurozone it is demonstrably in Europe's and America's interests to nurse it back to health,\" he writes. \"Europe, after all, to be true to its own values, must give hope and succor to its periphery.\"\nIn all their calculations Western officials need to ask themselves whether it is in the interests of the Western alliance to jettison Greece. The answer is no, but in dealing with the Greek leaders of whatever political persuasion, as always, the question is the price.\nThat will become clearer after this weekend's referendum.\nTony Walker is the AFR's international editor", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T12:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T12:17:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
