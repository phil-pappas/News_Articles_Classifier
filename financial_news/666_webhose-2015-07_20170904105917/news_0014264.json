Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Adam Rollason For Europeans, the term 'après ski' means more than just a nice bottle of red by the fire after a day on the slopes.\nIn the Alpine resorts of France, Switzerland and Italy, the final run of the day is often just the starting point for a night of eating, drinking, dancing and laughter, followed the next day by the best hangover cure there is: another day on the mountain.\nNow it's Australia's turn, with European party experience La Folie Douce coming to Thredbo for Top2Bottom race week. Translated literally as 'sweet madness', La Folie Douce promises a mix of \"French cabaret-style revue\" and \"a dynamite show with an avalanche of performers boosted by electro music\".\nPartygoers are invited to join DJs, singers, guitarists and dancers at Thredbo's Alpine Resort Poolside Terrace each evening from 6-8 August.\nThredbo's Top2Bottom race is in its 25th year. La Folie Douce's Ange Fandoh says they'll experience the same party seen each year in resorts like Courchevel and Val d'Isere.\n\"We want to bring to them the high energy, high altitude performances that we're known for around the world, not only on mountain tops but at Cannes Festival and the Grand Palais,\" she said.\n\"Together we're pushing the limits of celebration with a performance that has never been experienced in Australia before.\"\nThe crew has been brought to Australia by champagne house G.H. Mumm, which also has other events planned for those who prefer fine dining to the dancefloor. Award-winning chef Josue Lopez from Queensland's GOMA will host a degustation using paired with champagne, preceded by a champagne and caviar masterclass.\n The bubbly continues to flow at pop-up bars across the weekend, and there's even a champagne bar at the finish line of the Top2Bottom race. But if you're one of those taking part in the iconic downhill competition in its 25th year, remember to play it safe and hold off imbibing until your race is over.\nSophisticated Traveller magazine will be in Thredbo from August 7 for the show.
