As any trick-or-treater knows, vampires sleep all day and work all night. To embrace that on Wall Street, you'll need to wait for the closing bell before entering the markets. It could be a most profitable way to play stocks that get a lot of attention like Apple ( AAPL ) , Tesla ( TSLA ) , Facebook ( FB ) , and Twitter ( TWTR ) .\nThat's the surprising conclusion of a new working paper titled: \" Night Trading: Lower Risk but Higher Returns? \" by Marie-Eve Lachance, associate professor of finance at San Diego State University.\n\"The overnight return anomaly is pervasive, persistent, predictable, and can be profitable after costs,\" according to the paper, which was published July 18. \"But only for stocks with positive overnight biases in the past.\"\nOr put another way, trading at night works for those stocks that have historically outperformed in the after-hours market, but not for others. The trick, Lachance says, is to find the stocks that rose in price in a statistically significant way in the overnight market over the past 12 months. Then for the next 12 months, buy them at the closing price for the day and then sell at the opening price the next day.\nMust Read: Bank of America CEO Doubles Down on Himself in 'Power Grab'\nIn the study, the stocks picked were rebalanced each month as the specific top-ranked securities changed over time. The stocks were also weighted each day by market capitalization.\nHow profitable is that strategy? It produced annualized returns of up 21% after trading costs, the paper's findings show. That's approximately double the average annual returns of what long-term investors would get from investing in the S&P 500 over many decades.\nTo find the stocks that would generate those results, the author analyzed 12.8 million daily U.S. stock movements over a 20-year period ending Dec. 31, 2014, the report says.\nTo simulate the real world, trading costs were kept minimal by using brokers who would provide a very low per-share trading fee such as Interactive Brokers , which charges as low as 0.5 cent a share. Using market-on-close and market-on-open orders eliminated the cost of the bid-ask spread. The bid-ask spread is the difference between what the market maker buys and sells.\nThe author acknowledges that trading costs have historically been one of the reasons that overnight trading wouldn't work. But the decline in costs has changed enough for people to take advantage of the anomaly.\nProfits of 21% after trading costs were achievable with a portfolio of at least $100,000 per stock. With at least $10,000 per stock, the returns were lower but still a healthy 15.74%. The risk-adjusted figures were 15.7% and 10.5%, respectively.\n\"Stocks like IBM ( IBM ) , Procter & Gamble ( PG ) or Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) aren't likely to be in the overnight list,\" Lachance says. But \"those that attract a lot of attention\" are typically in the group. She refers to Apple, Tesla, Facebook, and Twitter by name.\n\"You can actually make money while you sleep,\" she said in an interview. (Remeber, after all, that playing the market worked out nicely for the Cullens, a family of vampires in Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series.)\nHas Lachance tried the after-hours strategy herself? Yes, she says: \"I did try it for my students. It's doable.\"\nThat said, Lachance warns she can't guarantee exactly the same results as those in her research paper and also notes that if you are trying to trade massive sums, like $100 million, then there might not be enough liquidity in the after-hours market.", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13228200/1/twilight-was-right-vampire-trading-can-make-you-rich.html", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13228200/1/twilight-was-right-vampire-trading-can-make-you-rich.html", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13228200/1/twilight-was-right-vampire-trading-can-make-you-rich.html&text=", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13228200/1/twilight-was-right-vampire-trading-can-make-you-rich.html&title=", "http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2633476", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13228200/1/twilight-was-right-vampire-trading-can-make-you-rich.html"], "published": "2015-07-24T15:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T14:00:31.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
