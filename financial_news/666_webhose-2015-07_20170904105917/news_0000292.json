Nearly all Greek medicine is imported. \n\"We have supplies for three to four months in the country and we remain committed to supply Greek patients,\" Efpia Director-General Richard Bergstrom said after an assessment of the latest situation. \nEfpia warned last week, however, that shortages could still emerge, given the fragmented nature of the Greek supply chain, adding that this could be exacerbated if drugs were re-exported. \nPfizer (NYSE: PFE - news ) said that current recorded stock levels in Greece should ensure that patients do not suffer any interruption in supply to its medicines in the short term. \nSanofi (NasdaqGM: GCVRZ - news ) , Bayer (Milan: BAY.MI - news ) , Merck (Other OTC: MKGAF - news ) and Boehringer Ingelheim said they were continuing to supply Greek patients. A spokeswoman for AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN - news ) said it was preparing contingency plans but operations remain normal for now. \n\"At present, there is no impact on our supply chain as, while the banks are closed, bank transfers to and within Greece are still possible,\" she said. \nRoche also said that both its medicines and diagnostics were available to patients. \n\"Roche is working to understand the full implications of yesterday's referendum decision and will both review and take steps to revise its operating plans as needed,\" the company said. \n(Additional reporting by Paul Arnold, Andreas Kroener and Patricia Weiss; Editing by Susan Fenton and David Goodman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T03:58:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
