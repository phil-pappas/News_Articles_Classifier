Great Basin Federal Credit Union credit and debit cards are compatible with Apple Pay so account holders can pay merchants simply by using their Apple mobile devices.\nApple Pay enables account holders to make purchases on the go with their mobile devices, including iPhone 6 and Apple Watch for in-store payments, and iPhone 6, iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 3 for payments within apps. Setting up your Passbook app for mobile purchasing with your Apple device is quick and easy.\nWhen using Apple Pay to make purchases, users are protected from hackers because Apple Pay transmits a unique code per transaction. Purchases made by Apple Pay use a Device Account Number as well as a transition-specific dynamic security code, so your credit or debit card number is never shared by Apple or transmitted with a payment.\nApple Pay is usable in many retail stores, gas stations, and restaurants across the country. The Apple Pay function sends a vibration and beep to your phone when your payment information has been sent.\nApple Pay offers a more secure option for making purchases. If an account holder loses his phone, the card information will not be stored in the phone, and the use of Apple Pay is protected by TouchID. Apple mobile device users can use the “Find My iPhone” feature to disable purchasing ability, require PIN entry for access, or erase all financial information from Passbook.\nTo learn more, call 775.333.4228 or visit Great Basin Federal Credit Union’s website at www.greatbasin.org.\nAbout Great Basin Federal Credit Union\nGreat Basin Federal Credit Union has been a member of the community since our charter on January 11, 1951.
