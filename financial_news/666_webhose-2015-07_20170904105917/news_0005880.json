Politicians derive their responsibility from their functions. No-one can force them. If someone tried I could go to the president (Joachim Gauck) and ask him to dismiss me.\" \nAsked if he was thinking about resigning, he replied: \"No, what makes you think that?\". \nSchaeuble said he and Merkel had an understanding: \"We know we can count on each other.\" \nSo far Merkel has been able to draw on Schaeuble's popularity among members of her conservative-social democrat coalition to garner grudging acceptance for a third Greek bailout. \nOn Friday, a large majority of lawmakers in the lower house of parliament gave Merkel the green light to start talks on the new rescue package -- but 60 members of her conservative CDU/CSU faction voted against. \nSchaeuble, a figure of hate in Athens where he sparked fresh outrage last weekend by floating the idea of Greece taking \"time out\" from the euro, described the new bailout plan as the \"last attempt\" to put Greece's finances to rights. \nAt home, his hawkish stance has played well with voters. \nA poll in early July showed 72 percent of Germans supporting his approach.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T16:48:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
