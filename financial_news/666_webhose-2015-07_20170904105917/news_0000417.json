SEE CAPTION FOR PURPOSE OF SPECIFIC PATCHES. Colin Murty by Jill Margo Rather than injecting and monitoring themselves through the day, people with diabetes type 1 may be able to wear a smart patch in the future.\nSuch a patch, now in development, would be an improvement on syringes, pens, pumps and hybrid patch-pumps.\nThe simple patch would be lined with 100 micro-needles each packed with insulin. The size of an eyelash, each needle would contain enough insulin to provide the same dose as a single injection.\nThe patch would also contain glucose-sensing enzymes to identify when blood-sugar levels are too high and insulin is needed.\nResearchers from North Carolina have published a study on the patch in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . They showed it effectively regulated the blood glucose in a mouse model of chemically induced diabetes type 1. Next it will be tried on pigs, then if it works, humans.\nIt is painless and can be personalised to account for the wearer's weight and sensitivity to insulin.\nIn the mouse model it lowered blood glucose for up to nine hours.\nAs a closed-loop system, it eliminates the potential for human error. Current-closed loop systems use mechanical sensors, pumps and needle-tipped catheters that have to be replaced every few days.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T12:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:07:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
