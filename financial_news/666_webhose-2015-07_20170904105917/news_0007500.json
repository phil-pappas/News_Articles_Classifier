Lisboa, an economic policymaker in 2003-2007, teaches business at Insper, which released the academic paper this week together with the Fundação Getulio Vargas University, where Pessoa is a professor.\n\"The outlook is worrisome because the country can't take any more tax hikes and it's becoming harder by the day to change the country's lavish government spending culture,\" Almeida said in a phone interview. \"Brazilian society must learn to make choices.\"\nThe paper sheds a light on Brazil's worse-than-expected state of public finances after years of budget profligacy. The ruling Workers' Party eased budget spending controls at the end of last decade, although without securing the necessary recurring revenues to sustain the trend, the economists said in the paper\nConcerns that Brazil may be on the verge of losing investment-grade ratings are rising Rousseff's austerity push looks unlikely to fully offset plunging tax collections.\nWith the country's population aging rapidly and economic growth poised to remain low for coming years, the outlook for extra state revenues look rather grim, Almeida noted.\nPressure to increase taxes, however, could have long-lasting consequences for economic activity: Brazilians spend almost 40 percent of their annual income on taxes, more than any other country in Latin America, the paper found.\n($1 = 3.1782 Brazilian reais)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T23:07:38.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
