Robert Rough by Jemima Whyte There's lots of things the market doesn't know about new Ten boss Paul Anderson.\nChief among them, he loves a Greyhound bus.\nKeen observers on the scenic route to Mackay (the gateway to the Bowen Basin) late last week would have noticed a Kiwi looking thrilled with the Wi-Fi and USB ports provided on the country's only national bus line. (And who wouldn't be? It is a pretty good set-up.)\nWhile Anderson may have enjoyed the ride, it wasn't exactly his planned mode of transport.\nHe'd been holidaying on Hayman Island and – shock, horror – was fogged in. Even getting to Hamilton Island wasn't without its issues, our sources tell us.\nKnowing it was a fairly crucial week for Ten and he was to play a starring role, Anderson didn't hang around.\nBoats, buses – whatever it took to find his way back to Sydney late-ish on Friday and get prepping for Monday's big announcement.\nAnd while we're on captains of industry keeping it real, let's not forget Virgin's John Borghetti .\n He's a man known for his car collection and sharply tailored suits (and, of course, hauling Virgin Blue upmarket – airport lounges, Wi-Fi and USB ports and all). Borghetti is also the chairman of (say this softly) budget carrier Tiger Airways, which Virgin bought last year.\nSo, well done for braving the budget airline on Friday morning to Melbourne. Thank goodness it was just one way!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:08:59.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
