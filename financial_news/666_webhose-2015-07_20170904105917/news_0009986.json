The existence of this cover material has previously limited the understanding of subsurface geology and structure.\n\nChinalco commenced an induced polarisation geophysical survey in June 2015 to detect and map economic mineral deposits in particular those associated with disseminated sulphides and massive sulphide mineralisation.\n\nThis is expected to be completed this month.\n\nTargets identified will be combined with geological and geochemical datasets to develop future drilling programs.\n\nDetailed geological mapping of the Native Companion area at 1:5000 scale also commenced in June 2015.\n\n\nOther Mount Isa Exploration \n\nChinalco has also completed a soil survey at Grid B and Wonder Valley on EPM 14365.\n\nA total of 111 soil samples were collected from Grid B and 360 samples were collected from Wonder Valley. These samples are awaiting assay results before further activities are planned for this area.\n\nThe company has also undertaken geological mapping of the Elaine South prospect which is defined by a 1 kilometre by 0.5 kilometre magnetic anomaly south of the Elaine Resource which remains poorly explored.\n\nPreliminary mapping of this area has revealed:\n- The area is dominated by an extensive sequence of altered metasediments including calc-silcates schists black shale and marble of the Corella Formation. Localised garnetite occurs to the north of the prospect and the area has been intruded by dolerite intrusives;\n- The area hosts extensive zones of silica-feldspar-pyroxene/-amphibole/-epidote/-magnetite alteration particularly closely associated with the magnetic anomaly; and\n- Minor copper mineralisation has been identified associated with small historic workings in association with calcite veining.\n\nA small soil sampling program is planned to be completed over this prospect in the second half of 2015.\n\nIt has also completed a soil survey extension over the Mt Dorothy Prospect with assays awaited while preliminary 3D geological modelling has been completed over Blue Caesar and Jubilee.\n\nModelling of the Blue Caesar area confirms that the garnetite alteration has a strong spatial relationship with the mineralisation and is likely to be a controlling factor in its deposition. \n\nThis relationship will be used to guide step-out drilling on the resource.\n\nModelling of the Jubilee area has demonstrated that the mineralised envelope is typically 3-5 metres true thickness and remains open along strike and at depth. This modelling will assist in developing follow-up drilling.\n\nCorporate Activity \n\nChinalco continues to pursue certain acquisition and project opportunities that are consistent with its objective of becoming a mid-tier copper producer. \n\nDue diligence reviews and negotiations are continuing.\n\nAnalysis \n\nChinalco Yunnan Copper will soon have a better understanding of its Native Companion prospect with drilling expected to start in the first week of August.\n\nNative Companion offers the best opportunity for an economic discovery given its location on the same mineralised corridor as Altona’s Cloncurry Project.\n\nOther exploration in the Mount Isa region provides further newsflow for the company. \n\nChinalco had 2 million in cash as at 30th June 2015.\n\n\nProactive Investors Australia is the market leader in producing news articles and research reports on ASX emerging companies with distribution in Australia UK North America and Hong Kong / China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:36:29.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
