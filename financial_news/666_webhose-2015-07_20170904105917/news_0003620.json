Andrew Quilty Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires A surprisingly strong recovery rally on the Australian sharemarket showed that investors had overestimated the impact of the Greek debt crisis, according to a leading fund manager.\nClime Asset Management chief investment officer John Abernethy said global central banks had spent seven years since the financial crisis shoring up the financial systems and would not let Greece get out of hand.\n\"All the shorting that got done ahead of the calamity got caught out when there was such a passive response to the no vote [following Sunday's referendum in Greece],\" Mr Abernethy said.\n\"The shorters have been operating to excess in our market and they got caught out today. The lower $A supports the sharemarket and if the currency falls to US70¢ we see the market at 6000.\"\nThe benchmark ASX 200 index ended Tuesday's trade up 106 points, or almost 2 per cent, to 5581.4, recording its biggest daily gain since February and adding about $30 billion in market capitalisation, while the All Ordinaries rose 1.8 per cent to 5564.\nMeanwhile, the Australian dollar spent most of the day trading below US75¢, or close to the six-year low of US74.52¢ it had plunged to early on Monday morning.\nMuted response to Greece's no vote Morgans private client adviser Alistair McCorquodale said the sharemarket rally was fuelled by a muted response on overseas markets to Greece's no vote on a bailout plan that demanded more austerity in the debt-plagued country.\n \"The reaction that we saw overseas probably wasn't as strong as we may have expected given the sell-off on Monday,\" he said. \"The Dow Jones was only off 0.3 per cent, and we were off 1.3 per cent.\n\"We're obviously trading ahead of them and because it is volatile and trading on new information coming through on the development of the negotiations with Greece, the markets will continue to be volatile unless there is some certainty in that process.\"\nIG market strategist Chris Weston said Monday's sell-off hadn't been all that convincing, trading just $4 billion in volume, in one of the lightest trading days in five months.\nBut today's session may have been driven from offshore, given the low Australian dollar.\nBut he said the ASX 200 price action was still in a downtrend, and would need to break through 5600 and sustain those levels to become excited.\nDespite the stunning rally on Tuesday, the ASX 200 still closed 18 points below where it ended on Thursday, before two days of hefty losses.\nEuro comments added fuel to optimism Mr McCorquodale said while China's roller-coaster sharemarket may be weighing on sentiment, he \"wouldn't put as much emphasis on it\". The Shanghai Composite Index was down just 1 per cent in late afternoon trade.\n\"I don't think the causation between our market and the Chinese sharemarket is as strong as the US and European markets,\" he said.\nSt George senior economist Janu Chan said some comments coming from European leaders overnight added fuel to optimism that a deal between Greece and its creditors can be reached.\nThe rally was led by the banks, which all gained strongly. Commonwealth Bank shares were up 1.6 per cent to $87.89, National Australia Bank was up 2.2 per cent to $34.21, ANZ Banking Group added 2.55 per cent to $33.03 and Westpac gained almost 4 per cent to $33.76.\n\"The banks have been strong today; yield hasn't been talked about for a while but it's still important, and at a certain point there's always going to be strong buying support,\" Mr McCorquodale said.\nQantas was the day's best performing stock. Its share price rose 7.9 per cent to $3.43.\n\"The fall in the oil price would be behind the big change in that one, Qantas is highly sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices,\" Mr McCorquodale said.\nOil's biggest one-day slide in four months Overnight on Monday US brent oil fell 7.3 per cent , the biggest one-day slide in four months.\n\"On the flipside, the energy stocks have fallen, but that's the only drag on what has been an otherwise positive day,\" he said.\nThe falls were modest and not all-inclusive however. Santos fell 0.5 per cent and Beach Energy was down 1 per cent, but Origin Energy ended the day up 0.1 per cent and Woodside gained 1.5 per cent.\n\"Out of all asset classes it seems commodities were hit the most by the Greek no vote … possibly China's sharemarket, which has fallen quite sharply, might have been behind that as well,\" Ms Chan said.\nBut despite a fresh slump in iron ore prices – which fell 5.4 per cent to $52.28 a tonne, adding to the previous week's 11 per cent fall – miners were mostly up.\nRio Tinto rose 1.1 per cent, BHP Billiton added 0.9 per cent and Fortescue Metals Group soared 4 per cent, clawing back some of yesterday's losses.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/iron-ore-extends-losing-streak-on-rising-china-stockpiles-20150706-gi6hvg.html", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/china/chinas-stocks-extend-rout-as-traders-cut-margin-bets-by-record-20150707-gi70r5.html"], "published": "2015-07-07T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T18:04:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
