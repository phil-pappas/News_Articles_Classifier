Many analysts foresee the first hike in September, though Fed Chair Janet Yellen has stressed that any increase will be driven by the latest economic data. \nThe statement noted that the job market, housing and consumer spending have all improved. The Fed still expects inflation to rise gradually toward its 2 percent target \n___ \nWill the Internet listen to your private conversations? \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The \"Internet of Things\" promises to usher in an era of automated homes outfitted with locks, lights, thermostats, entertainment systems and servants such as Amazon's Echo that respond to spoken words. \nIt's also raising the specter of Internet-connected microphones being secretly used as a wiretap, either by a company providing a digital service, government officials with court orders or intruders that seize control of the equipment. \n___ \nZero-percent financing turns heads, but may not be best deal \nDETROIT (AP) -- When a car dealer offers to loan you the money to buy a car at zero interest, it gets your attention. Yet that cheap money might not be the best deal you can get. \nDealers can offer zero-percent financing through automakers' finance companies because, unlike banks, they make money on the sale of the car and don't need to rake in interest payments. \nBefore biting on the zero-percent financing, check for other deals such as cash-back offers. \n___ \nReview: 5 ways Windows 10 fixes annoyances in predecessor \nNEW YORK (AP) -- It took me just a weekend to get comfortable with Microsoft's new Windows 10 operating system, something I never did with its predecessor, Windows 8, even after nearly three years. \nWith Wednesday's update, Windows no longer feels jarring, as though I'm using two different computers at once. \nBest part: This update is free. \n___ \nFacebook stock slides even as 2Q results soar \nNEW YORK (AP) -- Facebook's second-quarter revenue barely squeaked past Wall Street's outsized expectations, sending its high-flying stock down in after-hours trading. \nWhile the results surpassed forecasts on all fronts, some investors may have been looking for a bigger beat, or simply cashing in on some profits as Facebook's shares have been trading near record highs. \nThe world's largest online social network continued to expand its massive user base, reaching 1.49 billion monthly users as of June 30, up 13 percent from a year earlier. \n___ \nFTC investigating online college University of Phoenix \nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The University of Phoenix, an online college popular among military veterans, is under federal investigation for possible deceptive or unfair business practices, its parent company the Apollo Education Group announced Wednesday. \nThe for-profit, publicly traded company is the largest recipient of federal student aid for veterans and often a sponsor at military education and employment events. \nIn a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company told shareholders that it received a \"civil investigative demand\" from the Federal Trade Commission this week. \n___ \nUS pending home sales slip in June \nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of signed contracts to buy homes fell in June, as limited supplies of homes on the market are holding back possible sales growth. \nThe National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index declined 1.8 percent to 110.3 last month. Still, strong demand from would-be buyers has pushed the index up 8.2 percent during the past 12 months. \n___ \nLew gets more than 1 million comments on currency redesign \nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said Wednesday he's gotten more than a million responses to his request for comments on how U.S. currency should be redesigned and recommendations for what woman should become the first female on U.S. paper money in more than a century. \nLew said it has been a \"remarkable outpouring\" of everything from tweets and retweets to handwritten letters. \nHe said among the \"interesting commentary\" are suggestions to replace some of the buildings now on the currency with more direct depictions of the democracy theme that will be used in the redesign. \n___ \nBetter economy has smokers buying more Marlboros \nNEW YORK (AP) -- A better economy is helping sell more Marlboros and Camels, even as prices climb. That brought higher profits for their makers in the second quarter. \nMarlboro maker Altria Inc. has now seen two straight quarters of upticks in cigarettes sold. That is unusual at a time when tobacco companies have routinely seen declines, as people smoke less because of tax increases, smoking bans, health concerns and increasing social stigma. \n___ \nWhole Foods: Sales hurt by bad publicity from overcharging \nNEW YORK (AP) -- Whole Foods' sales are hurting from bad publicity over its overcharging of customers in New York City. \nThe grocery chain known for its organic offerings noted that sales growth slowed sharply in the last two weeks of the quarter ending July 5. That was after New York City officials said an audit found the chain's stores were overcharging customers by overstating the weight of pre-packed products â€” a finding that Whole Foods noted made national news. \nThe company said sales at established locations were still weak in the current quarter. \n___ \nTwitter stock tumbles as user growth stalls \nNEW YORK (AP) -- Tepid user growth and ongoing uncertainty about its leadership dragged Twitter's stock to its lowest level in over a year Wednesday, even though the short-messaging service reported sharply quarterly higher revenue. \nTwitter is \"not satisfied\" with its user growth, co-founder Jack Dorsey, who replaced Dick Costolo as CEO earlier this month, said Tuesday after the earnings report. But that's unlikely to change any time soon. \nTwitter doesn't expect to see \"sustained, meaningful growth\" of its number of users until it reaches the mass market, said Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto. This, he said, will take considerable time. \n___ \nChina auto sales slump hits industry fortunes \nBEIJING (AP) -- General Motors Co.'s $5 billion initiative to create cars for China and other emerging markets comes just as automakers face a collapse in the booming Chinese demand they were counting on to power their growth. \nJune sales in the biggest car market by number of vehicles sold shrank by 3.4 percent from a year earlier as an economic slowdown deepened and smog-choked cities tried to curb growth in car ownership. \nSales growth has cooled from 2009's explosive peak of 45 percent, but the latest figures surprised analysts, who were forecasting a healthy 7 to 8 percent for this year. \n___ \nYahoo plays catch-up in messaging with video texting app \nNEW YORK (AP) -- Imagine making a video call without other people being able to listen in. \nYahoo is trying to make that happen with Livetext, a new app that seeks to make video calling as private as texting. \nYahoo says video calls can be better than texts for expressing emotions, but their audio component makes private conversations public. With Livetext, you message friends by typing, just like texting, but you see video of friends without the audio. \n___ \nBy The Associated Press= \nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 121.12 points, or 0.7 percent, to 17,751.39.
