Chris Ratcliffe Share on twitter by Stephen Cauchi The historic relationship between gold and the Australian dollar has broken down - and that's probably just as well because some analysts are tipping gold will fall beneath $US1000 per ounce, which is 10 per cent below current levels.\n\"Up until October 2014 there was a very strong positive correlation between the gold price and the Australian dollar,\" said Ray Attrill, co-head of foreign exchange strategy at National Australia Bank.\n\"There has been this historical association which completely broke down from October last year.\"\nFrom October to early July, gold traded in a broadly sideways pattern between the boundaries of $US1150 per month and $US1300 per month, said Mr Attrill. But over the same period, the Australian dollar has plummeted from close to 90 US cents to 75 US cents.\nThe strong relationship prior to 2014 \"was not one that anyone could rationalise very well,\" said Mr Attrill.\n\"Unlike iron ore which is a third of exports, gold is less than 10 per cent of commodity exports,\" said Mr Attrill. \"You could make the case that the price of coal is more important than the price of gold to Australia because we export more of it by value.\nBut, with the gold price now tumbling as well, does this mean the close relationship with the Australian dollar is coming back?\n\"I don't think so. It explains why the Australian dollar hasn't suffered from the fall in the gold price that we've seen from last Friday - because the relationship has already broken down.\n \"We haven't seen people cite the weakness in the gold price for the weakness in the Aussie dollar, which is trading at the same level today as it was last Thursday, before the gold price plunge.\"\nGold, trading at $US1104 per ounce, is almost certainly headed lower.\nOversea-Chinese Banking Corp.'s Barnabas Gan, the most accurate forecaster of precious metals in rankings compiled by Bloomberg, predicts gold will reach $US1050 an ounce by December, a 5.2 per cent drop from current levels.\nABN Amro's Georgette Boele and Robin Bhar of Societe Generale told Bloomberg that bullion will approach $US1000 by December, almost 10 per cent below today's price.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@cauchis"], "published": "2015-07-21T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:04:40.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
