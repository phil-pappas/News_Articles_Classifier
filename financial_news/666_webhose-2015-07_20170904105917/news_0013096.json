The bid doesn’t reflect the rising value of K+S’s Legacy potash project in Canada, Chief Executive Officer Norbert Steiner said Thursday, indicating that an offer of at least 50 euros a share would be more appropriate.\nRandy Burton, a spokesman for Potash Corp., declined to comment, as did Kassel, Germany-based K+S, beyond their statements.\nK+S rose 4.4 percent to 38.67 euros Friday in Frankfurt, giving it a market value of 7.4 billion euros. Potash Corp. rose 0.67 percent to C$39.14 at 3:31 p.m. in Toronto.\nLegacy is scheduled to start production by the end of next year and reach 2 million metric tons of capacity from 2017 onward. Its book value is about 11 euros per share, Steiner said Thursday. Taking into account future earnings from the mine, he said it’s worth as much as 21 euros a share.\nK+S Shorts K+S is one of the most shorted stocks in Germany’s benchmark DAX Index, indicating a lack of investor confidence in the company, one of the people familiar with Potash said. At one point in May, short bets accounted for almost a fifth of outstanding shares, according to Markit data. In a short trade, investors bet the shares will decline, allowing them to buy the stock at a lower price.\nA bid of 42.50 euros would result in an 80 percent probability that a deal gets done, according to a note Wednesday from John Klein, an analyst at Berenberg Equity Research.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T22:55:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
