Lew rebutted claims that new rules have triggered volatility in bond markets, including last October when Treasury yields fluctuated wildly.\nRegulators will release a study soon that concludes the events of Oct. 15, 2014, weren’t tied to measures implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act, Lew said in Washington on Wednesday. Yields on 10-year Treasuries plunged the most since 2009 that day, prompting traders to question whether new rules had hurt liquidity.\n“There’s a question to be asked about regulation, and I don’t think the answer is clear,” Lew said during a question-and-answer panel at the Brookings Institution. He said that he doesn’t believe Dodd-Frank was a “significant” factor.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon is among bankers who’ve raised concerns that there’s a lack of liquidity in Treasury markets and that what happened in October should serve as a “warning shot” to investors. Blackstone Group LP CEO Stephen Schwarzman has gone further, saying that new regulations may fuel the next financial crisis.\nLew joins Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo in downplaying the role of rules in reducing liquidity. While regulatory changes may be one factor, there isn’t a “precise and convincing explanation of exactly what has happened” in markets, Tarullo said last month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:14:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
