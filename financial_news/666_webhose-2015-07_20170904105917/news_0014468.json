Shares in UCB surged 5.2 percent after the Belgian pharmaceutical company raised its 2015 forecasts and bank BNP Paribas gained 3.5 percent after its Q2 revenue rose nearly 16 percent.\nEconomists were waiting for July euro zone inflation and unemployment data due at 0900 GMT and for in-depth U.S. wage data due later. But just as important remained commodities and China.\nCopper, considered a bellwether for global economic activity, was facing a 9 percent monthly loss as it stumbled to $5,238 an tonne. Gold was down over 7 percent on the month at $1,081.95 an ounce as it chalked up its longest run of week-on-week falls in 16 years.\nFRAGILE CHINA\nChina's CSI300 index ended flat after a late dip to leave it down 14.7 percent on the month, and the Shanghai Composite Index lost 1 percent, extending its July losses to 13.4 percent despite recent support measures by the country's authorities.\nChina's securities regulator said on Friday it was investigating the impact of automated trading on the market and has clamped down on 24 trading accounts found to have abnormal bids for shares or bid cancellations.\nCrude oil also slipped for a second session as concern over global oversupply intensified after the head of the OPEC oil exporters' cartel indicated there would be no cutback in production. U.S. crude was down 0.3 percent at $48.2 a barrel.\nLead by China's woes, emerging stocks looked on track to finish their third straight month in the red, with many near multi-year lows as the sector grappled with the prospect of U.S. rate rises and sluggish growth data at home.\nU.S. gross domestic product data released on Thursday showed growth accelerated in the second quarter, though slightly short of some forecasts. Growth was tweaked higher in the first quarter, backing the Fed's assessment at its meeting this week that the economy was expanding \"moderately.\"\n\"We believe there's enough here for the Fed to raise interest rates for the first time in nine years,\" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.\nThe dollar inched down about 0.1 percent on the day to 124.030 yen, after rising as high as 124.58 overnight, its highest level since June 10.\nThe euro edged about 0.1 percent higher to $1.0938 , after dropping to a one-week low of $1.0835 on Thursday.
