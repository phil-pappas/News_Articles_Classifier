The unemployment rate fell to 5.3% (5.4% expected,) and wages went nowhere, at 0% month-over-month and 2.0% year-over-year. \nEconomists had estimated that average hourly earnings gew 0.2% month-over-month, and 2.3% year-over-year. \nThe more crucial component from this data was wages. The Federal Reserve is waiting to observe whether the pace of wage growth is strong enough to warrant rate hikes this year. \nTreasuries firmed after the jobs report, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note down about one basis point at around 2.4%. \nGold is off by about $7 an ounce, near $1,158.90. The dollar index is slightly lower at around 96.30. \nAt the bottom of the hour, weekly data on initial jobless claims will also cross. Data on factory orders is due at 10:00 a.m., and the weekly count of oil and gas rigs is due at 1:00 p.m. \nAfter a 4% drop on Thursday, West Texas Intermediate crude oil is slightly lower, at around $57 per barrel. \nMarkets will focus on the jobs report this morning. But the big story of the moment continues to be Greece. The latest is that finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has said he will quit if citizens vote \"No\" in the referendum vote on creditors' reform proposals Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T15:46:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
