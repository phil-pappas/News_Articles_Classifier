(and) incurring forex losses,\" it said. \nConsolidated revenues in the second quarter, however, rose by 6.4 percent to $3.6 billion from $3.4 billion, said the company which serves 168 million clients in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. \nEtisalat's net profit in the first half of 2015 also dropped 20 percent to $1.0 billion from $1.23 billion a year ago. \nBut its consolidated revenues in the first six months of the year rose 16.4 percent to $7.14 billion from $6.13 billion a year ago. \n\"This quarter's 6 percent increase in revenue is an indicator that Etisalat's long-term strategy for sustainable growth in our markets is the right approach, despite the decline in profit in Quarter 2,\" CEO Ahmad Julfar said. \nLast year, the company's net profit surged 26 percent to $2.43 billion as Etisalat saw a hike in subscribers after acquiring a Morocco operator stake. \nThe UAE government, which owns a 60 percent stake in the company, decided to open it up to foreigners for the first time in June. \nEtisalat had said the federal government had decided to allow foreign investors to buy 20 percent of the company's shares.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T20:24:18.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
