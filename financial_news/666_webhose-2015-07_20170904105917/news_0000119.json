We might see some rebounds in between but the general trend is down.\"\nOne trader, who asked not to be named, said over the last two weeks many large mills had shut down at least one of their four blast furnaces.\n\"The demand for steel is falling as the property developers are not embarking on new projects and local governments are reluctant to build infrastructure,\" he said.\nIron ore delivered to China's Qingdao port sank 10 per cent to $US44.59 a dry metric ton on Wednesday, according to Metal Bulletin. That's the lowest price since spot trading of iron ore began in May 2009.\n Iron ore at the Port of Qingdao plunged 10.1% on Wednesday to $US44.59 per tonne. This can be partly attributed to a massive surge in supply over recent days.\nQian Yi, a manager at industry consulting group Steelhome, said 959,000 tonnes was delivered to the five main ports in north China's on Wednesday.\nThat is 31 per cent more than the daily average for last week and 27 per cent higher than the week prior.\nThe sluggish Chinese economy was confirmed on Thursday as consumer prices rose by 1.4 per cent in June, slightly ahead of market expectations, but still well below levels associated with strong demand.\nWeak demand for iron ore comes after a sluggish start to the year for infrastructure investment across China.\nThe country's fixed assets investment rose by 11.4 per cent in the first five months of the year, well below the government's target of 15 per cent growth in 2015.\nThis is expected to pick up in the second half, but it won't be sufficient to rally the price of iron ore.\n\"If the economy is not good, the Chinese government might launch some stimulus policies, but the aim of these policies is to stabilise growth and this won't lead to a huge increase in steel demand,\" said Mr Xi from MySteel.\nMr Qian from Steelhome said the combination of weak demand and rising supply was the reason for the big price fall.\n\"Iron ore offloaded in China didn't change last week from the week before. However, inventories went up which suggests demand is falling, he said.\n\"This week, we have seen a big increase in iron ore offloaded in China.\"\nHe also said there had been numerous shut-downs of blast furnaces in recent weeks, particularly in central China.\nChina's latest inflation report shows steel prices in June slumped 16.7 per cent from a year ago, as a sluggish economy weighed on demand in another worrying sign for Australia's iron ore producers.\nWhile consumer prices edged up slightly, rising by a better-than-expected 1.4 per cent, year-on-year, producer prices fell for a 39th straight month, dropping 4.8 per cent.\nOne of the biggest falls was the price of non-ferrous metal refinery and processing, an indication of steel prices.\nQiu Yuecheng, an analyst with XiBen New Line Co, a steel products trading platform in Shanghai, said the price of rebar, which is mainly used for construction, is at its lowest since 2001.\n\"Some steel mills have liquidity problems so they are just selling whatever they can,\" said Mr Qiu.\n\"Demand is very weak.\"\nWith Lucy Guo", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T10:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:06:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
