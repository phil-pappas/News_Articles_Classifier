What it really involves, usually, is letting regular people — often amateurs — contract to rent goods and sell services to other people. You have a drill you paid $200 for that you only use to hang pictures once a year? You can rent it by the day to your neighbour up the street. You have a car? You can be a part-time taxi driver. Have a home you want to rent out to strangers while you’re on vacation or while you stay with your mom? You can be a hotelier. And so on.\nPeople could always do these things in the past, of course, but they were often impractical, dependent on placing newspaper classified ads your target market might never see, or hanging lamppost flyers with little tear-off phone number tabs at the bottom that take forever to create and hang, or putting notes on the community bulletin board to reach a few dozen people. In the past, to really make it work, you needed big companies who could operate at a large enough scale make it all profitable. Technology changes that.\nRelated : Uber lawsuit launched\nToronto says parking app illegal\nRenting spots by the hour\nAnd it has been changing it for some time. This is an evolution of a process that began with the Internet, when online marketplaces like ebay and Craigslist turn people’s old-fashioned yard sales into a global bazaar. It’s a process that’s seen everyone become a publisher through blogs and social media, many people to use the same tools to become journalists and photographers, that’s seen direct instant communication largely replace mail and even phone calls.\nIt may be useful to think of it as a somewhat “distributed” economy, where so many things rely not on a central source of power but the organizing of thousands or millions of small players: working-class people become angel investors through crowdfunding; homeowners run their own tiny solar or wind power plants and sell energy to the grid.\nThese technologically driven phenomena are reshaping whole industries, pointing out how unprepared our social safety net is for a world in which people run tiny independent businesses instead of having a traditional job with a single employer; remodelling how we think about labour relations and the role of unions in such a world, where each worker has dozens or more employers and deals with one or more middlemen as their main way of doing business; and of course, among many other things, they are calling into question the traditional regulations we’ve had.\nIn the case of the Rover parking app, the existing bylaws basically prevent people from legally renting out their parking spots, except in limited circumstances where they don’t own a car and maybe lease the spot by the month to a neighbour. A primary rationale for the law was to prevent the kind of traffic that a commercial parking lot being operated on someone’s front lawn would bring to a neighbourhood. Does that even apply to the odd car driver coming down the street knowing a spot is available because she’s booked it on her phone?\nWhen does a room for rent become a bed and breakfast in need of licensing? When does a car pool become a bus service? When does a someone selling his knitted goods become a retail store? And when do big middleman companies who basically provide a market for others to interact become, in practical terms, employers and vendors for those they connect?\nThese are interesting questions, and I think it’s possible that the phenomenon that is called the sharing economy and related tech changes to how we interact could be as transformative as the long-ago introduction of fractional reserve banking, which allowed the meagre savings of average people to be put to use to expand the money supply.\nOur whole economy and monetary system is now based around that kind of banking, and of course we recognize that industry needs strict regulation to keep it from exploding and disrupting all of us into ruin. But it’s taken centuries to figure out how to properly regulate banks, and as relatively recent world economic troubles have highlighted, we still haven’t entirely figured it out.\nThe thing with so-called sharing economy stuff is that each element of it is somewhat different: the concerns about people selling crafts are different from the ones about people becoming full-time unlicensed cab drivers; the concerns about preserving public service journalism are different from the land-use and residential concerns of a parking-spot rental service. They seem to demand to be taken on a case-by-case basis, but there are so many cases.\nMuch of the mainstream rhetoric around this stuff seems to either be libertarian-technocrat utopianism or a Luddite-conservative dystopianism. It seems that in order to wrestle with the benefits and drawbacks of these changes to how people interact and do business with each other, we need something in the middle, neither celebrating nor decrying what’s taking place, but observing closely good and bad effects. And then doing the difficult work of adjusting the government and social reaction.\n“It’s not going anywhere and we’d better find a way to make sure regulations catch up with it,” Mayor John Tory (open John Tory's policard) said this week, in reference to the parking app.\nWhich is true, but a much harder and bigger and more urgent job, maybe, than it sounds.\nekeenan@thestar.ca , @thekeenanwire\nMore on thestar.com\nKids’ park in Winnipeg to be named for Malala\nCat wreaks havoc on New York metro system", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:55:10.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
