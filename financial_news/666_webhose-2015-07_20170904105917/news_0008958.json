In response, a senior UP police officer said there was no \"prima facie\" evidence of any criminality on the part of Mulayam.\nA party leader had originally dismissed a two-minute audio clip of the purported conversation as \"doctored\", but spokesman CP Rai on Saturday evening told TOI, \"Mulayam Singh is a very senior leader and has never known to have threatened anyone in this manner. Thakur has himself acknowledged Mulayam Singh Yadav is known to his family. It was unethical, therefore, for him to tape the conversation and make it public.\"\nThe Hazratganj police station accepted his complaint, which includes a transcript of the purported conversation, after the senior IPS office threatened to stage a sit-in. \"His (Mulayam's) threat would amount to invoking of Section 506 of the IPC, which is a cognizable offence,\" Thakur has mentioned in his complaint. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Nutan,Mulayam Singh Yadav,Mulayam,Lucknow police,FIR Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-07-12T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T10:56:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
