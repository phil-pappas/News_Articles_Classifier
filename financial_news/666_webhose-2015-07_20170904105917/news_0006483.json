Yet nothing tangible has come out of it, not necessarily because of Essar's unwillingness, but because of politicians' parochial interests that, in this case, clearly shows that they have nothing to do with national interest. \nBimha has to demonstrate to the nation that government is committed to the Essar deal and wants it to work.
