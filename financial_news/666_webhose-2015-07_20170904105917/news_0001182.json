Munger's office had argued it was unfeasible to meet that requirement given Illinois' antiquated computer systems and that the state could face stiff federal penalties for noncompliance.\nReaction to Madigan's filing was not immediately available from Munger's office.\nPaying workers would relieve some of the pressure on lawmakers and Governor Bruce Rauner to agree on a fiscal 2016 budget. The Illinois Senate will be back in session on Tuesday to take up a $2.26 billion, one-month budget and payroll bill passed by the House last week.\nRauner, who vetoed a $36 billion full-year budget passed by Democrats, has said he opposes their temporary budget as well.
