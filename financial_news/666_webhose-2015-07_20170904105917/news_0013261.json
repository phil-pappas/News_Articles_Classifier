In December 2014, RBI had set the last date as 30 June 2015. Soliciting cooperation from the public, RBI has urged people to deposit the old notes in their bank accounts or exchange them at a bank branch convenient to them. RBI has stated that the notes can be exchanged for their full value. It has also clarified that all such notes continue to remain legal tender. Explaining the move, RBI said that the banknotes in the Mahatma Gandhi series have now been in circulation for a decade. A majority of the old banknotes have been withdrawn through bank branches. It has, therefore, decided to withdraw the remaining old design notes from circulation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T09:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T12:47:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
