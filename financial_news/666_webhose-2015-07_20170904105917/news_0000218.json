Last year's raises averaged 2.5 percent and cost about $27.6 million. \nRepublican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic leaders in the state Legislature haven't agreed on a budget for the fiscal year that started July 1. \nUI will honor raises that come from promotions or previously approved contracts, UI spokesman Tom Hardy said. The salary program deferral applies to workers regardless if they are paid with state money, school officials said. \nKilleen also said the school will go ahead with academic personnel appointments for the 2015-2016 years so trustees can approve them in September but those will be made at current salary levels. \nInformation from: The News-Gazette, http://www.news-gazette.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T18:45:08.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
