It’s spending another 30 million pounds ($47 million) this year in part to expand online products, because textbook sales have dropped and university enrollments have slowed.\nChief Executive Officer John Fallon, who rose through the ranks of the education business before winning the top job at the company in 2013, has touted Pearson’s transformation into “a global learning services company.”\n“Pearson’s direction of travel has been clear,” said Jonathan Helliwell, a media analyst at Panmure Gordon & Co. in London. “This deal gives them the flexibility to do some education mergers and acquisitions and help toward restructuring costs.”\nBesides textbooks, Pearson’s products include online materials to help teachers plan their lessons , online educational games and reference materials, standardized tests, vocational qualifications as well as college and career readiness training.\nNikkei is paying 844 million pounds for the FT Group, one of the best-known brands in financial journalism. Besides the salmon-colored newspaper, it includes the ft.com website, the How to Spend It luxury publication and niche businesses including the financial intelligence firm Medley Global Advisors. Pearson owned the newspaper for 58 years.\nScardino’s Vow The sale doesn’t include Pearson’s 50 percent holding in the Economist Group and some London property.\nTalk of a sale had been around for years and heated up after Fallon succeeded Marjorie Scardino as CEO. Scardino, an American who helped found the Pulitzer Prize-winning Georgia Gazette in 1978, once famously proclaimed Pearson would sell the FT “over my dead body.”\n“The FT was definitely not Fallon’s baby, so he had no association with it in terms of emotional attachment,” said Neil Campling, an analyst at Aviate Global in London.\nFallon may turn next to disposing of Pearson’s 47 percent stake in book-publishing venture Penguin Random House.\nBertelsmann SE, Europe’s biggest media company, owns the other 53 percent. Beginning in October, Pearson has the option to sell its stake under a shareholder agreement. People familiar with the matter said last year that Bertelsmann intended to buy all or part of the stake as soon as this year.\nPooled Assets Bertelsmann and Pearson created Penguin Random House by pooling their assets in 2012 to gain more clout in negotiating with retail outlets such as Amazon.com Inc. Under that deal, the owners may sell their holdings only after three years, with the partner given the right of first refusal. Should Bertelsmann choose not to buy Pearson’s shares, Pearson has the right to initiate a recapitalization of the venture.\n“Today’s deal definitely hangs a question over Pearson’s stake in Penguin Random House,” said Helliwell.\nWith the disposal of the FT Group, Fallon said Pearson reached an “inflection point” and decided Nikkei would be the best home to ensure the commercial and journalistic success of the FT. As for Pearson, it’s now 100 percent focused on education, he said.", "external_links": ["https://www.teachervision.com/\\", "http://qualifications.pearson.com/en/home.html\\"], "published": "2015-07-24T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T19:43:04.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
