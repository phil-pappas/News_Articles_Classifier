It must connect with all your people both internally and externally. All stakeholders must be able to clearly identify what you stand for,' she said. \nMs Quist entreated businesses to deliver sustainable Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities that give back to societies within which businesses operate to create an experience that is memorable and enjoyable for the customer. \n'People want to deal with businesses that make them feel important,' she stated. \nBy Barbara Agiligo", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T12:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T13:21:30.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
