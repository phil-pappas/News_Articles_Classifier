Ben Rushton Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey The Clean Energy Finance Corporation says it is ready to help finance newly approved large-scale solar farms but that did not mean it should stop financing wind projects and small-scale rooftop solar.\nIn a statement released late on Tuesday, the CEFC said it was ready to invest in a new plan by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency to develop another 200 Megawatts of large-scale solar capacity in Australia.\nUnable to abolish the government-owned loan facility, t he government has directed the CEFC to stop helping finance established technologies such as wind farms and rooftop solar and to focus large-scale solar and \"new, innovative and emerging technologies\".\nThe CEFC is challenging the directive and, in the meantime, has announced plans were already well advanced to finance the large-scale solar projects given the go-ahead by ARENA on Tuesday. ARENA will supply $100 million in grants.\nCEFC chief executive Oliver Yates said the Australia's solar potential was \"obvious but financing for large-scale solar has been difficult due to market and policy uncertainty\".\n\"The CEFC stands ready to invest and help catalyse the additional funding required for the growth of large-scale solar in Australia.\"\nBut that did not mean it should stop financing small-scale solar and wind, he said.\n\"The CEFC will continue to fulfil its purpose by working to bridge the financing gap for projects that make commercial sense, reduce Australia's carbon dioxide emissions and contribute to Australia's productivity.\"\n Treasurer Joe Hockey, who along with Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, issued the directive, said the private sector should finance the established and profitable technologies. He said the CEFC was often a minor partner in a funding syndicate and therefore was \"just another bank\".\nThe industry and the opposition argues that while some of the technologies are mature, the financing is still immature and the CEFC filled a vital role in supplementing loans.\nThe Australian Solar Council has branded the Abbott's government's latest assault on renewable energy as its \"WorkChoices moment\" and vowed a multi-million dollar campaign targeting marginal Coalition seats.\nChief executive John Grimes said \"if the Abbott government is returned, we are done\".\n\"It's all over, we're finished,\" he said.\nLast year, when the Abbott government moved to slash the Renewable Energy Target, the Solar Council held community forums in seven Coalition-held marginal seats. Mr Grimes said that as a result of the push against the CEFC, the campaign would be dusted off and expanded and would be run in 15 to 20 seats, focused mainly in Queensland, Victoria and NSW.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-14T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:35:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
