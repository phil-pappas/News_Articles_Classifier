\n- Cost of goods sold US8140/tonne (A9050/tonne); and\n- EBITDA of US59.4 million (A66.0 million) per annum.\n\nThe company has already commenced permitting for its proposed aluminous clay (kaolin) mining operation and beneficiation plant at Meckering Western Australia.\n\nThis is a key component and input to Altech's High Purity Alumina (HPA) project that provides a real alternative to current Chinese and Japanese producers.\n\n\nProcessing Plant \n\nThe second part of the project is the proposed Malaysian HPA plant.\n\nThis is a single train continuous processing plant which will provide economies of scale in terms of operating costs and will position Altech as the largest producer of HPA in the world surpassing Sumitomo Chemicals that currently states its annual HPA production capacity at 3200 tonnes. \n\nIn optimising the design of its HPA plant the company has specifically focused on minimising technological risk by selecting proven “off-the-shelf” plant and equipment. \n\nIts location at Tanjung Langsat was chosen based on significant economic and developmental benefits associated with this dedicated industrial park which includes the ready availability of hydrochloric acid power and natural gas – all at highly competitive prices and for its proximity to international container ports and international airports (Johor Bahru and Singapore).\n\nThe plant will apply a hydrochloric acid (HCl) leach process to produce HPA directly from kaolin clay sourced from Meckering.\n\n\nHPA Market \n\nThe global HPA market was estimated at 19040 tonnes per annum in 2014 and is expected to increase to 48230tpa by 2018 growing at a compound annual growth rate of 28%.  \n\nThe global HPA market is rapidly growing in the artificial sapphire sector which is used to produce Light Emitting Diode (LED) products (55%) semiconductors (22%) phosphor plasma display panels (16%) and industrial/chemical/medical applications (7%). \n\n- HPA is experiencing increasing demand due to its growing significance in the production of today’s high-performance electronic devices;\n- HPA is the key ingredient to the modern world;\n- HPA’s superior qualities are pertinent features for a range of existing and new applications for example sapphire glass for smartphones; and\n- The price for the 4N HPA product is a high-value product which ranges from US20-50/kg.\n\n\nProactive Investors Australia is the market leader in producing news articles and research reports on ASX emerging companies with distribution in Australia UK North America and Hong Kong / China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T13:25:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
