Other seasonings are considered safe, at least for now. \nWhat prompted the recall was a routine Food and Drug Administration test. A sample of Kroger Garlic Powder taken from a store in South Carolina was tested for contaminants and it turned up positive for salmonella. \nKroger has taken quick action, removing all of these spices from stores. Kroger says there have been no reports of sickness, but it is taking no chances and is asking customers who recently purchased any of the four affected spices to return them to a nearby Kroger store for a refund or, if possible, for replacement product. \nAffected stores include not just Kroger, but other stores that are owned and operated by Kroger such as Ralphs, Food 4 Less, Fred Meyer, Foods Co., Fry's, King Soopers, City Market, Smith's, Jay C, Dillons, Baker's, Gerbes, Ruler Foods, Pay Less, Owen's, and Scott's. The four recalled spices could have been purchased in any of the above stores and if they have, they are subject to the provisions of the recall. \nIf customers have specific questions about the recall, they can get answers by calling the Kroger customer support line, 1-800-576-4377.
