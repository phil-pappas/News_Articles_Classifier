PUBLISHED: 09:06, Wed, Jul 1, 2015 | UPDATED: 09:31, Wed, Jul 1, 2015 GETTY The new stone cards will be more efficient and reliable \nFive million of its environmentally friendly chalk-based Nu Stone eCards are going to members of the National Trust as part of a pioneering two-year partnership with the charity. Now the firm, a leading stationery supplier, is racing to be first to market with a product for the financial services industry, a more technically demanding proposition. Some 34 billion new cards are produced globally every year, for banking, loyalty, membership, gift and access purposes. But they are all made of cheap PVC, which does not biodegrade. Increasing environmental controls have driven searches for alternatives, including wood and even corn-based options but nothing so far has gained widespread traction. “The international sales potential for our Nu Stone innovations are enormous,” says Nuco’s managing director Keith Matthews. “Nu Stone does not compromise on price, quality or production.” Those cards are far more sophisticated. They are melted together, so any material has to be able to weather that process and perform Keith Matthews, Nuco’s managing director The firm recruited new product development consultancy Pera Technology to handle a £1.75million grant bid it has made to Horizon 2020, a fund set up to help smaller EU firms get to market, especially those with some proof of concept and demand. Nuco expects to hear the outcome in the next few months and, if successful, that will provide the funds for its financial and security card project and potential future accreditation with the likes of Visa, American Express and MasterCard. Matthews explains: “Those cards are far more sophisticated. They are melted together, so any material has to be able to weather that process and perform. The cards have to be security proof and last for several years. It is a tall order.” Development to produce a viable rival loyalty and gift product has taken four years. It was born, and then funded, out of Nuco’s primary business: supplying affordable, quality stationery to supermarkets, offices and the education sector. Manufacture for those products is in China. The company has an office in Hong Kong and it was during a Far East visit that Matthews met a Taiwanese company with the reclaimed chalk technology. “We saw the opportunity to create something really revolutionary,” he says. “Nuco has created a range of exclusive products working with the raw material patent owner for specific market applications, such as Nu eCard in the plastic market. “We now offer Nu Stone paper products that are made from ground stone. Despite the digital revolution people still use paper, especially students.” Coventry-based Nuco, which predicts revenues of £14million this year on 40 per cent year-on-year growth, emerged as a result of a management buyout that Matthews, a paper industry expert, staged 11 years ago. “It happened at the time supermarkets were expanding beyond food,” he remembers. “Tesco gave us a break and helped to turn us into the company we are today.” Nuco employs 28 and forecasts that up to another eight jobs will be created as Nu Stone develops. The company will sell its innovations globally to card manufacturers. “Food and label producers have shown interest,” adds Matthews, 53. “Focusing on the end user is how we think we can make the biggest environmental impact.” “It has been a real challenge convincing the market we have an alternative but we’re winning. The National Trust’s recognition has been invaluable.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T11:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T16:06:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
