In late afternoon exchanges Shanghai was five percent lower and Shenzhen gave up four percent. \nHowever, Tokyo reversed morning losses to end marginally higher, adding 17.29 points to 20,539.79 \nWith Greeks heading to the polls Sunday, analysts said investors were in a holding pattern until they had a better idea about the country's future. \nGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras broke off debt reform talks Saturday and called the plebiscite on creditors' proposals -- leading it to default on a loan repayment Tuesday. \nEuropean leaders have warned that the poll is effectively an in-out vote on Greece's future in the eurozone. \n\"There could be some hesitation from investors\" ahead of the Greek vote, Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) in Melbourne, said. \n\"Markets just want to see it getting solved so the contagion effect can be mitigated and we can move on to other things.\" \nThe EU and IMF added to pressure Thursday, slashing Greece's growth forecasts for this year and warning it will need tens of billions of euros over the next three years to stabilise its finances. \n- Shanghai extends rout - \nUS data showed the economy created a solid 223,000 jobs in June and the unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent from 5.5 percent. However, the report also said hourly earnings were flat compared with May, while the estimates for job growth in April and May were cut. \nThe Dow dipped 0.18 percent, the S&P 500 eased 0.06 percent and the Nasdaq dropped 0.10 percent. \nThe soft wage data led investors to ease back on their bets for a September Federal Reserve interest rate rise, with speculation now for a December lift-off. \nThat pushed the dollar lower, buying 123.05 yen in Asia, against 123.07 yen in New York and well off the 123.54 yen earlier Thursday in Tokyo. \nThe euro fetched $1.1104 and 136.65 yen against $1.1086 and 136.43 yen. \nMainland Chinese markets resumed their sharp downward spiral, with Shanghai now down 30 percent from its June 12 peak. \nIt had risen more than 150 percent over the previous year but economists say it has been hit by fears stocks were overvalued, profit-taking and margin traders unwinding their positions. \nInterventions by authorities including a surprise interest rate cut at the weekend -- the fourth since November -- and relaxing rules on margin trading have failed to arrest the declines. \n\"Chinese brokers may still be looking at reducing their risk exposure by closing more margin debt,\" Bernard Aw, Singapore-based strategist at IG Asia, said. \nThe country's market regulator pledged Thursday to crack down on market manipulation after rumours that foreign short-sellers were behind recent losses. \nThe comments came after accusations on Chinese social media that overseas investors were driving prices down by short-selling mainland stocks. \nOn oil markets US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for August delivery was down 24 cents at $56.69 while Brent North Sea crude was 15 cents lower at $61.92. \nGold fetched $1,168.56 compared with $1,161.50 late Thursday. \nIn other markets: \n-- Taipei slipped 0.22 percent, or 21.01 points, to 9,358.23. \n-- Wellington edged down 0.01 percent or 0.58 points to 5,840.89. \nAir New Zealand slipped 0.77 percent to NZ$2.57 and Fletcher Building (NZSE: FBU.NZ - news ) was off 1.10 percent at NZ$8.07. \n-- Bloomberg News contributed to this story --", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T10:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:24:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
