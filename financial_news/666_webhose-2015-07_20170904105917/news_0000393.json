Bloomberg Share on twitter by Joanna Mather Tax breaks for landlords will be curbed in the UK, where first-home buyers are competing with cashed-up investors, just like in Australia .\nDavid Cameron's Conservative Party has handed down a budget heavily littered with tax changes, including a pledge to lower the corporate tax rate to 18 per cent by 2020.\nGalloping property prices, particularly in London , will be tackled via a restriction on tax relief for landlords who buy properties to rent them out.\nAt present individual landlords can deduct their costs – including mortgage interest – from their profits before they pay tax, giving them an advantage over other home buyers.\nWealthier landlords receive tax relief at 40 per cent and 45 percent, which is their marginal tax rate.\nThis tax relief will be restricted to 20 per cent for all individuals by April 2020.\nChancellor George Osborne said the present system gave buy-to-let landlords a \"huge advantage in the market\" over people buying homes to live in themselves.\nAustralia's negative gearing regime and capital gains tax discount have been blamed to creating the same problem here.\n While there is some appetite for change among academics and welfare groups, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has ruled out changes to negative gearing.\nThe British budget is less austere than anticipated and includes a \"national living wage\" of ₤9 from next April along with cuts to welfare.\nBritons aged over 25 will be entitled to a \"national living wage\" from next April. The current minimum wage, which applies to those aged over 21, is £6.50.\nAustralian business leaders are already worried about our high comparative tax rate of 30 per cent . They also point to generous tax arrangements for innovative companies as part of the UK's patent box regime.\nThe British corporate tax rate has already been cut from 28 per cent in 2010 to 20 per cent to boost competitiveness. Now it will drop to 19 per cent in 2017, and then to 18 per cent in 2020.\nTax rates on dividend income will also be increased, according to the budget papers. Furthermore, the maximum amount that people can contribute tax free to their pension savings will be reduced for individuals with incomes over £150,000.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-07-09T10:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:10:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
