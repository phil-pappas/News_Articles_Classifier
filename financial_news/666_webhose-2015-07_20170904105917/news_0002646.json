Nothing. It is just transaction gone bad,” he said. \nIvory Finance took the case to court, after SIC’s decision not to pay the interest. \nThe financial institution secured a court order last week to go ahead and take over the assets of SIC and sell them to defray its debts. \nHowever, the SIC filed an application in court to stop Ivory Finance from going ahead to auction its assets. \nThe application was granted, however, the court on July 16 deferred its ruling to 23rd July after lawyers for Ivory Finance failed to show up in court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T03:59:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
