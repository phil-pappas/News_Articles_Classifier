Peter Braig by Duncan Hughes A portfolio of Australian shares has generated the best returns for self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) investors over the past 25 years after allowing for performance, costs, fees and taxes.\nThat's according to exclusive analysis for Smart Money by Atchison Consultants, which advises superannuation funds. It also found a diversified mix of direct property assets (including residential, retail and industrial) was a top performer, but overall returns were clipped by higher expenses and fewer tax concessions.\nOverseas shares and cash were among the worst performers, while listed Australian property companies were volatile, despite pegging back most of the losses caused by the global financial crisis during the subsequent national property boom.\nThe analysis highlights why SMSF investors need to consider costs, taxes and potential volatility in their asset selection.\nA couple aged 65 retiring this year will have to stretch their savings to last a further 25 years, since there's a 70 per cent chance that one of them will live to 90, according to the latest actuarial tables.\n\"That means their strategy should not be totally defensive,\" says Kev Toohey, general manager for Atchison, about squirrelling away super gains in no-risk savings accounts. \"There is a place for equity and property risk.\"\nToohey is not suggesting investment strategies. Rather, he is urging investors to consider a mix of asset classes, maximise tax advantages and spread risk so that a portfolio is not devastated when the next economic crisis rocks global markets.\nFor example, the average value of Australian real estate investment trusts (A-REITs) collapsed by about 60 per cent after the global financial crisis, says Atchison, making it difficult to recoup losses or benefit from the recovery for those investors with most of their assets in the sector. A-REITs are property funds listed on the Australian Securities Exchange\n \"Don't put all your eggs in the one basket, to ensure no single event is catastrophic,\" Toohey says.\nA lot can happen to an investment portfolio in a quarter of a century.\nTwenty-five years ago, the median house price in Sydney was less than $200,000, the Australian All Ordinaries was about 1200, Sinead O'Connor was top of the pops and tapered high-waisted jeans with matching denim jacket were considered fashionable.\nSince then Sydney median prices have increased more than five-fold and the ASX 200 is north of 5400.\nA basket of goods and services costing $1000 in 1990 would now cost more than $1800, a total change of more than 84 per cent at an annual inflation rate of 2.6 per cent, according to the Reserve Bank of Australia.\nVinyl copies of O'Connor's recordings and aged jeans are among the few goods likely to be cheaper than their original asking price.\nHigher inflation can quickly devastate fixed incomes.\nMore than one in every three dollars of the estimated $550 billion in SMSFs, which account for one third of the nation's super savings, are in low-paying cash funds, according to analysis by the Financial Services Council.\n'Be careful with small percentage numbers' The Atchison study considered eight local and overseas asset classes, including cash, managed funds, overseas shares and direct retail, office and industrial property.\nThis diversified portfolio within an SMSF delivered a real return – after fees and tax – of at least 5 per cent above the 2.4 per cent consumer price index, he says.\nAustralian shares, retail, residential and industrial property were the top performers.\nLocal shares – boosted by franking credits, dividend reinvestment and tax breaks in the super fund – generated a real (after costs) return of nearly 7 per cent.\nAustralian companies and trusts receive franking credits, also known as imputation credits, for Australian income tax they have paid. They are passed on to investors when a company, or trust, pays franked dividends or distributions.\nThe maximum rate of tax paid by an SMSF fund on investment income is 15 per cent in accumulation phase. No tax on earnings is payable by funds in pension phase.\nFranking credits can be used to offset tax payable on dividends and other SMSF income.\nThe next top performers in the study were retail property (6 per cent) and residential (5.4 per cent). The worst returns were from overseas shares (2.8 per cent), cash (2.5 per cent) and office property (2.4 per cent).\nThe tax advantages of an SMSF are highlighted by looking at the returns of this portfolio if held by an individual assessed on the top tax rate.\nThe same assets were the top performers, but the returns banked by the investor would have been about 4 per cent for Australian shares, 3.6 per cent for retail property and 3.4 per cent for residential property.\nDirect property investments also produced strong real returns and low volatility.\nThe portfolio's biggest downside risk over the 25 years – which is a measure of prospective loss in any year – was from overseas shares and A-REITs.\nThe latter – and unlisted retail property funds – have rebounded during the past five years. Retail investors in unlisted trusts typically buy \"core\" funds, which have less than 20 per cent allocated to riskier new developments, less than 50 per cent gearing and more than 90 per cent exposed to property. During the past 12 months to the end of May, the sector has returned about 10 per cent, or a long-term average of 7.5 per cent and capital gains of about 2.5 per cent.\nThe potential impact of fees, costs, commissions and charges on retirements savings are illustrated by this simple example provided by Rice Warner, actuaries and asset consultants.\nFund A charges 1 per cent in fees and Fund B charges 2 per cent in fees.\nA 40-year-old earning $70,000 a year with a balance of $150,000 investing in Fund A will retire in 25 years with $466,000. The same retiree investing in Fund B and charged 2 per cent will retire on $405,000.\nThe difference in fees means the investor in Fund A will end up with a final benefit that is 13 per cent higher.\nMost funds charge operating, investment management, advice and performance fees plus additional charges for investments in real property, or infrastructure.\n\"You need to be careful with small percentage numbers,\" says Alun Stevens, senior consultant with Rice Warner. \"They might look small but they can make a substantial difference in dollar terms over time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:13:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
