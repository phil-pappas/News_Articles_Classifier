It adds an extra negative factor on top of the turmoil in Chinese financial markets, the recent rise in U.S. drilling rigs, and a potential increase in Iranian oil supply,\" said Olivier Jakob, senior energy analyst at Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland. \n\"The main implication is for euro/dollar and I think it will put additional pressure on the euro,\" he added. \nBenchmark Brent crude oil fell $1.42 a barrel to a low of $58.90 before recovering a little to around $59.00 by 0925 GMT. U.S. light crude fell as low as $54.34, down $2.59 from its close on July 2. July 3 was a U.S. holiday. \nThe falls left both crude benchmarks at their lowest since mid-April. \nWith markets already nervous due to the turmoil in Europe and China, fundamentals were also bearish. \nU.S. drilling increased for the first time after 29 weeks of declines, the strongest sign yet that higher crude prices are coaxing producers back to the well pad. \nProduction in Russia and the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is also at or near records. \n\"Demand is good, but supply is better,\" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB in Oslo. \nPutting further pressure on oil markets is a possible nuclear deal between global powers and Iran, which could add more oil to oversupplied markets if sanctions are eased. \n\"Reports increasingly suggest a deal is likely before July 9,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report. \n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore, Aaron Sheldrick in Tokyo; Editing by Dale Hudson)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T12:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T12:47:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
