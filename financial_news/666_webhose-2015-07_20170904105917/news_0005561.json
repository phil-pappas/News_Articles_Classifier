Photo: Eddie Jim\nA sacked Grill'd employee has taken the burger company to court demanding her job back as a feud escalates over \"unfair\" pay and conditions.\nMelbourne hospitality worker Kahlani Pyrah, 20, went to the Federal Court on Monday alleging she was fired for questioning the company's WorkChoices-era employment contracts.\nStaff at five Grill'd outlets in Melbourne's south-east are employed on contracts that pay below-award wages and deny penalty rates and overtime.\nMs Pyrah had recently circulated a petition among staff requesting full award entitlements and launched a legal application on June 30 to change the contract.\nAdvertisement But she was fired by the company 10 days later over accusations she had bullied two senior managers at the Camberwell outlet where she worked.\nMs Pyrah and the hospitality union, United Voice, will tell the Federal Court it believes the accusations are baseless and argue she was sacked for speaking up on workplace rights.\nLawyers for United Voice appeared in court with Ms Pyrah requesting an urgent injunction to reinstate her to her old job.\n\"I want my job back. I want my workmates to get paid the award minimum and I want Grill'd to respect our right to join a union and speak out,\" Ms Pyrah said.\nThe hearing has been adjourned until later this week while the company prepares affidavit material.\nThe court heard the outcome of the application would not affect Ms Pyrah's upcoming industrial proceedings at the Fair Work Commission, which will seek to have the current Grill'd agreement terminated.\nRegistered in 2007 under the Howard government's unpopular WorkChoices legislation, the Grill'd contract means staff are given a flat hourly rate and are required to buy own uniforms and participate in unpaid training outside work hours.\nMs Pyrah was paid a flat-rate trainee wage of $15.20 an hour when she started at the restaurant in June last year.\nSince turning 20, she was paid an hourly rate of $17.52 with no weekend penalty rates. Under the restaurant award, adult grade 2 staff would be receiving almost $18.47 an hour and up to $27.71 an hour at weekends.\nA Grill'd spokeswoman said Ms Pyrah's mistreatment claims were \"vigorously denied by management and will be strongly defended\".\nShe said the workplace agreements in place at Grill'd stores were legally valid and ensured lawful rates of pay for all employees.\nUnited Voice state secretary Jess Walsh said the contract, although not illegal, was unfair and provided pay and conditions well below provisions of restaurant industry's basic safety net.\nShe said Ms Pyrah's case was a \"shocking example\" of how vulnerable young workers are treated in the hospitality industry.\n\"Kahlani has been incredibly brave speaking up for her co-workers and asking Grill'd to respect their legal rights,\" she said.\n\"For that, Grill'd has tried to silence her and force her out of her job.\"\nAn online petition calling on Grill'd to reinstate Ms Pyrah and improve pay and conditions has drawn more than 15,000 signatures in a day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T12:18:52.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
