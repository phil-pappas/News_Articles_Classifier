Election years are not very conducive to those decisions, which is why for the Ghana situation a lot of the fiscal adjustment was front loaded in 2015”, she said. \nShe added that so many of the hard decisions have already been taken, which should hopefully make 2016 a year when the hard decisions are at a lower level. \n“I’m very hopeful that Ghana continues to deliver and continues to restore the economic stability that it had and is sensible about its borrowing capacity”, she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T12:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:46:40.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
