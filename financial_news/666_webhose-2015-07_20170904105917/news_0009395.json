The program gives developers access to data, technology APIs and insights from Citi's network.\nAussie success More than 750 companies entered the most recent EMEA challenge, only to beaten by an Australian founded company for customer introduction and onboarding Avoka Transact.\n \"We found that working with Avoka was cheaper and more effective than anything we had tried internally,\" Ms Duncombe said.\nWhile it may be cheaper to partner with a rising technology company, the program does not come cheap. Along with the cost of running a major, four-country event, Citi has also allocated funds to invest in potential partnerships with promising companies.\n\"It costs us a lot of money to put on something like this,\" Ms Duncombe said. \"It's a major investment for us and we've set aside money in next year's budget for this event to ensure we can follow through.\"\nAlongside its program, Citi also runs a series of fintech accelerator programs in the United States and Israel. Ms Duncombe said it was keen to invest further in the local start-up community after the program, although the shape of that commitment was yet to be determined.\nThe head of Citi's Israeli innovation centre, Lyron Wahrman, said the accelerator program had partnered with several of the companies going through their program.\n\"The accelerator was about extending our reach in the sector,\" Mr Wahrman said. \"When there are synergies, we try to incorporate their solutions in our work. This happens pretty often but it doesn't have to: some just take part in the program and grow.\"\nAustralia's financial technology start-up scene has flourished over the last three years, with more than 800 people registered across a range of fintech community groups.\nThere are two targeted accelerator programs already active, AWI's financial technology accelerator and Tyro's fintech hub; another, Stone & Chalk, is due to announce its first intake this year.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711", "https://twitter.com/rosepowell"], "published": "2015-07-27T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:09:30.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
