If approved by shareholders, the liquidation and dissolution is expected to occur before the end of the year. \nThe Fund's investment manager, Templeton Asset Management Ltd., is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc.

TEMPLETON RUSSIA AND EAST EUROPEAN FUND, INC. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015 TOTAL NET ASSETS: $57,945,123 NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE: $ 11.18 OUTSTANDING SHARES: 5,183,357 PERCENT OF TOTAL NET ASSETS SOCIETATEA NATIONALA DE GAZE NATURALE ROMGAZ SA PERCENT OF TOTAL NET ASSETS PERCENT OF TOTAL NET ASSETS \nYou may request a copy of the Fund's current Report to Shareholders by contacting Franklin Templeton's Fund Information Department at 1-800/DIAL BENÂ® (1-800-342-5236) or by visiting franklintempleton.com. All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. Special risks are associated with foreign investing including currency volatility, economic instability, and social and political developments of countries where the Fund invests. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with their relatively small size and lesser liquidity. Investments in Russian and East European securities involve significant additional risks, including political and social uncertainty (for example, regional conflicts and risk of war), currency exchange rate volatility, pervasiveness of corruption and crime in the Russian and East European economic systems, delays in settling portfolio transactions, and risk of loss arising out of the system of share registration and custody used in Russia and East European countries. The U.S. and other nations have imposed and could impose additional sanctions on certain issuers in Russia due to regional conflicts. These sanctions could result in the devaluation of Russia's currency, a downgrade in Russian issuers' credit ratings, or a decline in the value and liquidity of Russian stocks or other securities. The Fund may be prohibited from investing in securities issued by companies subject to such sanctions. In addition, if the Fund holds the securities of an issuer that is subject to such sanctions, an immediate freeze of that issuer's securities could result, impairing the ability of the Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities. There is also the risk that countermeasures could be taken by Russia's government, which could involve the seizure of the Fund's assets. Such sanctions could adversely affect Russia's economy, possibly forcing the economy into a recession. These risks could impair the Fund's ability to meet its investment objective. Because the Fund invests its assets primarily in companies in a specific region, the Fund is subject to greater risks of adverse developments in that region and/or the surrounding regions than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically. Political, social or economic disruptions in the region, even in countries in which the Fund is not invested, may adversely affect the value of securities held by the Fund. Also, as a nondiversified investment company investing in Russia and East European countries, the Fund may invest in a relatively small number of issuers and, as a result, may be subject to greater risk of loss with respect to its portfolio securities. The Fund is actively managed and investment allocations can be expected to change, but there is no guarantee that the manager's investment decisions will produce the desired results. The industry allocation uses MSCI's industry definitions for the convenience of comparison. The information provided is as of the date shown and comes from sources considered reliable, but the Fund makes no representation or warranty as to its completeness or accuracy. \n* Equity includes convertible and preferred securities.
