Simon O'Dwyer by Catie Low Record cattle prices are threatening to push steak off the menu and take the sizzle out of beef sausages.\nSome beef cuts have spiked by as much as 50 per cent in the past six months thanks to strong overseas buying – driven partly by the softening Australian dollar – and drought conditions.\nThe big price rises are putting the squeeze on margins in the meat processing industry and sparking warnings that shoppers need to get used to paying more for beef .\nButcher Peter Bouchier​ admitted it was very difficult to pass on the big cost increases to shoppers.\n\"There's just no cheap beef any more and it's the cheaper cuts that have probably taken the biggest rise, chuck, stewing steak and trimmings, which we use for sausage meat,\" he said.\nMr Bouchier, who has several Melbourne outlets, warned some expensive cuts of beef could disappear from butchers and restaurant menus altogether.\nThe major retailers are also grappling with the big price hikes.\nMarket watchers suggest they can't absorb the big price rises for much longer before passing them onto customers.\n Coles said the price rises in beef were great news for farmers but had forced the supermarket giant to \"minimise\" the impact for some of these increases.\n\"[However] for some beef products in our supermarket, . . . we have needed to increase prices to reflect the higher cost, \"a spokesman said.\nAldi also said rising prices were making it challenging to find cheaper cuts of beef.\n\"However, what we may see is consumers trying new cuts of meat like chicken or pork,\" a spokesman said.\nSome retailers are understood to be increasing the minimum portion of popular products like mince to support sales volume.\nIt's understood Woolworths has not changed its mix of cuts or sizes.\nHowever, it has invested heavily in keeping a lid on meat prices, grocery data released by Macquarie Securities shows.\nThe price index revealed no change in Woolworths' meat pricing compared with a 0.7 per cent increase in the price of meat at Coles.\nIt's not just the retailers that are grappling with the beef price hikes.\nCWB The House of Quality Meat supplies product to the restaurant industry and holds major contracts with pubs and clubs.\nTarik Yalcin, who has worked at CWB for 16 years, warned the higher prices for steak and sausages were here to stay.\nHe said prices had increased more than 30 per cent in just six months.\nHe said it was hard to see what would bring them down given the ongoing overseas demand for Australian meat.\n\"Everything gets driven by the export prices,\" Mr Yalcin said.\n\"We ring our suppliers on a daily basis to get chuck or silverside and one day they say it's $7 and the next it's $9.\n\"And they say 'take it or leave it' because if we don't want it, the export market does . . . this is the new normal.\"\nThe high cost of cattle is also hurting meat processors, which are cutting shifts and reducing production.\nTwo processors revealed they had cut production in response to the beef price spike, leaving one business operating just two days a week.\n\"These are hard times for everyone in the industry and it's hurting a lot of people,\" one processor said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:13:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
