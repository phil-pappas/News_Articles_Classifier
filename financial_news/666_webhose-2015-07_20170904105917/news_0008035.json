Jim Rice Share on twitter by Stephen Cauchi Gold prices may need to fall another 30 per cent to reach fair value, according to Deutsche Bank, with cheap oil the only potential lifeline for the battered precious metal.\nGold is currently trading around $US1096, just above last week's fresh five-year low of $US1072.30 .\nBut Deutsche's paper Estimating fair value for gold argues the price of the precious metal needs to drop substantially to bring valuation levels back towards historical averages.\n\"Gold would need to fall towards $US750 per ounce to bring prices in real terms back towards long-run historical averages,\" said Deutsche.\nDeutsche ran the gold price through several models to determine \"fair value\" for the precious metal.\nThe Deutsche \"gold price model\", which factors in world growth, the US dollar, money supply and central bank gold purchases, calculated fair value at $US785 per ounce.\nBut the long-run average price in real terms - using the Consumer Price Index - was $US770. Using the Producer Price Index, the long-run average price was $US725.\n\"In real terms gold prices would have to fall to as low as $US750, suggesting that even at current levels gold can still not be considered cheap.\"\n And this correction will happen shortly.\n\"We believe financial forces imply fresh lows in the gold price in the months ahead,\" said the bank. \"We believe the adjustment in US long term real yields and the US dollar is still incomplete and interest rate and dollar markets will continue to move higher heading into next year and beyond.\"\nFalling oil price could support gold But, said Deutsche, a falling oil price is the one caveat to this bearish forecast. Cheap oil reduces inflationary pressure in the US, eases the need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, and therefore puts downward pressure on gold's main competitor, the US dollar.\n\"We would view the falling oil price as the most likely catalyst to provide support to the gold price,\" said Deutsche.\n\"Not only could lower energy prices and US inflation delay Fed tightening but we are already seeing lower oil prices push US energy corporate bond spreads to their widest levels since the beginning of the year.\n\"The risk of a default cycle for US energy names and a broader credit event spilling onto US financial markets may provide some welcome support for the gold market.\"\nAnd gold could drag other metals down with it, particularly platinum.\nDeutsche's bearish prediction for bullion is shared by some analysts - ABN Amro say bullion will be at $800 by 2016 - but not by others.\nCapital Economics, for example, tip gold to be at $US1050 at the end of the third quarter and $US1200 at the end of 2015, rising higher in the years after that. The World Bank tips gold will fall but only gradually, reaching $US1000 in 2025.\nUBS commodities analyst Daniel Morgan said the magnitude of gold's recent plunge - it was at $US1200 in June - was \"surprising\".\nUBS's official forecast for gold is an average price of $US1180 in the second half of 2015.\n\"It doesn't have an upward catalyst in the short-term, anything to support it,\" he said. \"It doesn't look like physical demand has picked up enough to support the price.\"\nUS rate rises - and UBS has forecast two this year, beginning in September - will not help gold, he said. \"It's our view that they will be a good thing for the US dollar which in turn is a headwind for gold.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@cauchis"], "published": "2015-07-27T13:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T10:12:08.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
