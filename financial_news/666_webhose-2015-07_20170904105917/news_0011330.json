It is our rendition. Sabri brothers’ family not liking our rendition of the qawwali is like my grandchildren not respecting Being Human,” Salman said about the singer’s accusations.\n“I don’t think somebody from the family would have done this. I don’t think there is a legal issue. If there is any legality then we will see it,” he said.\nThe original qawwali was written by Purnam Allahabadi, composed by Maqbool Sabri, and performed by the Sabri Brothers in 1975.\nThe reworked version of “Bhar Do Jholi” is composed by Pritam Chakraborty and sung by Adnan Sami.\nDirected by Kabir Khan, Salman Khan, Kareena Kapoor starrer “Bajrangi Bhaijaan” will hit the screens on July 17.\nFirst Published on July 04, 2015 1:37 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T19:52:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
