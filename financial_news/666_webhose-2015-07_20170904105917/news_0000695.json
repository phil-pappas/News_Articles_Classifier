Comcast Corp.’s CMCSA, +3.51% Universal Studios released “Battleship” in 2012, which grossed $303 million worldwide, and in 1985 Paramount Pictures, owned by Viacom Inc. VIA, +0.00% brought “Clue” to the big screen. \n“The landscape of board game movies at the box office is a mixed one,” Rentrak Corp. RENT, +1.58% media analyst Paul Dergarabedian said. “I don’t think there’s any thing inherently wrong with making a movie out of a board game, as long as you make a good movie. \n“Lions Gate has a good business model and really has their finger on the pulse of what audiences what. They wouldn’t go into this unless they thought they do differently what everyone else has done wrong.” \nAlso see: 6 things you probably didn’t know about Monopoly \nLions Gate LGF, +0.62% and Hasbro’s Allspark Pictures have not announced a timetable for the movie, or director, but did announce in a news release that Oscar-nominated writer Andrew Niccol (“The Truman Show”) will pen the screenplay. \n“Hasbro is a partner with incredible global reach, one of the most compelling brand portfolios in the world,” said Lions Gate Motion Picture Group President Erik Feig in a statement. “Andrew Niccol is the ultimate world creator responsible for such disparate and imaginative films as ‘The Truman Show,’ ‘Gattaca’ and ‘The Terminal.’ He is an inspired choice to develop this timeless property into a big, crowd-pleasing event film that will appeal to kids, families and anyone who has ever played [Monopoly].” \nIn 2008 Universal and director Ridley Scott were set to shoot a film version of the game, but the movie was never made. A documentary of the game, however, titled “Under the Boardwalk: The MONOPOLY Story” won the audience award for best documentary at the 2010 Anaheim International Film Festival. \nHasbro, which has sold more than 275 million copies of Monopoly, has seen its stock rise 36% in the year-to-date, and reported sales of $714 million in the first quarter.
