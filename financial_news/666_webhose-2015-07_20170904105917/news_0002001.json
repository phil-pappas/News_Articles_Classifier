So a business paying an even juicier yield has to be an even better thing, right? Not so fast. Because while that first company may well be a genuine high-yielding business of the sort that income seekers love to stuff in their portfolios, the second could turn out to be a yield trap . And yield traps are businesses that you most definitely don't want in your portfolio -- whatever your investing style. Why? Because not only do yield traps offer dismal income prospects, but their share prices have a nasty habit of heading south alongside their dividend payouts. \nGotcha! \nNow, yield traps don't announce themselves as such. Online data resources don't have a column headed 'Yield trap', with a tick against appropriate names. Companies themselves, ever bullish, never utter the words. And more to the point, you can only know for sure that a business is a yield trap, after the event. Prior to that, it's a just a potential yield trap -- a share with a mouth-watering yield that lures the greedy towards it, until -- too late! -- investors find themselves nursing a hefty capital loss and an income that is only a shadow of what they had expected. \nNow you see it, now you don't \nSo what exactly is a yield trap? And how do income investors spot the warning signs? Let's take the two questions separately. At its simplest, a yield trap is a share that offers an investor a yield that is too high to be sustainable. So in general, shares offering yields of 7%, 8%, 9% or more are definitely in potential yield trap territory. 5%? 6%? That's when spotting a yield trap starts to get difficult. Because if the market thought that those implied yields were genuinely sustainable, then it would simply bid the share price back up to the point where the yield came closer to the market average of 3.5% or so. \nIn short, a very high yield is often a warning flag that the market has serious doubts that the yield is sustainable -- the first warning sign of a yield trap. Put another way, the 7% or so that's seemingly on offer when you buy the shares may turn out to be illusory. \nGreedy, when others are fearful \nAn example will help. Let's take Company A, which offers a forecast dividend of 35 pence on a share price of £10 -- in other words, that market-average yield of 3½%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T00:19:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
