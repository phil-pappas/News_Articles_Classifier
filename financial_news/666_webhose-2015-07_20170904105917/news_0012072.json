I don't want to imagine it,\" he said. \n\"In particular, for us it's not good because the UK is a partner promoting a free-market economy, much more than the southern hemisphere in Europe. [Some of these countries] want to have a more state-regulated economy, and the UK is more like us, for instance, like Holland and the northern hemisphere, so we would not be very happy to see it go.\" \nMr Fuchs described Brussels as a \"huge\" bureaucracy that needed to be scaled back. \"I fully agree with certain statements of [Prime Minister] David Cameron saying that Brussels need not be such a huge bureaucracy, with so much red tape. \n\"That's quite important, I think, and we need Cameron's help to change it.\" \nThe Conservative Government has pledged to hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by the end of 2017. \nDavid Cameron has pledged to hold a referendum on UK membership of the EU by the end of 2017 \nHowever, business groups and some MPs are calling for the vote to be held sooner rather than later. \nAccountancy firm Smith & Williamson said many of its SME clients had expressed fears about the negative impact a referendum would have on business confidence. Almost 70pc of 200 business directors questioned by the firm said a \"Brexit\" would harm British businesses. \n\"With the EU forming the largest destination for the export of UK goods, a potential British exit will become an even more pressing issue as we approach the referendum,\" said Guy Rigby, head of entrepreneurs' business services at Smith & Williamson. \nTwo-thirds of the entrepreneurs surveyed said that migrants played an important part in their business. SMEs would be adversely affected if Britain were to leave the EU, they added. \nMr Cameron wants to limit welfare benefits for migrants from other EU states, as well as introduce protection for the City of London (LSE: CIN.L - news ) in the event of closer eurozone integration. \nHis pitch last month to secure a better deal for Britain was overshadowed by the possibility that Greece could leave the eurozone. \nAngela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, pledged in May that Germany would be a \"constructive partner\" to the UK in getting reforms , and has said she does not rule out future treaty changes in Europe. \nHowever, Mr Fuchs said it was very unlikely that Mr Cameron would be able to achieve this. \nThis is not easy because you are talking about the Lisbon Treaty and you know to change it you need 28 votes, a unanimous vote.The fathers of the EU made it complicated for us to change it because they knew at a later stage there could be demand for changes. It is difficult [to change].\" \nMr Cameron wants to limit welfare benefits for migrants from other EU states, as well as protection for the City of London in the event of closer eurozone integration. \nHis pitch last month to secure a better deal for Britain was overshadowed by the possibility that Greece could leave the eurozone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T02:42:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
