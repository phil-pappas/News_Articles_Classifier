Josh Robenstone Share on twitter by Adele Ferguson Over the coming days financial services group IOOF will launch a campaign aimed at restoring investor confidence amid damaging allegations.\nIOOF's public attempt at recovery will begin in earnest when chief executive Chris Kelaher fronts a Senate committee to answer questions about misconduct.\nKelaher, who will appear on Tuesday, will hope his well-practised messages will let him ride out the crisis. If the company's statements so far are any indicator, his message will be that the misconduct was quarantined to one division, it happened in the past, it wasn't systemic and no clients were affected. Oh, and any wrongdoing was \"appropriately dealt with\" by the company. Sound familiar?\nA lot will be riding on Kelaher. If he isn't convincing, a second Senate hearing will be guaranteed, particularly given chairman Dr Roger Sexton was unable to attend Tuesday's hearing. Peter Hilton, the head of advice research, who is on leave, is also unable to attend.\nRod Clement Kelaher's presence at the Senate follows an expose by Fairfax Media that uncovered misconduct in IOOF's research division. This ranged from allegations of front-running and insider trading, the misrepresentation of performance figures, unit pricing errors, faulty research reports and juniors told to cheat on training and compliance exams on behalf of their boss.\nSince the allegations hit the headlines, based on a cache of documents and explosive whistleblower testimony, IOOF's share price has gone on a roller coaster ride, initially falling 20 per cent, wiping hundreds of millions of dollars off the market value, as investors reacted negatively.\nThe share price has recovered slightly but it is still down almost 15 per cent, despite briefings from the company and speculation that it will report a strong full-year profit result on August 28.\nString of reports The violent sharemarket reaction triggered a string of analyst reports debating the impact of the scandal and whether the share price rout had been overdone.\nThe latest report, released on Friday by Citi, lowered its earnings per share estimate for IOOF by 4 per cent and reduced its target price. Citi's reasons include the \"elevated risk near term associated with the ASIC review\" and other potential fallout from the Fairfax investigation.\nIOOF was formed in 1846 as the Independent Order of Odd Fellows friendly society. In 2004 it listed on the ASX with $12 billion in funds under management. By 2015, through a series of acquisitions, it had funds under management of $150 billion, 650,000 customers and had built the sixth-biggest financial planning network in the country.\nThe string of acquisitions, driven largely by Kelaher, earned IOOF the nickname \"Pac Man\". Kelaher joined IOOF in April 2009, when IOOF bought Australian Wealth Management, a business run by Kelaher since 1997 and which includes Bridges.\nThe Bridges business is at the centre of many of the IOOF misconduct allegations, and Kelaher and IOOF head of investigations Rob Urwin will be asked to explain to the senators why more draconian action wasn't taken to clean it up.\nPart of the IOOF redemption campaign will include the completion of an \"independent\" report by PwC into the group's regulatory breach reporting policy and procedures in its research division.\nThere is talk that the campaign will include changes in the senior management ranks and possibly at board level.\nTime will tell Whether this is enough, time will tell. What IOOF needs to do is face up to its shortcomings, including making sure staff who talk to clients or give presentations or advice are ASIC compliant. They also need to make sure there is a share register in place that staff know about and is diligently followed to ensure any potential conflicts of interest are adequately disclosed. It also needs to stamp out cheating on training and compliance modules, as well as ensure the contents of its research reports are properly sourced. (Cheating was reported to the company early in 2014 by staff, yet almost 12 months later another staff member reported it was still going on).\nThe company also needs to address its use and sourcing of research reports. Stock recommendations need to have a financial basis to be meaningful. IOOF also needs to report any suspicions of insider trading or front running to the corporate regulator, instead of handling the investigations in-house.\nIOOF needs to spend more money integrating its various businesses and upgrading its technology. And it needs to come clean on the amount of compensation it has paid to clients over the years and be more transparent how it dealt with the customers of planners who were terminated, \"moved on\" or were eventually banned by ASIC.\nIt also needs to treat whistleblowers better. More than one whistleblower has been poorly dealt with over the past few years.\nThe move by IOOF to appoint an independent expert to review its procedures will not be enough to address some of the problems that have been unearthed at the company.\nAt the end of the day the integrity of a so-called \"independent\" review depends on the terms of reference, how far back and wide the review is allowed to be and what documents and staff are made available.\nThe upshot is independent reviews or independent experts are often considered opaque. Some have been found to be meaningless or misleading.\nA lot of flak Over the past few years consultancy bodies paid to give independent reviews have received a lot of flak. The most recent drubbing came from Justice Paul Brereton in a controversial judgment in the Supreme Court of NSW relating to Gina Rinehart, a family trust and her estranged children. \"She [Rinehart] has demonstrated a willingness and ability to influence an organisation that one would otherwise expect to be independent – PricewaterhouseCoopers – to provide an advice in respect of CGT [capital gains tax] on an assumption about vesting, which was contrary to the advice already obtained, and to 'sanitise' a version of its advice for provision to the beneficiaries,\" Justice Brereton said.\nAnother recent example was the release of a report by ASIC in April into a compensation scheme run by CBA as part of a two-year enforceable undertaking. The scheme, which was overseen by PwC, was found to be deeply flawed and unfair to thousands of victims. In 2014 a Senate inquiry into Commonwealth Financial Planning and ASIC asked how PwC, as CBA's auditor, could also be appointed and paid for by CBA to conduct an independent review into the enforceable undertakings CBA had entered into with ASIC.\nIn the case of IOOF, it isn't the first time PwC has been brought in to review its operations. In 2014 some problems bubbled to the surface when staff reported concerns in the research division, including bullying, misrepresentation of performance figures, cheating and issues with its research reports. PwC's report was kept secret. Some of the issues were addressed, including a decision to stop publishing incorrect performance figures. But the person at the centre of these allegations remains in his job. He was given a final warning, had his management status revoked and almost a year later the company put someone above him.\nThis was after another IOOF whistleblower reported allegations of misconduct in the research division. Again PwC was hired to conduct a review. The whistleblower was informed that PwC had given the company a clean bill of health and his allegations were \"vexatious\".\nThe completion of the current review by PwC is imminent. This time all eyes, including the corporate regulator's, will be on its findings.\nThe stakes are high – for everyone.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@adele_ferguson"], "published": "2015-07-05T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:06:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
