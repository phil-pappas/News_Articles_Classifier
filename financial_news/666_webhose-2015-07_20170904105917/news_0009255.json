Photo: Jim Rice\nThe corporate watchdog spends a lot of money investigating wrongdoers and now it wants the targets to help pick up that bill.\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission announced on Wednesday that it would take the new tack to recover the expenses and costs of its investigations.\nASIC's funding model is up for consideration as part of the Murray inquiry. The review proposed a much harder line on corporate crime and greater reliance on user pays rather than central government grants .\nASIC chairman Greg Medcraft. Photo: Ryan Stuart\nThe government response to the inquiry is due any day and it has already begun a process to privatise ASIC's corporate registry.\nAn ASIC statement said the agency had possessed the power to recoup investigation costs where that under its 2001 Act but had \"rarely\" done so.\nGenerally, ASIC must pay the expenses of investigations it conducts. However, under s91 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001, ASIC may make an order to recover investigation expenses and costs where that investigation has led to a successful prosecution or civil proceeding against a person.\n\"ASIC has reviewed its approach and considers that it should more frequently seek to recover the expenses and costs of an investigation from the person who has caused those expenses and costs to be incurred,\" the statement said.\n\"Accordingly, ASIC will consider making an order for the recovery of its investigation expenses and costs in each case where the legislative requirements are met.\"\nCosts that ASIC could look to recover include:\nsalary costs for ASIC staff who have worked on the investigation; travel expenses; the cost of external legal counsel; and the cost of employing an expert to perform an analysis. As part of its considerations ASIC will weigh a number of factors including the resources of the target to pay the costs, the extent of ASIC's success, the effect on victims and the degree of culpability.\nThe new approach will apply to investigations from 29 July 2015 as well as some investigations commenced before this date.", "external_links": ["http://www.theage.com.au/business/whitecollar-crime-profits-should-be-targeted-and-penalties-toughened-20141207-121vz3.html", "http://asic.gov.au/about-asic/media-centre/find-a-media-release/2015-releases/15-200mr-asic-moves-to-recover-costs-of-its-investigations/"], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T06:52:49.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
