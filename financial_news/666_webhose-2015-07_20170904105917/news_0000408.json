CA is hardest & most rigorous profes. exams I've ever done across Aust, Eng & US. These people are not CAs,\" tweeted the indi adviser from Quantum Financial, Tim Mackay CFP CA MBA BEc (Hons).\n\"We certainty don't want any confusion with the Chartered Accountant designation,\" Stackpool told CBD.\n\"We'll aim to be known as Certainty Advisers designate by our 'C' symbol rather than CA Advisers.\"\nStackpool indicated there is no reason to panic just yet, as the registration process is likely to take years - even if it is successful.\nTurf war To give readers, and Stackpool, an understanding of the rough and tumble world of accounting professional bodies, we need only look at a court case which has just concluded on the other side of the ditch.\nCPA Australia landed on Kiwi turf in 2012, ending the monopoly enjoyed by The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA).\nWar was declared, and the NZICA unleashed a marketing campaign against the CPA called \"Project Ambush\".\nThe NZICA published ads that year stating \"in accounting there's best practice and then there's second-best practice\". Oooh.\nIn 2013, its boss Kirsten Patterson , seriously 'dissed​ the CPAs at a conference saying the rival bean crew: \"Wastes or misuses membership fees to pay for expensive television advertising\".\nAs if that wasn't inflammatory enough, she then said CPA Australia is a \"second-rate designation that has undermined the accounting profession in New Zealand.\"\nCPA Australia now claims these local mean beans defamed it in speeches at industry events and breached the Fair Trading Act in statements in flyers and advertisements.\nIn the court case which ended Tuesday, CPA is seeking a declaration of defamation and $NZ50,000 for the Fair Trading Act breaches.\nCPA Australia's legal counsel, Alan Galbraith QC told the court the rival body engaged in \"professional denigration\" that was \"quite extraordinary and offensive\".\nBruce Gray QC told the High Court in Wellington on Tuesday that his client, the NZICA, had made a \"clumsy response\" with its campaign and speeches by Patterson, but said they were not defamatory.\n\"Corporates have no personal reputation,\" Gray said at an earlier hearing. \"They have no feelings to hurt.\"\nMay the best bean body win.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/timqfadvice", "http://www.financialobserver.com.au/articles/stackpool-rebrands-firm-develops-designation", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YUiBBltOg4"], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:13:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
