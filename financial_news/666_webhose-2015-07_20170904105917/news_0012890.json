Enry Canaj Share on twitter by James Chessell By the time it was clear Greeks had overwhelmingly voted against five years of painful European austerity, a jubilant crowd had filled Syntagma Square in central Athens outside the Parliament building.\nBanging drums, blowing whistles and waving flags, thousands of Greeks celebrated an extraordinary show of defiance that will send shockwaves through the single-currency eurozone. Chants of \" oxi, oxi, oxi \" (Greek for no) could be heard several city blocks away.\n\"It means a better life for my child,\" said Athina Fothioidalu, holding her two-year-old daughter Ariadni. Her friend Angelos Chondrorizos, who works at a printing company in the capital, stood next to her with a broad smile on his face and a red flag of the ruling left-wing Syriza party in his hand.\n\"I can't describe the happiness of tonight,\" he said. \"This means the people of Greece can decide for themselves, we are an independent country, we are equal with Germany and with France and with Italy.\"\nThe sense of euphoria on the streets of Athens on Monday night was heightened by the unexpectedly large margin of the victory. An endless series of opinion polls had predicted a tight contest but Prime Minister Alex Tsipras' decision to call the snap referendum just over a week ago and back the no campaign was vindicated almost as soon as polls closed at 7pm. In the end his side won with 61.3 per cent of the vote.\nBut for all the pride about standing up to eurozone powers such as Germany, which argued Athens must continue to raise taxes and cut pensions in order to receive further bailout aid, a nasty reality check awaits Greek voters as the implications begin to register this week.\nTheir banks are still closed, their creditors remain hostile and their financial system still teeters on the brink of collapse.\nHaving promised a no vote would strengthen his ability to strike a new bailout deal, Tsipras will have to sit across a table from creditors he has likened to blackmailers and his pugnacious finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has described as terrorists.\n Adding another twist to the already chaotic events, Varoufakis announced on Monday afternoon he would stand down as finance minister saying his presence would only hamper aid talks.\nThese are a set of circumstances that make many ordinary Greeks – particularly those who voted yes – decidedly nervous. \"A lot people are driven more by passion than by logic in this vote,\" said Yiannis Mallios, a student. \"For them, it's a vote of pride.\"\n'Suicide note' Little wonder many observers are predicting the resounding no vote will worsen the stalemate between Greece and its creditors, and hasten the county's slow march out of the euro (and possibly the European Union). \"We argue that [eurozone] exit now is the most likely scenario,\" noted the Barclays economics research team. Mujtaba Rahman, the head of European analysis at the Eurasia Group risk consultancy, was less diplomatic. \"Greece has just signed its own suicide note,\" he told the Financial Times .\nThe market's predictions of a \"Grexit\" are based on a logical reading of European politics. Since the global financial crisis, Greece has received €240 billion ($354 billion) of rescue funds from the other 18 other members of the eurozone. Unlike other bailout recipients such as Ireland and Portugal, which have endured austerity paid back their loans, Greece has no chance of making good its debts which stand at 180 per cent of total economic output.\nThe next key date in the crisis is July 20 when €3.5 billion owed to the European Central Bank falls due. The ECB will also miss out unless a new bailout deal can be agreed.\nAthens argues its debt mountain is the fault of its creditors whose austerity measures contributed to a recession that has seen the economy shrink by a fifth over the past five years and the unemployment rate hit 25 per cent. Tsipras has insisted on any deal including debt relief in form of write offs, lower interest rates or an extended payment schedule. The eurozone powers retort is that a series of Greek governments have mishandled the job of economic reform and point to a sharp deterioration in the country's finances since Syriza swept to power in January. They have thus far refused to discuss debt relief until Athens agrees to further austerity measures.\nWhatever the case, voters in countries such as Germany resent Greece's out-of-control spending, culture of tax evasion and generous pension system – the official retirement age was only recently raised from 54 to 67 although there are a remarkable 580 professions including hairdressing and radio announcing deemed hazardous enough to qualify for early retirement. At a time when conservative political movements are exercising more power – particularly in Northern Europe – no politician is going to be rewarded by throwing Greece another financial lifeline.\nGermany's hardline finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble is so unpopular in Greece that the no campaign put his face on a poster – along with the warning that the 72 year old has been \"sucking your blood\" for five years – and plastered it all over the country. Yet back home, he enjoys a personal approval rating of 70 per cent.\nSo while the German chancellor Angela Merkel and French prime minister François Hollande have called an emergency meeting eurozone leaders on Monday to discuss the latest twist in the crisis, nobody is holding out much hope for a breakthrough.\n\"I take note of the outcome of the Greek referendum,\" said the influential Dutch chair of the eurozone's group of finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem. \"This result is very regrettable for the future of Greece.\"\nGerman vice-chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, the leader of Merkel's centre-left Social Democratic junior coalition partner, was even more direct. Tsipras had \"torn down the last bridges on which Greece and Europe could have moved towards a compromise\", he told Tagesspiegel newspaper.\nSo far only the French have made conciliatory noises. Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron insisted before the polls closed that both sides must resume talks regardless of the result.\nEurosceptics flourish Nervousness about the result of the referendum is not just confined to Greece. The eurozone has also taken a leap into the unknown. The strong endorsement of Syriza is giving confidence to several other populist, eurosceptic political movements flowering in the EU.\nFrance's far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen described the Greek vote as form of \"rebellion against European 'diktats' of those who want to impose the single currency at any price, through the most inhuman and counter-productive austerity\".\nNigel Farage, the leader of the anti-immigration UK Independence Party said: \"It's fantastic to see the courage of the Greek people in the face of political and economic bullying from Brussels.\"\nEurozone leaders do not want to give the likes of Le Pen more oxygen by allowing Greece to revert to the Drachma, a scenario that goes against the European Project's chief aspiration of establishing an \"ever closer union\". Nor does the German manufacturing sector – which has benefited from a weaker euro – want to see Greece leave for economic reasons.\nBut at the same time, any consideration of debt relief for Greece would mean they are butting up against another core principle of the eurozone: that of fiscal sovereignty. The eurozone is not meant to be transfer union but a collection of nations that share monetary policy. This principle is in danger of being eroded by Greece which should not have been allowed to enter the currency union in 2001 given the poor state of its finances.\nIn televised address on Sunday night, Tsipras declared: \"Together we have written a bright page in modern European history.\" However, many of his critics claim he knew all about the political dynamics in the eurozone when he ended five months of factious negotiations and called the referendum. They argue he is well aware the eurozone powers face an impossible choice and will not offer meaningful debt relief unless Athens agrees to genuine economic reforms. Indeed, Miltos Kyrkos, a member of the European Parliament with centrist party To Potami (\"The River\"), which backed the yes campaign, suggests it was Tsipras' plan all along to leave the euro and set up a parallel currency. He just couldn't say so because 80 per cent of Greeks – including many no voters – want their country to keep the common currency.\nFaced with demands from the hard-left faction of Syriza to avoid making any further concession on pensions or sales tax, he chose to make the eurozone an offer it could refuse. If Tsipras is indeed secretly preparing for a Grexit, he would be hoping the impact of a currency valuation would make Greece a more competitive economy in the long-term.", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://twitter.com/jameschessell", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/greece_drama_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-07-06T16:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T12:07:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
