That’s a Bad Idea Written by: Brian O'Connell 07/16/15 - 2:45 PM EDT More Headlines Protect Your Retirement from the Artful Dodger: How to Avoid Financial Cons \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) - More lower-income Americans are using prepaid cards, especially the so-called \"unbanked\" who shy away from financial institutions. Somewhat disturbingly, though, those financial types who've gone \"rogue\" are using their prepaid cards in ways that regulators didn't intend. That's the conclusion of a new report from the Pew Charitable Trusts . The report states that users of general purpose reloadable (GPR) prepaid cards are \"on the rise\" but that unbanked consumers are increasingly using their cards as pseudo checking accounts. That brings up \"safety and transparency\" issues according to Pew analysts, who call on the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to more closely scrutinize the prepaid card industry. Currently, about 23 million Americans use prepaid cards (up 50% from 2012), which enable users to load funds via direct deposit or with cash and can then be used to withdraw funds from ATMs or to make purchases at retail outlets. That's an encouraging number if you're an executive at a prepaid card company, but it should be a discouraging one for financial consumer advocates and possibly for prepaid card users, too. \"Our data show that the unbanked use their prepaid cards like checking accounts, reloading them more frequently and registering them more often,\" notes Susan Weinstock, director of Pew's consumer banking project. \"In contrast, people with bank accounts use the cards more like an ancillary financial product in that they load funds on a card, spend it down, and then buy another one. When a prepaid card is someone's only transaction account, it is especially important to ensure that the card is safe and comes with uniform protections against theft, loss, and deception.\" Currently, Pew reports, GPR prepaid cards are not required to have the same level of protection as traditional bank accounts, such as FDIC insurance (although many cards do), liability coverage for unauthorized transactions and restrictions on overdrafts. Consequently, prepaid card users should be careful, whether they have a bank account or not (but especially if they don't.) 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T22:43:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
