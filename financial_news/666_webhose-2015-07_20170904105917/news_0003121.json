Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Durkin Max Dupain's much-loved Sunbaker image of 1937 has been the silent witness to some of Australia's largest corporate deals, as it hung on the wall of a Sydney office tower over the past 15 years.\nBut as law firm Minter Ellison moves to its new industrial-style warehouse offices there is no longer room for layabouts.\nMinter's move from the Aurora Place Renzo Piano building in Sydney to the iconic Governor Macquarie Tower is forcing the firm to divest its $1.6 million collection of 56 artworks .\nThe collection, which consists largely of Australian photographic work, including pieces by Dupain, Bill Henson, and Tracey Moffatt, will be auctioned in Sydney on July 21.\nArt consultant Amanda Love put the Minter collection together in 2001. She says the sale is good news for private collectors.\n\"The works have been looked after and many have not previously been available on the secondary market,\" she says. \"Now they are priced to sell to another generation of buyers.\"\nThere might be even more good news to come, because Minter Ellison is not alone in flogging off its collection.\nSeveral companies have sold significant works in recent years, including the $13.3 million sale of the Foster's art collection, which featured works by Frederick McCubbin, in 2005 and the $13 million art sale in 2002 by Orica, which included works by Brett Whiteley and Arthur Boyd – largely acquired by businessman Kerry Stokes. Axa Asia Pacific, Fairfax Media – publisher of AFR Weekend – Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton have also made divestments.\n Chairman of Sotheby's Australia Geoffrey Smith says he's regularly valuing the large art collections of big companies to assess whether they should remain dormant on their books, as businesses look for new premises.\n\"Often it can be a matter of having some very valuable assets on the books and making some decisions about the priorities for the company,\" Smith says.\nA key reason, as with the decision behind Minter Ellison's auction, is the rush for more open-plan offices, hot-desking and light-filled stairwells, epitomised by Sydney's new Barangaroo precinct. What ironically is considered a more creative working environment has left companies with fewer walls on which the creativity of others can hang.\nSmith agrees the current style of office design is dictating a new direction in corporate art.\n\"Now that a lot of people do the majority of their business away from their physical desk, often organisations don't need as much office space,\" he says.\n\"If you are going into a new, contemporary, cutting-edge building and space, that really dictates the nature and direction of a collection.\"\nLove says given the current style of architecture and office design, new media art is emerging as the dominant force in corporate art.\n\"You could argue that our lives are becoming increasingly intangible and more transient art forms reflect this. New media, light installations and screen-based art works are perfect for these office spaces because they are more fluid and malleable.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108544913517269724355/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/patrickdurkin"], "published": "2015-07-17T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:06:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
