Whichever documents we are able to get and subsequently trace the sale of the crude or transfer of money from Ministries, Departments, Central Bank. \n\"We will ask for the cooperation of those countries to return those monies to federation accounts and we will use those documents to arrest those people and prosecute them. This, I promise Nigerians.\" \nThe President frowned at the way and manner the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation was mismanaged, saying his administration would check the excesses of the corporation. \nHe said his administration was carefully studying the issue of oil subsidy. \nMr. Buhari said he would not be a party to taking decisions that would further impoverish Nigerians in the name of removing oil subsidy. \n\"When people ask you to remove subsidy ask them to define it. Who is subsidizing who? Let me make it clear. The people are gleefully saying 'remove subsidy'.\" \n\"They want petrol to cost N500 per litre. If you are working and subsidy is removed, you can't control transport, you can't control market women, the cost of food, the cost of transport. \n\"If you are earning N20,000 per day and you are living in Lagos or Ibadan, the cost of transport to work and back, the cost of food. You cannot control the market women they have to pay what transporters charge them. \n\"If there is need for removing subsidy, I will study it. With my experience, I will see what I can do. But I'm thinking more than half the population of Nigeria virtually cannot afford to live. \n\"Where will they get the money to go work? How can they feed their families? How can they pay rent? \n\"If Nigeria were not an oil producing country - all well and good. Our refineries are not working. We have a lot of work to do.\" \nOn the appointment of ministers, Mr. Buhari dismissed those accusing his administration of being too slow in taking crucial decisions relating to governance and appointment of political office holders. \nHe cited the immediate past PDP government, which he said spent more than two months to settle down during its 16-year rule. \n\"In some quarters they are now calling me 'Baba Go Slow'. I'm going to go slow and steady.\" \nMr. Buhari also pledged to study the Diaspora Bill with a view to signing it into law as requested by the Nigerians in the Diaspora. \nHe advised Nigerians living abroad and searching for government jobs back home to suspend their ambition as the nation's economy is in a bad shape as it would take his administration at least 18 months or more to resuscitate it. \nThe president, however, promised that some of the job seekers would be engaged by the Nigerian Government as consultants to enable them contribute their quota to the nation's development. \nAll those who spoke at the interactive session expressed their readiness to assist the APC-led administration of Buhari to achieve its campaign promises for the benefit of Nigerians. \nThey also called on Mr. Buhari to sign into law the Diaspora Bill. \n(NAN)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T09:22:56.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
