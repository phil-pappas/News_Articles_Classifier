Arsineh Houspian Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Helicopter enthusiast and Speaker of the House Bronwyn Bishop has been warned by Prime Minister Tony Abbott her position will be in jeopardy if she makes any more mistakes, as the saga known as \"choppergate\" entered its sixth day.\nLabor, meanwhile, suggested Ms Bishop wore a \"P\" plate normally reserved for provisional drivers, with Finance Spokesman Tony Burke repeating that she was \"the most biased Speaker in living memory\" and needed to be sidelined.\nWith social media awash with caricatures and propellers, Mr Abbott's language was his strongest yet.\n\"I think the message to Bronwyn, the message to all of us, is please no errors in the future like the sorts of errors that we have seen in the not-too-distant past,\" he said.\nMr Abbott said Ms Bishop remained \"on probation\".\n\"The Australian people are unhappy that a senior representative in the Parliament should think that it was all right to use a helicopter to get around, when a COMCAR would have been available at a fraction of the price,\" he said.\nWaving a print of a \"P\" plate like a matador's flag in front of the cameras, Mr Burke argued, however, that there was \"no parliamentary precedent\" for an MP to be on probation.\n\"What on earth does it mean for the Speaker of the House of Representatives to be on probation?\" he said.\n Labor has begun to prepare another vote of no confidence against the Speaker, a move likely to fail, but demonstrating its enthusiasm to keep the matter on the agenda after a few bad weeks for Opposition Leader Bill Shorten.\nMr Abbott said while Ms Bishop made a \"serious error of judgment\", she still had his confidence.\n\"Bronwyn has my confidence. She has been a good and effective Speaker of the Parliament,\" he said.\nJoining the debate on Tuesday, Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer condemned Ms Bishop's actions and suggested a crossbencher could replace the Speaker.\nMr Shorten also defended using $1200 in expenses for flights and Commonwealth car hire in 2013 to attend a fundraising event in Sydney, saying he addressed the Maritime Union of Australia on the same trip in his capacity as shadow industrial relations minister.\n\"It was a straightforward flight to do official business,\" he said.\nAnger in the Coalition directed at Ms Bishop continued to simmer on Tuesday, with more ministers expressing their frustration after it was revealed this week that she used another chartered flight to attend a Liberal Party fundraiser in Young, NSW, in November 2014.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-07-21T14:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:04:37.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
