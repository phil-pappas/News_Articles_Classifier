There are also issues related to human and labour rights during development and construction.\nAmanda Clack, RICS president elect and only second female in the role, and RICS director of strategy, Dan Cook, said, on a visit to Sydney this week, that professionals in the built environment sector must take concerted action to prepare for the unprecedented global change the sector will face up to 2030.\nMs Clack said this emerged from a new RICS report, entitled \"Our Changing World: Let's be ready\", which was authored by Mr Cook.\nThe report examines how global social and economic changes will require new skills, business models and responses to developing technologies over the next 15 years.\nMr Cook said significant shifts in demographics, levels of urbanisation and economic power will impact on how and where we live.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T07:32:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
