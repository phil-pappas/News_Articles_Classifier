In 2012, there was just one lender offering student loan refinancing but since, that has grown to nearly a dozen lenders, both traditional and alternative. Chatter about the student loan debt problem around the country faces is prevalent, and many of my friends and acquaintances have asked me about the opportunity to capture some of this market through potential IPOs or by investing in the asset class. I’m not in the business of giving investment advice, but I do think there will be extremely strong growth for the student loan refinancing industry. Here’s why:\nLow Penetration\nThough much discussion swirls around addressing the student loan debt that 40 million Americans bear, there has been extremely low penetration in the student loan refinancing market to date. According to Goldman Sach’s The Future of Finance (2015) report, out of the $211 billion in student loan debt estimated to qualify for refinancing, only $3-4 billion, or less than 2% has been addressed. With more students graduating with debt each semester, the addressable market will continue to grow, further fueling the expansion of the student loan refinancing companies.\nConsumer Interest\nIn the post-financial crisis economy, consumers are interested in how they can best take control of their financial futures. With student debt being a significant burden on so many, consumers’ eagerness to find ways to reduce their student loan payments has grown drastically in just the last few years. In the last four years, Internet search volume for student loan refinance terms has increased nearly four-fold , exemplifying not only the growing need to refinance but also the want of the consumer.\nGrowing Number of Lenders\nAs noted, the number of lenders in the student loan refinancing space continues to grow. In 2012, there was only one lender in the student loan refinancing space. In the last three years, this has expanded to over 12 lenders refinancing federal and private student loans with the new entrants being a mix of major banks, new alternative lenders, and credit unions. This number seems certain to increase as many large private student loan lenders consider entering the space so they can retain their own customers who might want to refinance.\nThird Party Attention\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": ["https://www.credible.com/blog/student-lending/best-companies-to-refinance-and-consolidate-your-student-loans/", "http://www.google.com/trends/explore?hl=en-US#q=student%20loan%20refinance&date=7%2F2011%2048m&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B7"], "published": "2015-07-15T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:50:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
