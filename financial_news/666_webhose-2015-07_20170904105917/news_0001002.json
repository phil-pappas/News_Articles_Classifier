Despite its exposure to the Asian market, HSBC remains well capitalised and financially robust and is looking to streamline its operations wherever possible,\" Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown, said. \n\"Some stabilisation in Greece has also helped market sentiment. If we don't hear any bad news from Greece in the next couple of days, investors will turn back to fundamentals such as quarterly earnings,\" he added. \nGreeks banks reopened three weeks after closing to stop the system collapsing, the first cautious sign of a return to normal after a deal to start talks on a new package of bailout reforms. \nAlso on the upside, Sports Direct shares climbed 3 percent after Exane BNP Paribas raised it target price for the sporting goods retailer's stock to 860 pence from 800 pence. \nIn other gainers, Rolls-Royce rose 0.4 percent after the British engineering company, under pressure after successive profit warnings, said its aero-engine business won two new contracts totalling $2.23 billion. \nBut miners were knocked back after gold plunged 4 percent to its lowest level in more than five years as bullion's safe-have status took a fresh knock from mounting expectations of a U.S. rate hike. \nBlue-chip gold producers Randgold Resources and Fresnillo (Other OTC: FNLPF - news ) fell 3.2 and 3.5 percent respectively, while mid-cap miners Lonmin (LSE: LMI.L - news ) , Centamin (Toronto: CEE.TO - news ) and Acacia tumbled between 7.2 and 3.9 percent. \nAveva was the biggest FTSE 250 gainer, surging 29 percent after France's Schneider Electric (Swiss: SNE.SW - news ) said it would combine its software unit with the British company in a reverse takeover designed to create a global leader in industrial software. \nAmong other mid-caps, online takeaway ordering service Just Eat added 5 percent on top of a near 9 percent advance seen last week after bullish commentary from brokers.
