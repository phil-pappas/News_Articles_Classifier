Supplied by Stephen Todd W hen I look at Nina Tolstrup’s designs, I feel something akin to joy. But also I sense a certain gravitas. Behind the playful colours, the quirky lines, the atypical materials of her Re-Imagined chair or the Reveal cabinet or her Waste Not Want It seat, lurks an agenda in which the boxes of sustainability, upcycling and repurpose are deftly ticked.\nBut Tolstrup’s touch is light, her principles cleverly segued to practice; her concerns underpin, as opposed to weigh down, the design. In a derailed steampunk world of stools constructed from rusty shovels and toys made from discarded Pringles packets, Tolstrup, 53, shows that ethical designs don’t necessarily mean mumsy handicraft or clunky DIY.\nDanish by birth, London-based since 2000 – the year she set up the multidisciplinary Studiomama studio in the East End with husband Jack Mama – Tolstrup obtained a business marketing degree in Copenhagen before training at the rather cerebral École nationale supérieure de création industrielle (ENSCI-Les Ateliers) in Paris. A blonde, blue-eyed polymath, she’s applied her talents to everything from an airy apartment eyrie in Stockholm to a recycled timber table lamp. Macro to micro, the same vision applies.\n“There’s no running away from the fact that my roots are Danish,” she laughs over the phone from Copenhagen, where she still spends a lot of time. “Being based in London makes me realise even more how very Scandinavian I am in approach, in my understanding of form and function, aesthetics and simplicity. Anything that’s not needed will be scraped away.”\nRe-Imagined chairs by Nina Tolstrup of Studiomama. Supplied Eco-friendly too And the results are often compelling in their clarity: Outdoor Kitchen of 2010 is a cart constructed from objects obtained at an ordinary hardware store (although good luck finding one of those these days – and perhaps therein lies a message, too). It involves a bucket connected to a garden hose and so repurposed as a sink, the waste water collected in a watering can for easy transport back to the garden bed. A simple gas bottle hob is the heat source, storage encased in a plywood box. Branch Out (2009) is a trestle system based on fallen branches, scanned and rapid-prototyped. And 2010’s Pallet lamp is … you get the picture.\nBut the series I find most intriguing – and this is precisely because it is less readily legible – is her recent suite of Re-Imagined chairs designed for London furniture gallery 19 Greek Street, in Soho. To create these, Tolstrup scoured the area around her studio and picked up abandoned office chairs, which she then stripped down to their frames, powder-coated in eye-popping colours and appended bulging backs and seats from recuperated materials which she upholstered to match. “With a little resourcefulness there’s a lot of potential in exploring and finding the beauty in the unloved,” she says.\nOnce they hit the market, the Re-Imagined chairs turned out to be much loved – so much loved, in fact, that Tolstrup and the curators at 19 Greek Street decided to move the design into batch (that is, multiple, though not mass) production.\n Clearly, making a recognisable edition from repurposed junk (which, ironically, takes on a status of exclusivity) was not going to be possible, so how to retain the sustainability creds?\nRevitalising the economy “That was a big concern,” she recalls. “So we found a project where young unemployed people were taught the skills of carpentry and upholstery to maintain the aspect of local production and social responsibility.” And in doing so, Tolstrup hammers home the message that sustainability means more than reusing old stuff; it entails lateral thinking in order to revitalise the economy – and the culture.\n“What I love about the Re-Imagined chairs is their incredible energy and originality,” says Rachael Fry, co-owner of Melbourne’s Criteria furniture and object gallery, the importer of Tolstrup into Australia. What’s also to love is the integrity of Tolstrup’s design process. Despite the apparent simplicity of her objects, there is an intensity to the process that is palpable. In Tolstrup’s words: “To make a piece of furniture that works and yet is expressed very simply is often more challenging than elaborate and complicated visual solutions.” As I said at the outset: gravitas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T05:06:13.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
