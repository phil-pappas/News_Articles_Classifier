Jessica Hromas by Sally Rose David Garvey and Grant Saxon, the duo who were promoted to joint lead managing partners of accounting firm BDO's east coast practice in a dramatic management shake-up that ousted chief executive Chris Brant last month , have vowed to usher in a more transparent culture and refocus the business.\nIn their first interview since being promoted, Mr Garvey and Mr Saxon – who both joined BDO when the firm merged with the east coast practice of rival PKF in 2012 – told The Australian Financial Review they had been petitioning the board to scrap Mr Brant's role for almost one year.\n\"I joined the board 12 months ago and it was not long after that I moved to put the issue of succession planning on the agenda. It just wasn't the right strategy for a practice our size operating in the mid-market to have a full-time admin CEO with no clients and we wanted to move away from that to a managing partner model,\" Mr Saxon said.\nSydney-based Mr Saxon is now managing partner of the NSW practice, while Melbourne-based Mr Garvey has been appointed managing partner of the Victorian practice. Both men will continue to work with audit clients.\nBDO in Australia is an affiliation of 10 offices, making it the fifth-largest accounting group in the country. BDO East Coast Practice, an alliance between the Sydney and Melbourne offices, generates about 35 per cent of BDO's revenue in Australia.\nAs first revealed by the Financial Review, BDO Australia's board, chaired by Helen Argiris, sacked Mr Brant and split the leadership role at the important east coast practice into two in late June . The management overhaul followed months of declining revenue and infighting about inequity in remuneration at the mid-market accountancy firm.\n'More nimble' decision-making \"This new leadership structure takes away a layer of administration and allows us to be much more nimble in our decision-making processes, while also being more direct and transparent with the other partners in the business,\" Mr Garvey said.\n Mr Saxon said the new management model would help the practice stay on top of costs to remain competitive.\nHe estimated revenue growth out of Sydney and Melbourne offices will be more than 6 per cent for the year to 30 June 2015, taking total billings for BDO ECP to almost $89 million after an upturn in the last quarter.\n\"This is a good result, given the flat market conditions that everyone has experienced over the last 12 months. Economic conditions are tough at the moment and that means there is more competition in our mid-market patch from the bigger firms than there might be in better times,\" Mr Saxon said.\nThe new BDO ECP leadership duo declined to provide any guidance for the current financial year, but said they were confident of \"steady\" growth.\nOn July 1, BDO Australia appointed 20 partners nationally, bringing to 166 the total number of partners across the association's 10 Australian offices. Within BDO ECP three new partners were appointed in Sydney and seven in Melbourne.\n'More measured, sensible' \"Our core business in audit, tax, private clients and corporate finance are all very strong, with lots of growth potential now we are getting back to focusing on our staff and clients,\" Mr Garvey said.\nThe new joint lead managing partners said they plan to take a more \"measured and sensible\" approach to building up the advisory practice.\n\"As a mid-tier accounting firm it is important to think really carefully about the areas we invest in; our clients don't need the sorts of massive technology based transformation services the big four firms offer. Down the track we will probably look at investing more in risk advisory, forensic accounting, traditional management consulting and insolvency,\" Mr Saxon said.\nIt is hoped that close links to BDO International offices in Asia will also help spur growth, with several local partners from Asian backgrounds now focused on growing that pipeline of work.\nA Korea desk in the Sydney office, and China desks in both the Sydney and Melbourne offices, are generating strong returns, Mr Garvey said.\n\"More clients from Asia are investing in the local property market and doing business deals, and that's a trend we expect to keep growing strongly.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:08:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
