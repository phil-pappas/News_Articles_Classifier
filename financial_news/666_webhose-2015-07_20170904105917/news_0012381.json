Related Topics Kenya: State Dismisses Reports on Nairobi Lockdown for Obama's Visit \nThese include electronics, mobile phones, and stationery among others. \nSpeaking during the China Trade week which opened in Nairobi yesterday, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade said Chinese manufactures make quality products. \n\"Chinese products are of good quality and fair price. Kenyan products such as tea are also enjoying high reputation in China,\" CCPIT deputy director general Wu Yanguang said. \nMIE Group, an exhibition, trading and consulting organisation behind the Nairobi event blamed Kenyan traders for sourcing cheap products. \n\"It is your responsibility to decide what is the quality you require for the product you want to sell in your home market,\" said MIE international director Gary Robinson. \nAccording to Robinson, China manufactures any quality of product needed by the markets. \n\"If you choose on specification of your product which is very low and you expect a low price rate, then you can't expect it to be durable and long lasting. China can produce just any quality depending on what you want,\" he said.
