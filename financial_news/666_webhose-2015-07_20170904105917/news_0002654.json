Photo: Michel O'Sullivan\n The Australian Financial Markets Association has elected Morgan Stanley's Steve Harker as its new chairman, as it works towards releasing a revamped code of conduct for its members within the next three months.\nMr Harker, Morgan Stanley's local chief, replaces Stephen Roberts at the helm of AFMA. Mr Roberts stepped down following his transition to chairman of Citigroup Australia from the chief executive role.\nThe industry is being very proactive in dealing with these issues.\nSteve Harker, Morgan Stanley The changeover comes as the industry has continued to be marred by probes involving potential manipulation of the bank bill swap rate and incidents of questionable practices in the provision of financial advice.\nMr Harker outlined the increased importance of improving behaviour and culture and consulting effectively on public policy, including tax and regulatory matters, as the finance industry continued to navigate the fallout from the global financial crisis.\nAdvertisement \"It's important the industry as a whole signs up to it [new code of conduct and ethics] because you always risk having some marginal individuals who give the industry a bad name,\" he told Fairfax Media.\n\"The industry is being very proactive in dealing with these issues… the bar continues to be raised and I think that's appropriate,\" Mr Harker added, noting that industry bodies and companies were working toward improving culture, and raising standards and education levels of those working in financial markets.\nAFMA's chief David Lynch said the association was working with members to revise its code of conduct and ethics, providing a more comprehensive document that will beef up stipulations around ethical principles. That last document was dated January 2011, but AFMA also periodically releases guidance notes on topics including debt trading and confidential information and the conduct of market soundings.\nThe new AFMA document will also draw on the United Kingdom's Fair and Effective Markets Review, which was partly established to restore trust in financial markets.\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia's Kelly Bayer Rosmarin​ was elected AFMA's deputy chair, following the departure of former Westpac Banking Corp executive Rob Whitfield. Ms Bayer Rosmarin is CBA's group executive for institutional banking and markets. Hr Harker is also on the Future Fund Board of Guardians and was this year's joint inductee into the stockbroker's hall of fame.\nAFMA is also busy on a raft of regulatory, tax and policy issues, and is keenly awaiting the federal government's response to the landmark financial system inquiry.\nAmong other things, AFMA's submissions to the FSI highlighted the need for taxation matters to be considered due to their influence on financial markets, and underscored the importance of the local corporate bond market.\nEarlier this month, AFMA said it supported the corporate regulator's recommendations on the administration of financial benchmarks in Australia. It is also liaising with an Australian Securities Exchange working group on a simultaneous move to a shorter two-day settlement cycle for debt and equities markets.\nAFMA represents more than 130 members, such as local and international banks, brokers, securities companies, state\ngovernment treasury corporations, fund managers, and traders in electricity and other specialised markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T17:31:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
