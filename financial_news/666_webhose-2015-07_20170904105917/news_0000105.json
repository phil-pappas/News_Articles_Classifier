Bloomberg by Angela Macdonald-Smith The market's biggest surprise at BHP Billiton's latest write-down on its US shale business was that it wasn't larger.\nThe conclusion reached by most is that the prices BHP has used to test the value of its onshore US petroleum assets has not actually changed much, despite the gloomier outlook.\nBHP still has its shale business valued at $US24 billion on its books. Even excluding a $US4 billion deferred tax asset, that's some way higher than the valuations several analysts have. UBS, for example, puts it at $US16.6 billion, while Citigroup calculates just $US11.2 billion.\nCiti's assessment of the business assumes a long-term gas price of $US3.50 per million British Thermal Units (MMBTU), well above current spot prices of about $US2.80. Similarly, West Texas Intermediate is assumed at a long-term price of $US70 a barrel, compared with current spot prices of about $US52.\nBHP isn't revealing what long-term prices it uses to test its assets against, and is required by regulation to assume forward prices in any case for the first few years for valuation purposes. But the fact that the Hawkville field in Texas accounted for the bulk of the impairment signals that gas prices were only a relatively minor part of the problem. Otherwise, a further write-down of the dry gas Fayetteville business in Arkansas and the Haynesville shale on the boarder between Louisiana and Texas couldn't have been avoided.\nLooking again It's worth looking again, however, at just how the gas price outlook has changed for the worse for BHP since it spent nearly $US20 billion on its shale assets in 2011, when the forward curve was showing US prices reaching $US6 and beyond by 2019-2020.\nEven as LNG exports from the US Gulf of Mexico are set to kick off next year, US prices now are remaining stubbornly low. Even by 2019 forward prices are only just over $US3.50.\n While most estimates from analysts are more bullish, it's not by much. The consensus is for prices to return to 2011 levels of around $US4 only in 2017. That compares with prices north of $US12 at their peak in mid-2008.\nBy 2019 when the US should be well on its way to becoming the world's third-biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, analysts are forecasting prices will only be about $US4.25, according to estimates cited on Bloomberg.\nIt also contrasts to the warnings put about by manufacturers such as Dow Chemical, Alcoa and others a couple of years back when the debate over allowing LNG exports from the US was at its height. Then the industrial users were arguing that LNG exports would destroy the economic renaissance being enjoyed by manufacturers due to cheap shale gas. There's no sign of that as yet.\nSlowdown in production growth But a recovery in the US gas market rests not just on on stronger demand gains but also a slowdown in production growth. Only faint signs of the latter are emerging.\nThe US has had four years of record supply of gas, with production forecast by the government to rise 5.7 per cent to 78.97 billion cubic feet a day this year, partly fuelled by rising demand from power producers taking advantage of the low prices. For the first time ever, gas overtook coal in April as the top source of US electricity generation.\nYet gas inventories are 35 per cent higher than a year ago, at 2.577 billion cubic feet as of late June, putting stockpiles on track to end the summer above the five year average.\nIt points to prices that will continue to wallow for some time, but BHP still sees huge value in its substantial, low-cost shale gas resources in a market seen prone to demand shocks. It's just going to take some time longer to realise than anyone imagined.\namacdonald-smith@afr.com.au\nTwitter: @angelamacd", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@angelamacd"], "published": "2015-07-16T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:04:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
