Photo: Charles Pertwee\nDemand for experienced staff by international fashion and homeware chains is fuelling the strongest retail recruitment in four years and forcing domestic retailers to offer incentives such as profit sharing and flexible working hours to retain key employees.\nDespite below-trend retail sales growth and choppy consumer sentiment, about 55 per cent of retail employers are planning to hire more staff in the next 12 months, according to Michael Page Australia's 2015-16 salary and employment outlook.\nAnd after several years of low retail wages growth, almost 80 per cent of retailers expect to give employees a pay rise this year and 65 per cent expect to pay bonuses to reward and retain talented staff.\n\"It's the most encouraging [conditions] I've seen for the last four years,\" said Michael Page regional director of sales, marketing, retail and digital Richard Wynn.\nMost of the growth is coming from global fashion and homeware chains such as H&M, Uniqlo, Zara, Forever 21, Williams Sonoma and Muji, which have been opening large flagship CBD stores and in some cases are expanding into suburban areas.\nNew international retailers are also looking for staff before opening their first stores in Australia.\n\"We expect to see even more high-profile names enter the market and this will have a direct impact on hiring, so we feel confident about the retail job market for the next 12 months,\" he said.\nMr Wynn likened the boom in the fashion jobs market to the one in food and grocery recruitment six years ago, when Coles' new British-led management team started looking for staff to implement a turnaround at the supermarket chain.\n\"Fashion is having its turn at the moment,\" he said.\nH&M, for example, is estimated to have hired 15-30 managers and 200 sales staff for its Melbourne and soon-to-open Sydney store in Pitt St mall, opposite Forever 21's first Australian store.\n\"That has a knock-on effect because everyone wants to work at H&M and the Glasshouse [in Sydney],\" Mr Wynn said. \"They'll take people from David Jones and Myer and Glue ... that's really igniting the retail market.\"\nWhile salaries are rising in line with CPI and many businesses are tightening up on remuneration packages, domestic retailers are \"bending over backwards\" to retain staff by offering more-flexible work arrangements, including working from home and extra holidays, long-term incentives in the form of cash or shares, and fostering diversity and inclusion.\n\"Money isn't the massive driver at the moment â€“ more retailers are talking about work-life balance and company culture.\"\nMr Wynn also attributes retail recruitment growth to restructuring and leadership changes at major domestic retailers in the past 12 months. After a hiring freeze, new CEOs have finalised their growth strategies and are looking for staff to implement them.\n\"Now they've settled in ... we'll start to see more entry-level [jobs] and mid-level jobs between $80,000 and $180,000, from store managers to national managers,\" he said.\nGiven the level of leadership change at major retailers such as Myer and Woolworths in recent months, this trend could be repeated next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:05:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
