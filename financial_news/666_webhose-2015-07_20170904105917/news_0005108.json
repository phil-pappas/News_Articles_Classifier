Overseas custom offers vast riches \nWhile Ben Sherman's 'mod' ancestry and famous target design may be unique, there are parallels to be made between the Brighton-built designer and a number of its FTSE-listed fashion peers. \nLondon-based Ted Baker (LSE: TED) is a not-too-distant cousin from Ben Sherman, its very English credentials and smart street style making it a favourite amongst young males. And like its compatriot, Ted Baker is cottoning onto rising demand for blue-chip labels from foreign climes by expanding its presence across the globe -- indeed, the retailer has opened a swathe of new outlets from Hong Kong to the US, Germany to Japan during the past few months alone. \nThis aggressive policy is also being adopted by Oriental-inspired outfitter Supergroup (LSE: SGP), whose Superdry ranges also sates the appetite of those seeking British 'cool'. A 17% surge in retail revenues during the 12 months to April has vindicated the company's expansion across Europe and decision to acquire distribution rights to the brand in the US, and in a bid to court the increasingly wealthy populations of Asia, Supergroup has announced plans to roll out its wares in China. \nAnd while Marks and Spencer (LSE: MKS) may not be as 'sexy' as its listed rivals, the retailer's reputation as the go-to outlet for traditional, quality British goods still makes it a favourite for shoppers in exciting new territories. Indeed, a combination of improved fashion lines and easing pressure on consumers' wallets helped overseas sales edge 0.7% higher during April-June. And with the business bulking up its presence in Hong Kong and India in particular, I expect revenues -- along with those of Ben Sherman and the other iconic brands I have mentioned -- to keep on climbing. \nAnd if you are looking for even more British beauties for your stocks portfolio, I strongly recommend you check out this totally exclusive report that singles out a wide array of FTSE 100 bruisers waiting to deliver explosive shareholder returns. \nOur \" 5 Dividend Winners To Retire On \" wealth report highlights a selection of incredible stocks with an excellent record of providing juicy shareholder returns.
