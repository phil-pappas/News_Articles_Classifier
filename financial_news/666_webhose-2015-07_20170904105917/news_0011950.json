Ultimately though, with so much focus on Asia, a downturn in emerging markets is seen as having far greater potential to derail a recovery than the continuing political and economic uncertainty we are seeing in Europe.\" \nMany Greek ship owners - whose overall fleet of Greek and foreign-flagged ships is among the biggest in the world - have traditionally been active in the dry bulk sector. \n\"Many sub-sectors of the shipping industry continue to suffer real pain,\" Theochari said. \nShipping still faces a multi-billion dollar funding hole as many European banks have retreated from the sector, partly due to capital constraints and regulatory demands to shore up reserves in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. \n\"The Scandinavian, U.S. and Chinese banks are demonstrating significant appetite for the shipping sector,\" Theochari said. \n\"While private equity is beginning to gradually step away from the sector, debt capital markets are piling in.\" \nThe survey said mergers and acquisitions, pooling arrangements, joint ventures and other tie-ups were expected to become a major feature in shipping over the next year partly due to the need for new investment and capital. \n\"Consolidation, driven by both distress and the on-going corporatisation of the industry, is the natural next step for shipping businesses,\" Theochari said. \nThe survey - in its sixth year which polled over 157 respondents across the transport industry including companies, financiers and government entities - said the outlook for rail and aviation was more positive due to more funding and better economic prospects. Lower oil prices had helped cut fuel costs for the aviation industry. \n\"Longer term, the anticipated growth in demand, rising fares and freights, and increased innovation and infrastructure investment is expected to create new opportunities for the transport sector,\" Theochari said.
