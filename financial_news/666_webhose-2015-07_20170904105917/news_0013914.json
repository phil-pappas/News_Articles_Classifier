The insurer acknowledged that low bond yields have squeezed investment income. Still Cloninger said he knows how much his company is envied because of what Aflac learned when conducting a search to find someone to replace him as chief financial officer.\nFrederick J. Crawford, who joined Aflac in June as CFO, previously worked at insurer CNO Financial Group Inc. CNO has had an ROE of about 9 percent lately. MetLife Inc., the largest U.S. life insurer, said in May that it would probably miss its 12 percent ROE target for 2016.\nAflac rose 3.2 percent to $64.35 at 3:39 p.m. in New York, the biggest intraday rise since February. The Columbus, Georgia-based insurer projected Tuesday after markets closed that full-year operating earnings per share will climb at least 4 percent on a currency-neutral basis. The company had previously said the increase could be a little as 2 percent.\nCloninger’s remarks weren’t the first time that he boasted about returns. In 2010, the year that MetLife bought American Life Insurance Co. to expand in Japan, Cloninger dismissed the threat.\n“We’ve always beat them,” he said of Alico.", "external_links": ["http://ir.cnoinc.com/files/doc_presentations/2014/INV_PRES_Q42014_Final.pdf\\"], "published": "2015-07-30T04:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T23:10:50.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
