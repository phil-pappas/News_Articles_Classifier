Some economists predict he’ll fully unwind last year’s four rate increases and return the benchmark to a record low of 2.5 percent.\n“We continue to expect the RBNZ to cut the OCR by 25 basis points apiece in September and October to a low of 2.5%,” said Nick Tuffley, chief economist at ASB Bank. “That, along with the weakening N.Z. dollar, will help prop up the broader economy and push inflation back towards the 2 percent mid-point of the inflation target.”\nThe Reserve Bank now expects inflation of “close to” 2 percent early next year, depending on how quickly the weaker New Zealand dollar translates into higher import prices, Wheeler said. In June, it forecast an inflation rate of 1.9 percent in the third quarter of 2016.\nCurrency Rose The kiwi dollar rose after Wheeler’s statement and traded at 66.25 U.S. cents at 9:18 a.m. in Wellington.\nWheeler’s easing bias had helped engineer a 13 percent drop in the exchange rate since the end of April.\n“While the currency depreciation will provide support to the export and import competing sectors, further depreciation is necessary given the weakness in export commodity prices,” Wheeler said today. He omitted previous references to the dollar’s level being unjustified and unsustainable, a key criteria for intervention.\n“The market may make a lot of the changed comments around the New Zealand dollar, but the key message from the RBNZ is it wants to see the currency lower,” Tuffley said.\nWhile a weaker exchange rate may lure more tourists to New Zealand and boost export returns, the price of dairy products, the nation’s biggest export earner, has slumped to a 12-year low. Economic growth is forecast by the Bank of New Zealand to slow to around 2 percent this year from 3.5 percent in 2014.\nOutlook Softer “New Zealand’s economy is currently growing at an annual rate of around 2.5 percent, supported by low interest rates, construction activity and high net immigration,” Wheeler said today. “However, the growth outlook is now softer than at the time of the June statement,” when the RBNZ forecast expansion of 3.1 percent this year.\nRebuild activity in the earthquake-damaged city of Christchurch “appears to have peaked,” Wheeler said.\nThe RBNZ is joining counterparts in Canada and Australia in responding to falling commodity prices. The Bank of Canada this month cut its benchmark rate for a second time this year as lower oil prices shrank the economy in the first half. The Reserve Bank of Australia has also cut rates twice in 2015 as a mining boom dwindles.\nThe risk is that lower borrowing costs fuel surging house prices. In Auckland, home to a third of New Zealand’s population, prices jumped 17 percent in June from a year earlier.\nWheeler said while house prices in Auckland continue to increase rapidly, house-price inflation outside the country’s largest city “generally remains low.”\nNew Zealand’s inflation rate was 0.3 percent in the second quarter and has been below the 2 percent midpoint of the RBNZ’s 1 percent to 3 percent target band for almost four years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T00:47:18.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
