Other data showed manufacturing activity nudged up in July after slowing for three straight months. \n\"We are not going to see a lot of earnings growth in the second half of the year as the economic data hasn't been very strong,\" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. \n\"The fall in commodities is also a concerns that global growth is slowing and that ties into U.S. growth too.\" \nAmazon.com shares jumped as much as 20.4 percent to a record high of $580.57, a day after the online retailer posted an unexpected quarterly profit. \nDow component Visa was up 5.4 percent at $75.61 after the credit and debit card company's results handsomely beat expectations. \nStarbucks rose 1.9 percent to $57.65 after the world's biggest coffee chain reported a higher quarterly profit. \nAt 11:04 a.m. ET (1504 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 72.93 points, or 0.41 percent, at 17,658.99, the S&P 500 was down 8.23 points, or 0.39 percent, at 2,093.92 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 4.97 points, or 0.1 percent, at 5,141.44. \nBiogen's 16.9 percent slump weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 after the biotechnology company cut its 2015 forecast. \nSix of the 10 major S&P 500 indexes were lower with the health index's 1.37 percent fall leading the decliners. \nSecond-quarter S&P 500 earnings have been mixed, with 74 percent of companies so far beating analysts' profit expectations but just 52 percent surpassing revenue expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. \nRBC Capital Markets said investors were treating disappointing stocks harshly. While only 20 percent of companies have missed expectations, below the 23 percent over the past three years, there was a 3.5 percent selloff versus the 2.4 percent seen historically, a note said. \nAdding to the concerns regarding lukewarm earnings, the S&P 500 is relatively expensive, trading at 16.9 times forward 12 months' earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. \nStancorp Financial Group soared 48.2 percent to $113.70 after Japan's Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance said it has agreed to buy the company for $5 billion. \nTruecar slumped 37 percent to $6.73 after the online car-shopping service provider cut full-year revenue forecast. \nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,943 to 939.
