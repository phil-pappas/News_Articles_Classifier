By Chris Metinko | 07/02/15 - 07:21 AM EDT Reprint \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — Jacob Lumby, a 25-year-old in Lubbock, Texas who works at an online marketing company, is not saving up for a down payment on a dream house. Nor does he have a savings fund for an exotic vacation or exotic car. Instead his wife, Vanessa, and he are squirreling away thousands of dollars each year for retirement . \n“We are very actively saving for our future, and reaching financial independence is a priority,” Lumby said. “The general goal is to have the freedom to make career decisions without having to worry about money. That freedom isn't created by saving 3 to 5% in a 401(k).” \nLumby is not alone, according to new numbers from a Wells Fargo study. The percentage of eligible employees investing in their 401(k) jumped 13% between 2011 and 2015, demonstrating an increasing commitment to retirement planning. Still the overall improvements are meager: the study revealed only slightly more than half of Millennials now participate in their 401(k) — 55% compared to 45% in 2011. On top of those numbers, only 54% of Millennials are contributing enough to capture their full company match. \n“For the past few years, Millennials have been hammered with news about how Social Security may not be sustainable over the long-term,” said Melinda Kibler, a financial planner with Palisades Hudson Financial Group in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. “Millennials need to be saving on their own, because they cannot count on Social Security to provide for their retirement. Participation hikes in 401(k) plans are a signal this message is being heard.” 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T15:00:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
