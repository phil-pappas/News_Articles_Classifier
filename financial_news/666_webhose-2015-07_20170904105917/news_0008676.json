The government has taken action to reduce the influence of the shadow economy in Kazakhstan implementing new laws and regulations. These changes apply mainly to traditional retailers which do not have check their cash registers and the significant proportion of traditional retailers which do not pay taxes. Modern grocery retailers on the other hand usually offer a much wider range of better quality products while their storage and production are better controlled and all of their taxes are usually collected in full. The discounts and variety of marketing campaigns undertaken by modern grocery retailers tend to attract increasing numbers of Kazakhs. Despite this however traditional grocery retailers remains an important retailing channel because of the convenient locations and long tradition of these outlets in Kazakhstan.\nFull Report Details at\n - \nCompetitive Landscape\nMagnum Cash&Carry TOO remained the leading player in grocery retailers for the second consecutive year in 2014 as the company’s value sales reached KZT62.2 billion.

Hypermarkets and supermarkets are generally quite well-developed while some modern grocery retailers channels are not even present yet including discounters. In order to achieve success in discounters high numbers of outlets are generally needed as it is essential for these outlets to achieve economies of scale by having high customer turnover rapid commercialisation of their stock and a wide range of private label goods. As such no discounters chain is expected to enter Kazakhstan over the short to medium term. Over the longer term however there is chance that discounters will enter Kazakhstan as it is the country with the biggest retailing market in Central Asia and it is also the country with the highest consumer purchasing power in the region. Moreover over the medium to long term more international investors are expected to enter Kazakhstan.\nReport Overview\nDiscover the latest market trends and uncover sources of future market growth for the Grocery Retailers industry in Kazakhstan with research from Euromonitor's team of in-country analysts.\nFind hidden opportunities in the most current research data available understand competitive threats with our detailed market analysis and plan your corporate strategy with our expert qualitative analysis and growth projections.\nIf you're in the Grocery Retailers industry in Kazakhstan our research will save you time and money while empowering you to make informed profitable decisions.\nThe ;Grocery Retailers in ;Kazakhstan market research report includes:\n * Analysis of key supply-side and demand trends\n * Detailed market shares for international and locally-based retailers\n * Historic volumes and values company and brand market shares\n * Five year forecasts of market trends and market growth ; ;\n * Robust and transparent market research methodology conducted in-country\nOur market research reports answer questions such as:\n * How is grocery retailing performing in Kazakhstan?\n * Are consumers switching towards more convenient grocery channels?\n * Are independent and family run grocery stores coming under pressure in Kazakhstan?\nReasons to Get this Report\n * Gain competitive intelligence about market leaders\n * Track key industry trends opportunities and threats\n * Inform your marketing brand strategy and market development sales and supply functions\nAbout Fast Market Research\nFast Market Research is a leading distributor of market research and business information.
