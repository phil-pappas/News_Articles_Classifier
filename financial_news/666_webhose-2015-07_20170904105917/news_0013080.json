The majority of policyholders are employed in the private sector. \nThe number of service providers amounted to nearly 2521 while 28 insurance companies and eight claims management companies operate in the Kingdom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T06:10:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
