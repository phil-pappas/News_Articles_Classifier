In other news: markets partially rebound amid rumors that Greece will yield on key issues; and U.S. economic news this week is mostly strong. \nWith no Greek deal over the weekend , a default on Tuesday was all but certain raising fears of a Greek exit from the euro and likely the EU. The markets plunged on Monday around 2 percent (their biggest selloff this year), with the Dow dropping 350 points (1.95%), the S&P 500 dropping 43.9 points (2.09%), and the Nasdaq Composite dropping 122 points (2.4%). Greece initiated capital controls on its banks Sunday to limit the strains on its financial system and to stem the outflow of cash. This will effectively keep the banks closed until July 6, a day after a national referendum vote by the Greek people will determine if Greece will accept the terms of their creditors (a cut in pensions and higher taxes). On June 30 Greece defaulted on a 1.6 billion euro loan payment with the IMF. \nOn Wednesday, U.S. and European markets surged on news of a leaked letter indicating that Greece is willing to concede to the demands of its creditors. The Dow ended up 138 points (0.8%), the S&P 500 up 14.3 points (0.69%), and the Nasdaq Composite up 26 points (0.53%). Responses from Greece's creditors was stern, with little show of any compromise; their focus now is on handling the crisis if Greece exits the EU. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has ruled out any agreement prior to the Greek national referendum planned for Sunday, July 5. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said a 'No' vote does not mean Greece will drop the euro . \nThis week has released mostly strong U.S. economic news: factory activity grows and construction spending hits over 6-year high indicating pace in manufacturing sector improved slightly more than expected; private job creation is heating up , with companies adding 237,000 jobs (218,000 expected) which could lead to a higher jobs number on Thursday; consumer confidence jumps again in June , indicating consumers expect business conditions to improve; and home prices across the America rose 4.9 percent in April , indicating sales of new and existing homes are on the rise along with construction of new homes. \nIf you're trading options, it is suggested trading Put Credit spreads for the remainder of this week at 2.0 standard deviations or greater. Expect the price of the SPX to fall within 2043 and 2113 (2 standard deviations) by this Thursday. \nFor more information about options, see the 'Suggested Links' below.
