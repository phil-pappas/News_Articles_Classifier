Bhatkal, an accused in many terror attacks including Dilsukhnagar bomb blast on Hyderabad, is lodged in Cherlapally Jail. Deputy Inspector General (Prisons) Narasimha said Bhatkal was provided facility to speak to his family members on the direction of a court in February this year, and can exercise it twice a week for a duration of five minutes. He denied that the jail authorities had provided mobile phone facility to him. The officer said all prisoners are allowed to speak to their family members over landline phone. The DIG was talking to reporters amid reports in a section of media that Bhatkal told his wife that he would be out soon with help from Damascus, triggering fears that he may get help from Islamic State (IS). The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is reported to have intercepted the conversation. The DIG said they have not received any information from NIA, but as a precautionary measure, security had been beefed up.
