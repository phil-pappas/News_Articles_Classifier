(Submitted photo: CoStar) Braemar Office Park in Edina sells for $22 million By: Finance and Commerce Staff July 15, 2015 2:09 pm 0 \nAn Oregon investor paid $22.35 million for two office buildings along Interstate 494 in Edina, according to a certificate of real estate value made public Wednesday. \nAn entity related to Portland-based Felton Properties closed Tuesday on the two-building Braemar Office Park at 7900 and 8000 W. 78th St. The portfolio includes about 215,192 square feet of office space. \nThe deal breaks down to about $103.86 per square foot. \nFelton couldn’t be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. \nThe two four-story buildings, each constructed in 1983, sit on the northeast quadrant of Highway 169 and I-494. The Braemar Golf Course, Braemar Arena and Braemar Golf Dome are just north of the buildings. \nTenants include Harleysville Insurance, Intelligent Financial Strategies, CBRE Group and Blake Financial Group, according to CoStar Group. \nThe seller is RREEF America REIT III Corp., an entity related to Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management . The company paid a combined $24.4 million for the properties in 2006, according to property tax records. \nHennepin County values the buildings at a combined $17.65 million. \nThe majority of Felton’s properties are in the Portland market, but the company also paid $16.2 million to buy the historic Rand Tower in downtown Minneapolis last summer. \nFelton CEO Matt Felton told Finance & Commerce at the time that Minneapolis-St. Paul offers better risk-reward ratios than other national markets. \n“On a national basis, real estate is becoming more and more expensive,” he said in July 2014. “It’s harder to find intrinsic value in many of the markets we own and operate in.” \nFelton also said his company targets “well-located” buildings with “reasonable returns.” Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T22:29:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
