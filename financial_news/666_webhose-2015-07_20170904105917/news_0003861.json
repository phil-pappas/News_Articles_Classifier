Iran and six world powers reached a landmark nuclear deal on Tuesday meant to place long-term verifiable limits on nuclear programs that Tehran could modify to make atomic arms. AP by Tony Walker US President Barack Obama has described the nuclear deal with Iran as \"an opportunity to move in a new direction\". This places an optimistic interpretation on a highly complex geo-strategic agreement whose fine print will be examined in the minutest detail in the next days and weeks.\nThe question for America's friends and allies is whether a deal struck with the Islamic Republic after months of difficult negotiations will prove to be a positive development, or one that will simply embolden Iran in its ruthless pursuit of regional hegemony.\nWill this agreement lead to Iran resuming constructive engagement with the outside world, or will it enable a newly-cashed up Tehran to assert itself regionally at a time when the Middle East is in turmoil and opportunities for mischief abound?\n\"Everyone should be careful about predicting or assuming in any way that this will lead to a moderating of Iran's behaviour towards its own citizens or toward its neighbours,\" says Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations.\nThe glass half-full view is that the deal will boost forces in Iran allied with the \"relatively moderate\" President Hassan Rouhani and thus facilitate a normalisation of Iran's strained relations with the outside world, including Western business.\nThe glass half-empty version is that an easing of sanctions, and more importantly, the ability of Iran to ramp up oil production free of constraints, will simply provide the wherewithal for Tehran to increase its power and influence, and, in the process, add to pressures on countries like Israel and Saudi Arabia?\nThe administration and its supporters are seeking to sell the agreement as a win for pragmatism in the face of widespread criticism of the terms of the deal from Republicans and from regional allies.\n\"A nuclear-armed Iran, or an Iranian nuclear program unconstrained by any serious long-term restrictions, multiplies exponentially the dangers in an already chaotic region,\" William Burns, former deputy secretary of state and the man who was involved in the secret diplomacy that led to negotiations with Iran, told The New York Times .\n The least worst option Concerns about a rampant Iran – freed of sanctions constraints – are entirely legitimate, but for the Obama administration and its successors the issue was always going to be what was the least worst option, or, put another, the lesser of various evils.\nThe alternative was continued sanctions that would, inevitably, have frayed over time and prospects of Iran pushing ahead with its nuclear program, prompting a regional nuclear arms race of nightmarish potentialities.\nAs things stood, a nuclear threshold Iran was assessed by Western intelligence as being tow to three months away from testing a nuclear device.\nUnder the terms of the agreement struck in Vienna between Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany, Tehran will be constrained for 10 years from pre-positioning centrifuges that would enable it – theoretically – to enrich uranium to weapons grade.\nIt would also be precluded from producing enriched uranium for 15 years.\nThis is both the nub of the agreement, and its weakness, as Haass suggests.\n\"There is nothing in the agreement that says what Iran cannot do in ten years on centrifuges and fifteen years on enriched uranium,\" he says.\n\"So, the real concern I have is less the strategic significance of Iranian non-compliance than the strategic significance of Iranian compliance.\"\nHaass, who has worked for Republican administrations, believes the US and its negotiating allies \"compromised more than we should have\", both on the issues of centrifuges and enrichment and on arms embargos.\nUnder the agreement, embargos on arms shipments will remain in place for five years and eight years on missiles.\n\"It just seems to me that a desire on our part to avoid either a totally constrained Iran or a war propelled us to go further that we should have on some of the compromises,\" he adds.\n\"There were too many areas where we seemed to split the difference rather than insist on something closer to our position.\"\nHaass's views and those of other hawkish commentators do not go unchallenged.\n\"Put bluntly – and in defiance of the hyperbolic objections of the deal's critics – Iran has been pushed far back from a militarised program for many years, even if it really was seeking nuclear weapons in the first place,\" writes Scott Lucas, professor of international politics at Birmingham University.\n\"It no longer has any 20 per cent uranium in a form that can be developed for a bomb, and even its 5 per cent uranium is sharply reduced. Its nuclear facilities, including enrichment plants and a proposed heavy-water nuclear reactor, are under an extensive and tightly defined system of inspections.\"\n\"Iran will finally adhere to the Additional Protocol of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\".\nThis latter confines adherents to peaceful uses of nuclear power.\nDifficult negotiations in Congress Argument about the duration of constraints on Iran's nuclear program and embargos on its weapons imports are the potential sticking points in what promises to be difficult negotiations between the administration and Republican-controlled Congress.\nCongressional approval is required to phase-out of sanctions.\nInitial indications are that Republicans will put up a fight with all of the Republican presidential hopefuls coming out in opposition. In Congress itself, Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he begins \"from a place of deep scepticism\".\nSenator Corker described Iran as the world's \"lead sponsor of terrorism\", and voiced concerns heard across the Middle East from Israel to Saudi Arabia that an emboldened Iran would prove more difficult to contain.\nCongress is beginning a 60-day review of the agreement in which many Republicans are likely to take their cue from Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu who described the deal as an \"historic\" blunder.\n\"Iran will get a jackpot, a cash bonus of hundreds of billions of dollars, which will enable it to continue to pursue its aggression and terror in the region and in the world,\" Netanyahu said.\n\"Iran is going to receive a sure path to nuclear weapons.\"\nObama telephoned both Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia's King Salman to reassure them America remained committed to their defence, but neither seemed reassured.\nIn Riyadh, a Saudi official told Reuters \"we have learned as Iran's neighbours in the last 40 years that goodwill only led us to harvest sour grapes.\"\nIn Melbourne, Colin Rubenstein, executive director of the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council called on Australia to ensure the deal was subjected to \"maximum scrutiny\".\n\"This is too fateful an issue to allow eagerness to reach a diplomatic resolution to undermine the essential interests of the global community in preventing proliferation and destabilisation in the world's most volatile and dangerous region,\" Rubenstein said.\nAdding to concerns about the deal among regional allies and opponents in America will be initial reactions from Iran's friends in Iraq and Syria. In Damascus, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad hailed the agreement as a breakthrough that would enable Iran to support \"just causes\".\nThe view from Baghdad In Baghdad, Iraq's deputy prime minister Hoshiyar Zebari welcomed the agreement, saying any deal that lessened tensions between Iran and the West was a desirable outcome for the region.\nOn the other hand, former prime minister Ayad Allawi, a secular Shiite aligned with Sunni parties, was more circumspect.\n\"Regional security includes not interfering in internal affairs of countries,\" Allawi, who has had his differences with Tehran, said pointedly.\nTehran is a steadfast backer of the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad. Iran's Revolutionary Guards units are involved in a fight with Islamic State forces in Iraq, and in Syria.\nIran's Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, is engaged in combat with Sunni extremists, including IS, in Syria.\nWhat remains now, apart from Congressional deliberations that may prove messy and draw a presidential veto if a vote goes against the administration, is a complex technical process under which Iran will have to demonstrate it is complying with the agreement.\nThis will require Tehran to draw down uranium stocks, demonstrate it has dismantled operating centrifuges, put limits on existing nuclear facilities and convince the outside world that it is not cheating by pursuing a secret program at undisclosed sites.\nUnder the agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will verify Iran's compliance by December to enable sanctions to be eased.\n\"So, Iran's oil exports halved since 2012 will not be boosted until spring 2016 at the earliest,\" professor Lucas writes. \"It will still face the challenge of attracting foreign investment for the oil and gas sector and other vital industrial areas. By the time they have righted the economic ship, their adherence to the agreement should be well established.\"\nThis is positive spin.\nWhat is the case is that sanctions have been shown to have worked in the sense that it is extremely unlikely Iran would have acceded to the terms of such an agreement – however imperfect from the West's perspective – if it was not under significant economic duress.\nIran's economy has been hammered by nearly a decade of sanctions.\nIn the 48 hours since the deal was struck, there has been much optimistic talk about a change in Iran's behaviour, bearing in mind it remains – in Washington's eyes at least – one of the world's leading state sponsors of terrorism.\nNo sudden transformation Iran's revolutionary impulses, its support for repugnant regimes, its presence in Iraq and Syria and the pressure it exerts on moderate Sunni regimes in the Gulf mean that it will not suddenly transform itself into a benign global citizen.\nInternal conflicts in Iran itself between hardliners and \"moderates\" clustered around President Rouhani will ensure that a change of behaviour will not come about overnight, if at all.\n\"It would be a mistake to in any way defend this agreement on the basis that it will lead to a change in Iran's character or behaviour,\" says Council on Foreign Relations president Haass. \"At no point over the duration of this agreement ought we cut Iran any slack on the details of the agreement in the hope that somehow its intentions evolve. That would be a real mistake.\"\nThe West may have a relatively positive view of Iran's president Rouhani, but he is far from a free agent, but it is the case that a successful conclusion to protracted negotiations will have strengthened his hand in a treacherous political environment.\nIn the end, the agreement marks something of a leap of faith for Obama who has staked his foreign policy legacy on efforts to engage – rather than disengage – longstanding foes like Iran and Cuba.\nIn Iran's case it will be some years before the success of Obama's outreach can be judged.\n\"History shows that America must lead not just with our might but with our principles,\" he said in a televised address. He might have added: \"history will also judge.\"\nTony Walker is the AFR 's International Editor.
