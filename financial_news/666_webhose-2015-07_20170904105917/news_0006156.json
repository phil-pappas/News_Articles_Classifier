Holiday let units in Adelaide came in third with a yield of 6.02 per cent, followed by Cairns (5.84 per cent) and Melbourne (5.51 per cent). Unit 207/455 Brunswick Street in Fortitude Valley is a 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom, 1 car space property that could be yours for offers over $259,000. Source: Supplied\nBrisbane beat Melbourne despite the Victorian capital having a cheaper median unit price ($453,500 in Melbourne versus $487,000 Brisbane). That was because Brisbane fetched high median rents per week at $570 compared to $480 per week in Melbourne.\nSydney dropped three spots to seventh place for units, yielding 5.26 per cent off average rent of $760 per week and a median unit price of $756,000.\nMoney expert Michelle Hutchison of finder.com.au said the top 10 travel spots may not necessarily provide the best investment returns.\nGREEK ISLANDS NOW CHEAPER THAN SYDNEY HOUSES\n“For the second year in a row, we’ve seen the busiest travel spots return some of the lowest yields for investors because their demand causes high property values that outpaces their rental prices. This could potentially mean a bad investment decision,” she said.\n“Property investors need to do their research when comparing investment property hot spots, including the potential return on their investments. And the return on a property can be massively impacted by the investment home loan, so investors need to spend as much time comparing investment locations as the best value investment home loans to maximise their return.”\nHoliday unit Top 10 yields:\nPort Douglas 7.45%\nBrisbane 6.11%\nAdelaide 6.02%\nCairns 5.84%\nMelbourne 5.51%\nCessnock 5.42%\nSydney 5.26%\nMargaret River 5.18%\nNoosa 5.06%\nHobart 4.71%\nSource: finder.com.au\nOriginally published as QLD tops holiday investor yields ", "external_links": ["http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/qld-tops-holiday-investor-yields-when-it-comes-to-units/story-fndbalka-1227442682990?sv=67e01a78062e0a8d845a58955c3a9342", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=QLD+tops+holiday+investor+yields&c=SYDNEY+may+be+the+most+popular+tourist+destination+in+Australia%2C+but+if+you+want+to+make+some+money+off+holiday+property+investment%2C+you%26%238217%3Bd+be+better+placed+to+sink+your+funds+into+Queensland.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/qld-tops-holiday-investor-yields-when-it-comes-to-units/story-fndbalka-1227442682990?sv=67e01a78062e0a8d845a58955c3a9342", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/qld-tops-holiday-investor-yields-when-it-comes-to-units/story-fndbalka-1227442682990?sv=67e01a78062e0a8d845a58955c3a9342&title=QLD+tops+holiday+investor+yields", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/qld-tops-holiday-investor-yields-when-it-comes-to-units/story-fndbalka-1227442682990?sv=67e01a78062e0a8d845a58955c3a9342&h=QLD+tops+holiday+investor+yields", "http://www.couriermail.com.au/realestate/news/qld-tops-holiday-investor-yields-when-it-comes-to-units/story-fnihpu6h-1227442682990", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/qld-tops-holiday-investor-yields-when-it-comes-to-units/story-fndbalka-1227442682990?sv=67e01a78062e0a8d845a58955c3a9342&title=QLD+tops+holiday+investor+yields", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/qld-tops-holiday-investor-yields-when-it-comes-to-units/story-fndbalka-1227442682990?sv=67e01a78062e0a8d845a58955c3a9342"], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T01:26:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
