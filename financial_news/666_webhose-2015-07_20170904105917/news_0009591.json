From his cookbooks, Food Food TV channel to restaurants spanning cities, he can easily be called the ultimate authority when it comes to Indian food.\nIn an exclusive chat with TOI Food, the chef shared about the importance of cooking equipment in the kitchen and some lost cooking rules. Here's a lowdown:\nYou lay a lot of emphasis on the cooking equipment. What is the significance of right cooking equipment in the kitchen? Does it alter the taste too?\nRight cooking equipment in the kitchen is definitely required for optimum utilization of resources without wastage of time. The right cooking equipment comes into play when a recipe demands ingredients to be mashed/chopped/blended to a particular consistency, at such times if it's not done right, it can affect the final outcome of the dish. As far as taste is concerned, I would say use of earthenware does enhance the flavours for sure.\nIs there any old school cooking item in the kitchen that you feel will never get outdated?\nSilbatta a.k.a the stone grinder!\nAny cooking equipment that you feel should immediately be replaced from a regular Indian kitchen?\nAs useful as it is, it still has to be the refrigerator. Eat fresh instead!\nWhat are the signs of a health scare we need to look out for in the kitchen?\nThe most important one - avoid usage of metal spoons or ladles on non-stick cookware. These can cause scratches on the pans and pots, causing them to wear out. Once the surface starts to peel off, it's best to replace them. Wood or silicon is the best option instead.\nDiscard the cookware or dinnerware immediately if it develops cracks or rough edges. The food gets stuck on these, making it favourable for bacteria to grow. Not to forget, keep the sponge used to clean the sink away from all edible stuff, at all times! It's a hotbed of germs and bacteria.\nAre there any specific techniques one need to follow while cleaning kitchen equipment - mixers, dinnerware, non-stick pan?\nIt is imperative to clean the cooking equipment thoroughly after use, as residue of food left behind till the next time the equipment is used can result in the formation of germs, fungus and bacteria. The equipment should preferably be cleaned with warm water and a mild detergent and one must ensure that it is dried thoroughly before being put away for the same reason as mentioned above.\nWhat is the right table setting technique that people can follow at their households RIGHT NOW?\nThere is nothing like right or wrong. We all know about placing the fork to the left and the spoon to the right and I'm sure you don't want to know that. In today's times, it's more than enough if the family can sit and eat together! As rightly said, the family that dines together, stays together!\nWhich is your favourite and indispensable kitchen equipment?\nIt has to be my slow juicer. Not a single day passes without me using it!\nImagine you are stuck with one kitchen equipment and lots of fresh produce around you. What will you cook and how?\nIt has to be a delightful combination of some of my favourite fruits and veggies that I'll just dunk into my slow juicer and juice up! The combination and possibilities are endless!\nYou are an inspiration for many food enthusiasts. What is your tip for them?\nCook fresh. Eat fresh. Serve with love.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Sanjeev Kapoor,Kitchen hacks,Indian kitchen,cooking mistakes,cooking equipment Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-07-28T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:48:18.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
