Results are widely expected to come in below par and exorbitant valuations are emerging as clear and present danger to the U.S. markets. However, the failure of various metrics to accurately estimate valuations is causing confusion. \nConventional Valuation Approaches \nAccording to Thomson Reuters estimates, the forward P/E for the S&P 500 stood at 16.5 midway through Friday’s trading session. This is 10% higher than the historic mean of 15. The metric is significantly lower than the dot-com boom record of 24.5 back in 1999. But it is the highest level experienced in more than a decade. \nThe two most popular value metrics are forward P/E and TTM P/E. Those investing using the second approach are skeptical about the accuracy of forward estimates. They say that incorrect assumptions, bias of analysts and a generally bullish approach lead to a variety of errors. \nHowever, both approaches seem to be converging when it comes to concerns about overvaluation. One estimate, released by Charles Schwab last week showed that both of these measures were hovering above their medians. Forward P/E for the S&P 500 was at 19, higher than the median value of 17.9. Meanwhile at 17, TTM P/E was higher than its median value of 14.8. \nCAPE Ratio \nThe third most popular approach makes allowances for real price levels. In this case, the inflation-adjust price of the S&P 500 is divided by the moving average of the last 10 years earnings to arrive at a metric with a long-term perspective on valuation. US CPI is utilized to account for inflationary changes. \nThe idea behind utilizing 10 years of earnings is to smooth out the effects of business cycles. This gives us the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio or CAPE ratio. Some call this the Shiller ratio after Nobel laureate Robert Shiller who has popularized it. \nIn this case, the results are similar in the sense that they also indicate that stocks are overvalued. However, there is one significant difference. Thomson Reuters estimates from the end of June indicate that the CAPE or Shiller ratio was nearly 27, compared to the TTM ratio of around 19 for the S&P 500. Now, the debate becomes not one about direction, but one centered on magnitude. \nLow Inflation Leads to Low Interest Rates \nNaturally, there are skeptics about the efficacy of the CAPE approach as well. Shiller himself is also unable to explain the various issues surrounding the debate. However, he does point toward the one factor which has created several distortions in the first place. \nThis is the prevalence of a low interest rate regime across most of the developed world. Low interest rates in turn originate from the low levels of inflation being experienced. In fact, both of these indicators are nearly 65% lower than average levels, according to one estimate. This usually leads to high P/E ratios. \nOur Choices \nIt seems the primary reason for such exorbitant P/E ratios is weak earnings growth. This requires a separate discussion, but most of first quarter earnings weakness can be traced to the energy sector. In the short run, it seems that stocks are indeed overvalued, but not to a degree which can be termed as excessive. This is due to the distortions being experienced by valuation metrics due to the effects of low inflation rates. \nHowever, it would be wise to remain wary about valuations, since they do remain higher than usual. Below we present three domestic S&P 500 stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank. They also acquit themselves creditably on several valuation metrics, including our Value Style Score. \nFinding a great value stock can be a tough task. But thanks to our new style score system we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for value investors in the near term. The Value Style Score condenses all valuation metrics into one actionable score that helps investors steer clear of ‘value traps’ and identify stocks that are truly trading at a discount. \nOur research shows that stocks with Value Style Scores of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities in the value investing space. \nTyson Foods, Inc. TSN produces, distributes and markets chicken, beef, pork, prepared foods and allied products. \nTyson Foods holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a Value Style Score of ‘A.’ The company has expected earnings growth of 17.7% for the current year. The forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) for the current financial year (F1) is 12.42. The Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) P/E is 13.69. \nPACCAR Inc. PCAR is the third-largest manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks in the world and has substantial manufacturing exposure to light/medium trucks. \nApart from a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), PACCAR has a Value Style Score of ‘A.’ The company has expected earnings growth of 18.7% for the current year and a P/E (F1) of 13.88x and TTM P/E of 15.42. \nThe Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company GT is one of the world’s largest tire manufacturing companies, selling under Goodyear, Kelly, Dunlop, Fulda, Debica, Sava and various other “house” brands as well as private-label brands. \nGoodyear holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a Value Style Score of ‘B.’ The company has expected earnings growth of 5.4% for the current year and a P/E (F1) of 9.7x and TTM P/E of 10.35. \nCurrent stock valuations may not seem as exorbitant as they appear on first glance. However, it would be prudent to remain watchful about this issue when picking stocks. This is why these stocks would make good additions to your portfolio. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.
