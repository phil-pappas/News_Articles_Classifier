James Mooney by Jonathan Barrett \"Don Randall picked me up from the brink of a black hole and gave me some light and hope.\"\nFor many Australians, Don Randall, who died on Tuesday, aged 62, will be remembered as a direct, controversial and at times inappropriate conservative MP who helped spark the February leadership spill motion against Prime Minister Tony Abbott.\nBut to many in and around his electorate of Canning – an urban and rural electoral division south of Perth – the same fiery qualities that sometimes got Randall into trouble made him the perfect person to have in your corner.\nWest Australian farmer Peter Swift said Mr Randall came to his aid in 2009 after intense litigation with a state government department over land clearing allegations left him with diminished health and finances.\n\"I was in a bad way,\" said Mr Swift, who ultimately won the court battle. \"Don Randall and [deputy liberal leader] Julie Bishop were the only people helping me deal with that, even though it was a state issue and they were federal politicians.\"\n\"He gave me hope. He was just drafting a letter on Monday to send to the state Attorney-General on my behalf. Was he direct? Yes. But you knew where you stood.\"\nThe Federal Liberal MP died on Tuesday afternoon in Boddington, south of Perth. The cause of death has not been released but he is thought to have died from a heart attack. Mr Randall is survived by his wife Julie and their two children Tess and Elliott.\nBorn in Merredin in Western Australia's central wheat belt, Randall was elected to the House of Representatives for the electorate of Swan in 1996, before being defeated in 1998. He returned as a federal MP for Canning in 2001, and retained the seat for the next three elections.\n West Australian Liberal Premier Colin Barnett said on Wednesday that he was saddened by Mr Randall's sudden death.\n'A colourful political career' \"I think it's fair to say that Don had a colourful political career,\" Mr Barnett said.\n\"But I think what needs to be recognised is his seat of Canning was a true marginal swinging seat and Don through very hard work in his electorate and very strong support by the people of Canning has made it his seat for the last 15 years.\"\nMr Randall's ability to transform a marginal seat into his own was not rewarded with key portfolios. The MP would only hold junior shadow ministerial positions during his lengthy political career, and he tended to gain the public's attention for the wrong reasons.\nHe was widely criticised for once referring to the public broadcaster as the \"Gay-B-C\" and reportedly told a business luncheon in 2011 that the mining industry was being \"pussy-whipped\" by Julia Gillard.\nIn 2013, he was caught claiming questionable travel entitlements that included taxpayer-funded trips to Cairns, where he visited an investment property, and to Melbourne, where he attended an AFL football match.\nBut his popularity in his home state did not wane. He was returned as an MP in 2013 with a comfortable 11.8 per cent margin in what was once a marginal seat.\nHe was a renown campaigner who was like a \"dog with a bone\" and a king of doorknocking, according to WA local government minister Tony Simpson.\nMr Randall was highly critical of what he described as Labor's welfare state mentality and of unions, which he said wanted to \"rule their members' every move\" but he was not averse to creating tension within his own party too.\nIn February, Randall seconded the ultimately unsuccessful spill motion proposed by his colleague Luke Simpkins, in a move that did not endear himself to many of his conservative colleagues.\nAnd his support for Manjimup farmer Mr Swift has put him at odds with the governing state Liberals. Mr Randall described one state Liberal politician who allowed Mr Swift to be prosecuted for land clearing as having \"blood on his hands\" and of being \"the most weak and timid minister in the government\".\nMr Swift said on Wednesday that he was thankful for all that Mr Randall had done for him. He described the late politician as a man who never \"distinguished between classes\".\n\"We met in the 90s – he used to put his head into the mechanic shop I worked at and chat to the apprentices during the smoko,\" Mr Swift said. \"He wanted to know whether there was anything that the government could help them out with.\"\n\"His passing is absolutely terrible, shattering. Don Randall picked me up from the brink of a black hole and gave me some light and hope.\"\nWith AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T14:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:56:17.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
