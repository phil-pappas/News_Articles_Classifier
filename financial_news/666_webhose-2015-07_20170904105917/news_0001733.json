As a dedicated feminist, Gillard responded to this atrocity by making Rudd leader of the ALP and then prime minister.\nIn The Killing Season , Gillard repeated this allegation, confirming the fraud of her feminist credentials.\nNow, in terms of policy programs and public spending, the Abbott government shouldn't hesitate to wind back other flawed aspects of Gillardism.\nAt the beginning of her prime ministership, Gillard created a 12-year National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children (2010-22).\n In the name of ending \"gendered crimes\", it's a profligacy machine for establishing new bureaucracies and wasting government money.\nWe haven't seen anything like this – a spaghetti bowl of unnecessary government authorities and duplication – since Kim Beazley's \"Noodle Nation\" document in 2001.\nAmong other new agencies, Gillard foreshadowed the creation of a Tripartite National Plan Implementation Panel, National Women's Alliances, Workplace Rights and Entitlements Projects, National Workforce Agendas, Local Community Action Grants, a National Centre of Excellence (on Family Violence), Building Capacity Building Bridges Projects and the Our Watch media/marketing unit.\nPlan misses the point That's quite a list, guaranteeing the employment of a bulging army of Left-feminists in the public sector.\nRegrettably, the National Plan will do nothing to reduce rates of violence against women.\nDespite claiming a \"solid evidence base\" for its work, it ignores the root cause of domestic violence: the concentration of socioeconomic disadvantage in certain communities.\nMen who live in underclass conditions, experiencing the chaos of welfare, alcohol and drug dependency, tend to use violence as a coping mechanism – an outlet for their frustrations.\nIn adopting the social theory of \"patriarchy\", the National Plan follows a different assumption: that men abuse women because ingrained sexism gives them the green light to behave this way.\nThat is, they're violent not because of how they feel about themselves, but because the patriarchy makes them feel bad about women.\nIf this were true, the tragedy of domestic violence would be spread evenly across all socioeconomic groups.\nBut this is not the case. Crime statistics in NSW show a close correlation between rates of domestic violence and socioeconomic disadvantage, especially in communities with large Indigenous populations.\nLast year, women living in the western NSW local government area of Bourke (30.2 per cent of population Aboriginal) were 49 times more likely to experience domestic assault than women in the affluent Sydney LGA of Ku-ring-gai (0.1 per cent Aboriginal).\nBourke recorded 4139 domestic assault incidents per 100,000 population, while in Ku-ring-gai the rate was 84 per 100,000.\nThe five NSW LGAs with the lowest rates of domestic violence (Ku-ring-gai, Willoughby, Lane Cove, Palerang and Hornsby) are among the 25 most socioeconomically advantaged areas in Australia.\nBy contrast, the five most violent LGAs (Bourke, Walgett, Moree Plains, Coonamble and Bogan) are among the 160 most disadvantaged areas in Australia. Each has an Aboriginal population of over 14 per cent.\nThe obvious solution to domestic violence is to end the underclass concentration of poverty in certain communities.\nIn trying to change the behaviour of all men through the creation of new bureaucracies and \"social marketing campaigns\", the National Plan is wasting public money.\nJust as inside the Labor Party Gillard was a fake feminist, in government her feminist programs were a fraud on the Australian taxpayer. The Abbott government should abolish them immediately.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:57:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
