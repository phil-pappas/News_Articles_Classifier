Paul Jeffers Share on twitter by Tess Ingram Atlas Iron managing director David Flanagan says the embattled iron ore miner fell short of its $180 million equity raising target because of the global market volatility that struck halfway through its critical fund raising efforts.\nThe iron ore miner revealed on Monday it managed to raise $86 million from equity markets, less than half of its target of $180 million.\nAtlas undertook the critical raising amid extreme volatility in the iron ore price , which fell from about $US60 a tonne on the day the company received shareholder approval to raise the equity, to as low as $US44.59 a tonne about half way through its efforts.\nMr Flanagan said fund managers indicated to him towards the end of a 21-day roadshow the market conditions made it \"tough for them to invest\".\n\"There was a stage in the early part of the raising where I was certain we were going to be bowled over with demand, absolutely, without a doubt,\" Mr Flanagan told The Australian Financial Review .\n\"That volatility we saw in the last week – the markets in Greece, the markets in China – cost us quite a lot of money from the big institutions. The institutions don't have the same authority as a single investor does … they are investing other people's money and they have to go to their investment committees in the week the iron ore price has its biggest fall on record.\"\nAs well as a share issue to its contractors, which is understood to have amounted to about $44 million, Atlas had hoped to raise up to $50 million through a placement to new and existing shareholders and an additional $100 million through a shareholder participation offer, all at 5¢. It is also giving away one free 7.5¢ option with each new share.\nSources said of the $86 million raised, the roughly $42 million of fresh equity raised outside of the contractor issue consisted of about $12 million from institutional investors and about $30 million from \"mum and dad investors\".\n Plummeting iron ore prices forced Atlas to briefly shut its three Pilbara operations in April, a move it has since reversed after striking a company-saving profit sharing agreement with contractors including MACA, Qube and McAleese.\nThe contractor share issue underpins the agreement, which Atlas hopes will allow it to reach full production of 14 to 15 million tonnes a year at a break-even price of about $US50 a tonne by December.\nHaulage contractor McAleese had committed to chip $14 million into the share issue.\nThe equity raising was designed to strengthen the company's balance sheet and pay back some of its $340 million debt burden, which has weighed heavily on the junior since the iron ore price crashed.\n\"It is $86 million we didn't have before, in a market that was pretty ordinary, so we shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth,\" Mr Flanagan said.\n\"Yes, it was ambitious because I reckon shareholders deserve us to have a go, and go out there and have a crack at everything.\"\nMr Flanagan said Atlas would now examine the options it had to address its debt, including looking at the possibility of a refinancing its key $US269 million ($364 million) Term Loan B facility, due to be paid in December 2017.\nThe miner's key US-based debt holders are Western Asset Management, Fortress Investment Group, Marathon Asset Management and Sankaty Advisers and Mr Flanagan said he expected them to be willing to co-operate.\nAtlas said the shares and options under the raising were expected to be issued on Friday and it hoped to return to trading on Monday July 27. Atlas's shares have been suspended at 12c a share since April.\nOne analyst said he was not surprised by the result. \"They have obviously given it their best shot … I don't think it cleans up their position for them. Unless they can clean that debt off their balance sheet they are going to be in trouble.\n\"Perhaps a debt to equity conversion is their best option but that depends on whether the lenders are willing,\" the analyst said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TessIngram"], "published": "2015-07-20T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T22:48:15.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
