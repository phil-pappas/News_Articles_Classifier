He told The News-Gazette ( http://bit.ly/1LNYBoA ) that the school typically adjusts year to year as it watches state funding fall. \nAdjusting for inflation, state support for the university has dropped from more than $1 billion a year in fiscal 2002 to $662 million in the year that just ended. \nAdesida said the task force will discuss spending priorities for the next five to 10 years. \nHe said the university may decide to consolidate or end some functions. But it also wants to produce more of its own revenue. \nInformation from: The News-Gazette, http://www.news-gazette.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T19:28:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
