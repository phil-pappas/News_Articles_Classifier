Quite confident the year would end well for the firm. Photo: Jane Dyson\nSydney-based stockbroking and advisory firm Bell Financial Group has enjoyed a strong first half of calendar 2015, with pre-tax profit tripling from a soft first-half last year.\nThe marked pick-up follows a decline in after-tax profit in the 2014 year. Bell's consolidated unaudited profit came in at $8 million before tax for the six months ended June 30, the company told the Australian stock exchange on Thursday.\nThe improvement was buoyed by an 18 per cent jump in first-half revenue, which saw the pre-tax profit print just below the $8.4 million 2014 annual before tax result.\nAll Bell's underlying businesses traded profitably, the company said. Revenue from equities execution rose 16 per cent to $45 million, and income from equity capital markets climbed 37 per cent to $15 million.\nAdvertisement The numbers also reflect a healthier environment for the stockbroking industry, as IRESS data showed equity trading volumes across the ASX and Chi-X had their strongest start to the year since 2008. But volumes in recent weeks have dropped off due to macroeconomic concerns out of Greece and China.The broking sector is also mindful of a shaky market for initial public offerings after a raft of listings were pulled or repriced in the past six weeks.\nBell executive chairman Colin Bell is, however, optimistic that market ructions in China and the debt crisis in Greece can be resolved in coming months and that that will aid the local equity capital (ECM) activity in holding up.\n\"The ECM business is still good; the pipeline is still there but a lot of [floats] won't come out of the pipeline for a few months,\" he said.\nMr Bell also said that in spite of current volatility he was quite confident the year would end well for the firm.\nThe company statement said futures and foreign exchange rose 41 per cent in its first half to $6.7 million, while portfolio administration income increased 10 per cent to $4.7 million.·Funds under Advice (FUA) exceeded $32 billion for the first time, a 10 per cent rise on the same period last year.\nThe online trading arm Bell Direct also saw higher revenues and growth in active customer numbers.\nIn February, Bell reported a 15 per cent drop in net profit to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31. The company is scheduled to report its audited first-half results on August 18.\nBell shares leaped 11.6 per cent to 48¢ on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:05:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
