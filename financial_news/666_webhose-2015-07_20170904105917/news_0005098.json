NHSB is financially incapacitated to settle indebtedness with the employees. The CBL is in arrears of over US$300,000 to the NHSB for the renting of the security vault. The NHSB will be able to significantly settle indebtedness with the aggrieved redundant employees only if the CBL makes payment of the vault rented amount owed her,\" the committee stated in its findings. \nThe committee pointed out in the report that plea made to the Senior Management of the CBL to settle its financial obligation to the NHSB has fallen on \"deaf ears.\" \nMeanwhile, the Standing Committee of the Liberian Senate on Banking and Currency has recommended that authorities of CBL should be invited to show cause why they should not be held in contempt for failing to yield to advice given to settle their indebtedness to the NHSB. \nThe committee also called for a decision to be taken for budgetary appropriation for the NHSB to help settle its arrears with the aggrieved redundant employees. \nThe committee also called for the Ministry of Finance and Development to take full responsibility for the settlement of outstanding liabilities of the NHSB because, the bank has gone \"bankrupt.\" \nThe committee further urged the redundant employees to remain calm. \nDuring debate on the committee's preliminary report, some of the Senators including Varney Sherman of Grand Cape Mount County and Alphonso Gaye of Grand Gedeh County, amongst others expressed unwillingness to endorse the recommendations contained in the report. \nAccording to Sen. Sherman, CBL authorities should not be invited for failing to abide by an advice from the committee, since in fact, the advice was not mandatory. \nHe suggested that the summoning of the CBL authorities should be erased in order for the Senate not to abuse its contempt power. \nHe called for the Liberian Senate to also make an appropriation for the payment of the redundant employees, instead of asking the Finance Ministry to do so. \nMeanwhile, a motion for the committee's to do \"due diligence and a comprehensive data\" on its report was filed by Sen. Gaye. \nAmong other things, Sen. Gaye said the report does not outline how much the Housing Bank is indebted to the redundant employees.
