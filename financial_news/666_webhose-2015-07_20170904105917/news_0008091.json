Heathrow Airport Protesters Storm Runway By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News â€“ 4 minutes 55 seconds ago \n\nClimate change demonstrators have got onto the north runway at Heathrow airport to stage a protest. \nA spokesman for direct action group Plane Stupid said around a dozen demonstrators cut through the airport perimeter fence to get onto the runway at 3.30am. \nHe said the protesters were campaigning against airport expansion and would remain on the runway for as long as possible. \nA Heathrow spokesman confirmed that \"a group of people\" had breached the perimeter fence. \nHe said: \"We are working closely with the police who are dealing with the incident. The southern runway remains open. Our priority remains to ensure the safety of the airport community, including passengers, employees and protesters. \n\"Both runways are open and operational but we expect some delays/cancellations. We're advising passengers to check with their airline.\" \nElla Gilbert, one of the activists on the runway, said: \"Building more runways goes against everything we're being told by scientists and experts on climate change. \n\"This would massively increase carbon emissions exactly when we need to massively reduce them, that's why we're here. \n\"We want to say sorry to anyone whose day we've ruined, and we're not saying that everybody who wants to fly is a bad person. \n\"It's those who fly frequently and unnecessarily who are driving the need for expansion, and we cannot keep ignoring the terrifying consequences of flying like there's no tomorrow. \n\"No ifs, no buts, no third runway. And we mean it.\" \nA video posted online appeared to show several activists chained together and being spoken to by a police officer. \nThe officer told them: \"As a consequence of you being here, you are causing severe disruption and it will be in the millions of pounds because it will take us a while to remove you. \n\"The cost will be in the couple of millions. The airport will attempt to make a civil recovery.\" \nHe added: \"There are international flights now being diverted.\" \nEarlier this month a long-awaited report recommended that a new runway should be built at Heathrow rather than Gatwick. \nAfter three years of investigation, the Airports Commission said Heathrow was best placed to provide \"urgently required\" capacity, but environmentalists warned that building a new runway there will make it harder to reduce air pollution and climate change emissions. \nMore follows...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T09:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:25:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
