In May 2015, the company renewed a long-standing agreement with Bremer Bank; in Jul 2014, the company renewed a five-year agreement with PA-based Members 1st Federal Credit Union and in 2013, Moneyram fortified its association with Susquehanna Bancshares and Mountain America Credit Union, to provide official check services.Moneygram is a leading funds transfer and payment services company that offers a complete official check outsourcing solution. This service provided by the company since 1979 consists of a full package including inventory management, real-time updates and daily balancing and reconciliation, for less than the cost of most in-house programs.
