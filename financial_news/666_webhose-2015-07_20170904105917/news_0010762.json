But the outage, which seemed to have little impact on market movement—stocks traded on other exchanges, which were unaffected by the halt—is hardly the first such glitch to affect investors in recent years.\nIn fact, technical glitches have been the bane of stock exchanges and a constant bugaboo for regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission, who have tried to root out some of the market’s peskiest structural problems.\nSee: NYSE outage is a ‘black squirrel’ event .\nTrading resumed on the NYSE at 3:10. But here are a few recent, self-inflicted snafus:\nEDGX: On Monday, BATS Global Markets halted trading on its EDGX Exchange for more than 30 minutes due to a “software issue.” Nasdaq “flash freeze”: A three-hour shutdown halted trading of all Nasdaq-listed stocks on Aug. 22, 2013, after the exchanges securities information processor broke down. After a few days of finger-pointing, Nasdaq OMX Group took most of the blame for the disruption. NYSE: It wasn’t a full shutdown, but the New York Stock Exchange had trouble with its matching engine on Nov. 12, 2012, recalled analysts at Credit Suisse . That prevented the NYSE from holding its closing auction. The exchange was able, however, to publish a synthetic closing price using the consolidated tape, since stocks were still traded on other platforms, they noted. Facebook Inc. FB, -1.80% IPO: The social-media company’s high-profile initial public offering in May 2012 left Nasdaq with a black eye and several million dollars poorer. Nasdaq agreed to pay $26.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit tied to its handling of the debut. That was on top of a $10 million fine from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Technical issues marred the IPO, leaving market makers unclear on the status of orders for hours.
