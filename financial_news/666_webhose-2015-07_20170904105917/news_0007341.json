Photo: Dallas Kilponen\nIn a few weeks' time, the annual \"confession season\" cranks up as all listed companies unveil their results for the 2014 financial year.\nThe real estate investment trusts lead the charge in early August to update investors, media and the analysts communities of how they fared for the past six months, since the February results season and the more important narrative on the year ahead.\nIt's the time when the REIT's senior management are happy to talk and give as clear a picture as possible of market conditions and likely headwinds.\nAmid the large number of slides and long press releases, there is a cast ocean of facts and figures to wade through, in order to ​gauge the health of the balance sheet.\nAdvertisement So what are the themes for this year's season?\nAccording to the analyst community, valuation uplifts, the length of leases and the premiums built into net tangible asset values (NTA), will be keenly reviewed.\nOccupancy, which goes hand in hand with weighted average leasing expiry (WALE) will also be on the agenda for review from investment analysts.\nThis reflects the outlook about the underlying base of the office and, to a lesser extent, leasing market environment.\nAt the present time, there are mixed views on the leasing market conditions, with some landlords saying it's tough, while others believe it's troughed and heading upwards.\nBut there is consensus that the small to medium end, being offices up to 1000 square metres are in the higher demand bracket. That reflects the inflow of small to medium businesses into the central business districts.\nTo give some context on the leasing environment, DEXUS Property, one of the biggest office landlords in the country, says it's all going well.\nIn his report for June, Peter Studley, the general manager of research at DEXUS, says the Office Demand Barometer increased in the June quarter – indicating that conditions for tenant demand in Sydney are likely to remain positive over the next six months.\n\"The DEXUS Office Demand Barometer was up slightly to 1.6 per cent in June compared to 1.5 per cent recorded for the March 2015 quarter,\" the report says.\n\"A lift in Australian business confidence over the past few months is a positive indicator for office demand as recorded by the NAB Business Confidence Index for the finance, business and property sectors.\"\nMr Studley says the Sydney CBD office market is clearly well into recovery phase as actual demand continues to firm.\nOn the Australian, A-REIT side of the ledger, Folkestone Maxim's chief executive Winston Sammut, says with the current low level of interest rates, asset prices for equities and commercial property continue to be well supported.\nIn the year ended 30 June 2015, the Folkestone Maxim A-REIT Securities Fund returned 20.35 per cent, marginally outperforming its benchmark S&P/ASX 300 A-REIT Accumulation Index, which returned 20.20 per cent.\nMr Sammut says he expects the A-REIT sector to weather the offshore equity market concerns arising from developments in Greece and China although volatility will remain elevated.\n\"The upcoming reporting period is likely to deliver higher NTA's for the A-REITs as a result of cap-rate compression on the back of increased demand from offshore/local investors for quality assets,\" he says.\n\"We continue to favour those A-REITs with exposure to industrial and social infrastructure sectors, and those securities with quality management and relative attractive yields that have the ability based on active management of the portfolio to drive income growth in the year ahead.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:39:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
