The Israeli maker of video-based driver assistance systems climbed in above-average volume in the stock market today, hitting an intraday high of 60. That puts the stock less than 30 cents below its all-time high of 60.28, reached last October. Shares are now in profit-taking territory, which means that the stock is more than 20% extended past a 48.88 buy point from a cup-with-handle base, which it initially cleared on June 11. Some of Mobileye's clients include Tesla, GM, Ford and Honda. It's competing with Google and others in the autonomous driving arena. Mobileye says it plans to launch \"the first hands-free capable driving at highway speeds and in congested traffic situations\" in the 2016 time frame. It expects the technology to include country roads and city traffic in 2018. Meanwhile, Google is looking to build the right side of a year-long price consolidation with a 609.01 buy point. The search giant is currently trading about 4% below that level. Google reports earnings Thursday.
