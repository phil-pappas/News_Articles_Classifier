This needs to be controlled,” the person said. \nCompanies such as GAIL Gas, Mahanagar Gas, Gujarat Gas Company and Indraprastha Gas operate in specific geographies. \nSuch renewed demands for rationalisation of the tax structure come as the response to the latest round of license auctions for city gas distribution by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) have been rather lukewarm. Eight out of the 20 areas that went under the hammer received no bids, while two areas received one bid each. \nGas distributors however say that operating in large districts with sparse populations is unviable unless the rules of the game are fundamentally changed. \nThey want natural gas deemed a “declared good,” a move they say will bring down the price. \nMoreover, they want the city gas distribution sector to be given the status of a public utility, something that would allow them to construct pipelines and other civil work without paying the local municipal authorities. \nHowever, since such moves would mean revenue loss for state governments, there could be political resistance. \nThe Narendra Modi-led government has an ambitious target of achieving 10 million piped natural gas connections by 2019-20 from the current 2.7 million. \nFurther still, gas companies want those areas in cities where piped natural gas infrastructure exists, to be declared “subsidised LPG free zones.” \n“Simply put, in areas where piped gas is available, people should not be given subsidised LPG cylinders,” the person said, adding that such a system worked in China. In effect, such a move would give distributors captive markets, although it will help the exchequer save some money on reduced subsidy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T05:38:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
