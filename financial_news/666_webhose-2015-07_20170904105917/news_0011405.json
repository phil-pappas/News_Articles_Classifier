Tracking gold, silver ready fell by Rs 150 to Rs 34,200 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 600 to Rs 33,600 per kg. \nSilver coins nosedived by Rs 1,000 to Rs 49,000 for buying and Rs 50,000 for selling of 100 pieces. \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T22:28:38.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
