Bohai’s offer was 25 percent more than Avolon’s closing price in New York on Thursday, when the company’s market value was $2.01 billion.\n“We think Avolon is willing to sell the company after a proper bidding process and would not be surprised if there are additional offers,” Helane Becker, a Cowen & Co. analyst, said in a note to investors.\nThe jockeying began with Bohai submitting a plan for 20 percent of the company at $26 a share, Avolon said. That was followed by the non-binding offer at $30, which triggered a required notice to Bohai, Avolon said. Wulumuqi, China-based Bohai then countered with $31.\n“Avolon’s Board of Directors has not accepted or rejected either offer,” according to a statement. The company “has authorized its financial advisers to continue negotiations with both offerers regarding their respective offers.”\nTelephone calls to Bohai’s Beijing office went unanswered after regular business hours on Friday. Avolon isn’t commenting beyond the statement, said Jonathan Neilan, a spokesman for the company at FTI Consulting.\nStock Performance Avolon rose 19 percent to $29.68 at 11:22 a.m. in New York, following a gain of as much as 20 percent that was the most since the company’s December initial public offering. The shares advanced 24 percent through Thursday since the IPO.\nFounded in 2010, Avolon now has more than 260 planes delivered or on order, and the fleet’s average age of 2.6 years is the youngest among major lessors, according to a company fact sheet. Oak Hill is the third-largest shareholder, based on data compiled by Bloomberg, after fellow private-equity firms Cinven Ltd. and CVC Capital Partners.\nThe IPO in December followed Avolon’s rebuff days earlier of an acquisition offer from a unit of Chinese planemaker Aviation Industry Corp. of China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:53:03.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
