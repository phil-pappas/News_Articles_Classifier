No? Neither do retailers. \nVisa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express and their banking partners have set a government-enforced deadline of October 1 for a “liability shift” that, for the first time, would make merchants liable for any fraudulent charges that result from using point-of-service readers that can't read chip-and-pin EMV cards . Unfortunately, with banks no longer bearing responsibility for those charges, they haven't been in any great hurry to educate either customers or businesses about the new chip-enabled cards they've been issuing all year. \nAs a result, point-of-sale technology company Randstad Technologies notes that 42% of business technology decision makers, including corporate executives, have either taken no action to install new card readers or don't know if their companies will hit the deadline. That cutoff date, by the way, is roughly two months away.

Small-business website Manta, which hosts 2.5 million businesses, conducted a survey that found 28% of small business owners don't know what EMV technology is or how it impacts their business. Used in Europe since the early 1990s, EMV cards -- which take their name from Europay/MasterCard/Visa -- contain an embedded microchip that is authenticated using a personal identification number. A reader detects the chip and asks the card user for a PIN that matches the one found on the chip. Since there isn't a magnetic stripe with all a user's data embedded, there's a far lesser chance of a chip-and-PIN user's data being stolen. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T01:28:18.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
