Combined with cost cuts across the business, that led to operating profit of 1.4 billion pounds ($2.2 billion), slightly ahead of a consensus of 1.3 billion pounds and up 18 percent on a year ago. \n\"The investments we have made have given us a strong platform on which to build and we have a clear set of plans to deliver long-term growth and returns for our shareholders,\" Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said. \nSky, which is engaged in a fierce battle at home with rivals such as BT and Virgin Media to provide pay-TV, broadband and telephony, said it had been helped across the five countries by improved customer loyalty and demand for an increasing number of services. \n($1 = 0.6409 pounds) (Reporting by Kate Holton; Editing by Neil Maidment)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T09:36:09.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
