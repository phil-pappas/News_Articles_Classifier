This sordid development forced the people to protest, including an attempt to lynch their chief for reportedly supporting the mining company. \nThe development compelled the MP of the area, Emmanuel Armah Kofi Buah to visit the site of the mining company, after which he lodged a formal complaint with the EPA over the proximity of the blasting site and it accompanying negative effect on his constituents. \nSome of the residents confided in The Chronicle that had it not been the intervention of the MP, EPA would have sat idle without doing anything about the situation. \nAccording to them, they have sent countless petitions to the regulatory body but they failed to act upon them, but immediately they received a petition from the MP, experts were sent to the blasting site who recommended the closure of the place. \nThe EPA then went ahead to fix the 22nd of July for all the stakeholders to meet and discuss the issue. \nThe meeting was attended by management team of Adamus Resource, led by Mr. Mark Addo, the Finance Director of the company, the regional Minister, Pal Evans Aidoo, Ellembelle District Chief Executive (DCE), Daniel Eshun and the MP himself. \nThe Mineral Commission Boss, Dr. Toni Aubyn and that of the EPA, including another Minister were also present. The Chronicle sources at the meeting told this reporter that the EPA maintained their position on the closure of the mining company blasting site. However, it ordered it to undertake its blasting in another site instead of the old site. \nThe EPA and the Mineral Commission according to the meeting would commission an independent body to ascertain the destruction caused to the buildings and properties as a result of the mining company's blasting activities. \nThe Chief of Anwia, Nana Simanle Kpanyle who confirmed the decision of the meeting told this reporter in a telephone interview that the management of the mining company apologized to the meeting for the harm caused them (indigenes), as a result of their blasting activities and promised to reduce its severity. \nBut Nana Simale Kpanyile said he objected on grounds that the community could not take their word. For now, what the community wants is relocation as agreed at the meeting. \"So we are looking forward to Adamus coming to negotiate with us in two weeks time as the meeting directed\". \nNana told this reporter that though they were not against the mining company operation, they could, however, not sit down unconcerned for the activities of the mining company to destroy their livelihood. \nThe MP on his part thanked the EPA and the Mineral Commission for the swift response it handled the case. \nMr. Armah Buah expressed the hope that the mining company would act on the orders of the EPA and the Mineral Commission to ensure peace in the area.
