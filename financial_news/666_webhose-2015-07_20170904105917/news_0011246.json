His big lesson? Don't ever pitch to someone who's never been to Africa because they'd always say 'no':\"Don't waste your time. \nSavannah Fund currently has 16 investments in 5 African countries: Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Nigeria and Ghana. Although these countries are where most start-ups are happening, Savannah Fund will look anywhere in Africa. It has two strands: an accelerator programme and a seed fund. The seed fund is aimed at high-risk companies on a Pan-African basis. \nThe accelerator bring promising start-up teams to iHub in Kenya and is now on its fourth class. There have been 150 applications a year for each class and applicants come from a wide range of countries including Zambia and Zimbabwe. \nAlliy gives me a couple of examples of start-ups from the accelerator programme he finds interesting. Ahonya.com is a Ghanaian e-commerce start-up which caught his eye because it had actually sold quite a lot although the turnover was at that stage below US$200,000:\"It was clear that they had found a way to do it.\" The programme helped them raise extra funding and they now have a turnover of US$1.5 million. \nIn the current class, he's got his eye on BitFinance from Zimbabwe, a Bit Coin start-up as the name implies:\"I was interested because it was country that would benefit from it. This is a country with 13 legal tenders.\" It also has plans to do remittances. \nThe seed fund either gives money on an equity investment or convertible debt basis and looks to the start-up getting follow-on funding. Its last two investments have been cloud funding start-up Angani and Wyze Talk, a Cape Town-based social CRM company. One of the seed fund companies it put money into was Lagos-based Africa Courier Express which he says is \"a modern logistics courier for e-commerce needs, including working for banks doing things like picking up cash and dropping off credit cards.\" \nSo where do African start-ups struggle most? Many of those applying to the accelerator classes don't understand the importance of the financial side of the business and don't spend enough resources to keep good books. This can take as much as two years to sort before they realize:\"It's time to get really serious.\" \nThe next set of issues is very similar to what he found in the USA. The teams are not always stable and don't always gel:\"We expect a high rate of failure from the accelerator.\" \nAt the seed fund level the issue is much more about scaling up. He talks about the Safaricom trap: how the prospect of a single deal with this dominant mobile operator mesmerizes Kenyan start-ups. \nThey tend to think if you can get a deal with Safaricom your problems will be over:\"If you're looking for the easiest paths to get to people, it's a honeypot.\" But in reality the problems are just starting as the terms of the deal are not always ideal, they may not deliver on marketing promises and it may be hard to keep up:\"Too many business models depend on Safaricom. Too many Fintech start-up models depend on mPesa.\" \nThere's also a tendency to copy developed world models without translating them for the local context:\"There were 7-8 Uber clones. We're Uber for boda bodas plus mPesa. There are huge differences. For example, drivers don't use maps. Payment interaction is the key. mPesa is not like a credit card.\" \nHe's also fairly skeptical of donor-funded programmes for start-ups:\"They have silo-ed approaches to what they fund.\" He also makes the point that many make that donor funding actually skews what people do and how they behave:\"In Kenya, there's a donor market and there's an equity market.\" \nWe close by talking about how he's moving back to Tanzania and one reason is because he's had enough of the traffic in Nairobi. You can't hope to be an effective business hub if you have to set out for the airport when it's raining 4-5 hours ahead of time.
