Mattel swung to a loss of $11.4m from a net income of $28.3m in the second quarter last year. \nBratz are known for their large heads, almond-shaped eyes and bold fashion sense \nBratz’s first-time around was an overwhelming success , snatching more than 40pc of the UK fashion doll market by 2004, marking the first time that Barbie did not hold the top spot since records began 10 years earlier. \nBetween 2005 and 2007, Bratz was the top brand in the UK toy market beating Thomas and Friends, Star Wars and Barbie and no other toy company since has held the top spot for three consecutive years. \nBut in 2006, Mattel filed a 58-page lawsuit against MGA Entertainment, accusing the Bratz owner of intellectual property theft because the dolls were conceived by a designer while he was employed by Mattel. \nAt the time, MGA chief executive Isaac Larian told the Telegraph, “It's an absolute pure act of desperation . Mattel lives in a fantasy land. They don't own Bratz and they know it. It's all fabricated paranoia from a company that's lost its leadership.” \nMGA fired back at Mattel, claiming that the toy giant stole its designs to create a new range of dolls under the My Scene brand. \nThe overwhelming popularity of Frozen has hurt Barbie's sales \nIn 2008, a California judge ordered MGA to stop making and selling Bratz dolls and to turn the franchise over to Mattel, after a jury found in favour of the Barbie owner and awarded Mattel $100m in damages. \nHowever, this ruling was overturned in the appellate court before it came into effect. The chief judge, Alex Kozinski, wrote, \"Mattel can't claim a monopoly over fashion dolls with a bratty look or attitude, or dolls sporting trendy clothing these are all unprotectable ideas.\" \nThe tables were turned in the 2011 retrial, when a federal jury sided with MGA after finding that Mattel had stolen trade secrets from its smaller rival. \nBratz's return is well-timed, after Barbie has already taken a knocking from the flyaway success of Disney's Frozen-related merchandise, which recently transferred its licensing rights from Mattel to Hasbro (NasdaqGS: HAS - news ) as of 2016. \nThe dolls and accessories sector has overwhelmingly outperformed the overall toy market for four of the last five years in the UK, growing 11pc last year to reach £287.6m in sales, according to Euromonitor International. \nIt is the second-largest and second-fastest growing segment of physical toys, beaten only by construction toys such as Lego , which have enjoyed an enormous resurgence in recent years thanks to the blockbuster success of The Lego Movie and a string of high-profile licensing deals. \nMGA's UK MD Andrew Laughton and brand manager Nicola Mellor (photo: Simon Jacobs) \nBut MGA which also owns Little Tikes, the brand behind the iconic red and yellow plastic Cozy Coupe that is said to be Britain’s best-selling car, and is a majority shareholder in the German maker of Baby Annabell dolls isn't worried about having to take on Princess Elsa as well as Barbie. \n\" The Frozen phenomenon is fabulous for the toy industry it thrives on crazes like Frozen, Furby, Moshi Monsters and loom bands,\" Andrew Laughton, UK MD of MGA, told The Telegraph. \"There is always room for new brands.\" \nAnd is the relaunch of Bratz likely to drive a nail into Barbie's coffin ? \n\"Mattel have a fabulous, iconic brand,\" he said. \"You can’t have a toy industry without things like that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T23:58:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
