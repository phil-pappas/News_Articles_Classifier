Total, like its rivals, said it was keeping its dividend unchanged, at 0.61 euros per share. \nProfits at Total's downstream refining and chemicals sector tripled, while oil and gas output rose from a year ago thanks to new start-ups and the renewal of an Abu Dhabi concession. \nAt 2.299 million barrels of oil equivalent, output was slightly lower, however, than the first quarter due to the shutdown of a liquefied natural gas plant in war-torn Yemen. \nThe jump in refining and chemicals profits to $1.3 billion from 401 million, shows how integrated oil companies can weather lower oil price by offsetting income falls from exploration and production with higher margins on gasoline and diesel sales. \nTotal also said market conditions remained favourable at the start of the third quarter. \n($1 = 0.6409 pounds) (Additional reporting by Raphael Bloch in Paris and Sarah Young in London,; editing by David Clarke)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T12:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T12:44:35.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
