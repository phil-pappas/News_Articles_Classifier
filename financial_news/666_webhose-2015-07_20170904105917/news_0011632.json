According to the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) the real GDP growth averaged 1.0% a year during this period and demand for new construction projects in the country decreased resulting in reduced investment in the industrial energy and utilities markets.

The bill’s main purpose is to reduce the share of nuclear energy from 75.0% of the total energy supply in 2014 to 50.0% by 2025 and reduce greenhouse gases by 40.0% by 2030. Accordingly the government plans to increase its renewable energy share to 40.0% of total energy consumption by 2030. The increase in the share of renewable energy is expected to support the energy and utilities construction market over the forecast period.\nThe government is focusing on transport development and under the National Transportation Infrastructure Plan (SNIT) it announced plans in 2013 to invest EUR5.0 billion (US6.6 billion) in transport infrastructure every year until 2025 to modernize and develop the country’s infrastructure by 2030. The government’s effort to improve the transport infrastructure is expected to drive growth over the forecast period.\n\nAbout Us: \nResearchMoz ( ) is the one stop online destination to find and buy market research reports.
