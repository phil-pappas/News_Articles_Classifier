Most of the time, these terms are interchangeable: 1 percent cash back is equal to 1x points. \nBusiness cards help you maximize points on business-related expenses. For example, Amex Business Gold offers 3x points on your choice among five business-related categories. You can choose to earn 3x points on advertising, shipping, computer and software, gas or airfare. For a business, having that choice is obviously a real benefit because you can select the category that your business spends the most on, earning yourself the biggest rewards. \nIn contrast, the Bank Americard Cash Rewards card is a popular consumer card that offers 3 percent cash back on gas, 2 percent on groceries and 1 percent on other purchases. These categories are probably not directly relevant to your business. \nAnother win for business cards is that they have a higher limit on cash back. For example, Chase Freedom offers 5 percent cash back on revolving categories, but you can only earn 5 percent back on up to $1,500 in purchases each quarter. Chase Ink Plus, a business card, also offers 5 percent cash back in select categories but you can earn this for your first $50,000 in annual spending. Credit card companies seem to recognize that businesses have greater spending needs than individuals and adapt the cashback programs accordingly.
