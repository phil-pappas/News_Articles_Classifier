Superannuation . nest egg. investment . investing . investments. gold egg. ***afrphotos.com*** Virginia Star by Jackie Pearson Do-it-yourself superannuation is changing, morphing into something that few would have ever imagined. Each year an ever-increasing number of service providers add their shingles to the list of accountants, administrators and financial advisers claiming to be self-managed super fund experts.\nSetting up an SMSF is easy, they say, and sometimes they will even offer to do it free. So when you get your statement from that APRA-regulated big-brand fund you've been with for years, and discover that after taxes, fees and insurance premiums, your actual retirement savings balance is not really growing much at all, the control and flexibility offered by the SMSF set can seem appealing.\nSelf-managed super offers many advantages for high-net-worth individuals with multiple investment and business structures. Even those with smaller retirement savings balances can benefit greatly from the additional control and flexibility at the heart of having your own super fund.\nThe challenge is, unless you are a retired financial services professional or avid market watcher with plenty of time and knowledge on your hands, you will not be able to completely manage your own super fund. As a trustee, whether individually or through a company, you are ultimately responsible for the fund's adherence to the law, which means that you are likely to need professional help.\nAt the very least, you will need an auditor, and those in the pension phase who don't have segregated accounts will need an actuary. An accountant-administrator also has many advantages and so too does consulting an expert, professional and non-conflicted financial adviser.\nThings get tricky once you start trying to build the right team of SMSF helpers, and this is not because they are in short supply.\nWalking the walk From your friendly neighbourhood accountant to some of the biggest companies in the world, there are few who haven't twigged to the opportunity in Australia's self-managed super funds. It's quite a change from 20 years ago when no one wanted to know about it.\n Back then it was a bit of a thorn in the side of the nation's largest wealth managers, meaning AMP and the big banks. AMP correctly sniffed the wind and made a number of astute investments in the space some time ago. That may explain why three out of the 10 SMSF service providers in our tables are owned by AMP.\nThe big four banks became more active as the outflows of funds from their coffers into private hands became too much to ignore. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has got in on the act with an ambitious claim on the retirement savings of Australians in the form of its fledgling operation, brightday.\nProtracted financial advice reform has meant aligned financial advice business units are no longer the efficient and low-cost distribution channel they used to be for the funds management businesses of the nation's five biggest wealth management institutions.\nRetail super funds have also earned a reputation for their high costs and for struggling to protect their members from capital losses when markets turn sour.\nBecause of these factors, demand and supply have both moved away from managed super products and towards SMSFs over the past two decades â€“ so much so that self-managed super now represents 99 per cent of the total number of super funds and 30 per cent of the $1.9 trillion total superannuation assets as at June 30, 2014. SMSF growth is slowing slightly but its sheer volume has now captured every wealth manager's attention.\nAs a result, Australia's biggest financial institutions have finally made up their mind that self-managed super is not going to disappear. In fact, they've decided it might be a great way to funnel new money into the same old managed funds they've always pushed at unsuspecting investors. So be wary.\nMost SMSFs do still prefer cash, in the form of term deposits, and Australian shares as their investments of choice. But their popularity with wealth managers, both large and small, means they are vulnerable to being sold unnecessary services, inferior products and poor advice.\nThat's why it's so difficult, and so important, to assemble the best possible support team.\nApples and apples SMSF trustees, new and established, have many tricky choices to make when it comes to assembling a trusted team for achieving their retirement savings goals. If you choose to set up and manage your fund online, you will quickly discover that it is quick, easy and even free to do so.\nSmart Investor has given the cut-price end of the SMSF administration market a wide berth in this year's survey. There are simply too many dodgy operators to make it anything other than a \"buyer beware\" marketplace for SMSF trustees.\nIf you do decide that saving a few dollars is the most important factor to consider when setting up and administering your SMSF, there are three things you should do:\nMake sure that your fund is 100 per cent vanilla. Any additional complexity raises the prospect that you could end up on the Australian Taxation Office's bad side and incur a costly penalty. Check that claims about free fund set-up and administration are true and that they don't tie you to a lengthy administration contract or hidden fees. Choose an operator that is regulated by the ATO, domiciled in Australia and has not fallen foul of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. ASIC chairman Greg Tanzer has made it clear the regulator is increasing its enforcement activities in the area of self-managed super. Recent actions and enforceable undertakings from ASIC underscore that it means business.\n\"With more than 539,000 SMSFs, over a million members, and assets totalling more than $550 billion, ASIC has ramped up its attention on a sector which is of growing importance to more Australian investors,\" Tanzer said in response to ASIC taking successful civil action in the Federal Court against individuals involved in ActiveSuper and Royal Capital.\nThe case involved misuse of more than $4 million raised from more than 200 SMSF investors. The Federal Court judgment made in Brisbane on May 29 saw two individuals permanently banned from providing financial services, including twice-bankrupt property developer Craig Gore.\nThe court found that Gore was the mastermind of a scheme that purported to invest unsuspecting retirees' retirement savings in distressed residential US property, when in fact more than $2 million of the money raised was used to fund his lavish lifestyle, including luxury cars and private jet travel. The outcome \"shows the courts, ASIC and the community will not tolerate behaviour that seeks to destroy people's lives,\" Tanzer said.\nSmart Investor is not suggesting that all inexpensive SMSF set-up, administration and advice services are shop fronts for dishonest and fraudulent conduct.\nHowever, ASIC's focus on issues such as false advertising and unregulated managed investment schemes does mean you have to be extra careful when dealing with self-managed super service providers who seem to be promising the world for very little money.\nWho can you trust? Fortunately, there are a core of service providers who are highly reputable and care about ensuring SMSF investors are well looked after. We recommend looking for service providers that have at least 10 years' experience in the market and take care of many hundreds, if not thousands, of self-managed super trustees and members.\nIn addition, look for those that don't push one particular investment scheme or type of investment. They will usually have some sort of expert qualification or accreditation.\nWe've separated the field into two main streams or categories: SMSF administration-only services and integrated SMSF service providers. You will find the best five providers in each category in our tables.\nThe integrated providers usually offer fund set-up, ongoing administration and tailored financial advice. The administration-only services focus on making sure your SMSF complies with super laws and is well structured and efficient, but they won't help you figure out how to invest the money it holds.\nWhat's best for your fund? The first decision you will need to make is whether you want an administration-only service or whether you want to deal with a one-stop shop that can help with set-up and administration and also help you to implement your fund's investment strategy.\nThis decision will depend on many personal factors including how much experience you have as an investor, your attitude towards risk and how much time you have available to take care of your fund's administration and investments.\nOne thing is certain: unless you have plenty of time and a good understanding of Australia's superannuation and taxation laws, you will need help with your fund's administration. The consequences of breaking the super rules, even accidentally, can be catastrophic. Your fund could lose its taxation status and that could cost you half of your life savings.\nThe ATO also has a range of new penalties at its fingertips to punish trustees who don't take their role seriously, even if the mistakes they make are unintentional. This elevates an SMSF administration service from a simple time-saving device to a compliance necessity. See this year's top five administration-only services to get an idea of what's available and how much it will cost.\nDo you need investment advice? All SMSFs are required to have a written investment strategy from the get-go. In terms of making sure your fund stays on the right side of the law, it is a very good idea to make sure the actual assets held by the fund, and how they are managed, line up with the fund's written strategy.\nAdministration-only SMSF service providers can offer you some assistance with formulating the written investment strategy. Their expertise in this area, however, only goes as far as making sure the strategy lines up with the law. A strictly admin-only service provider will be unlikely to have the expertise to give you an in-depth examination of your fund's risk profile, asset allocation or appropriate investment time frames.\nIn fact, many leading administration-only providers feel very strongly that SMSF administration should not come from the same source as SMSF investment advice, lest the advice be compromised in some way that weighs on your returns.\nAccording to Meg Heffron, customer services manager at Heffron SMSF Solutions, \"Once upon a time DIY meant DIY because there weren't that many people you could tap into who were experts in the field.\"\nHeffron SMSF Solutions, which takes out this year's top spot in our administration-only category, was one of the only SMSF specialists when the business was set up. Now it is one in hundreds.\nMeg Heffron says the advice an investor received depended on whether it came from thier accountant, financial planner or somewhere else. \"Now trustees can decide where they want to sit,\" she says.\n\"They can choose online, no-human contact administration and be absolutely hands on with all the other stuff if they want to. At the other end of the line they can have an accountant, financial adviser and technical SMSF expert if they have a difficult transaction to do.\"\nHeffron believes that SMSF trustees should surround themselves with the best possible support team but that administration should come from a different source to investment advice. It's a \"stick to your knitting\" approach that serves the firm, and its clients, well. Know what you're good at and if a client needs something that doesn't fall into your area of core strengths, refer them to someone else.\n\"Advisers are not a homogeneous group, but there is a substantial and growing cohort who twigged to the advantages of having an SMSF even before accountants [did],\" Heffron says.\n\"In the dim and distant past accountants put you in an SMSF because they didn't know any better and advisers put you in a master trust because they didn't know any better. More recently advisers have said, 'Self-managed super is the best structure, so if that is the case I'd better get myself educated fast.' They both came from different sides and the SMSF is just a vehicle.\n\"Accountants said, 'I understand tax structure and compliance'; financial planners said, 'I can see the strategic benefit of having an SMSF, because it allows more diverse investments than what's on a wrap-approved product list.'\"\nHeffron acknowledges that both disciplines are now merging but she remains an SMSF administration purist and argues that the selection of an investment adviser should be separate from the selection of an SMSF administrator.\nWhat style of advice? Dixon Advisory, ranked first in our administration plus advice or integrated services table, is at the opposite end of the spectrum to Heffron. The managing director of Dixon's superannuation business, Chris McCurdy, says choosing a one-stop shop to provide all your SMSF needs is about taking advantage of economies of scale and making sure your whole team is reading from the same page.\nHe is emphatic that, when it comes to choosing Dixon over its competitors, the decision is also about price. Dixon's ongoing administration fee includes a set number of hours with a financial adviser each year and McCurdy claims they are the only integrated service provider who has this price structure.\nPaul Oliver, national manager of selfmanagedsuper.com.au , which is ranked second in our integrated service provider table, argues that it too caps fees for its SMSF clients and includes some investment advice in the mix.\nThe difference is, when it comes to the financial advice side of the equation, selfmanagersuper.com.au prefers to use model portfolios. \"These portfolios incorporate all the major asset classes and include investment options like exchange traded funds, listed shares, term deposits and bonds,\" Oliver says.\n\"We focus our investment selection decisions on sectors and regions we expect to outperform over the long term and build portfolios for clients which factor in income requirements, risk and investment time frame,\" he says.\nThe list of advice styles and philosophies is long and complex but it is a question you will need to explore if you do decide to go with a one-stop shop. The bottom line is that it is not easy to build the best possible support team for your SMSF but it is essential that you do so.\nWhat to look for Whether you choose an administration-only service and then find an adviser or select a one-stop shop, the most important factors that you should take into consideration are:\nTrack record and longevity. As Meg Heffron says: \"If someone has been doing it for a long time it is always a good indicator that there must be enough people around who trust them.\" Qualifications and experience. Take a look at the individuals behind the brand. Make sure they have the expertise to offer SMSF services. Look at the depth of their qualifications and ask whether they are real SMSF experts. What's mechanised and what's human? Heffron says that many parts of SMSF administration can be automated but you still need to check who wrote the programs and whether they are experts in superannuation law and trust law to ensure your fund is compliant. Are you being sold something? If the service you are considering seems to be more about selling you an investment scheme than taking care of your retirement savings, you'd be better off looking elsewhere. Si test We asked 53 SMSF service providers to tell us about their offerings. A comparative analysis of their service was conducted to compare their time in the business, the size of their team and the number of self-managed super funds they looked after. We assessed their capacity to offer:\nA comprehensive and affordable SMSF set-up service, including the cost of establishing a corporate trustee. A comprehensive and affordable administration service for an existing SMSF. Online systems that did not require SMSF trustees to spend a large amount of time entering data. Daily online reporting. Year-round compliance. Deed, service provider and asset flexibility. Integrated service providers were also assessed for the access they provided (either in house or through agreements with third parties) to other service areas such as personal financial and investment advice, insurance and borrowing.\nTo make it into our recommended tables, integrated services providers also needed to have an Australian financial services licence.", "external_links": ["http://selfmanagedsuper.com.au/"], "published": "2015-07-01T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T11:10:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
