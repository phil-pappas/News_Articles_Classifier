Robert Rough by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell X2 Resources has turned to familiar faces at Goldman Sachs as it works on a potential $4 billion acquisition of Rio Tinto's NSW coal assets.\nStreet Talk understands X2 has been in talks with Rio about the Hunter Valley thermal coal assets for months. Goldman is running its side of things out of its London office but the Australian team is also on board.\nX2 has been working on potential valuations for the assets and it has been reported the talks with Rio Tinto are \"serious.\"\nSwiss commodities giant Glencore owns several mines in the region and was in talks with Rio about potential joint ventures last year.\nSources close to X2 did not believe Rio was in active talks with Glencore, but obviously could not rule it out.\nThe Hunter Valley assets are understood to be Davis' primary focus at the moment. There had been some talk that X2 may have at look at Peabody's Queensland coal assets, which Street Talk revealed were on the block.\nDavis is yet to make an acquisition for X2, after raising US$5.6 billion from investors with Goldman's help. Goldman would also be on board for debt financing.\nDavis was in talks to buy a $US3 billion coal miner owned by Goldman Sachs last year.\n Rio is open to exiting thermal coal, or selling down its portfolio of assets, if a decent offer comes their way. Rio's coal boss left in February and the division was punted into the copper arm of the global giant\nGlencore sees itself as the natural operator of the Rio assets and the Swiss company's chief executive Ivan Glasenberg has been a long-time rival of Davis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T22:08:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
