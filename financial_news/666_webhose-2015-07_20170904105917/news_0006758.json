VF Corp said a continued benefit from the shift of its revenue mix toward higher margin businesses was more than offset by the impact of foreign currency. \nRevenue rose 4.6% on a reported basis driven by growth in the group's outdoor & action sports and jeanswear coalitions, as well as its international and direct-to-consumer businesses. \nInternational revenue, on a reported basis, was down 1% in the quarter. In Europe, sales were down 8% reported, and in the Asia Pacific region climbed 14%. Revenue in the Americas (non-US) region was down 1%. \n&quotOur second quarter was another strong illustration of the ability of our global, diverse and powerful brands and platforms to deliver consistent, profitable growth,\" said CEO Eric Wiseman. &quotOur strategy for continued growth and fuelling our momentum is working: Keep the consumer at the centre of everything we do; deliver innovative and relevant product; and focus our execution and discipline to maximize long-term growth opportunities.\" \nFor the full-year, VF is forecasting EPS, on a currency neutral basis, to increase 15% compared to an adjusted EPS of $3.08 in 2014. This is an increase from the previous expectation of 14% per share growth provided in May. \nFull-year revenue expectations are unchanged, with an 8% increase on a currency neutral basis, and a 3% rise on a reported basis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T19:35:02.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
