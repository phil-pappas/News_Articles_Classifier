We will fight the battles we face with determination.\" \nSome 6,000 anti-austerity demonstrators gathered near parliament ahead of the vote to protest against the cash-for-reforms deal, according to police. \nA handful of petrol bombs were lobbed in the direction of the security forces, who had thrown up a ring of steel around parliament after riots during last week's vote on austerity measures. \nTsipras was expected to win Thursday's vote comfortably after opposition parties said they would back it, but analysts said the debate would show whether the premier can avoid another deep split within his own party and head off the risk of early elections after only six months in power. \nKaterina and George Sergidou Kokkinavis, two Syriza members in their thirties taking part in Wednesday's protest, said they had come because \"the government is no longer listening to the people\". \nSyriza came to power on an anti-austerity ticket however the government has agreed to a deal that involves more painful reforms -- despite a referendum result in which Greeks came out against further cuts -- in the hope that it will prevent the country from crashing out of the eurozone. \n- 'The pain doesn't stop here' - \nThe second bill, less controversial than the first, covers civil justice reforms, a bank deposit protection scheme, and measures to shore up the liquidity of the banks, which reopened Monday after a three-week closure imposed to avert a catastrophic bank run that could have seen Greece's financial system collapse. \nThe banks have seen some 40 billion euros withdrawn since December by customers anxious over the safety of their cash -- seriously undermining the banks' ability to function normally. \nBloomberg News reported that the European Central Bank boosted its cash lifeline for Greek banks -- the programme known as Emergency Liquidity Assistance -- by 900 million euros on Wednesday, in a move that had been announced last week. \nThe ELA is the only source of funding for banks until the bailout package can take effect -- and, by extension, the sole financial lifeline preventing the Greek economy from imploding. \nTsipras told parliament that Greece would have to adapt to \"the new realities\" of the bailout agreement. \n\"The painful path does not stop here, unfortunately,\" he said. \"We have been forced to make a difficult compromise under urgent conditions. We were at the limits of our economy and our banking system, and at the limits of Europe -- where conservative forces, obsessed with austerity, dominate,\" he added. \nTsipras was forced to reshuffle his cabinet last week, having sacked three ministers for voting against the first bailout bill. \nVassiliki Georgiadis, a political science professor at Athens' Panteion University, said the split within Syriza was between hard-left MPs -- \"some of whom have spoken of a Greek exit from the eurozone as the only solution\" -- and those more sympathetic to Tsipras's arguments. \nShe added that it would be \"difficult\" for the 40-year-old premier to continue in office if he was forced to rely on opposition MPs to get laws passed. \nGovernment spokeswoman Olga Gerovassili said Monday that elections would not be \"useful at the moment\", and the government had \"no intention\" of calling early polls. \nGerovassili said negotiations with Greece's creditors -- the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- would resume immediately after Thursday's vote. \nThe EU's Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said they were aiming to finalise the deal by mid-August. \nBoth sides are under huge pressure to finalise the terms of the rescue before August 20, when Greece owes the ECB a loan repayment of 3.2 billion euros it cannot afford.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T03:30:35.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
