Unemployment ticked higher by 15,000 persons in the three months to May - the first increase since the start of 2013 - while the rate of increase for average weekly earnings picked up to its fastest since 2010. \n\"The data might be a reflection of supply constraints hitting employment growth, as some recent survey results have been pointing to\", Dominic Bryant at BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) said in a research note e-mailed to clients. \nCable ended the day just 0.03%. \nStateside, in her testimony before the lower chamber of Congress Fed chair Janet Yellen sounded a slightly more upbeat note on the US economy's prospects than in a speech delivered on 10 July. \n\"Yellen sounded somewhat less dovish than in her speech last Friday before the City Club of Cleveland. In part, we view the change in tone as reflecting the change in audience. Nonetheless, we take some signal from the change in tone in her carefully prepared remarks,\" Rob Martin from Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) said in a research note e-mailed to clients. \nThat pushed euro/dollar through the psychological level of 1.10 to close at 1.0955. \nReinforcing that message, Jesse Hurwitz at Barclays said: \"These assessments of the pace of growth improved from the May Beige Book and reinforce the positive trend we have noted in high-frequency economic data over the past several week.\" Dollar/yen closed 0.44% higher at 123.90. \nActing as a backdrop, markets were nervously awaiting a vote by the parliament in Athens on whether to accept the package of reforms which creditors had asked of it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T19:52:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
