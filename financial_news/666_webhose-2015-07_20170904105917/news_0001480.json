In an analysis of 600 companies (excluding financial and oil and gas companies) representing 70 percent of the overall market capitalization, it said it found only a three percent uptick in revenue growth. However, the growth is 230 basis points over the 0.7 percent seen in the quarter ending March 31, 2015, CRISIL Research said in a statement. The moderate growth expected in export-oriented consumer driven sectors will be impacted by continued weak performance of investment-linked sectors and low global commodity prices, it added. \"Export-oriented sectors and some domestic consumption-driven sectors (such as retail, FMCG, and media) will be the topline outperformers with the former being partly aided by the recent weakness in rupee,\" said CRISIL Research's senior director Prasad Koparkar. Low prices will majorly impact petrochemical, steel, sugar and man-made fibre sectors while cement manufacturers are likely to see another weak quarter, it said. However, after three flat preceding quarters, construction companies are likely to see two to four percent growth. Low rural consumption is reflected in the volume and topline growth of FMCG, tractor and two-wheeler companies which depend on the hinterland. On the brighter side, rise in data revenue and control on operating expenses will boost telecom companies margins by 120 basis points. Margins of petrochemical companies are expected to witness a rise of over 400 basis points following improvement in polyester feedstock spread, the statement added. Road developers are also likely to witness margin rise by 350 to 400 basis points following a hike in build, operate and transfer (BOT) projects.
