You can blame the eurozone, as some have—one single currency for 19 countries may not have been the best idea. Many European countries have serious public debt compared to their respective GDPs—Belgium, Italy, and Spain are at top of mind, but others are in relatively serious trouble, too. You can blame Greek politics, as many observers have, or you can blame what some claim to be a misguided austerity budget gambit. \nIt’s probably a combination of the three. But, if you pick apart all of those potential reasons, you can find some basic lessons about budgeting that can help you manage your own finances. \nThe eurozone complaint? Doubts about the euro’s positive impact on individual countries within the European Union have persisted since 1999. Depending on how you look at it, Greece is one big, finger-wagging “I told you so,” or it’s a necessary test for the eurozone if it is to survive another 16 years. Either way, the principle of balancing personal interests and the good-of-the-order comes into play here when thinking about a personal budget.
