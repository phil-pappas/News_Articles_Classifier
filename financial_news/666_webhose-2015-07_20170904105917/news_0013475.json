That said, there are plenty of consumer stocks that had big losses. The S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector index rose 6% through June 30, 2015, outperforming the general market. The S&P 500 Index rose just 0.2% over the same period. Here are the stocks with the biggest losses to date. But not all of the stocks are sells -- having lost much of their value, some of them might actually be smart buys. TheStreet paired the stocks with TheStreet Ratings to determine whether they really are poor investments going forward. \nTheStreet Ratings , TheStreet's proprietary ratings tool, projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and dividends. Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. More Headlines 10. Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Market Cap: $67.2 billion Year-to-date return: -15.3% TheStreet Ratings: Buy, B \nTwenty-First Century Fox, Inc. operates as a diversified media and entertainment company worldwide. It operates through Cable Network Programming, Television, Filmed Entertainment, and Direct Broadcast Satellite Television segments. \n\"We rate TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX INC (FOX) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its notable return on equity, attractive valuation levels, expanding profit margins, good cash flow from operations and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The company's current return on equity greatly increased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of significant strength within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Media industry and the overall market, TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX INC's return on equity significantly exceeds that of both the industry average and the S&P 500. 36.30% is the gross profit margin for TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX INC which we consider to be strong. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Along with this, the net profit margin of 14.25% is above that of the industry average. Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 53.66% to $1,761.00 million when compared to the same quarter last year. The firm also exceeded the industry average cash flow growth rate of 15.21%. Even though the current debt-to-equity ratio is 1.06, it is still below the industry average, suggesting that this level of debt is acceptable within the Media industry. Despite the fact that FOX's debt-to-equity ratio is mixed in its results, the company's quick ratio of 2.09 is high and demonstrates strong liquidity.
