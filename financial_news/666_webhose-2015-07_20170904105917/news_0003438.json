Bloomberg Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Greg Earl When a refugee from the rise of Nazism in Germany arrived at a fledgling university in Canberra in 1950 from London, Indonesia looked like one of the last places an ambitious young academic economist might have looked to make their name in a new country.\nAnti-western rhetoric was growing, inflation was rising and in little more than a decade Australian soldiers would be fighting with Indonesians in Borneo.\nHeinz Arndt spend that first decade as an economics professor at Canberra University College (and then the Australian National University) writing about issues such as trading banks. But he was increasingly drawn to asking why Australia didn't know more about what was happening in the Indonesian economy.\n\"It was quite a leap of faith on his part,\" says historian Colin Brown of Arndt's decision to visit Indonesia in 1964 amid rising tension with Australia, \"But it cemented in his mind that something could be done.\"\nThe project has had four directors since Heinz Arndt retired in 1980. Peter Morris That something was the ANU Indonesia Project , which celebrates its 50th anniversary this week as one of the oldest institutions of its kind in Australia, home of the world's leading academic publication on Indonesia's economy and one of the deepest continuing links between the two countries through many political chills.\nAmid the latest round of an old debate about whether Australia and Indonesia can really sustain a stable, productive relationship, the expected attendance of three former Indonesian ministers – former vice-president Boediono​, former trade minister Mari Pangestu​ and former finance minister Chatib Basri​ – at the celebration will underline the depth of those links.\nBrown, who has written a history of the project commissioned by ANU, says Arndt discovered that he could maintain contact with an emerging generation of Indonesian academics whatever was happening in the political relationship and Indonesian authorities would tolerate informed academic criticism of their policies in contrast to other comment from Australia.\nRegular input on decisions The project has had four directors since Arndt retired in 1980, including now the first Indonesian national in Budy Resosudarmo. It holds the world's largest annual conference on Indonesia and provides regular input into government decision making on the country.\nBut 50 years on, the institution faces problems Arndt may not have imagined with a virtual flood of detailed analyses of the Indonesian economy in the past couple of years as businesses assess whether it will actually become a top five economy by 2050 as some forecasters predict.\nAt the same time it has lost some profile as Australian students have deserted Indonesian language study and both private and public support for such institutions has shifted as China has loomed larger in the focus of students and business alike.\nBut Basri describes the project as \"an important part of the Indonesian intellectual discourse.\" He says the regular high level policy dialogue in Jakarta organised by the Project and the Australian Treasury was very useful when he was finance minister.\n\"Fostering and maintaining a study centre for 50 years is not an easy task. Especially if this study centre focuses on the country which is very vibrant, very dynamic and in the process of history of making. We are dealing with a moving target,\" Basri says.\nRMIT University deputy vice-chancellor Andrew MacIntyre​, who previously worked at ANU, describes the project as a gem in the academic landscape.\n\"Not only does it stand out as the global leader for research on the Indonesian economy, but it has been a hub for a wider community of scholars interested in Indonesia.\n\"There is nothing comparable elsewhere in the world. Over multiple decades it has provided quite exceptional bang for taxpayer buck.\"\nGreg Earl is member of the Indonesia Project advisory board.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/100440329083596928444/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Greg__Earl", "https://crawford.anu.edu.au/acde/ip/"], "published": "2015-07-24T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:06:25.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
