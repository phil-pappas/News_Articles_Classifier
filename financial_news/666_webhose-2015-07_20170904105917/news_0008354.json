Now is the time to get greedy in gold Jul. 22, 2015, 5:08 PM 278 print \nGold and the mining stocks have been absolutely crushed lately. The plunge in price after a nearly four-year bear market has investors panicking. In fact, during the 10%+ decline in the gold mining equities indexes yesterday, the fear was almost palpable. \nIt’s very easy to say, “be greedy when others are fearful,” but it’s another thing entirely to actually do it. Here are a couple of reasons why it might pay off in the miners right now. \nThey say the best time to buy is when there’s “blood in the streets.” At -22%, the 5-year average annual return for the Philadelphia Gold/Silver index has never been so poor, as Short Side of Long reports.

I can only imagine the sort of returns that degree of despair produces. And that’s just the sort of setup that piques my interest. \nAll in all, I’m fairly certain that the gold mining stocks are now the most hated asset class in the markets.
