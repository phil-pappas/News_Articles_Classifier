Commonwealth Bank of Australia economist Diana Mousina said the retail figures have been disappointing over the past few months despite what should have been positive influences for consumers. In early May the Reserve Bank cut the cash rate by a quarter of a percentage point for the second time this year. One of the measures included in the May 12 federal budget was increasing the instant asset write-off to $20,000, effective from budget night, from the previous threshold of $1,000. \"The small business package in the Federal Budget has had a positive influence on small business asset spending: eg, electronics,\" Ms Mousina said. \"This impact should be more evident in the June data.\" Ms Mousina said the surge in housing construction is helping lift spending as people furnish and fit out their new homes. Household goods had the strongest rise of all the retail categories, up 0.9 per cent in May, bouncing back from falls in the previous months. This trend is expected to continue while dwelling construction remains elevated,\" she said. \"The lift in dwelling prices also means that the costs of moving have increased and households are instead choosing to renovate.\" ANZ economists Katie Hill and Jo Masters said weak wages growth appears to be a key factor weighing on discretionary spending in department stores and cafes and restaurants. \"A disappointing May retail sales print provides further evidence that consumer spending has failed to pick-up in 2015,\" they said. \"While stronger consumer confidence could still support retail in the near-term, anaemic wages growth and high household debt continue to point to a subdued medium term outlook for household consumption.\" JP Morgan Australia chief economist Stephen Walters doesn't expect spending will get a boost from increased consumer confidence any time soon. \"Consumer sentiment bounced after the RBA's rate cut and the budget, but slumped in the subsequent survey in early June, suggesting that the afterglow from the policy stimulus was pretty dim,\" he said. \"The sentiment survey revealed lingering concerns about rising unemployment and persistent offshore troubles. \"So, the June retail data released in a month's time should be a decent gauge of households resilience in the face of these constraints.\" HOW AUSSIES SHOPPED IN MAY * Hardware and garden supplies up 1.7 pct * Furniture, floor coverings and textiles up 1.2 pct * Groceries up 0.7 pct * Liquor up 0.6 pct * Cafes, restaurants and catering up 0.1 pct * Clothing down 1.3 pct * Newspapers and books down 3.0 pct (Source: ABS seasonally adjusted numbers) ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail-spending-disappoints-in-may/story-e6frfkur-1227427056399?sv=8052d45f4b2850969d1b5afdb482b740", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Budget%2C+rate+cut+fails+to+boost+spending&c=WEAK+retail+figures+have+continued+into+May%2C+with+spending+in+department+stores%2C+cafes+and+restaurants+suffering+falls.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail-spending-disappoints-in-may/story-e6frfkur-1227427056399?sv=8052d45f4b2850969d1b5afdb482b740", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail-spending-disappoints-in-may/story-e6frfkur-1227427056399?sv=8052d45f4b2850969d1b5afdb482b740&h=Budget%2C+rate+cut+fails+to+boost+spending", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail-spending-disappoints-in-may/story-e6frfkur-1227427056399?sv=8052d45f4b2850969d1b5afdb482b740&title=Budget%2C+rate+cut+fails+to+boost+spending", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail-spending-disappoints-in-may/story-e6frfkur-1227427056399?sv=8052d45f4b2850969d1b5afdb482b740&title=Budget%2C+rate+cut+fails+to+boost+spending", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail-spending-disappoints-in-may/story-e6frfkur-1227427056399?sv=8052d45f4b2850969d1b5afdb482b740"], "published": "2015-07-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T05:52:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
