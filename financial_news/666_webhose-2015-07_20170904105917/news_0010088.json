Some analysts had expected 100bn or more of issuance in 2015, but at the current run rate it will likely fall short of that. \nAt its peak, the ABS market saw volumes of US$1.2trn in 2008, according to research group Bruegel. \nBarclays will now focus its efforts on the booming US securitisation business, the source said. \nBarclays currently ranks fourth in the Thomson Reuters US ABS league tables with a 9.1% market share for this year.
