Its departure schedule has yet to be determined, boat repair facility Vigor said. \nThe Fennica had returned to Portland in recent days for repairs to a three foot (1 meter) gash it suffered in Alaska earlier this month. The ship holds a capping stack, a piece of equipment that would help plug a oil well, should one blow out. \nUntil the Fennica returns to the Chukchi Sea off northern Alaska with this emergency equipment, Shell is not allowed to drill into the oil bearing zone, the Interior Department said last week in issuing the final permits for exploration. Any delays could be costly as the exploration season only lasts until about October, when sea ice returns. \nPresident Barack Obama has tried to strike a balance in the Arctic by expanding protected areas of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge this spring. But at the same time his Interior Department is allowing Shell to return to drilling leases the company obtained when George W. Bush was president. \n\"The Fennica will begin its return journey to Alaska once we've completed the final preparations,\" Shell spokesman Curtis Smith said. \nShell hopes to return to the Arctic for the first time since 2012, when it experienced a series of mishaps including the grounding of an oil rig.
