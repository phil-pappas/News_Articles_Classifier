The Greek parliament approved the plans on Saturday, despite them being similar to those rejected by Greeks in a controversial referendum on July 5. \n- New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) laws by Wednesday - \nGreece would now have to push through new laws by Wednesday under the conditions agreed by the eurozone ministers and to be considered by the leaders of the bloc, Finnish Finance Minister Alex Stubb said afterwards. \nAthens would also have to introduce tough conditions on labour reform and pensions, VAT and taxes, and measures on privatisation, he said. \nThe Eurogroup even proposed a temporary Greek exit from the euro, a move first floated by Germany, which some observers said was a thinly disguised way of pushing Athens out of the single currency softly. \n\"In case no agreement could be reached, Greece should be offered swift negotiations on a time-out from the euro area, with possible debt restructuring,\" said the document obtained by AFP. The passage was in brackets to indicate it was not unanimously approved and needs the approval of leaders. \nOther measures include letting the \"troika\" of creditors back on the ground in Athens after they were expelled by Tsipras's government, and getting creditors' approval for any legislation affecting issue covered by the bailout. \nThe crisis has exposed tensions between the eurozone's two biggest powers with pro-austerity Germany going head to head with France, which has been the country most supportive of Greece during the crisis. \nHollande said Paris would do \"everything\" to keep Greece in the euro and ruled out the \"temporary Grexit\" proposal. \nAn emergency summit of all 28 EU leaders on Sunday -- billed by Tusk last week as the final deadline to keep the country in the euro -- was called off at the last minute due to slow progress. \n- 'Everybody's worried' - \nFive years have elapsed since the Greek debt drama began, but the latest instalment has opened deeper than ever rifts in the European single currency, the heart of the post-war dream of a politically unified Europe. \nIn Greece, there is growing alarm at capital controls that have closed banks and rationed cash at ATMs for nearly two weeks, leading to fears that food and medicine will soon run short. \n\"We don't sleep, everybody's worried,\" a Greek pensioner said, watching with concern the events taking place in Brussels several thousand kilometres (miles) away. \nThe European Central Bank is providing emergency liquidity to keep Greek banks afloat but has frozen the limit, with fears that failure to reach a deal could cause it to shut off the taps completely. \nECB chief Mario Draghi has also found himself at the centre of the storm, with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble reportedly snapping \"don't take me for a fool\" at him on Saturday. \nGreece's debt is now worth nearly 180 percent of the country's GDP and on June 30 it became the first advanced economy to default on a payment to the International Monetary Fund. \nTsipras was elected in January on a vow to end five years of bitter austerity under two bailouts since 2010 worth 240 billion euros. \nBut fears are mounting that the results of Friday's parliamentary vote in Athens could have critically weakened the Greek government's ability to quickly legislate on the reforms as demanded by the eurozone. \nTsipras won the backing of 251 out of 300 deputies in the Greek parliament for his reform plans, but three senior government figures were among 10 MPs who abstained or voted against.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T22:29:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
