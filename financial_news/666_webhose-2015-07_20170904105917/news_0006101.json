Hundreds of thousands of good jobs right now are going begging and these are gigs that may pay into the six figures. Doing what? First know this: those unfilled jobs may well represent a real and personal threat to you. That’s because these are jobs in cybersecurity, which is the profession of keeping criminals away from sensitive data. Right now, legit companies are frantically trying to keep up with the crooks and that may mean yet more data is stolen as criminals take advantage of lax protections. Is there a skills shortfall ? “There's a shortage of talent, because almost every enterprise from the Fortune 1000, global 5000 and government agencies are now scrambling to find experienced talent and it's become a very competitive market, even for recent graduates,\" said Muddu Sudhakar, CEO of Caspida, a cybersecurity company based in Palo Alto. \"This is why we are seeing what use to be five digit salaries for entry level talent grow into six figure salaries. It has become even more competitive with experienced cybersecurity talent.” From HomeDepot to the U.S. government, from Target to Anthem insurance, U.S. businesses and government entities are under 24/7 attack by a mashup of money-hunting cyber criminals along with state sponsored hackers who are sucking up information for reasons currently unknown. Most computer systems - generally anything built in the last century - were designed with at best a passing stab at incorporating security. Even some systems birthed in this century appear to have minimal security . The upshot: Google, Facebook, the big banks and government, among others, are throwing money at skilled and expert cybersecurity pros who largely can write their own tickets as to where they work, for how much and for whom. Large IT company Cisco has predicted there is a present shortfall of one million cybersecurity professionals. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T22:32:28.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
