And on Sunday, Roger Federer, who is also 33, will play 28-year-old Novak Djokovic.\nIn the Open era, 33 has historically been pretty old to be near the top of the rankings. For some perspective, Andy Roddick, who retired three years ago, is still just 32. The legend Bjorn Borg retired when he was 26. And Rafael Nadal has looked for most of 2015 like he can’t quite compete at the level he played at while winning 14 Grand Slam titles. He is 29.\nIf the oldsters end up winning, Federer would become the oldest man to win Wimbledon in the Open era, which began in 1968. Serena would become not only the oldest woman to win Wimbledon, but to win any Grand Slam tournament in the Open era.\nThey would also be setting some other impressive records. It would be Federer’s record eighth Wimbledon title. And it would earn Williams her second “Serena Slam” — which means she would hold all four Grand Slam titles at once.\nWinners will receive $2.94 million, and runners-up will get $1.47 million.\nThe women’s final will be Saturday at 9 a.m. Eastern, and the men’s final will be on Sunday at 9 a.m. Eastern. Both will be on ESPN.\nAnd with the flick of his wrist... http://t.co/intRsiaGal #Wimbledon #Federer #SCTop10\n— ESPNTennis (@ESPNTennis) July 10, 2015 WATCH Garbine Muguruza bounds into her first Grand Slam Semi-final. #Wimbledon\n https://t.co/QoiNh5tb8S\n— Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) July 8, 2015 #NovakDjokovic makes his 4th #Wimbledon final in 5 years - how he did it > http://t.co/4bBSqsQtYl pic.twitter.com/6ztOegehn3\n— Live Tennis (@livetennis) July 10, 2015 PICTURES: @serenawilliams storms into Wimbledon ladies’ final\n http://t.co/5cAjVhd9NA pic.twitter.com/ID2lUFx5Gh\n— Live Tennis (@livetennis) July 10, 2015 More from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://t.co/6ztOegehn3", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/SCTop10?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/serenawilliams", "https://twitter.com/livetennis/status/619553675397103616", "https://t.co/QoiNh5tb8S", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NovakDjokovic?src=hash", "http://t.co/4bBSqsQtYl", "https://twitter.com/Wimbledon/status/618682911026384896", "http://t.co/ID2lUFx5Gh", "http://t.co/5cAjVhd9NA", "http://t.co/intRsiaGal", "https://twitter.com/ESPNTennis/status/619564105507176448", "https://twitter.com/livetennis/status/619560687275261952", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Federer?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Wimbledon?src=hash"], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T03:31:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
