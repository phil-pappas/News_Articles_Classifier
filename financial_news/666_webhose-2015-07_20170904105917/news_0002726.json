Under the New Legislation, deductions will only be allowed in calculating chargeable gains with respect to sums actually invested in the fund structure by individuals as consideration for acquiring the rights to that carried interest (as opposed to the amount that would have been permitted under D12). The New Legislation also provides that carried interest will only be construed as a foreign chargeable gain (and hence outside the scope of UK tax) for non-UK domiciled (but UK tax resident) individuals only to the extent that the recipient of the carried interest performed their services outside of the United Kingdom. The New Legislation does however give credit for employment income tax charges (where relevant). The New Legislation will not affect co-investment arrangements with funds made by investment managers on an arms length basis or the taxation of performance-linked rewards. \nThe New Legislation will be incorporated in the Finance Bill 2015, which will introduce new sections in the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.It will have effect from July 8, on all carried interest, irrespective of when the arrangements were entered into so there are no grandfathering provisions applicable. \nA tax impact note (together with draft legislation to implement the foregoing) can be found", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T22:34:30.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
