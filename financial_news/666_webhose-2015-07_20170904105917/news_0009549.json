No injuries or arrests were reported but a few protesters threw petrol bombs at police, it was reported. \nNow Greece hopes new bailout talks can be finished before 20 August, which is when the country must repay a debt of more than €3bn to the European Central Bank, which has twice injected new funds into the banking system this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T08:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T09:50:57.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
