Here are five numbers you need to know. \n= $4 trillion: total stock market losses = \nAt its peak, the Shanghai Composite Index was 152pc higher than a year earlier. Yet after that colossal bull run, shares plunged by 32pc in less than three weeks. \nThe total value of equities listed in China dropped by around $4 trillion (£2.6 trillion). Fears of slowing growth and concern that stocks had climbed too high led to the severe correction. \nWei Yao, an economist at Societe Generale (Swiss: 519928.SW - news ) , said: \"A stock market crash would be undoubtedly painful, which, if materialising, could shave 0.5 to one percentage points off real GDP growth in the following 12 months.\" \nAs well as potentially hitting China's GDP, the stock rout could threaten sorely needed economic liberalisation, prompting policymakers to become more conservative . The more intervention by Government, the less likely the chance of China's economy liberalising. \nTo put it another way, China is still learning how stock markets work , as IMF chief Christine Lagarde said earlier this week. \n= 92 million: massive influx of new investors = \nThe preceding mega-rally before China’s stock market troubles was driven largely by a huge increase in the number of private individuals deciding to buy stocks. \nA growing middle class has meant that citizens have wanted to buy into China’s corporate growth; tapping into the stock market has allowed them to do that. \nState-run media and the Chinese Government itself have also encouraged people to invest in equities, driving them higher still. \nZhu Guangyao, the country's vice finance minister, told The Telegraph that education would play an important part in developing the country's financial markets in future. \n“So many retail investors made this market very difficult to supervise,” Mr Zhu said during a visit to London. “But the people want [to invest in stocks] … so the Government has a responsibility to provide a good legal and market framework for them to do so.” \nHe argued that a lack of financial education is “the main problem”. “After the market stabilises we should emphasise education for people who want to invest in the stock market,” he said. \n= 97pc: number of stocks frozen on one day = \nThe downturn was met with a broadside of interventions by the Chinese authorities , after stocks dropped by more than 5pc on July 8 alone. \nThe country's central bank boosted its support for the market: new IPOs were suspended; state-run companies promised to invest in the market; and over 1,400 companies were given permission to suspend trading in their shares. \nLimits on daily movements of stocks and the halting of trading in some companies has meant that investors have been unable to buy or sell during much of the turbulence. \nAnalysis by the Wall Street Journal showed that such limits meant that for many days fewer than a fifth of stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen could be traded. On July 9, after stocks bottomed out, only 3.2pc of stocks were able to move, the paper found - leaving an incredible 97pc on ice. \n= 16pc: a brief rally = \nOnce the authorities responded forcefully, China's stock market climb resumed. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) rose by more than 16pc from the low point on July 8. \nBut the rally was short-lived. July 27 saw the most severe slump in Shanghai-listed stocks in eight years , as confidence in the markets vanished again. \nChina’s main index lost 8.5pc of its value, the largest one-day fall since early 2007, and the second greatest since 2000. \nThere are many possible explanations for the return of falling prices . Poor data on the progress of China's economy, less intervention from the country’s authorities, and fears that government support will be removed are all among the catalysts identified by China watchers. \n= $800bn: amount of cash leaving China in a year = \nWhile the market volatility goes on, cash is leaving the country. \nRobin Brooks, of Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) , estimates that capital outflows rose above $224bn in the second quarter, a level he said was \"beyond anything seen historically\". \nMy colleague Ambrose Evans-Pritchard highlights this chart from Lombard Street Research , which shows capital flight has reached $800bn over the past year. \n\"These are frighteningly large sums of money,\" he writes. \nCharles Dumas, of Lombard, produced the chart and warned that China could engage in currency depreciation, pushing up the value of the US dollar. \n\"If and when depreciation occurs, it could be by encouraging the already powerful flow of private capital out of the country by further relaxing (or abolishing) capital controls,\" he suggested. \nMr Dumas added: \" As the chart above shows, there is a potential tidal wave of outflows.\" \nThe turbulence in China isn't over yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:13:30.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
