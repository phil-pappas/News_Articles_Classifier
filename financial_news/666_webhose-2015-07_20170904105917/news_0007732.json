It prefers more market-friendly mechanisms, such as \ncurrency auctions. \n\"Short Latam currencies is a once-in-a-lifetime trade at \nthis juncture,\" said Bernd Berg, emerging markets strategist at \nSociete Generale (Paris: FR0000130809 - news ) in London. \nHe predicted falls of up to 10 percent against the dollar in \ncoming weeks on the real as well as Mexican and Colombian pesos, \nnoting that all these countries faced deteriorating growth and \nfalling commodity prices, \n\"Additionally they are highly vulnerable to any Fed rate \nhike due to their current account deficit positions and capital \noutflows,\" Berg added. \nThe Brazilian real, meanwhile, showed net longs increasing \nto 6,206 contracts in the latest week, the highest since \nmid-February. \nMEXICO PESO (Contracts of 500,000 pesos): \nJuly 21, 2015 Prior week \nweek", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T00:46:02.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
