But it still has a truly global presence, in both consumer and wholesale banking, which competitors will struggle ever to replicate. Citi's management has taken many of the necessary steps to ensure that a global universal banking model works. Our belief is that its clients, and its shareholders, will increasingly see the benefits of its unique global franchise.” \nCiti also won a number of regional awards, including Best Investment Bank in Africa, Best Investment Bank in Central and Eastern Europe and Best Investment Bank in Latin America. \n“By every measure, Citi has become a simpler, smaller, safer and stronger bank,” said Citi CEO Michael Corbat. “I’ve said since I took over as CEO that two of my goals are that Citi become known for making smart decisions and for being an indisputably strong and stable institution. This award shows that we’re well on our way and we have begun to show what our firm can do at its best.” \nThe Euromoney Awards for Excellence are recognized as among the most prestigious in the financial services industry. \nBelow is a list of Citi's Euromoney award wins in all regions except for Asia, which will be announced at a dinner in Hong Kong next week: Best Global Bank Best Global Emerging Market Investment Bank Best Investment Bank in Africa Best Investment Bank in Central Eastern Europe Best Investment Bank in Latin America Best Investment Bank in Argentina Best Investment Bank in Peru Best Equity House in Africa Best DCM House in Turkey Best DCM House in Latin America Best Equity House in USA Best Transaction Banking House in North America Best M&A House in the Middle East \nCiti \nCiti, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services, and wealth management. \nAdditional information may be found at www.citigroup.com | Twitter: @Citi | YouTube: www.youtube.com/citi | Blog: http://blog.citigroup.com | Facebook: www.facebook.com/citi | LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/citi View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150709006285/en/ Contact", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T02:53:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
