That's not all. The same study states that only 6% of total mobile app development is spent on security. \"That's why one of my biggest concerns for mobile banking is the lack of security on the back-end of a mobile banking app,\" says Andrew von Ramin Mapp, chief executive officer of Data Analyzers, a data =0recovery and computer forensics firm. \"As more mobile banking apps come out, you may want to resist the urge to download one on your phone. The less apps on your mobile phone, the less of a chance of a 'man in the middle' hacker accessing communications and information, especially sensitive banking information.\" Some banking experts say the most realistic solutions for banks and for mobile users, are not to eliminate fraud - that's not going to happen - but limit it. \"There will always be fraud,\" says Robert Siciliano, an identity theft specialist at BestCompanys.com. \"With an increase in mobile banking, there will be in increase in fraud simply, because there are known exploits that fraud artists exploit more often like malware and check cashing fraud.\" Even so, mobile banking is still relatively safer than other forms of digital banking. \"The low hanging fruit is still personal computers,\" Siciliano adds. \"There are hundreds of thousands of viruses targeting mobiles, specifically Androids, but millions of viruses targeting personal computers. And, as the scams and scammers get more prolific, so will the fraud. But mobile is inherently more secure than PCs, or less ubiquitous, or less vulnerable, in regards to traditional online banking.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T04:49:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
