Apparently his computer had flashed up one too many “blue screens of death” and paid the ultimate price.\nI mention this story, published in PCWorld magazine last April, only because it proved to be a most prescient indicator of widespread discontent in the personal computing sector. Specifically, sales of personal computers have fallen off a cliff, along with the stock prices of the companies that make the things.\nShipments of PCs worldwide dropped 11.8 percent in the second quarter compared with the same period in 2014 — from 74.9 million units to 66.1 million units, according to a recent report by International Data Corp. This was the largest decline in two years, with all the major PC manufacturers except Apple Inc. having major declines in sales.\nChina-based Lenovo Group Ltd., the world’s largest computer maker with about 20 percent market share, saw sales drop 7.5 percent in the quarter. And PC sales at long-suffering Hewlett-Packard Co. were down 10.4 percent, while Dell saw a decline of 8.7 percent.\nAcer Group was the biggest loser among PC makers with a jaw-dropping 26.9 percent decline in sales. On a positive note, shipments of the Apple Macintosh were up 16.10 percent as it continued to take market share from competitors, although it remains the fourth largest PC maker.\nThe reason most often cited in the financial press for the sales slump involves the much-anticipated launch this week of Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system. PC makers are hoping potential buyers have simply delayed buying computers until they can get the newest operating system.\nPerhaps the impending Windows 10 launch is partly to blame for slumping sales, but there’s more to this story than that. For starters, Microsoft is offering a free Windows 10 upgrade for existing Windows users, so I suspect most PC owners will simply download the free operating system and keep their current machines.\nSome analysts have also suggested that the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies has made PCs too expensive, especially in Asian markets. Granted, currency issues are not insignificant, but when customers are firing bullets into their products, exchange rates are probably not the whole problem.\nThe most pressing issue affecting the PC market is the ascent in recent years of relatively inexpensive mobile devices, such as smartphones and notebooks.\n“The decline in PC sales first started showing up in about 2012, so this is not a new problem,” said Ashraf Eassa, technology specialist at The Motley Fool, a financial services company. “When tablets became more mainstream, that is when PC sales really started to decline.”\nGartner Inc., an information technology company, estimates that for the first time more tablets will be sold this year than PCs or laptops — 320 million compared to 316 million. With sales falling, it’s not surprising that the stock prices of most of the publicly held PC makers are in full retreat.\nShares of Hewlett Packard are down 23 percent so far this year as revenue growth has stalled. Lenovo shares are actually up 20 percent so far this year, but their price has come down 33 percent from its previous high hit in May. And the carnage is not limited to the PC makers. Some of the chipmakers, which are in the PC food chain, have been torpedoed too.\nFor example, shares of Micron Technology Inc., which makes memory chips for PCs, are down by almost 50 percent so far this year. And the story is much the same for Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which makes microprocessors and motherboard chipsets. Its shares are down 33 percent.\nThe magnitude of the losses has pushed valuations so low that some stock analysts have begun putting “buy” recommendations back on some of these cheap stocks. However, sales are expected to continue to fall throughout the year even after the release of Windows 10.\n“Sales will still be down this year, but the decline might be less steep,” Eassa said. “At some point these stocks will bottom out, but it is not clear when.”\nHe stressed that the PC industry is not going away, because there will always be demand for personal computers. But the high growth rates of the past are probably over, and the remaining players will be locked in a highly competitive fight for market share — not a positive backdrop for stock price appreciation.\nTony Sagami, an analyst at Dallas-based Mauldin Economics, recently advised investors to steer clear of this sector. He probably put it best in a recent column when he said: “What you have is a handful of formerly powerful and profitable computer companies beating the crap out of each other for an ever-shrinking pie.”\nBy the way, the Colorado man who killed his computer avoided jail time, and police even allowed him to keep the bullet-riddled PC. He offered this description of that fateful day to the Los Angeles Times : “It was glorious. Angels sung on high.”\nAmen, brother.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T05:52:14.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
