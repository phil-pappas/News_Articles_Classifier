The outbreak has reduced the national flock by more than 40 million laying hens and pullets, the company said in a statement. Cal-Maine hasn't had any positive tests for the disease — there have been zero cases in Mississippi — and it has “significantly increased” biosecurity measures at all its locations to keep the disease at bay, according to Chief Executive Dolph Baker.\nSee also: Egg prices may break lower as bird-flu fears fade\nBut the company still failed to fully benefit from the spike in egg prices, which rose about 43% in May from April, according to the producer-price index calculated by the U.S. Department of Labor. A report last week showed the trend continued into June, when egg prices were up a staggering 84.5% from May.\nSoutheastern egg pricing was volatile in the quarter, averaging $2.26 per dozen eggs in the latter two weeks and $1.13 for all of April, according to research firm DA Davidson.\nFor Cal-Maine, “It appears volume was skewed towards periods of lower pricing,” analyst Eric Gottlieb wrote.\nStill, Cal-Maine management was bullish in its earnings release, citing the company’s strong balance sheet, abundant and cheap grain supply and positive outlook for specialty eggs as reasons for optimism. Specialty eggs include such items as organic eggs, cage-free eggs and nutritionally enhanced eggs.\nEager to tap consumer demand for those products, Cal-Maine in April unveiled a new production joint venture in Texas with Rose Acre Farms to build a shell egg production complex with capacity for about 1.8 million cage-free laying hens. Construction has begun, and the first flocks are expected to be placed in November.\n“This joint venture, Red River Valley Egg Farm LLC, provides a unique opportunity to capitalize on the growing demand for specialty eggs and better serve customers who are looking for a trusted supplier of cage-free eggs,” said Baker.\nThe company managed to lower its average feed costs by 10.9% in fiscal 2015 thanks to a generous supply of grain from the record corn and soybean harvests last fall.\n“We should have an adequate supply of our primary feed ingredients, but expect that prices will be volatile in the year ahead,” said Baker.\nDA Davidson is sticking with its buy rating on the stock and $65 price target.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T07:50:21.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
