The other components are \"performance,\" \"people\" and \"price.\"\nMorningstar rated DoubleLine's \"people\" component \"positive\" after not rating it last year, and changed its \"parent\" component to \"not rated\" based on \"insufficient information about succession planning, risk control and firm culture,\" Bush said in a phone interview.\nGundlach, who was named Morningstar's fixed-income manager for 2006 and widely known as the new \"Bond King,\" started DoubleLine in December 2009 after he was fired as chief investment officer of TCW Group Inc in a dispute that led to a legal battle.\nHis Total Return Bond Fund has surged to $46.7 billion in assets after opening in April 2010 and beat 94 percent of peers in the past three years.
