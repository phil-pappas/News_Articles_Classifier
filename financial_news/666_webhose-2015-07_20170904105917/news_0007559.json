Later, he apologised and withdrew his resignation.\nLast month, he hogged the limelight again when he gave away all his holding, worth about Rs 200 crore, in the company to the employees.\nIn December last year, Housing.com had raised USD 90 million through private equity infusion from SoftBank Group along with Falcon Edge and other existing investors. SoftBank has over 30 per cent stake in the company.\nWithin two years of its founding, the company has expanded from its original rent and resale proposition to include PGs and hostels, serviced apartments, land, plot projects, and new projects.\nHousing.com currently has more than 2,551 employees in over 100 cities across India.\nFor Updates Check Company News ; follow us on Facebook and Twitter\n 10, 2015 6:14 pm", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress", "http://twitter.com/financialxpress"], "published": "2015-07-11T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T01:39:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
