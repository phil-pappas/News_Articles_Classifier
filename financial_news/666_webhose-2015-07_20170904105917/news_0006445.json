It is thought the French bank could also participate in this stage of the financing. \nThe mine will cost around £1.5bn to build and is expected to produce something in the region of 13m tons per year of polyhalite, a type of potash used as fertiliser. \nOnce complete, the mine will make York Portash a subsidiary of Sirius one of the world’s biggest producers of the mineral. \n• Ian McVeigh: Sirius mine decision highlights need for Government to take planning lead \nMr Fraser said that the company has already received approaches from government-backed export credit agencies hoping to support equipment suppliers to the project, and has held talks with Infrastructure UK to back the scheme, which will bring thousands of jobs to the region. \nSirius estimates that the mine will boost the economy of North Yorkshire by up to 10pc and generate around £1.2bn per year in export revenue for the British economy. \nIn order to minimise the environmental impact of the mine, Sirius plans to excavate a 23-mile long tunnel that will link the project’s main site near the village of Seamer with the port at the Wilton petrochemicals site on Teesside. \nA major test for the scheme will be to secure more deals for the polyhalite, which is largely untested in the fertiliser market. The resource contains a lower quantity of potassium than conventional potash. \n“We already have various levels of commitments from customers,” said Mr Fraser.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T01:29:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
