South African billionaire Christo Wiese clearly still feels the thrill of the chase. \nThe 73-year-old is third on South Africa’s rich list, with an estimated worth of £4.2bn. The journey that recently saw his investment firm Brait acquire both Virgin Active and New Look this year, two of the UK’s foremost brands, began 50 years ago with his family’s purchase of a small discount clothing chain in a remote Northern Cape town. Pep Stores became Pepkor under Wiese’s management, spreading to Europe and Asia. \nShoprite, perhaps his most famous project, came along in 1979, when it had eight stores in Cape Town. It now owns more than 2,000 supermarkets, furniture shops and food outlets in 15 countries, with sales in South Africa alone of £2.2bn last year. Wiese has also put money into industrial products, financial services and mining, and bought a wine farm in the Western Cape. \nThere is certainly no financial need for the billionaire to seek deals as big as those he has secured in the UK. As he moves well into his seventies, there is nothing to stop Wiese from taking his money and enjoying a well-earned retirement after five decades in business. But that would go against the grain. \nChristo Weise, 73, still enjoys dealmaking \n“I think he just enjoys the deal, it’s not about the money anymore. He loves the chase. Clearly it is intellectually stimulating for him,” said Nic Norman-Smith, chief investment officer at Lentus Asset Management. \nThe deal is something Wiese has expertise in. The one most cited is the “fabled”, as one analyst put it, OK Bazaars purchase from brewer SABMiller (Xetra: BRW1.DE - news ) . Shoprite bought the chain for one rand, turned the company around, and made 1bn rand. Wiese’s reputation skyrocketed. \n“There was a lot of risk, but he managed to pick up the hidden value, something he’s done a lot of times,” Norman-Smith said. \nWiese is not, however, married to his investments. Pepkor was a crucial part of his empire, but was sold to South African furniture company Steinhoff International last year in a £3.6bn transaction that left him with a 20pc stake in Steinhoff, which has operations in Europe and will shortly list in Frankfurt. \nFor Norman-Smith, this deal is attributable to Wiese’s “phenomenal ability to analyse risk and reward”, as are the Virgin Active and New Look takeovers. \nExperts have put Wiese’s growing interest in European markets down to both economic instability back home in South Africa and the growing prospects in Europe as economies recover. \n“South African economic growth is sluggish, there’s not a good chance of it coming out of the box soon,” said Adrian Saville, chief strategist for specialist wealth management firm Citadel. \n“As a large part of his assets are in South Africa, there might be an obvious diversification argument.” \nSasha Naryshkine, owner of South African investment firm Vestact, agrees that the economic and political situation in the country may be one of the reasons Wiese is looking elsewhere for more stable investments. “Whilst government appears to be business friendly, the very far and radical Left gained one million votes in the last elections,” he said. “Plus, growth rates have been really slow, opportunities have been in places where borrowing rates are likely to be lower for longer, and prices are a little more beaten up than the global norm, such as Europe.” \nThe negative aspects of South Africa are balanced by the more positive outlook for Europe, and the UK particularly, Norman-Smith said. \n“With the pressure UK retailers have been under, that sort of turmoil brings opportunities,” he said. \nThis shift in focus, however, does not mean Wiese has given up on his home country. He has faced problems there before. After the rand collapsed in the late 1980s, Pepkor found itself in a dangerous situation as a result of the currency fluctuation. Wiese rode out the storm and managed to get the company on an even keel once again. \n“There’s a lot of negativity about South Africa. People say he’s just bailing out. The risk of investing in South Africa has increased because of the economic and political concerns, but I think he’s making a cool, calculated play,” Norman-Smith said. \nBrait chief executive John Gnodde is adamant the Virgin Active and New Look acquisitions are due more to opportunities elsewhere than negativity over South African prospects. \nNew Look the clothing retailer was a recent target \n“The prospects in the UK are looking pretty good compared to recent years. In all our businesses we want to have a good base in the home market and the ability to jump over boundaries, and both Virgin Active and New Look demonstrate that,” he said. \nVirgin Active has operations in south-east Asia, while New Look has opened 31 stores in China. \nGrowth in Asia, rather than prospects in the UK, may have proven the real attraction, Gnodde confirmed. \nSaville said Wiese was being savvy if Asia was his real target. \n“The growth is elevated. This is the fastest growing region in the world. It is not a country, it is a basket of countries that represent this growth, which is likely to result in rising incomes and discretionary items,” he said. \nWhatever the reasons, Wiese is sticking to what he knows by investing in retail. “He has been especially powerful in rolling out franchise models and these acquisitions also speak to that,” Saville said. \nYet Wiese is unlikely to be too active with New Look and Virgin Active. Existing management has been kept on, and he has a track record of incentivising bosses to grow his businesses rather than running them himself. \nThis style is reminiscent of Warren Buffett, and is particularly evident with the trust put in Whitey Basson over the years at Shoprite. \n“The guy is an experienced investor who has been doing this for over \n45 years. He’s done a lot of investments in retail and consumer industries. \nHe is our largest shareholder, but the reality is when our team has the ability to tap into that skill-set on a daily basis, it is a huge advantage,” Gnodde said. \n“A real characteristic of him is he’s much more of a dealmaker than an on-the-ground operator,” Norman-Smith said. \nGood on-the-ground operators have been crucial to Wiese’s success, and making sure he unearths more is important for the future health of the empire. \nWiese is 73, Basson is 69, so finding a long-term heir is important. Wiese’s son, Jacob, is seen as the most likely successor from within the family, but Norman-Smith said Wiese is not a Rupert Murdoch-type figure, keen to create a family dynasty. \nInstead, Markus Jooste, chief executive of Steinhoff, could have been identified as the man to inherit the Wiese empire. \n“I think that he wants to cement his legacy and find a trusting partner, he is not getting younger, neither is his number one lieutenant Basson,” Naryshkine said. \nWiese continues to live an unostentatious life, driving his own car and sitting in the same old family office down in Parow East in Cape Town. But his reputation as one of South Africa’s paramount dealmakers remains. \n“He’s gone through the dark days of apartheid, and now democratic South Africa, identified opportunities and moved. And I’m sure he’ll continue to do that,” Norman-Smith said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T23:46:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
