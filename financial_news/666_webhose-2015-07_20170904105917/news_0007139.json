Share on twitter by Stephen Cauchi Australian businesses are enjoying solid growth in sales, according to the Commonwealth Bank's Business Sales Indicator.\nThe business sales indicator covers nationwide spending and is also broken down into various sectors.\nThe business services sector - which covers expenditure on items like office equipment and other business needs - enjoyed 2 per cent sales growth in June.\nNationwide spending - which includes all sectors including business services, retail, amusement and entertainment, and automobiles and entertainment - rose 0.7 per cent in June.\nNationwide spending in the year to June rose 7.6 per cent – the fastest pace in seven months and well above the decade-average trend of 5.3 per cent.\n\"June's indicator provides a solid indication that now is a promising time for Australian businesses,\" said Claire Roberts, Executive General Manager, Local Business Banking, Commonwealth Bank.\n\"Sales figures continue to reach record highs with businesses and consumers more confident about the economic outlook.\n\"A combination of low interest rates and reduced unemployment has resulted in a positive end to the 2014-15 financial year and businesses should be optimistic about what the next 12 months will bring.\"\n Craig James, chief economist at CommSec and author of the report, said June's sales figures implied the Australian economy was gathering strength.\n\"Despite recent global economic uncertainties such as the Greek debt crisis and China's slowing economy reducing demand for Australian resources, it's encouraging to see businesses and consumers embrace low interest rates and government stimulus, with spending growing at a steady pace.\"\nIn addition to the Business Services sector, other industry sectors that saw an increase in sales in June were amusement and entertainment (up 2.6 per cent); automobiles and vehicles (up 1.3 per cent); wholesale distributors and manufacturers (up 1.2 per cent); and the large retail stores sector (up 0.5 per cent after rising 0.6 per cent in the previous eight months).\nOnly four of the 19 industry sectors recorded contractions in sales in trend terms throughout June, including airlines (down 0.7 per cent); mail order/telephone order providers (down by 4.6 per cent); professional services and membership organisations (down 1.4 per cent); and transportation (down by 0.3 per cent).\nSales rose in all states and territories in June with the exception of Northern Territory, which was down by less than 0.1 per cent. South Australia saw the most sales growth (up 1.1 per cent), followed by Queensland (up 0.8 per cent), NSW (up 0.7 per cent), Victoria and Western Australia (both up 0.6 per cent), and Tasmania and ACT (both up 0.4 per cent).\nIn annual terms, NSW and Northern Territory were the only two states to record lower sales compared to June last year (down 5.6 per cent and 6.6 per cent respectively). In comparison, ACT experienced the strongest growth (up 14.2 per cent), followed by South Australia (up 8.4 per cent), Western Australia (up 7.7 per cent), Queensland (up 7.3 per cent), Tasmania (up 6.5 per cent) and Victoria (up 1.7 per cent).\nThe indicator tracks the value of credit and debit card transactions processed through Commonwealth Bank point-of-sale terminals.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@cauchis"], "published": "2015-07-22T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:05:24.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
