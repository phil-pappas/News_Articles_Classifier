Louie Douvis by James Eyers The need for higher equity ratios will drive ANZ Banking Group to sell its capital-hungry minority stakes in two or three Asian banks over the next couple of years, says Deutsche Bank, lifting the bank to the top of the capital tree and offsetting the impact of higher mortgage risk weightings that the prudential regulator is expected to announce this month.\nANZ owns a 39 per cent stake in Panin Bank in Indonesia, 24 per cent of AmBank Group in Malaysia, 14 per cent of China's Bank of Tianjin, and a 20 per cent holding in the Shanghai Rural and Commercial Bank. These stakes tie up around $5.3 billion of capital, draining returns.\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority requires ANZ to fully deduct the equity in its Asian joint ventures from capital; the rules were more generous to ANZ when the stakes were acquired eight years ago.\nAs bank capital levels around the world continue to rise as regulators push for more resilience in the financial system, and with APRA expected to announce soon that Australian banks must build capital even higher, investors are closely monitoring relative capital levels at Australia's banks.\nAt 8.7 per cent, ANZ's common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio is well above the required minimum level of 8 per cent, but it lags the other big Australian banks. National Australia Bank will have the strongest CET1 ratio at 10 per cent, after announcing the sale of Clydesdale Bank in the UK and a $5.5 billion equity raising in May. It is also offloading Great Western Bank in the United States.\n\"We believe the sale of [Asian] partnership stakes is the key plank in ANZ closing the gap between its bottom of peer CET1 ratio and the higher capital ratios it will likely need to hold in the future,\" said Deutsche Bank banking analyst Andrew Triggs in a note to the bank's clients on Thursday morning.\nMr Triggs said it seemed more likely that the Panin and two Chinese stakes would be the ones to be sold given ANZ's small stakes and lack of control. However, the AmBank stake might be considered more strategic, he said, given difficulties of expanding organically in Malaysia.\nBids have already been received for ANZ's $8.2 billion Esanda Dealer Finance portfolio, which will also lift capital. Deutsche is advising ANZ on that transaction.\n Assuming a sale of Esanda and three of the Asia partnerships at book value, Mr Triggs said ANZ's pro-forma CET1 ratio would rise to 10.3 per cent - above the 10 per cent level of NAB, which UBS analyst Jonathan Mott described last week as the new \"line in the sand\" for the sector.\nNational Australia Bank finance boss Craig Drummond last month said its rivals are catching up fast to the capital high ground it set in May.\nAPRA is expected to announce its response to the financial system inquiry this month, and is expected to call for the risk weightings applied to big bank mortgages to be lifted, which will require more capital to be raised to maintain ratios.\nDeutsche said ANZ is in a strong position versus its peers to meet the higher housing risk weights.\nIf Panin and the two Chinese stakes were sold, ANZ's CET1 ratio would rise to 9.8 per cent, just shy of NAB. Assuming APRA imposes a 25 per cent average risk weight on housing, this would result in ANZ sitting at 9 per cent - higher than each of the other big four banks.\nANZ chief Mike Smith said last October the $800 million position in Panin was \"untenable\" and said ANZ could be a seller or a buyer. But the latter is considered unlikely, given 46 per cent of Panin is held by an Indonesian family not considered a seller to ANZ.\nBloomberg reported in April that ANZ had restarted talks to sell the stake and the Gunawan family \"may now be more receptive to another investor buying the holding\" and named Japan's Mizuho Financial Group as a possible buyer. The Panin stake is considered less important for ANZ given the success of its 99 per cent owned ANZ Indonesia business.\nANZ has already exited stakes in Vietnam, with 17.5 per cent stake in Saigon Securities sold last year and its 9.6 per cent stake in Vietnam's Sacombank offloaded in 2012.\nThe quest to build capital ratios ahead of regulatory action has been a big driver of deal making in the financial services sector in recent months. Last month, Westpac said it would offloaded part of its stake in BT Investment Management.\nMeanwhile, Commonwealth Bank chief executive Ian Narev said last week CBA would respond \"when the picture becomes a bit clearer\" and \"I would imagine the most likely scenario is you'll hear more about that at the time of our annual results in mid-August.\"\nMeanwhile, ANZ said on Thursday that Martin Hanrahan had been appointed global head of corporate advisory, where he will oversee the bank's mergers and acquisitions services to clients of the international and institutional banking division. He will report to ANZ's managing director of global loans and advisory, Christina Tonkin.", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.afr.com%2Fbusiness%2Fbanking-and-finance%2Fapra-mulls-options-for-lifting-bank-capital-20150628-ghxl7d&ei=NYWUVaLSJ8T-8QXxjYb4DA&usg=AFQjCNEaGjfLGc3sisW47KOYwRuQQ2Kzig&sig2=9-dyA8fPQ9alT7IM1fFICw&bvm=bv.96952980,d.dGc", "https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB0QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smh.com.au%2Fbusiness%2Fanz-frustrated-as-stake-in-indonesian-panin-bank-remains-in-limbo-20141005-10qgse.html&ei=XIWUVaT0HcmA8QXYlZSwDg&usg=AFQjCNGNXjvlKWFKeJ2mJN44nJdkvCcK1Q&sig2=oDzArcxOwL0z3K2pVRysuA&bvm=bv.96952980,d.dGc"], "published": "2015-07-02T08:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T05:40:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
