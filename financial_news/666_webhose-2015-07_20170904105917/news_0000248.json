Christopher Pearce by Claire Stewart Old workers are thought to be more expensive to retain than hiring young people, and have outdated skills, new research has found.\nThe kicker: old is now 47, the average age senior business leaders see discrimination becoming an issue for workers in Australia.\nThe findings come despite nine out of the 10 people surveyed saying older workers are underused, and that workplace diversity, which includes diversity of age, gender and cultural backgrounds, is good for business.\nReleased today, the Westpac Women of Influence Report questioned nearly 1200 women and more than 500 men, earning over $85,000 a year and in senior leadership positions with responsibility for business performance or managing a team.\nAinslie van Onselen, Westpac's director of women's markets, inclusion and diversity, said the bank introduced targets in 2013 to mandate positive action to change attitudes.\nThose targets include raising the mean retirement age from 60.6 years in 2013 to 62 years in 2017 and ensuring the number of \"prime of life\" workers, those over 50, comprise at least 20.5 per cent of the staff.\n\"There are two types of prime of lifers, ones who are keen to keep their career very much tracking along with full energy and impact, and others looking to downscale, work fewer hours.\n\"Rather than have them leave the organisation and go from five days to zero, we're really encouraging flexibility â€¦ across the board,\" Ms Van Onselen said, pointing to the importance of retaining essential corporate knowledge held by workers over 50.\n \"We're not doing this because it's a nice thing to do, we're doing it because it's a business imperative. It is definitely good for business, it makes perfect business sense, just as it does to increase the diversity in our workforce as well,\" she said.\nStudies since 2012 found that Australians over 45, considered by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as \"mature aged workers\", contribute $65 billion to the economy annually, and that a 3 per cent increase in mature-aged participation, above that now expected, would add $33 billion to the GDP.\nWomen workers affected Critically, nearly eight out of 10 leaders surveyed said that gender discrimination still exists in organisations, a phenomenon which stacks the odds against older women workers.\n\"The thing about age discrimination is that unlike any other area of discrimination, it will affect everyone,\" Australia's Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Liz Broderick, who held the dual role of Age Discrimination Commissioner until 2011, told The Australian Financial Review .\nBut women, she said, face intersectional discrimination.\n\"What older women tell us is that they become invisible. As a nation, we can't afford to have that. And not only that, in terms of women's expectations about their life, that's not right either.\"\nNearly half of those surveyed said legislation should be introduced to mandate equal pay, as a way to keep more women in the workforce longer. More, however, thought flexible working hours for women as well as for men, should be a requisite change.\nOutdated skills, the perceived cost saving for hiring younger workers, higher salary expectations of older workers and issues arising because of younger workers not knowing how to manage older staff, are all to blame for why ageism exists, the study found.\n\"If we are about building a strong economy we need all the available talent to get on board, and not only that, because of life expectancy, the quadrupling of the number of people over 85, doubling of people over 65 by 2015, it just makes good business sense,\" Ms Broderick said.\nHow to become a Woman of Influence Nominations are open for The Australian Financial Review and Westpac 100 Women of Influence Awards.
