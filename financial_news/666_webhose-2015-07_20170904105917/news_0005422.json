Our casework suggests car dealers and providers of car loans are the most problematic.”\nHe said the common technique was for salespeople to attempt to add the insurance or warranty at the last minute to your credit card or loan, hoping you will agree on the spot.\nOther salespeople will try to slip the documents in with other paperwork and encourage customers to sign each of the papers without reading.\nConsumer Action said it has a number of cases where clients’ banks sold them income protection insurance, bundled in CCI, when they were unemployed or self-employed and so not able to claim on the income protection product.\nMr Leermakers said providers of CCI and similar products should be on notice. “Insurers should stop selling this junk insurance or risk paying more refunds further down the line,” he said. “Where Australians have clearly been mis-sold we’ll be encouraging them to seek the refunds they’re entitled to.”\nFigures from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority show CCI pays out about 23 cents for each dollar of premium paid, compared with travel insurance at 50 cents, home insurance at around 60 cents and car insurance at around 80 cents.\n“Because it’s sold as a bundle of products it makes it harder for us to come out and say in a word that it’s ‘useless’, but the statistics show and have for many years that CCI is the worst-value insurance product you can buy,” Mr Leermakers said.\nFigures from the UK show that gap insurance, which covers consumers against a shortfall between the comprehensive insurance payout and the loan balance in the event a motor vehicle is stolen or written off, is even lower value that CCI, although Australian figures are unavailable.\nOther cases included:\n• Consumers who did not realise they had been sold add-on insurance and warranties — frequently totalling thousands of dollars, financed and paid off through the normal loan repayments — when buying cars or car finance.\n• Consumers who were told by the salesperson or finance provider that they had to purchase add-on insurance or warranties to get the loan — this is against the law.\n• Consumers who were sold motor vehicle discretionary warranty products without it being explained that the warranty gives the provider absolute discretion over whether to accept claims.\nResearch commissioned by ASIC and published in 2013 noted that customers were not asked critical questions about whether they were eligible for cover — such as having pre-existing medical conditions — with the result that people paid for products that were useless to them.\nIn the UK, the selling of Payment Protection Insurance, the equivalent of CCI, led to an estimated 1.25 million ombudsman complaints made about mis-selling and around £22 billion paid in compensation since 2011.\nIn 2011-12, there were 983,648 CCI policies sold in Australia and 27,388 claims made, of which 3,171, or 11.6 per cent, were denied, according to the Financial Ombudsman. In 2013-14, the number of claims fell 9 per cent to 26,237, but the number of denied claims increased 19 per cent to 3,791.\nFOS noted that the factors contributing to denied and withdrawn claims “suggest that consumers do not have a clear understanding of how these products operate”.\nAccording to FOS, more than half of all internal disputes — that is, unresolved complaints between customers and financial institutions — concerned declined CCI claims.\n“Data trends in particular classes of personal insurance ... suggest to us that there is a gap between consumer expectations and how these products operate in practice,” FOS wrote.\nWHAT SHOULD AUSTRALIANS WATCH OUT FOR?\n• Always be suspicious if a salesperson or lender tries to add on an extra product you haven’t asked for. The best policy is always to sleep on it. If the add on product is genuine, they will be happy to sell it to you tomorrow.\n• These products are often sold using pressure sales tactics, like rushing you to sign papers in a hurry, or as an inducement to ‘complete’ the sale. The best response is to be polite but firm — you’ll take the brochure home and think about it but you’re not buying it today.\n• It is sometimes true that the lender can require you to buy insurance to get a loan. For example, if your car loan is secured against a car, the lender can require you to get the car comprehensively insured. But remember that: 1) a lender can never require you to buy consumer credit insurance — if they force you to take CCI they are breaking the law; and 2) you can always choose which insurer you go with. You do not have to use the insurer that the salesperson suggests.\n• If you think you’ve been sold insurance in circumstances where the salesperson misled you about the insurance, or where the insurance was useless to you from the beginning, seek legal advice. You may be eligible for a refund.\n(Source: Consumer Action Law Centre)\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/australians-being-sold-thousands-of-dollars-in-junk-insurance-every-day/story-fnagkbpv-1227440943087?sv=403b7859835da1568b90871a5e3dcaba", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/australians-being-sold-thousands-of-dollars-in-junk-insurance-every-day/story-fnagkbpv-1227440943087?sv=403b7859835da1568b90871a5e3dcaba", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=You%26%238217%3Bre+being+sold+absolute+%26%238216%3Bjunk%26%238217%3B&c=IF+YOU%26%238217%3BVE+bought+a+car%2C+applied+for+a+credit+card+or+taken+out+a+loan+recently%2C+you%26%238217%3Bve+probably+been+slapped+with+this+dodgy+add-on.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/australians-being-sold-thousands-of-dollars-in-junk-insurance-every-day/story-fnagkbpv-1227440943087?sv=403b7859835da1568b90871a5e3dcaba", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/australians-being-sold-thousands-of-dollars-in-junk-insurance-every-day/story-fnagkbpv-1227440943087?sv=403b7859835da1568b90871a5e3dcaba&h=You%26%238217%3Bre+being+sold+absolute+%26%238216%3Bjunk%26%238217%3B", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://videomam.news.com.au.s3.amazonaws.com/generated/prod/05/06/2015/47968/image1024x768.jpg?count=1&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/media-centre/find-a-media-release/2015-releases/15-175mr-cgu-insurance-and-accident-and-health-international-to-refund-2-million-in-useless-payday-insurance-premiums/", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/australians-being-sold-thousands-of-dollars-in-junk-insurance-every-day/story-fnagkbpv-1227440943087?sv=403b7859835da1568b90871a5e3dcaba&title=You%26%238217%3Bre+being+sold+absolute+%26%238216%3Bjunk%26%238217%3B", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/australians-being-sold-thousands-of-dollars-in-junk-insurance-every-day/story-fnagkbpv-1227440943087?sv=403b7859835da1568b90871a5e3dcaba&title=You%26%238217%3Bre+being+sold+absolute+%26%238216%3Bjunk%26%238217%3B"], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T09:14:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
