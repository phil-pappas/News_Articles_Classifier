Sales also reflect a 4 percent decrease in tire unit volume, primarily driven by a weak economy in Brazil and Venezuela. Replacement tire shipments were down 2 percent. Original equipment unit volume was down 11 percent. \nSecond quarter segment operating income of $43 million was down 27 percent from a year ago primarily due to the impact of inflation on both raw material and conversion costs as well as lower volume, partially offset by favorable price/mix. \nOperating income in Venezuela was $36 million, up $17 million from 2014's second quarter. This operating income excludes foreign currency exchange losses related to the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte, which were $12 million in the quarter and represented a $19 million greater loss versus the second quarter of 2014. The company previously indicated that it expected no earnings contribution from its Venezuelan operations in the second quarter. \nOutlook \nThe company reaffirmed its 2015-2016 financial targets, which include: \n- Segment Operating Income growth of between 10 percent and 15 percent per year; \n- Annual positive Free Cash Flow from Operations and, \n- An Adjusted Debt to EBITDAP ratio of 2.0x to 2.1x. \nShareholder Return Program \nThe company paid a quarterly dividend of 6 cents per share of common stock on June 1, 2015. The Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of 6 cents per share payable September 1, 2015, to shareholders of record on July 31, 2015. \nAs a part of its previously announced $450 million share repurchase program, the company repurchased 1.6 million shares of its common stock for $50 million during the second quarter. \nConference Call \nGoodyear will hold an investor conference call at 9 a.m. today.
