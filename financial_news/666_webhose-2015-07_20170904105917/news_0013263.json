Bill Belden, managing director at Guggenheim Investments , said ladders are making a comeback as yields head higher. \n\"The ladder is basically allocating your assets across a set of maturities or exposures, and then as those exposures mature, you reinvest, redeploying those proceeds into later-dated maturity,\" Belden said. \"So really what it does is get out of the predicting game of what's going to be happening with interest rates, and provides a very constructive and an effective way to allocate fixed-income assets.\" \nGuggenheim enables its investors to create ladders with its BulletShares line of exchange-traded funds which provide defined-maturity exposure through portfolios of either investment-grade or high-yield corporate bonds. \n\"They wed the best aspects of owning a bond ETF or a bond fund with that of owning an individual bond,\" Belden said. \"So when you are seeking to have a very precise exposure across maturity years, you can use the BulletShares or defined-maturity ETFs, which have availability in years between 2015 and 2024 on the investment-grade side, to provide that type of position, and that makes it a lot easier to execute on.\" \nMust Read: 11 Dividend Stocks Buffett, Soros and Other Billionaires Love \nOutside of its bond ETFs, Guggenheim has also done well with its Spin-Off ETF ( CSD ) , which has returned over 76% since its inception in January 2007, compared with a 43% gain in the S&P 500 . \nBelden said the firm had confidence that CSD would outperform due to \"empirical analysis of evidence that supported the fact that companies that are actually spun off from their parents actually outperformed during a particular period of time post-spin off.\" \nFinally, Belden acknowledged that growth has far outperformed value since the financial crisis and said Guggenheim's suite of Pure Style ETFs offer a \"pure\" way to gain exposure to one side or the other. \n\"We offer the tools to be able to allocate to client portfolios and take advantage of that in a very pure way, which contrasts with the typical growth and value exposers, which actually blend with each other,\" Belden said. \"So the purity of the index that these funds really track takes advantage of that outperformance of growth and that's taken place over the course of the past several years, frankly.\" Check Out Our Best Services for Investors \nPortfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.
