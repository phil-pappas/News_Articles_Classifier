There are many vague terms in the text,\" said newly-appointed Labour Minister George Katrougalos.\nHe said the government, elected in January on an anti-austerity platform, would fight for an agreement that was \"socially just\" and dismissed suggestions that it would have to take on the powerful labour unions and risk street protests.\n\"The Left is with demonstrations. The Left wants the people on the streets,\" he said.\nAcceptance of the tough bailout terms marked a turnaround for Tsipras after months of acrimonious talks and a referendum that resoundingly rejected a less stringent deal proposed by the lenders. But opinion polls suggest the prime minister's own popularity remains high.\nA poll published on Saturday in the leftwing Efimerida Ton Syntaknon newspaper suggested Syriza would get 42.5 percent of the vote if an election were held now, almost double conservative New Democracy's 21.5 percent.\nIn addition, 70 percent said they would prefer to accept the bailout deal if it kept Greece in the euro.\nNegotiations on the package are set to begin from next week after parliaments in Germany and other European countries gave their asset and European authorities approved emergency funding that should enable Athens to avoid defaulting on a 3.5 billion euro debt repayment due on Monday.\nThe European Central Bank has also agreed to release 900 million euros in emergency credit next week to the stricken Greek banking sector. But banks remain closed until at least Sunday and it is still unclear whether they will be able to reopen immediately.
