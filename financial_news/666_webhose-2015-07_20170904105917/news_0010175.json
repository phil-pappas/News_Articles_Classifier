Glenn Hunt Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow It's official. The odds are now shorter for me to win the 100-metre sprint at the Rio 2016 Olympics than for Glenn Stevens ' Reserve Bank of Australia board to decide on an interest rate cut at Tuesday's meeting.\nBut as my mother keeps telling me, there's still hope.\nSo what will inform the thinking of the RBA Nine?\nNo points for guessing that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will get a mention.\nRod Clement Cartoon: Rod Clement And no points, either, for guessing how the RBA will respond to this weekend's Hellenic excitement . As always, they will want to wait and see what happens.\nThen there is the plunging dollar, which is doing exactly what the RBA wants it to do. It fell below US75¢ for first time since 2009 . Our holiday plans are now in tatters.\nBut, this being Australia, let's not forget our national obsession: the housing market.\nFresh air-loving Treasury secretary John Fraser – who also sits on the RBA board – has made his thoughts as clear as the Canberra winter sky peeking through the window at his office in Parkes. His assessment is that Sydney is \"unequivocally\" in a house price bubble.\n What about the rest of the country? Well, as fellow RBA director Catherine Tanna could well tell him, it's unequivocally luke warm.\nYep, after almost a year on the market , Tanna's Geoff Parker -designed five-bedder in St Lucia, Brisbane, is still on the market. It was listed in August 2014.\nTanna bought it from former Wallaby Brendan Cannon for $2.77 million it 2009. Seems Cannon, who now works at property outfit CBRE in Brisbane, has this property game worked out.\nWhen we spoke to Tanna's agent Larry McQuie, at McQuie Fine Homes, in January, he told us the now Melbourne-based chief executive of Energy Australia was holding firm for $3 million-plus for the pile.\nThe discreet McQuie wouldn't tell us too much on Monday about the transaction, other than to say there was a buyer \"still circling\", as he said during our chat six months ago.\nNot that we're blaming him. Whatever Fraser might tell you to the contrary, the top end of the Brisbane market remains weak. It's understandable that buyers in strong financial positions, such as Tanna, are holding tight for now.\n\"We're not giving this one away,\" McQuie says.\nThere is hope though. Overseas buyers are flying in to inspect the property this weekend.\nIf only Tanna can get her fellow eight RBA board members onside at Tuesday's meeting.", "external_links": ["http://www.mcquie.com.au/", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow"], "published": "2015-07-06T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T22:07:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
