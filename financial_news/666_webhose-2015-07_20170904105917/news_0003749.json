China Railway Group Ltd., the nation’s biggest construction company by total assets, and China Telecom Corp. slid more than 2 percent. GF Securities Co. led declines among brokerages with a 1.5 percent drop.\nThe H-shares gauge has fallen 9.9 percent in July, making it the worst performer among major global benchmarks tracked by Bloomberg, after Chinese policy makers introduced a spate of measures to prop up equities.\nWhile the measures in China -- allowing more than 1,400 companies to halt trading, banning major shareholders from selling stakes, suspending initial public offerings and giving a government agency access to more than $480 billion of borrowed funds to help finance equity purchases -- have helped support stock prices, critics say intervention undermines the country’s pledge to increase the role of markets in the world’s second-largest economy. International investors have been net sellers of yuan-denominated A shares via the Shanghai-Hong Kong exchange for 11 of the past 12 days.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index was little changed at 4,016.36.
