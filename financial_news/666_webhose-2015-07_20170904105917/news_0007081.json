The jobless rate hit a record high of 27.9 percent in September 2013.\nUnemployment has come down from record highs as the economy stabilised last year after a severe slump, but remains more than double the euro zone's average of 11.1 percent in April.\nGreece's economy contracted by 0.2 percent in the first quarter, dipping back into recession after a fragile recovery last year.\nIt was expected to expand by only 0.5 percent this year based on the latest EU Commission forecasts but the imposition of capital controls and the shuttering of banks is already exerting a marked slowdown in economic activity.
