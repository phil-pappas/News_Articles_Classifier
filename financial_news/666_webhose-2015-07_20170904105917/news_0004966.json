Gabriele Charotte Share on twitter by Kate Cowling SMSF investors are moving into alternative funds in a bid to plump up their income while shielding themselves from global market volatility, asset managers say.\nAMP Capital has seen inflows into its absolute return-style fund increase eight-fold in the 18 months to June 2015, which signifies diversification away from SMSF investors' traditional menu of cash, term deposits and Australian equities, according to AMP Capital's head of SMSF Tim Keegan.\nBlackrock had similarly reported growing interest in its absolute return fund in the last few months, while Perpetual Private sad its clients were asking for strategies to protect income in response to volatility.\nHasan Tevfik, an equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said it was not unexpected for SMSF investors – particularly older ones – to seek income, but that often saw them move up the risk curve into equities rather than going into funds.\nHe said based on Australian Taxation Office data, \"selfies\" still preferred direct equities for their dividends and any shift from that would be in defiance of general trends for the last five to six years.\nBetween June 2009 and March 2015, direct equities as a proportion of SMSF investors' portfolio holdings – defined as primarily Australian equities – increased between 29 per cent and 32.5 per cent, while indirect – defined as funds – dropped from 10.7 per cent to 9.7 per cent, showed Credit Suisse's analysis of ATO data.\n\"The four banks and Telstra have returned 120 to 130 per cent and that's why you've had direct positions come up,\" he said.\nDearth of assets \"Your more important selfies are your ones that are just about to go into retirement, they have the biggest assets under management, in general, they have a lot of wealth elsewhere, so they're willing to take the risk and what they really need is income-producing assets, which there's a dearth of in Australia.\"\nOn the fund side, Mr Keegan said recent flows into its three income producing funds – one focused on commercial property, one absolute return and the third global listed infrastructure – demonstrated a gradual loss of appetite for SMSF investors core asset classes, rather than a direct response to patches of volatility, such as the China sell-off.\n\"We don't see week-to-week or month-to-month significant movements, but what we see over time is this more progressive dance towards income-related investments and diversification away from Aussie equities,\" he said.\nBut Blackrock had seen increased interest in its multi-opportunity, absolute return fund in the last couple of months.\n\"We see certain markets around the globe, a lot of developed markets, looking stretched, [while] bonds are less effective diversifiers because of the ultra-low yields ... The flow on from that is we're receiving interest in absolute return strategies which, by their definition, are looking to produce positive results regardless of their market conditions,\" said James Langlands, Blackrock's head of wealth advisory.\nHe said the appeal of absolute return and long-short strategies had filtered through recently, with the situation in China \"having an impact\".\nIt came as global consultancy firm Towers Watson warned long-term returns for super funds would fall up to two percentage points shy of their long-term target.\nPerpetual Private, an independent manager of high net worth clients, had similarly noticed a trend towards its alternative asset programs, with inquiries from clients about return-protection strategies increasing lately due to global volatility.\nAny time there's market volatility it becomes a discussion point,\" said Jason Komadina, general manager of product and investments for the advisory.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kate_cowling"], "published": "2015-07-21T11:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:03:47.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
