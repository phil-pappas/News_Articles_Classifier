The brands P&G will transfer to Coty account for about $5.9 billion in sales, or about 30 percent of P&G’s $19.5 billion in beauty segment sales for the fiscal year that ended in June 2014. P&G had total annual sales of about $83 billion. Jon Moeller , chief financial officer of P&G, declined to comment on which managers might stay with P&G or depart with the brands that will merge with Coty. “I would comment, though, that I think Coty provides a wonderful home for our brands and our people, and I’m very pleased about that aspect,” Moeller told market analysts during a conference call. “I don’t want to speak for Coty, but I know through every conversation I’ve had with them that they value the people that they’re going to have access to in this transaction and are interested in building further their own capabilities. So I expect this will be a good outcome all the way around. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on any individuals.” Becht told market analysts during a separate conference call on Thursday that webcasts were held that morning to inform Coty and P&G employees of the deal. “We’re going to have a lot of interaction with the management teams on the Procter side as well as on the Coty side,” Becht said. “We’re going to do town hall meetings literally this week and next week.” The next task “is to define the final shape of the organizational structure and then start cascading the staffing process through the two organizations,” Becht said. “So, I would say there is a program in place to make sure that we’re communicating and retaining all the key talent, which is necessary to run this company successfully going forward. … “Ultimately, we’re looking forward for this business to be managed by a strong, well-aligned leadership team from the best talent of the two companies,” Becht said. Coty expects to become the global leader in fragrances and to enhance its position in color cosmetics through the transaction. The P&G businesses involved in the deal include fragrance brands such as Hugo Boss, Dolce & Gabbana and Gucci. Coty’s current brands include Calvin Klein fragrances and Adidas deodorant. The transaction includes P&G’s global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. Some divestitures might be necessary as a result of the merger with Coty, Becht said. “On the fragrance side, a lot of these smaller businesses are really license-type businesses, so I think the bigger question is anything around the regulatory framework, if there are any divestitures taking place,” he said. “I think that’s where the focal point will be from a divestiture point of view.” A.G. Lafley , CEO of Procter & Gamble , said the Coty transaction will help P&G focus on its remaining 65 core brands such as Tide detergent and Pampers diapers. The Coty deal will essentially complete the streamlining that Lafley announced last August, when he said P&G planned to sell, discontinue or consolidate about 100 brands . P&G has 118,000 employees worldwide, including about 11,000 in Greater Cincinnati, but both of those numbers were expected to drop even before the deal with Coty because of the sale of other brands and head count reductions. P&G could have fewer than 100,000 employees by the time the Coty deal closes next year. P&G would prefer to do either a split-off or spin-off as a deal called a reverse Morris trust in which Procter & Gamble shareholders could exchange P&G shares for shares of Coty. P&G shareholders would have the option of exchanging all, some or none of their P&G shares. Those who own P&G stock could avoid taxes on capital gains while diversifying their holdings, and P&G would be able to unload unwanted assets without paying taxes on gains. There will be “no real big benefit to shareholders other than the potential for a tax-free exchange of some shares,” said Lori Hudson , a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in downtown Cincinnati. “No big surprises here – other than it is a very long time till closing of (the) deal,” Hudson told me. “It seems it will be a continued drag on P&G – more focus on getting the deals done than improving the remaining businesses.” Other brands in P&G’s deal with Coty include Max Factor, Wella Professional, Sebastian Professional, Clairol Professional, Sassoon Professional, Nioxin, SP (System Professional), Koleston, Soft Color, Color Charm, Wellaton, Natural Instincts, Nice & Easy, VS Salonist, VS ProSeries Color, Londa/Kadus, Miss Clairol, L’image, Bellady, Blondor, Welloxon, Shockwaves, New Wave, Design, Silvikrin, Wellaflex, Forte, Wella Styling, Wella Trend, Balsam Color, Lacoste, Bruno Banani, Christina Aguilera, Escada, Gabriela Sabatini, James Bond 007, Mexx, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen. \nWant Cincinnati Manufacturing news in your inbox?
