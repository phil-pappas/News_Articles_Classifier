Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe Google shares burst through $US700 for the first time ever on Friday and Facebook rose to an all-time high, propelling the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index to a record. Given the buoyancy in technology stocks, US investors are asking if they should be worried about a bubble building just like before the dotcom crash in March 2000.\nAs several big US companies delivered better-than-expected second-quarter results in the first week of the latest profit reporting season, the 16 per cent surge in Google shares on Friday added a one-day record $US65 billion to the company's market capitalisation. Faceook rode the bullish sentiment up 4.5 per cent to $US94.97, prompting investors to debate if the social media company will soon hit $US100.\nThe rally in Google shares follows an 18 per cent jump on Thursday in the stock price of Netflix, the on-demand internet streaming media company ramping up its international expansion.\nTech stocks are clearly market darlings. So far in 2015, Apple's shares are 18 per cent higher, Facebook's shares have risen 22 per cent, Google's shares are up 28 per cent and those of Netflix have surged 135 per cent.\nPrices certainly look potentially a bit frothy in the publicly-listed market. Apple's market cap is at $US747 billion, Google is now at $US468 billion, Microsoft at $US377 billion, Facebook at $US266 billion, Amazon.com at $US225 billion and Netflix at $US48.7 billion. The private market, where companies such as ride sharing service Uber is eyeing a valuation of $US50 billion, appears even more inflated, analysts say.\n'This is nothing like what we saw' Yet there are sound reasons to believe the boom in tech stocks will not end in tears like the 50 per cent plunge in the Nasdaq 15 years ago.\nScott Kupor, chief operating officer of San Francisco-based venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, says that the market is not in a bubble.\n \"If you're comparing it to '99-2000 for a bubble, then by any metric ... this is nothing like what we saw,\" Kupor said at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference. He says the jump in tech stock prices has been underpinned by earnings growth.\nIn the late 1990s, investors poured money into speculative start ups that were delivering little or no revenue, let alone profit. Today, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are powerhouse businesses, collecting billions in revenue and delivering real multi-billion dollar profits.\nDisruptive technology is reshaping the economy across transport (Uber), hotels (Airbnb), retail (Amazon), movies (Netflix), as well as drones, 3D printing, smart phones, social media, cloud computing and big data analytics.\nRapidly evolving innovation is deeply immersed in how we live and work. But the caution to bear in mind is that just because a company is highly disruptive and damaging incumbents, there is no certainty that it will deliver sustainable profits.\nNetflix and Uber are cutting edge innovators shaking up television and transport.\nNetflix is facing growing competition from copycat products by Amazon, Apple, Comcast, HBO and Sling TV, who are all trialling similar online subscription streaming models. Netflix reported a loss of $US92 million in the June quarter due to the expense of its international footprint, but investors cheered the 3.3 million net subscriber additions.\nUber, the dominant ride sharing firm that has smashed the taxi industry, is being challenged by Lyft and Sidecar.\nSolid earnings reports Back in the public markets, the Nasdaq rose 0.91 per cent to reach an all-time closing high of 5210 on Friday. Over the week, the index jumped 4.3 per cent, the S&P 500 gained 2.4 per cent and the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.8 per cent.\nInvestors took heart from solid range of earnings reports from Bank of America, Citigroup and General Electric. A key reason for Google's surge was attributed to comments from new chief financial officer Ruth Porat, who arrived in May after two decades at Morgan Stanley; she is promising to rein in what some investors have seen as unchecked spending, offering the potential for higher profits.\nMore broadly across world markets, signs that Greece has dodged a Grexit for now also helped stocks this week.\nIn China, the Shanghai Composite Index surged 3.5 per cent on Friday, after the government set up a stabilisation fund to boost the volatile market.\nHealthy US inflation and strong housing construction data published on Friday lent weight to the US Federal Reserve's plan to raise interest rates this year.\nThe US dollar resumed its march against most major currencies. The New York Fed said on Friday the 12 per cent appreciation against a basket of currencies since mid-2014 had shaved economic growth. The Australian dollar had fallen 0.34 per cent to US73.71Â¢ on Saturday morning.\nStill, the focus will remain on US tech stocks in the week ahead with earnings from IBM on Monday, Apple, Microsoft and Yahoo! on Tuesday and then Amazon on Thursday. The Nasdaq may still have room to rise higher.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-07-18T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T03:06:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
