On announcing that Barclays was parting way with Antony Jenkins , its chief executive of the last three years, John McFarlane , who took over as chairman in April, said: \"Arriving at Barclays with a fresh perspective, it is evident that we have a standout brand with first-class retail, commercial and investment banking businesses.” \nThere is no doubt that Bob Diamond, chief executive of Barclays until his ignominious 2012 departure in the wake of the Libor scandal, would have reversed the order. Jenkins never gave the impression he was sure what the order should be. \nIt has been, in fairness to him, a conundrum. \n• The 'death' of British investment banks is nothing of the sort \nThe organisation he inherited was a large global investment bank - accounting for 62pc of underlying pre-tax profit in the first quarter of 2013 - with a much smaller, domestic retail bank bolted on the side (an African operation and Barclaycard completed the eclectic mix). \nBut it was also tainted by the swash-buckling culture Diamond had encouraged and facing a significant slowdown in the activities at which it excelled, like fixed income trading. \nBob Diamond, Jenkins' predecessor as chief executive of Barclays \nA retail banker by training, Jenkins had to make a decision: either completely denounce Diamond’s legacy and cut what had been called Barclays Capital back to the base, or justify the importance of investment banking to the group. He chose a middle way. \nHis first move to dispatch Rich Ricci, the head of the investment bank and one of Diamond’s last remaining lieutenants was decisive. Subsequent moves were less so. \nRicci was replaced by Tom King and Eric Bommensath, who retained their old jobs as, respectively, the head of the investment banking division and the head of markets. At the time Jenkins, using the management speak that became his trademark, said: “Given the importance of corporate and investment banking, I want to de-layer the organisation creating a closer day-to-day relationship and clearer line of sight for myself into the business.” \nJust a year later Barclays named Eric Felder as head of markets, and made Joe McGrath and Richard Taylor the co-heads of banking. All three reported to Bommensath and King the management layer had been added back in. \nRich Ricci, who departed as head of Barclays investment bank soon after Jenkins got the top job \nThen there was Jenkins’ infamous comment in March last year that Barclays would be gripped by a \"death spiral\" unless it paid large bonuses to key staff in the US investment banking operation. This followed the revelation that the investment bank’s bonus pool had increased from £1.4bn to £1.6bn, despite adjusted profits falling 37pc. \nThat may not have been the cleverest thing to say. But really Jenkins was just publicly articulating what many in the City had privately been saying for years bonuses are as much a tool for retaining talent as for rewarding it. \nThe real issue was that Jenkins undermined his own unpalatable logic not two months later: in May last year he announced 7,000 job cuts at the investment bank (around a quarter of the staff in the division) and a big reduction in its balance sheet. \nWhy had Jenkins argued that the bank had to pay top dollar to retain its bankers when it was just about to let so many go? \nMore importantly, it looked like he had left the restructuring too late. The best time to fix the roof is when it’s sunny; Barclays was doing it in the teeth of an investment banking gale. \nLast year the investment bank’s return on equity was just 2.7pc, compared to the 12pc bar that Jenkins had said each part of the bank would have to clear in order to prove its worth. In March this year, Jenkins said he would no longer be “patient” with underperforming parts of the company . The obvious retort was that he had already demonstrated the patience of Job. \nNevertheless, the next chief executive will be able to build on what Jenkins has done. The bank’s reputation has improved albeit slowly. Jenkins was frequently lampooned for constantly banging on about “values” and plastering the bank's premises with vacuous words and phrases . In truth, the justifiable opprobrium that has been heaped on the banking industry made these platitudes a prerequisite. \nThe share price has recovered and outperformed the FTSE 100 over the past three years (though with price to book of around 0.7 investors still think it is worth more less than the sum of its parts). \nAnd if Barclays has been slow to adapt to new banking realities, Deutsche Bank, its long-time European universal banking rival, has been positively glacial - the German bank has a price to book of around 0.5. \nBut the most pressing question for the new chief executive will be the same one that Jenkins grappled with for the last three years and never quite answered: what should Barclays do with its investment bank?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T14:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T14:57:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
