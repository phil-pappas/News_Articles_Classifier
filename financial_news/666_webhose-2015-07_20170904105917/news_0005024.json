They seek not just to give large sums away but also to make sure these gifts are “effective”.\nFunding a guide dog for a blind person in the developed world costs tens of thousands of dollars, while effective altruists point out the same amount could be used to restore sight to hundreds of people in the developing world.\nBut Lise Vesterlund, an economics professor at the University of Pittsburgh in the United States and altruism expert, said it is human nature to give to causes close to home.\n“Many people have a higher desire to help people like themselves,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We settle down on something we feel passionate about.”\nTHE LIFE YOU CAN SAVE\nGiveWell, a “metacharity”, trawls through data to try to find charities which generate “proven, cost-effective and scalable” outcomes.\nIt currently recommends just four: Against Malaria Foundation, GiveDirectly, Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, and Deworm the World Initiative.\nThese charities, alongside a few others, are recommended by Singer’s organisation “The Life You Can Save”.\nDespite the name, he advocates taking quality of life into account as well as simply counting lives saved or extended.\nRemoving parasitic worms, a cheap intervention, is popular with effective altruists for this reason as it was demonstrated that children without parasites stay longer in school, he said.\nGlobally, far more is given to charities which look to cure first world diseases, to those which support the arts, and to emergency appeals, than to the global health charities which Singer and his supporters recommend.\n“Would your loved one really have wanted you particularly to focus on the disease that killed them?” Singer asked. “There are other conditions in the world that are so much more inexpensive to actually deal with.”\nCOMPASSION BEFORE PASSION\nCharity appeals launched for headline-grabbing disasters such as April’s Nepal earthquake or the 2004 Asian tsunami tend to raise far more than appeals to alleviate chronic suffering.\n“There are studies that suggest the money is not as effectively used as it would be if you gave it to one of those organisations that are just quietly there in the background 365 days a year, helping people with ongoing problems,” Singer said.\nFunding for the arts is treated with similar scepticism.\n“The difference between a renovated concert hall and an un-renovated concert hall can’t compare to saving lives.”\nBut furthering the good of humanity with no regard for personal connections is not everyone’s objective, said Vesterlund. “Just as we have different preferences for private goods, we have different preferences for charitable giving as well.”\nSinger recognises his rational, cool-headed approach faces an uphill struggle against the appeals to emotion which usually encourage people to give to charity.\n“It’s true that most people don’t follow the advice that I’m giving, but it’s also true that most people have never heard the advice I’m giving,” he said.\n 15, 2015 9:44 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T17:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T14:35:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
