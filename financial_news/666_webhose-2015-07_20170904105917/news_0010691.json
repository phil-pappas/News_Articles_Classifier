The Nikkei 225 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell 324.63 points to 20,215.16 by the break. \nOn foreign exchange markets, the dollar slipped to 122.63 yen from 123.05 yen on Friday while the euro was also lower at 135.43 yen from 136.31 yen. \nBut the euro held up against the dollar, after dropping in the immediate wake of the vote. It was at $1.1044 in Tokyo trade, ticking up from $1.0963 soon after early results of the bailout reforms vote were out. \nShinya Harui, currency analyst at Nomura Securities in Tokyo, said: \"There is no particular reason for the euro to be holding up, but markets are still assessing the spill-over risks in the case of a Greek exit from the eurozone.\" \nEuropean leaders have reacted with a mix of dismay and caution after Greek voters defied their warnings of a possible Grexit by saying No. \nIn response, jittery investors piled into the yen - a safe haven during times of turmoil - as the Sunday referendum sparked uncertainty about what happens next following months of fruitless talks between Greece and its EU-IMF creditors. \nFinancial spreadbetters predicted the FTSE 100 could open with a drop of as much as 2.1%, or 140 points. \nGermany’s DAX is expected to fall 294 to 328 points, or up to 3%, while France’s CAC 40 was predicted to slip by 134 to 143 points – again a drop of as much as 3%. \nEuropean stock index futures fell sharply, with investors trimming their exposure to riskier assets after the Greek No vote. \nAt 6am on Monday futures for the Euro STOXX 50, Germany's DAX and France's CAC were 2.5 to 3.1% lower. Britain's FTSE futures fell 1.1%. \nMore to follow...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T09:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T10:14:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
