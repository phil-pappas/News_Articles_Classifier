It revitalises the global partnership for development, establishes a strong foundation for implementation of the post-2015 development agenda, and points the way for all stakeholders for smart investments in people and the planet where they are needed, when they are needed and at the scale they are needed.\" \nThe agreement paves the way for the world body to push ahead with its 2015-2030 sustainable development goals, which are due to be formally adopted in New York in September. \nThere are 17 in all, ranging from ending poverty to providing universal access to sustainable energy. \nUnder the agreement, donor nations confirmed they aim to set aside 0.7 percent of gross national income for development aid. \nThe accord also encourages private-public sector cooperation as well as support for developing nations in implementing tax regimes and increasing tax revenues. \nDuring the summit, however, developing nations were forced to abandon their push to create a global tax authority. \nPoorer countries, as part of the 134-member G77 bloc, had been lobbying hard for an end to multinationals' profit shifting, which the UN's trade and development body UNCTAD says costs poorer countries some $100 billion (92 billion euros) a year. \nThey wanted a UN-managed intergovernmental body charged with overseeing a new set of global fiscal regulations to be created, replacing the current set-up where such matters are managed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the so-called \"rich man's club\". \nRicher countries, led by Britain and the United States, were opposed to the plan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T21:47:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
