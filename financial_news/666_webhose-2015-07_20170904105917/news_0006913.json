The Democrat-controlled House may vote later on Wednesday on a one-month emergency budget that Rauner said he will not sign. Instead, Madigan must choose between supporting Rauner's five pro-business and government reform bills or use the super-majority vote of Democrats in the House to pass a tax hike, the governor said.
