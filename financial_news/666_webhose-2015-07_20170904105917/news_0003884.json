Phil Carrick Share on twitter by Ruth Liew Sean Fenton of Tribeca Investment Partners is the top performing Australian shares investment manager of the 2015 financial year after his fund returned 20.5 per cent for the year - blitzing the benchmark S&P/ASX300 's gain of 5.6 per cent.\nTribeca beat more than 130 other funds for the number one spot on Mercer's best performing investment managers for the year ranking - making the Sydney-based investment house the top performer for the second year in a row.\nMr Fenton, portfolio manager of the Tribeca Alpha Plus Fund, said airline Qantas was the biggest contributor to the portfolio. The Alpha Plus Fund, which was launched in 2006, counts the big four banks and telecommunications giant Telstra among its biggest holdings.\n\"Qantas was still probably the biggest contributor for the year helped by improving domestic competition and the weaker oil price,\" Mr Fenton, who is currently travelling in Europe, said.\n\"Weakness in resources and mining services from the China slowdown created opportunities on the short side (Fortescue Metals, Arium Limited), while a stronger US dollar helped cyclicals with offshore exposure (Aristocrat Leisure, CSL Limited). Low interest rates helped asset prices (Macquarie Group and Henderson Group),\" Mr Fenton told Fairfax Media via email.\nAccording to Mercer, Smallco is Australia's second best performing manager after the fund returned 20.1 per cent for the year. The Smallco Broadcap Fund is managed by former Macquarie Bank director Andrew Hokin.\nâ€‹Craig Miller, a portfolio manager who contributes to the running of the fund, said the group had shied away from the resources sector that fell 16. 7 per cent last financial year - a strategy that paid off when others were dragged down by losses in the segment.\n\"It was a bit of a bloodbath with resources - we're fundamentally driven in our approach, and with resources it's difficult to forecast earnings with any great reliability because of commodity prices,\" he said.\nThe biggest contributor to the fund's gains was Sirtex Medical - a manufacturer of liver cancer treatments using small particle technology.\nSmallco invested in the stock when it was valued at $8 in September 2012. The company is now trading at $30.44.\nRounding out the top performing funds are Martin Currie Australian Real Income which also returned 20.1 per cent, Devon Australian Fund at 19 per cent and Bennelong Concentrated Equities at 16.9 per cent.\nThe median returns for an Aussie equities manager for the year hit 7.1 per cent, outperforming the benchmark S&P/ASX300's 5.6 per cent gains.\nAccording to Mercer, Australia's worse performing fund was the LSC Australia Value Equity strategy that lost 5.7 per cent during the year to June.\nPerennial Growth High Conviction Shares lost 4.8 per cent, while Independent AM Australian Equity Core rounded up the three worse performing funds when it lost 4.6 per cent for the 12 months.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-asx-extends-rally-20150715-gicgsf", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/bhp-flags-27-billion-impairment-on-shale-20150715-gickl1.html", "https://twitter.com/Ruth_LiewAFR"], "published": "2015-07-15T10:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T07:03:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
