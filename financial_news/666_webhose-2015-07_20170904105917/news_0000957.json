The brand is evolving to offer more fuel-efficient trucks and crossovers, including the Terrain small SUV and Acadia crossover. GMC's highest-volume vehicle, the Sierra pickup, is the most powerful light-duty pickup on the market, and the first full-size pickup to receive the highest-possible five-star Overall Vehicle Score for safety since the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration changed its New Car Assessment Program for the 2011 model year. http://www.gmc.com/ , on Twitter at @thisisgmc or at http://www.facebook.com/gmc . \nBrian Goebel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T17:32:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
