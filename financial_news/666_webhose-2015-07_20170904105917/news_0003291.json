Corcoran wrote that Wede had developed “strong relationships with our colleagues in banking that have allowed us to build a leading securitised products business.”\nWede arrived at Barclays in 2004 as the bank nabbed a team of five mortgage-bond traders from Citigroup Inc., where he had spent the previous decade. At the time, global lenders were beefing up their capital-markets units in New York with a focus on the booming business to compete with U.S. investment banks such as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos.\nNow, those former rivals are defunct, victims of the financial crisis that mortgage debt helped cause, and non-U.S. banks including Deutsche Bank AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG are retrenching. Barclays is considering deeper job cuts that could see its workforce shrink by about a quarter over the coming years, a person with knowledge of the matter said this week.\nOther Changes Adam Yarnold, who’s headed U.S. securitized-products trading at Barclays, will now oversee the business globally, according to the internal memo. Larry Kravetz, who leads Barclays’s commercial-mortgage bond origination team in the U.S., will report to him.\nRob Taylor will continue to manage Barclays’s municipals business across trading, distribution and banking. Taylor and Yarnold will now report to Art Mbanefo, interim head of equities and credit products, according to the memo.\nBarclays was the seventh-ranked underwriter of worldwide structured-finance transactions in the first half of this year, down from No. 1 in 2010, according to data compiled by Asset-Backed Alert . It’s the third-ranked underwriter in 2015 of so-called collateralized mortgage obligations, which includes government-backed debt that doesn’t get included in the newsletter’s tallies, according to Bloomberg data.", "external_links": ["https://www.abalert.com/\\"], "published": "2015-07-22T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T21:59:52.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
