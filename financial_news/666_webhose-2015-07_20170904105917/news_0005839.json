For the second consecutive quarter, results were weighed down by charges related to GE's decision to sell some $200 billion worth of financial services businesses announced in April. \nExcluding one-time items and the finance businesses that GE plans to exit, the company posted operating earnings of 31 cents per share. That beat analysts' average estimate of 28 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nRevenue rose 1.5 percent to $32.75 billion. For GE's industrial businesses, revenue was $26.9 billion, roughly unchanged from the year-ago quarter as four of seven segments grew. \nSales of GE's power and water unit, which sells a variety of power turbines, rose 8 percent, while its oil and gas segment saw sales dropped 15 percent. Like other suppliers to the energy sector, GE is vulnerable to a sharp slide in oil prices as customers reduce capital expenditures. \nProfit margins for the industrial businesses expanded to 16.2 percent from 15.5 percent a year ago, helped by cost cuts. \nGE expects industrial operating earnings in a range of $1.13 to $1.20 this year, raising the low end from $1.10. \n\"Since the street is at the lower end of this range, we would expect numbers to increase,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe said in a research note. \nThrough Thursday, GE shares had climbed 7 percent so far this year, compared to a 3 percent rise in the S&P 500. \n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Editing by W Simon and Bill Rigby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T16:07:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
