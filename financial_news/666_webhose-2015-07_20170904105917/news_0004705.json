Wayne McAllister/POOL Share on twitter by Joanna Mather Treasurer Joe Hockey has shrugged off the Reserve Bank's call for a review negative gearing , insisting that middle-income earners are the major beneficiaries of the tax break.\n\"More policemen negatively gear than specialised tax accountants, management consultants or university lecturers,\" Mr Hockey said on Thursday.\n\"This is a way for people on medium incomes, or even lower incomes, to be able to get into the property market in a way that they may not be able to.\"\nOn tax reform more generally, Mr Hockey has put the onus on the states to come up with ways to cover the future costs of health and education.\nWhile the federal budget was in deficit, several states were running surpluses and enjoying \"windfall\" revenue from stamp duty, he told the 2UE radio station.\n\"Good luck to them if that's the caseâ€¦but every boom doesn't necessarily last forever so sooner rather than later there is going to have to be state taxation reform,\" he said.\nThe central bank jumped into the debate over how negative gearing and the 50 per cent capital gains tax discount are making housing less affordable.\n\"The bank believes there is a case for reviewing negative gearing but not in isolation,\" the RBA said in a submission to a parliamentary inquiry into home ownership.\n \"It's interaction with other aspects of the tax system should be taken into account.\"\nBusiness leaders including David Murray and Tony Shepherd have questioned the future of negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount.\nBut Mr Hockey said an end to negative gearing would push rent prices up in a number of cities.\nLimiting negative gearing to new houses or a certain number of investment properties are among the changes Labor is reportedly considering.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-07-16T09:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:04:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
