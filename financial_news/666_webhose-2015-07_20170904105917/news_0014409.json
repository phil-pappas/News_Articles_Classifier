The median market forecast was for a reading of plus 22.\nIn an encouraging sign for policy-makers, big firms plan to raise capital expenditure by 9.3 percent in the fiscal year from April, the survey showed, beating a 5.2 percent increase expected by analysts.\nBOJ policymakers will scrutinise the tankan, regarded as among the most comprehensive gauges of the economy given its large sample base, when they meet for a rate review later this month.\nThe tankan's sentiment indexes are derived by subtracting the number of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.
