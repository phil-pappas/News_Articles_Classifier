I don't know how much money I need,\" says Darya, who works in the travel industry.\n\"I still want to maintain a decent standard of living, and I still want to travel while I'm healthy, but I am worried I wouldn't have enough money to do all that I would like to do.\"\nA major obstacle is her mortgage on her condominium.\nWhile she doesn't owe much -- $41,000 -- Darya suspects OAS, CPP and her savings, worth about $190,000, will not be sufficient once retired to make payments and fund her lifestyle.\nSo she continues to work, earning $44,000 a year while contributing CPP income to RRSPs.\nDarya says her retirement account is managed by an adviser who has built a portfolio of mutual funds.\n\"She's got my money in low-risk investments, I think, because she knows that I can't afford to lose too much.\"\nAs for her OAS money, Darya has tax taken off at source and uses the net amount -- about $480 -- to pay down about $7,000 in debt from a recent renovation.\nOn pace to pay off her mortgage -- and hopefully other debts -- in less than six years, Darya would like to retire at about age 70 while her health holds.\n\"I just want someone to give me some guidance,\" she says. \"What will my income look like?\"\nCertified financial planner Mary Ann Kokan-Nyhof with Desjardins Financial Security Investments in Winnipeg says Darya's goal to retire at 70 is workable, but she should definitely pay off her mortgage and other debts first.\n\"She is almost on pace to do that with her current repayment plan, but she will need to step up the mortgage payments a bit.\"\nAs it stands, her mortgage will be paid in five years and seven months. Kokan-Nyhof says Darya would need to increase her monthly payment to about $900 from $670 to have it paid off in four years.\nIncreasing her payments may be a challenge, however, because it appears her monthly expenses of about $3,400 exceed her monthly net income from work, about $3,000.\nGiven her debts are not a result of overspending, it may be she has over-estimated spending. If Darya wants to accelerate her debt repayment, she needs to track her expenses to find the extra cash.\nWhile she will have more money in about two years once her $250 monthly car payments are finished, and her renovation debts are paid off, she's better off budgeting sooner than later because it will only improve her situation by increasing her cash flow to pay off debt faster and further increase savings.\nOf course, Darya can always increase her mortgage payments and adjust spending accordingly. If she comes up short for other needs, she can divert some OAS money from debt repayment or CPP from RRSP contributions.\nYet, both options can have negative consequences to becoming debt-free before retirement, so the best course of action is tracking spending and cutting costs when necessary. Certainly, she can easily pare down some spending now, such as dinners and other entertainment ($225 a month) and clothing and gifts ($300 a month).\nYet Kokan-Nyhof says Darya needs to pay closer attention to other aspects of her finances, too, including her investment portfolio.\n\"Anyone who is looking to retire in the next four years really needs to know what her money is invested in, immediately,\" she says. \"She cannot afford to ignore her asset allocation if she needs to draw money out of her investments, and the market has a downturn, she could find herself eroding capital very quickly.\"\nWhile Darya assumes her investments have a conservative slant, that's not the reality. Her funds are a mix of income-oriented, sector-specific (such as precious metals) and equity funds, including one invested in highly volatile small-cap companies (those with a market value of less than $1 billion).\n\"Some of the funds she listed had a greater than 30 per cent decrease in value in the 2008/2009 crash,\" Kokan-Nyhof says. \"That would mean that if we encounter another severe downturn, her portfolio could potentially be worth $60,000 less right when she needs to take it out.\"\nBecause Darya will rely heavily on investments for income once retired, she should be looking at a portfolio mix of mostly bonds with some equities. But the smaller stock component should lean more to large firms that pay a steady dividend -- not firms that have a smaller growth.\nThen there's the matter of figuring out whether her savings -- asset allocation considerations aside -- are sufficient to meet her spending needs throughout retirement, which could last more than two decades.\nKokan-Nyhof says debt costs excluded, Darya will spend about $2,485 a month or about $30,000 net a year once retired.\nCPP and OAS will make up about one-third of that income. The rest -- about $21,000 -- will come from savings. Indexed at three per cent inflation, Darya would need to achieve about five per cent annualized returns on her investments to fund her expenses for more than just a few years. A balanced portfolio of about 60 to 70 per cent bonds and 30 to 40 per cent equities should do the trick.\nAlthough her current portfolio has achieved double-digit returns in recent years, it is far too risky to consistently return five per cent a year, particularly over a five-year period.\nBut even if she achieves a reasonably conservative rate of return, her money will not last long if she wants to fund her current lifestyle.\n\"She will likely run short of funds by age 83 and will have to live on her government pensions.\"\nWhile Darya can also draw on the equity in her condominium in a pinch -- which can also negatively affect her financial situation, particularly if she needs to move later -- a better strategy would be to cut spending so her money lasts longer.\n\"If she dials back on the vacations, say at age 75, then she can stretch her funds a little longer,\" Kokan-Nyhof says.\nAnd that's not entirely unrealistic, she adds.\n\"Most people don't travel a lot after age 80 due to the higher costs of travel health insurance.\"\njoelschles@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T12:08:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
