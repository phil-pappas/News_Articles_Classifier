Mr Smirk said Asian gasoline supply would increase in the coming months and Australian petrol prices will again be driven by crude oil prices, the value of the Australian dollar and refining margins. \"Westpac is forecasting crude oil prices to track sideways this year, which along with a broadly flat Australian dollar around 72 US cents means crude oil prices should have little impact on Australia petrol prices until crude prices start to rise again in 2016,\" he said. \"Given the above, we do see Australian petrol prices coming down through the rest of 2015 and into 2016 as the refining margin for gasoline narrows to more normal levels.\" ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Petrol+prices+set+to+fall+in+coming+months&c=AUSTRALIAN+petrol+prices+will+fall+over+the+remainder+of+2015+and+into+2016%2C+Westpac+says.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/petrol-prices-set-to-fall-in-coming-months/story-e6frfkur-1227465278880?sv=df45e2a90e1d0e90a872d3973278d640", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/petrol-prices-set-to-fall-in-coming-months/story-e6frfkur-1227465278880?sv=df45e2a90e1d0e90a872d3973278d640&h=Petrol+prices+set+to+fall+in+coming+months", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/petrol-prices-set-to-fall-in-coming-months/story-e6frfkur-1227465278880?sv=df45e2a90e1d0e90a872d3973278d640&title=Petrol+prices+set+to+fall+in+coming+months", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/petrol-prices-set-to-fall-in-coming-months/story-e6frfkur-1227465278880?sv=df45e2a90e1d0e90a872d3973278d640&title=Petrol+prices+set+to+fall+in+coming+months", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/petrol-prices-set-to-fall-in-coming-months/story-e6frfkur-1227465278880?sv=df45e2a90e1d0e90a872d3973278d640", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/petrol-prices-set-to-fall-in-coming-months/story-e6frfkur-1227465278880?sv=df45e2a90e1d0e90a872d3973278d640"], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T14:47:16.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
