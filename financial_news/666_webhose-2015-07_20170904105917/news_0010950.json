In some cases, the illegal construction is unearthed several months after a legal meter has been installed on the illegally constructed network,' he noted. \nApplicants/customers who acquire power supply legally but decide to extend the supply to their neighbours and others without a written authorization would be severely dealt with, same as those who engage in self-reconnection after disconnection. \nNo mercy for defaulters ECG does not disconnect customers for nothing; they may be disconnected for violation of any of the above, debts, safety reasons, default on an agreed payment.' \nOfficials of the company could not provide any factual response when asked about looses incurred by the company over the last couple of years as a result of illegal connections. \nCurrently, ECG puts its revenue leakage at 23.5 percent and plans to reduce it to 21 percent by end of year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T14:15:38.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
