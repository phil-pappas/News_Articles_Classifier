Funds worldwide are holding on to the most cash since the financial crisis of 2008, according to a Bank of America Corp. survey.\nThe level got so high that it triggered a “contrarian buy signal,” the firm said in a note dated July 14. Investors such as Union Investment’s Carsten Hilck remain cautious.\n“I’d still hold on to a bit of cash as a buffer -- just in case,” said Hilck, whose firm manages about 252 billion euros ($274 billion) in Frankfurt. “I don’t think we’ve quite seen the end of these volatile times yet.”\nThe MSCI index of global stocks has moved 0.7 percent on average each day this month, compared with gains or drops of 0.5 percent in the first half of the year. It slumped as 6.5 percent from its record in May through a low on July 8, to then rebound 4.4 percent through Thursday. It was little changed on Friday.\nAmong the concerns: Greece faces hurdles to winning financial aid, the Federal Reserve is on track to raise rates this year, and hedge-fund managers Paul Singer, Bill Ackman and Jeffrey Gundlach are among those warning of global consequences from China’s equity rout. The International Monetary Fund trimmed its outlook on worldwide economic expansion this month.\nBe Careful “Global growth is not accelerating, China is definitely not out of the woods, we have the Fed rate hiking cycle coming up, and the Grexit issue was only kicked a little further down the road,” said Ralf Zimmermann, an equity strategist at Bankhaus Lampe KG in Dusseldorf. “Investors should be careful after the strong rebound because the risks are more to the downside.”\nNot everyone is afraid of stock swings, and the declines can offer bargains for those willing to take the risk. Harris Associates’ David Herro, one of the biggest U.S. owners of European shares, said last week he’s buying up stock in companies such as BMW AG and BNP Paribas SA at attractive prices.\n“Volatility is here to stay, and investors should get used to it,” Stephanie Flanders, the London-based chief market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said at a presentation on Wednesday. “The ride is only going to get bumpier. But some volatility is healthier than none at all.”\nCash Piles Fund managers increased cash levels to 5.5 percent from 4.9 percent in June, according to the Bank of America survey conducted between July 2 and July 9. They cut the proportion of funds in European equities, emerging markets and Japan this month.\nLampe Asset Management started to raise cash this week, selling European stocks after buying them cheaply a few weeks ago, according to Michael Woischneck, an equity manager who helps oversee 6.2 billion euros at the firm. The Euro Stoxx 50 Index trades at 15.8 times estimated profits of its members, up from a low of 14.1 on July 7.\n“The rebound we’ve seen has been quite impressive,” Woischneck said from Dusseldorf. “Only a very strong earnings season or a surprise from a central bank can move markets much higher from here.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T17:00:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
