As a result, it is hard to mitigate the measure’s impact, it said. At 26pc, the hospitality sector has the highest proportion of jobs paying the minimum wage. However, Geof Collyer, of Deutsche Bank, believes it will affect some companies more than others. \nThe bank said Greene King (LSE: GNK.L - news ) is best placed, having just completed an acquisition of pub group Spirit . Analysts believe this acquisiton will “provide Greene King with a lot of hidden upside potential to offset much of the extra burden” from the additional labour costs. * The faulty logic behind George Osborne’s living wage The bank doesn’t look as favourably on Greene King’s peers, stating the profits of Mitchells & Butlers (LSE: MAB.L - news ) and JD Wetherspoon could be negatively impacted by as much as 25pc. \nDeutsche Bank downgraded Mitchells & Butlers from “buy” to “hold”, reflecting the medium-term pressure on cash flows in light of the new minimum wage. Numis also downgraded the mid-cap pub group for the same reason, and reckons only a quarter of labour costs are because of over-25s. \nDouglas Jack, of Numis, says JD Wetherspoon is the only quoted company to have labour costs that are smaller than the costs of sales. The company currently pays staff at an hourly rate of £7 on average, and on August 3 it will increase its hourly pay rate by 8pc. The broker downgraded the company’s earnings forecasts for next year, as it expects the pub group “to struggle to pass higher labour costs on to its price-sensitive customer base”. \nMeanwhile, Numis believes The Restaurant Group could incur an extra £3m of labour costs annually. Mr Jack reckons a third of the group’s employees are on the minimum wage, with half of these over 25. \nMitchells & Butlers fell towards the bottom of the mid-cap index, dropping 14.4p, or 3.4pc to 407.8p; JD Wetherspoon edged 1p lower to 705p; and Greene King finished 5p down at 856p. The Restaurant Group shaved 5p off its share price to close at 687p. \nIn the wider market, Britain’s benchmark index advanced after the Greek parliament approved stringent measures to meet bail-out conditions. The FTSE 100 added 42.70 points to close at 6,796.45. * Greek banks to open for first time in three weeks as Mario Draghi provides lifeline Elsewhere, Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) released a bearish note on oil. Analysts warned investors the “heat is on” as we move towards second-quarter results, which will provide the latest view of industry resolve and business plans. Alastair Syme, of Citigroup, expects oil companies to continue to reduce spending. \nBP took the biggest hit after Citigroup slashed its price target from 450p to 435p. The bank highlighted the oil giant’s lack of organic growth, which they believe is a constraint on future capital returns. While its recent settlement over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010 should draw a line under most of the outstanding Macondo litigation, Mr Syme warned fines and penalties could escalate above their forecasts. The stock fell 5.1p to 422p. \nBG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) failed to escape Citigroup’s round of downgrades, and its price target was cut to £12.63 from £13.40. However, the bank reckons Royal Dutch Shell’s potential takeover of the group will be completed, citing a relatively low level of risk that regulatory approvals will not be obtained. The stock finished 1p in the red at £10.76. \nAfter falling sharply on Wednesday, following a slowdown in revenue growth in the first quarter , Burberry made gains, despite UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) lowering its price target by £1 to £17. \nRevenue growth has been hit by a deterioration in the Hong Kong market, which accounts for 10pc of sales. However, Fred Speirs, of UBS, still sees “several specific opportunities in mainland China which could still help the business to outperform peers”. \nThe UBS note comes as the results of Burberry’s annual general meeting yesterday showed that 7.7pc of shareholders voted against its directors’ remuneration report. Last year, chief executive Christopher Bailey received a pay packet of £7.9m. The stock inched 5p higher to £15.83. \nMeanwhile, despite warning that it would write off around $4bn in the first half of the year, owing to a slide in iron ore and coal prices, Anglo American advanced 15.9p, or 1.8pc, to 890.3p. While, the FTSE 100 miner described its second-quarter production performance as “broadly in line” with their expectations, Alison Turner, of Panmure Gordon, said it was “mixed, with a bright point from coal offset by lower than expected iron ore”. * Miners dividends face the axe as metal prices tumble Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) climbed 25.5p, or 1pc, to £26.23 after recording a 9pc higher iron ore output than the previous year - in line with analysts’ expectations. However, Hunter Hillcoat, of Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) , expects next year’s results to be a low point in the FTSE 100 company. \nAmong the risers, Dixons Carphone (LSE: DC.L - news ) powered 6.7p, or 1.5pc, ahead to 468.2p, after reporting full-year pre-tax profit of £375m , a 21pc increase on the previous year. David Jeary, of Canaccord Genuity (Other OTC: CCORF - news ) , believes the company, which was created last year through the merger of Dixons and mobile phone firm Carphone Warehouse, is making good progress. \nMr Jeary, also pointed to the recent announcement on a joint venture to develop stores for the network operator Sprint in the US, saying “it is a very good pointer to the sales and profit potential”. \nFinally, Aim-listed Sound Oil (LSE: SOU.L - news ) made gains of 1.4pc to 18.25p after announcing that it had been awarded a production concession for Casa Tonetto from the Italian ministry of economic development - the final step to enable commercial production from the onshore well in its Nervesa gas project.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T22:39:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
