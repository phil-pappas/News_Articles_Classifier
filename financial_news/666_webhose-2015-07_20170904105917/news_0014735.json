You cannot have the vehicles of an organisation having 1,000 PSVs suspended as a result of just one. That is not how justice works,\" he said. \nHe stated anyone who breaks the law will carry their own cross as they will be dealt with individually by both the government and their SACCO. \n\"We have talked with the Transport Principal Secretary and we have agreed that together with the government, we will punish any driver or conductor found breaking the law. We have also embarked on a two week sensitisation exercise to ensure that everyone is aware of the rules and regulations governing road use,\" he stated. \nThe strike was called following the suspension of the license of Embassava SACCO which operates in Eastlands after one of its vehicles was involved in an accident which left two people dead. \nAccording to the National Transport and Safety Authority, the Embassava bus driver was to blame for the road crash after failing to obey traffic lights at the junctions of Jogoo and Rabai Roads. \nThe ban created a transport crisis for commuters from most parts of Nairobi's Eastlands since the affected SACCO has a large fleet of commuter vehicles. \nAccording to MWA, the suspension was an abuse of their rights. \nAccording to the NTSA, any transport operator who contravenes Public Service Vehicle (PSV) regulations will be suspended until they comply with all the conditions. \nThe authority said that after the crash, Embassava SACCO was asked to produce a formal response to an audit checklist and documentation of their operations. \nThe SACCO was found to have failed to comply with regulations, including failing to employ drivers.
