In the seventh block, it saw the figure at between 83 and 88 percent of profits. \nThe government take is the sum total of the contract's fiscal terms, including a variable royalty, income tax, surface rental fee and the percentage of pre-tax profits. \nThe energy ministry said previously that at least 30 percent, or five contract awards, of the 14 would be a success. Blocks not awarded can be tendered again at a later date. \nZepeda said it would take up to two days to verify the required financial guarantees for the winning consortium. \nThe initial phase of the so-called round one tender, the first of five phases expected to auction a total of 169 oil and gas fields, comes at a time of depressed international crude prices and a decade-long fall in Mexican output. \nA total of 34 companies, either in consortia or alone, pre-qualified for the first set of 14 shallow water production-sharing contracts, including U.S.-based majors ExxonMobil and Chevron. \nBut only nine bidders registered for the first phase. \nDeputy Energy Minister Lourdes Melgar said international oil prices and weak growth forecasts had made firms more \"selective.\" But she expected more interest in later rounds. \nThe 14 contracts were for areas with nearly 3.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in proven, probable and possible (3P) reserves thanks to prior drilling by state oil firm Pemex. \nMexico has historically relied on crude oil revenues to fund about a third of the federal government budget. But slumping oil prices, down by about half since last summer, cut the government's take to about 15 percent in the first quarter. \nThe auction was the first test of Pena Nieto's sweeping oil sector overhaul finalized by Congress last year. \nThe reform aims to lure billions of dollars in investment into a domestic industry long dominated by Pemex, which saw its 75-year monopoly on exploration and production end in 2013. \nThe government estimates investment from each of the two awarded contracts will total $1.3 billion per block, with 80 percent coming in the first five years of the 25 year contracts.
