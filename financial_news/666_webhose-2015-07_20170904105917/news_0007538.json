Despite being a team of mostly peripheral and unremarkable players, they overcame France and hosts Portugal (twice) to lift the trophy. Even hard-core soccer fans would be unable to name more than two players on that Greek squad, yet few will forget the remarkable collective achievement of a team that beat the odds of 150-to-1 for winning the trophy.\nWhat allows a team of B players to achieve A-team success? A great deal of scientific evidence suggests that the key determinants are psychological factors - in particular, the leader's ability to inspire trust, make decisions and create a culture where individual agendas are eclipsed by the group's goal. This is true for all teams, but if you're leading a team of B players (people who are second-best in terms of competence, talent or potential), you have to be an A-class leader; otherwise, your team will have no chance.\nEffective leaders tend to share some common characteristics. First, they have better judgment than their counterparts, meaning they can make good decisions and learn from experience. Second, they have higher emotional intelligence, which enables them to stay calm under pressure, build close and meaningful relationships with their teams and remain humble even in the face of victory. Third, they tend to have very high levels of ambition, remaining slightly dissatisfied with their success; this is why they stay hungry and continue to work hard, as opposed to getting complacent.\nAdditonally, four important tactics can help leaders make their teams more effective:\nAdvertisement 1. Vision Turning B players into an A team requires a strategy that represents a meaningful - and attainable - mission for the team. With A players, you might get by with a hazy picture of the future or a goal that shifts over time. For less-than-A players, you need to ensure that your goal is clearly defined. It should stretch them without demoralizing them by seeming unattainable. And it should include a plan of attack - milestones and tactics that allow the team to figure out their next steps.\n2. Analytics No matter how smart and experienced leaders are, they will make better decisions if they are armed with data. Data can cut through the biases and politics and create a culture of fairness and transparency. It can also highlight the key individual drivers of team performance, breaking down success into factors that can be easily manipulated. Intuition is still needed to translate data-driven information into useful knowledge, and there are many problems that data won't solve. But a team with better monitoring systems for quantifying performance will always have an edge, and the power of feedback will always depend on the accuracy of the analytics.\n3. Feedback Studies have shown that individual and team feedback improves performance by around 25 per cent - a margin substantial enough to let less-skilled teams who get a lot of feedback outperform better teams that aren't getting feedback. Why is feedback so important? Because it allows both individuals and teams to regulate their efforts.\nOf course, feedback is also essential to correcting mistakes and getting better, and leaders who fail to provide it risk coming across as indifferent to the team's welfare and performance. When you have a team of B players, it is important to be honest with them about their limitations. Instead of making them think that they are better than they actually are, tell them they will need to work hard to close the talent gap between them and their rivals.\n4. Morale Leaders own the job of creating engagement. Although individual engagement is critical, team morale is the key. You might have a team of B players, but when they share common values and motivations, they will raise each others' performance levels. This may seem like common sense, but too many managers are so focused on managing processes and attending to the formal aspects of task performance that they forget to build an engaging culture. In addition, when leaders are interested mostly in their own career, and success is not defined in terms of their team's performance, they tend to neglect and eventually alienate their teams.\nAsked the secret of his team's success, Greece's soccer coach Otto Rehhagel explained that it was mostly about his relationship with the players: \"I cherish them, I hold them in the highest esteem. I know what makes these boys tick. I don't lead by committee. I take the responsibility for my choices.\"\nTomas Chamorro-Premuzic is the chief executive of Hogan Assessment Systems and a professor of business psychology at University College London.\nÂ© 2015 Harvard Business School Publishing Corp.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T05:10:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
