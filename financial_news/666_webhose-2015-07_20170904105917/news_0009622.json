Barry Smith Share on twitter by Michael Smith A battle-scarred Virgin Australia is taking longer to recover from its domestic dog-fight than rival Qantas Airways. The airline's $49 million full-year loss is ugly compared to the nearly $1 billion profit Qantas will make in the same period but it is heading in the right direction.\nQantas will seize on the starkly contrasting financial performance of the two bitter rivals in the 2015 financial year to question chief John Borghetti's four-year strategy to transform struggling low-cost airline Virgin Blue into a full-service carrier.\nThe latest airline earning results and the slow pace of Virgin's return to profitability will put the spotlight back on to Borghetti's strategy. This has enabled Virgin to eat into Qantas' coveted share of the prized corporate market and inject serious competition into the domestic aviation market for the first time since Ansett's collapse in 2001.\nIt has come at a price for both airlines and requires more context than one year's earnings figures.\nIt was a different story this time in 2014, when Qantas posted a $646 million pre-tax loss and a record bottom-line loss of $2.84 billion. Virgin wasn't faring much better, posting a $212 million underlying pre-tax loss and a $356 million bottom-line loss.\nThe pressure was on Qantas boss Alan Joyce at the time, letting Virgin largely fly under the radar.\nQantas has since staged one of the most spectacular turnarounds in corporate history, helped by a deep cost-cutting program, lower depreciation charges and the same factors that are helping Virgin, such as a lower fuel bill and the end of the capacity war.\nIt is now Borghetti's turn to demonstrate he can return Virgin to sustainable profitability. Virgin has not had the same sudden bounce back into the black, but its fourth-quarter numbers out on Wednesday confirm it will be profitable in the 2016 financial year. This is of course barring any unexpected problems, which are not uncommon in aviation.\n The airline's fourth-quarter numbers, released on Wednesday ahead of next week's full-year results, mean the full-year pre-tax loss of $49 million was better than the $60 million loss analysts had been forecasting. While the market will be holding back any judgment until it can see more details next week, not all the report cards were positive.\nWhile Virgin's domestic yields have improved substantially, its international operations are under-performing and holding back the recovery. Borghetti will make some announcements next week on how he plans to address that and Virgin is widely tipped to start putting Tiger planes on some short-haul international routes to leisure destinations like Fiji.\nSome analysts are also questioning the 2 per cent in capacity added in the fourth quarter, although Virgin says this is because of the length of flights rather than the actual number of available seats. Citi analyst Anthony Moulder says Virgin increased capacity in the domestic market by 1.6 per cent in the first half of the 2015 financial year, compared to a 4.8 per cent reduction by Qantas in the five months to May.\n\"While a lower load factor is a positive for the longer-term growth in yields, we would prefer to see better capacity management,\" Moulder says. Falling fuel prices and cost cuts are also driving the recovery at both airlines but Moulder says the pace of cost reduction at Virgin is slower than expected.\nComparing the turnaround at Virgin and Qantas is fraught with difficulty, depending on what spin you put on the numbers. Qantas is 3.5 times the size of Virgin so its numbers, when it is on a winning streak, look more spectacular.\nAlthough Qantas and Virgin will be nit-picking over each other's performance in coming weeks, the reality is that conditions are improving for both of them.\nThe consumer environment in Australia is still sluggish, though, and both airlines are partly relying on cost-cutting and lower fuel bills to improve domestic performance. The falling Australian dollar should help both domestic carriers if it results in an increase in inbound tourism, but they will take a while to play out as passengers usually book flights months ahead.\nBorghetti will be under pressure to deliver in this financial year. Analysts expect Virgin to post a $151 million pre-tax profit. Qantas' earnings are tipped to hit $1.6 billion in the same period, Bloomberg says.\nThe former Qantas senior executive answers to his big airline stakeholders – Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines and Etihad – who all have an interest in ensuring the airline has a strong future.\nAir New Zealand is the only shareholder that has publicly grumbled about Virgin's financial performance. Borghetti was not impressed when chief executive Christopher Luxon said earlier that it was time for Virgin to turn a profit, but he has been quiet on the issue since then.\nKathmandu update due Kathmandu is expected to release a long-awaited update on its financial performance as part of its response to unwanted advances from Rod Duke's Briscoe Group by the end of next week.\nConcerns about Kathmandu's earnings outlook has been working in Duke's favour as he does the rounds with the target company's shareholders trying to sell his deal. There are mixed reports on how this is being received though, with some Australian investors still wanting more details about his strategy for the combined group before agreeing to accept stock in a company they don't know a lot about.\nA trawl back through the broker research on Kathmandu shows that Goldman Sachs analysts shared Duke's concerns about the target company's medium-term prospects.\nThis is interesting because Goldman Sachs are now advising on Kathmandu's defence. As you would expect under the so-called Chinese walls rules that exist between research teams and investment bankers, the bank's analysts have since ceased coverage on the company.\nGoldman Sachs downgraded the company from a buy to a neutral in February. As recently as July 1, analysts highlighted a \"relatively high level of uncertainty over Kathmandu's medium-term earnings outlook\".\nAnother blow to coal industry Peabody Energy Corp's decision to cut Australian coal production is the latest blow to an industry fighting for survival.\nJust about every coal asset in Australia is for sale at the right price but no one is prepared to stump up with the prices the sellers have in mind.\nThis is not a normal cyclical downturn but is being driven by permanent change in the way the world sources its power.\nCoal is on the nose in the United States because of the availability of cheap natural gas, China has pledged to cut coal use and focus more on renewables, while tougher emission standards are forcing down prices.\nPeabody, which put its Australian assets on the block earlier in 2015, said overnight it was cutting the production of metallurgical coal in Australia by 3 million tonnes a year. Chief executive Glenn Kellow told a conference call the industry faced \"difficult and indeed unprecedented times\".\nLike iron ore miners, coal producers are working towards a lower cost-base and praying for a price recovery in coming years.\nPeabody's performance highlights again the awful timing of its $4.9 billion Macarthur Coal acquisition in 2011, at the peak of the coal boom.\nBloomberg notes that coal bond prices fell 17 per cent in the second quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of price declines. The decline is even more unusual, given that bond markets usually fluctuate less than stocks.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR\nMatthew Stevens is on leave", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-07-29T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T04:43:41.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
