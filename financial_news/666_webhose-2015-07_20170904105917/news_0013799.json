Many in the market were optimistic, although there was a degree of caution about holding large bets going into the weekend.\n\"Should Greece find a momentary fit to its budgetary problems and stay in the euro zone, it would peel away a thick layer of uncertainty for the euro,\" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.\n\"The problem, though, is that it would expose a fundamental wound for the euro, the bloc's weak economy which remains in need of the ECB's strong policies of rock-bottom interest rates.\"\nThe euro climbed to a one-week high against the yen of 137.27 yen and was last at 136.99, up 2.4 percent. The euro zone common currency was on track for its largest one-day gain since April 2013.\nAgainst the dollar, the euro was up 1.2 percent at $1.1167 as Athens sent a proposal for reforms to its creditors. . It hit a one-week high of $1.1215 and was on pace for its best daily performance in a month.\n\"I am really not sure how far this Greek-inspired rally will last. Maybe we get to $1.14-$1.15, but given liquidity is getting thinner as we move into the summer holidays, there is a risk of overshooting,\" said Ian Gunner, portfolio manager at Altana Hard Currency Fund.\nAlso helping risk sentiment were signs Chinese equities may have stabilized after their recent 30 percent fall. Shanghai shares rallied for a second straight day, helped by emergency steps from the government to halt their dive.\nThe yen retreated, allowing the greenback to rise above 122 yen from a seven-week low mid-week. The dollar was last up more than 1 percent at 122.60.\nIn addition to China and Greece, a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on the U.S. economic outlook at 1630 GMT will be a major focal point.
