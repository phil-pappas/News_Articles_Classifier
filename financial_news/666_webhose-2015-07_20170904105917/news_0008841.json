The decline was its biggest single-day drop since February 2007, according to Bloomberg News. \n\"China is the world?s second biggest economy and is plumbed into the world?s capital markets, so when there is trouble there you can expect some impact abroad,\" agreed analyst Laith Khalaf at brokerage Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) . \nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong tanked 3.09 percent, Tokyo declined 0.95 percent and Seoul gave up 0.35 percent, but Sydney added 0.43 percent. \n\"The variety of reasons why this latest Chinese plunge has had such an effect on the markets captures the reasons why China itself is such a huge, and worrying, figure in the macro-economic landscape,\" added Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell. \n- Dollar week before Fed - \nThe dollar meanwhile remained weak after a disappointing read on the US housing market, as investors await the US Federal Reserve's next monetary policy decision due Wednesday. \nIn foreign exchange activity in London on Monday, the European single currency rose to $1.1067 from $1.0977 late in New York on Friday. \nWhile the Fed is not expected to raise rates this week, dealers are hoping for some forward guidance, with most analysts tipping a hike in either September or December. \nBack in London on Monday, British publisher Pearson (Xetra: 858266 - news ) topped the fallers after revealing Saturday (Shenzhen: 002291.SZ - news ) that it was in talks to sell its 50-percent share in The Economist Group. \nThe announcement comes just two days after Pearson agreed to sell the Financial Times to Japanese media group Nikkei for £844 million ($1.3 billion, 1.2 billion euros), saying that it wanted to focus solely on the education publishing sector which accounts for most of its business. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) tumbled 3.53 percent to 1,176 pence in midday London trade. \nOn the upside, household goods firm Reckitt Benckiser (Xetra: A0M1W6 - news ) rose as rising revenues and a brighter outlook eclipsed news of sliding first-half net profit. \nReckitt, which produces Durex condoms, household cleaner Cillit Bang, and Nurofen pain relief tablets, saw its share price gain 2.81 percent to 6,074 pence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T14:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T14:37:59.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
