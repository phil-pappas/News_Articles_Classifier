Fortescue Metals Group, a distant third, was 5 percent lower. \nAnalysts do not expect Australian miners, or the world's top supplier, Vale of Brazil, to slow their shipments to China given low costs, spelling trouble for smaller producers struggling to stay afloat. \nChina's state planner said on Friday it will allow 400,000-deadweight tonne ships to dock at its ports, officially lifting a more than three-year ban that had effectively shut out Vale's giant vessels. \nMeanwhile, China's steel production is also forecast to contract in 2015 and 2016 as the seaborne supply of iron ore increases. \nThese factors are tipped by Australia's Department of Industry and Science to drive the price of iron ore down to an average $54 a tonne this year and $52 in 2016. \nSmall supply adjustments, such as ones underway by BHP and Atlas Iron are also unlikely to have much impact in returning prices anywhere close to the $200 fetched four years ago. \n\"The industry's cycles have caught some unprepared and others looking for answers,\" Rio Tinto Chief Executive Sam Walsh told a London business group this week. \nA slowing Chinese economy has hit industrial demand with steel consumption continuing to shrink in the first half after contracting in 2014 for the first time in more than three decades.
