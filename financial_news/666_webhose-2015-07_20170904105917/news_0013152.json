We will find the necessary instruments,\" Coeure said at an economics conference in Aix-en-Provence, southern France. \n\"Our will to act in this matter should not be doubted.\" \nSergio Capaldi, fixed income strategist at Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo, said he expected the ECB to try to reassure markets and reduce volatility. \"They will show their muscle to the markets.\" \nCapaldi reckoned peripheral bond yield premia over German bunds would widen, with Italy's spread widening by 10-15 basis points to between 150 and 160 bps. \nBarclays strategists were gloomier, seeing a move out in Italian spreads to as wide as 200 basis points. \nGary Jenkins, chief credit strategist at ING Capital, said: \"Unless there is a pre-market announcement by the ECB I expect the market to be in turmoil.\" \nEuro equity markets too, which had one of their worst weeks of 2015 last week, were set for another selloff. \n\"The ECB has the capacity to limit the spread of contagion. But we might still see a fall of 3 percent on European markets on Monday,\" said Antonin Jullier, head of equity trading strategy at Citi. \nAsked whether there would be a big market hit come Monday, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, said: \"Yes, you will see one. With the extent and duration a function of whether the ECB steps in with new anti-contagion measures.\" \nCONTINGENCY PLANNING \nEuropean banks went over contingency plans and drafted in extra staff on Sunday, paving the way for large swings when markets open. \nEurope's financial firms have been preparing for a possible Greek exit from the euro zone for three years and, having drastically cut their exposure to the country, believe they are well shielded from the fallout from the weekend vote. \n\"We've been preparing for years and there's nothing more you can do. We just have to see what happens,\" said one banker from a large euro zone bank. \nForeign exchange traders at Barclays were in the office from Sunday afternoon to follow developments, and research and sales staff were monitoring the Greek referendum over the weekend, a spokesman for the bank said. \nDeutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) said it was prepared for any market volatility. \n\"We have adjusted our processes and procedures to take into account the new situation, which we continue to monitor, ensuring the continuity of business operations and client services,\" the bank said in an emailed statement.
