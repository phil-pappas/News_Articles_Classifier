Almost,\" she says. \n= 06.55 = \nOvernight Tsipras has gone into huddles with Hollande, Tusk and Merkel four times, in breaks of the meeting with the full 19. \nA major sticking point has been the German demand that Greek puts 50 billion euros of state assets into an offshore trust for privatisation - a move some are calling looting. It is certainly humiliating. Tsipras is insisting he has no right to sell his half his country, EU officials say. \n“What’s happening to Greece at the negotiations is waterboarding,” Nikos Filis, the parliamentary spokesman for the governing Syriza party, said in an interview with ANT1 TV. \n= 06.32 = \nMiro Cerar, the Slovenian PM, leaves as he must meet Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato chief, back home. \nThere is \"one open issue left\", he says. The sticking points of the night were the role of the IMF, and whether Greek assets could be placed in an offshore fund ahead of privatisation. He has deputised Dutch PM Rutte on his behalf. \n= 05.58 = \nAn update from Matthew Holehouse in Brussels: \n\"After 14 hours the meeting of the Eurozone, the result remains uncertain,\" tweets Cyprus government spokesman Nikos Christodoulides. They are going to yet another break. \nAsian markets have risen, while the euro is marginally lower, as talks stretch into the morning. Shanghai continued its recovery from weeks of wild volatility as several firms returned to trading while China released mixed data showing a pick-up in export growth but two-way trade sinking in the first half of the year. \nTokyo was up 1.50 percent in the afternoon, Sydney gained 0.64 percent and Seoul put on 1.25 percent. \nBy lunch Shanghai had climbed 2.28 percent and Hong Kong added 0.22 percent. \nIt's now 7AM in Brussels, and European leaders are still upstairs. The sticking point is the humiliating German proposal to put 50 billion euros of Greek assets into an offshore fund while they are sold off. \n= 04.34 = \nFormer acting head of the IMF's Europe division not taking the news well \n= 04.26 = \nOne of the reasons we might be waiting a while longer yet \n= 04.19 = \n= A revolt is brewing in the press room = \nThis probably won't be enough to get them to hurry up, but Matthew Holehouse in Brussels reports his fellow tired and weary hacks have resorted to banging their desks in sleep-deprived frustration. \n*bang bang bang* \n= 04.14 = \nA Greek official has also confirmed tonight's two outsanding issues: the level of IMF invovement in a new Greek package, and the proposal to set up a private fund of Greek assets worth €50bn. \n= 04.05 = \n= Greeks want smaller IMF role = \nThe IMF's current Greek bail-out ends in March 2016. Athens doesn't want the Fund involved in a third rescue package, presumably because of its determination to extract structural reforms from the country. However, IMF involvement is a must-have for the Germans in particular. \nAnd thus the fight goes on \n= 03.46 = \n= Compromise needed for banks to stay afloat = \nA flash from the MNI wire which suggests \"compromise\" is needed to allow the ECB to continue supporting Greek banks. This suggests that the banks will need more ELA to stay solvent past Monday. The central bank is due to make its latest decision on emergency funding this morning. \nMore talks that a \"compromise\" is now ready to be tabled... \n= 03.40 = \n= 03.33 = \n= Two issues yet to be resolved: the IMF and an external asset fund = \nIt's 4.30am in Brussels, the summit is back underway, and there are two outstanding issues yet to be resolved, according to Cypriot government spokesman Nikos Christodoulides. \nAnd it seems like we have our answer: the sticking points remain keeping the IMF involved until after March 2016 and plans for a private asset fund to pay off Greek debt. It seems the Greeks don't want it to be as large as €50bn and certainly don't want the fund based in Luxembourg... \n= 03.17 = \nI don't want to curse this but... \n*Update: cursed it \nAt least I wasn't the only one \n= 03.07 = \n= 03.04 = \n= Where's Juncker? = \nThe bored Brussels press corp has started a new game: find Jean-Claude Juncker. Where is the Commission chief? Le Soir's Jurek Kuczkiewicz say's he's totally \"disappeared\". \n= 03.00 = \n= On banks and bail-ins = \nI've been reading more of that Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) notes on the Greek banking system, because quite frankly, there's nothing else to do. \nBut, they raise a very interesting point about the prospect of a bail-in for Greek bank depositors. The last time eurozone depositors lost their money through a near-banking collapse was back in Cyprus in 2013, when depositors over €100,000 took haircut. \nhe Greek government has naturally maintained that there is no danger of people losing their money should they keep it in the banks. However, Barclays note that in the event that banks do need full scale recapitalisation and resolution, \" a bail-in of unsecured liabilities remain a big risk.\" \nThey go on to say that in the event that depositors take a haircut, the insurance scheme is also unlikely to extend to €100,000. \nFrom Barclays: \nTypically, if a bank fails, national deposit insurance schemes exist to support the repayment of deposits up to €100k in the euro area. These schemes are funded by annual contributions made by the banks in that country and in Greece we understand that there is a little over €4bn in the national insurance scheme clearly not enough to make all small depositors whole.\" \nAnd, in the worst worst case scenario, should there be no means of recapitalisation or bank resolution, the government would have to start printing a new drachma: \nIn the event Greece leaves the EMU and external assistance is not available to the banks and they are unable to meet recapitalisation needs with existing resources, we would assume that Greece could print its own money and inject capital in its new currency. \n= 02.29 = \n= 02.23 = \n= The parlous state of Greek banks = \nA very useful note from Barclays this morning on the state of the Greek banking system. They note that even if a deal is struck, the financial system is in need of serious recapitalisation. \nWe already know that capital controls are here to say for another two months at least, and Barclays estimate banks have lost nearly 25pc of their total deposits since 2014. These outflows have placed serious stress on their liquidity position. They expect the ECB will choose to keep ELA at its current level on Monday. \nFrom Barclays: \nWhile the current collateral buffer (which we estimate at around €15bn) should allow Greek banks to keep operating if the ECB’s Governing Council approves a further increase in the ELA, we think it will not be enough to absorb any significant increase in deposit outflows in the event that capital controls are eased and banks are reopened. \nA tiny collateral buffer limits the banks’ capacity to borrow ELA liquidity. Also we suspect that the remaining spare collateral is not evenly distributed among the four largest banks, and therefore some of them are likely to be in more of a stressed liquidity situation than the others, making them more vulnerable to any further bank run. Therefore, we believe that capital controls should remain in place for a long period even if there are positive developments in the negotiations and the ECB eventually increases the ELA ceiling. \n= 02.12 = \nIf EU Commission spokesman Margartis Schinas's not-so-cryptic tweet is anything to go by, there's still a big trust deficit to be bridged between the two sides tonight \n= 02.09 = \nA grumpy sounding former chief of the IMF's Europe department tweets... \n= 02.06 = \nIt's just gone 3am in Brussels... \n= 02.02 = \nThe pic of the weekend: Euclid and his Red Ipad Case \n= 02.00 = \n= Markets calm amid Greek uncertainty = \nThe euro fell slightly at the start of Asian trading this morning, but otherwise the foreign exchange markets are taking tonight's talks in their stride \n= 01.55 = \n= Tusk-xit = \nEU Council president seems to have left the three premiers to get on with it themselves \n= 01.50 = \n= ECB to unwind ELA - SocGen (Paris: FR0000130809 - news ) = \nMichala Marcussen at Societe Generale thinks that even without a new deal for Greece tonight, the ECB will not take the \"nuclear option\" to cut off Greece's banking system from emergency liquidity (ELA): \n\" Should there be no agreement on Greece, we do not expect the ECB to cut off ELA immediately, but rather to find a way to gradually unwind the ELA provision\". \nWhat \"unwind\" means in this context, it's difficult to know. If the ECB demands ELA is cut off and repaid immediately, that would set off a chain of events which would see bank assets and collateral seized by the central bank, putting lenders in immediate need of recapitalisation. Estimates suggests that even if Greece manages to stay in the euro, the banking system needs recapitalising to the tune of €25bn. This is money that will almost certainly have to come from European pockets. \n= 01.39 = \n= No old rescue funds for Greece = \nThat plan for revive some old rescue money from a 2010 bail-out fund (EFSM) was short-lived. It seems like another ill-fated attempt by the European Commission to push through a deal which has quickly and inevitably, met the dissent of their fellow partners (as well as probably being illegal under the ESM treaty). \nMore from Matthew Holehouse in Brussels: \nThere is scepticism here over the idea that the defunct ESFM might be used to provide a bridging loan for Greece. It would require a vote of majority by all 28 countries including Britain. It is not going to happen, insists one source. \nAs things stand, the proposal to give Greece time out is still on the table, we are told. \n= 01.29 = \n= Renzi v Rutte = \nWe've had reports of a Franco-German rift, and now it's time for the Italians and the Dutch to clash. \nDutch media are reporting that their PM Mark Rutte does not feel he can get a new aid package for Greece through his parliament. \nDe Volskrant say Mr Rutte was involved in a \"a fierce altercation in the corridor\" with his Italian counterpart Matteo Renzi, according to a diplomat who witnessed the conflict. \nThe two are an opposite sides of the camp tonight. Mr Renzi is pushing for a deal to avoid more Greek humiliation, having lost patience with the creditor bloc, led by Germany and including Mr Rutte's Netherlands. \nHere's the front-page of Holland's biggest selling daily tomorrow on the prospect of more money for Greece: \n= 01.10 = \n= Wednesday summit up in the air = \nA reminder that tomorrow (today I guess, it's Monday after all) finance ministers meet again for a regular meeting of the eurogroup, and one that will also decide its new president. It's a contest between incumbent Dutchman Jeroen Dijsselbloem (whose name is a scourge to live bloggers around the world) and Spain's Luis de Guindos. \n= 01.09 = \n= Food update = \nMatthew Holehouse is Brussels lets us know that things really are tough tonight: \n\"Leaders' dinner tonight consisted of an austere menu by EU standards of Gazpacho, roast chicken, limoncello sorbet, moka.\" \nAustere for some, but it's nearly time for my pre-fasting morning meal, so it all sounds incredibly good to me right now. \n= 01.00 = \nThe Telegraph's International Business Editor is having trouble keeping his eyes on the slow moving car-crash that is the euro \n= 00.57 = \nAlexis Tsipras is fighting on four different fronts tonight. He seems to have lost on at least one of them (having no further involvement from the IMF), but could be making inroads on another - his objection to having Greek assets shunted off into a private fund in Luxembourg and used to pay off creditors. \nThe original eurogroup draft stated assets worth €50bn. It now seems that even the IMF think that's ridiculous, and think somewhere close to €7bn is more reasonable. €7bn coincidentally is also the same amount the Greeks owe the ECB (€6.5bn) and the IMF (€450m ) in repayments until the end of August. I love it when a plan comes together. \n= 00.51 = \n= Where will the Greek money come from? = \nSo seems like the talk of Brussels has moved on to providing some form of bridging cash to keep Greece afloat until at least the summer when it faces a €7bn repayments schedule up until August. \nOne suggestion doing the rounds is that Athens could now be given cash which was last reserved under the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism(EFSM) first set up by the bloc as an emergency rescue fund in 2010. \nThere's never a good time to discuss the differences between various euro rescue funds, and especially not in the early hours of the morning. But the important thing to note is that any cash under the original EFSM is likely to no longer be available for member states, as states by the eurozone's own treaties. \nAccording to the treaty which established the new permanent mechanism (ESM) and thus replaced its temporary predecessors: \"the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) will remain in force until June 2013. As this mechanism is designed to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole, the European Council agreed that Article 122(2) TFEU will no longer be needed for such purposes. Heads of State or Government therefore agreed that it should not be used for such purposes. \nThanks to clever bod Bruno Waterfield at The Times for the heads up. \n= 00.35 = \nTime (Xetra: 17T.DE - news ) for that coffee you've been putting off \n= 00.20 = \nAn update from our man Matthew Holehouse in Brussels on where talk are at tonight, and what money is left in the Greek kitty. \nUpstairs at dinner, they are discussing: \nHow to find money to get Greece through the next few weeks. Potential sources are profits from the ECB's SMP programme, or money they claims left over in an old bank recapitalisation fund totalling some €13bn. \nOn that proposal to lock up €50bn of Greek assets in a Luxembourg fund, there is row. EU sources say that is now up to € 50bn in the \"long term\". \nMark Rutte, the Dutch PM, is concerned about the roll back of programmes that have been approved by his parliament. \n= 23.47 = \nOn a lighter note, Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) comes bearing gifts: Capital (Other OTC: CGHC - news ) controls that have shut Greeks off from its services, so it's giving them free iCloud access for the next 30 days. \nLet's see if things are resolved by then... \n= 23.36 = \nHmmmm, so just as the IMF is denying press reports that it is trying to push Mr Tsipras out, we have this from Fox Business... \n= 23.30 = \n= Update time = \nSo we're approaching 11.30pm and the Council is on its second break of the night. \nMr Tsipras, Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande have got together with Donald Tusk for a separate chat as of half an hour ago. There's still plenty to do... \nMeanwhile Twitter is abuzz with the #ThisisACoup trend, which is now trending worldwide. \nOn the back of that, the IMF has denied reports in Germany's BIld, that it is the driving force for a new technocratic regime to replace the Leftist coalition government. \n= 23.16 = \nThe Guardian's Ian Traynor is also reporting those same four objectives from PM Tsipras. Importantly, he notes the prospect of a \"euro break\" was not among them \n= 23.12 = \nDonald Tusk has now joined the three main leaders of Greece, Germany, and France tonight. \nHe's probably telling them to get a move on, given that on Monday, Mr Tusk told us Sunday was the final day to save the single currency. It's currently already Monday in Brussels... \n= 22.56 = \n= Some leaks = \nA flurry of news. The Economist's Tom Nuttal says PM Tsipras has four demands from creditors tonight; no IMF involvement, a promise for debt relief, increase in ELA and no to the idea of privatising €50bn in assets. \nMeanwhile, there are also suggestions that ECB chief Mario Draghi is willing to provide the Greeks with a post-default grace period if they can't pay back a bond on July 20, says Greek TV. There have been suggestions that the ECB could provide a 30-day grace period to Greece if it can't find the €3.3bn it needs to redeem a government bond. \n= 22.51 = \n= Germany's Der Spiegel: a catalogue of cruelties = \nCould the German press be turning against their government? We've heard plenty today about Mr Schuaeble pandering to his electorate with tough promises of Grexit to Athens, but today's Der Spiegel has come out fiercely against the eurogroup's measures, dubbing them a \"catalogue of cruelty\". \n= 22.42 = \nMalta's PM has tweeted from tonight's summit: \"still a way to go\" \n= 22.20 = \n= Bild: IMF want technocratic government in Greece = \nGerman tabloid Bild report that the IMF is pushing for Mr Tsipras's government to be replaced with a technocratic regime which would oversee the reform programme creditors are demanding in return for a new bail-out. \nPolitical analyst Dim Rapidis also cites sources in Washington saying the same. \nThis isn't the first time we've heard this suggestion, but it is the first time it has been attributed so clearly to the IMF. Greek media have reported that the favoured technocrat of choice for the Troika would be central bank governor and former finance minister of Greece, Yannis Stournaras. \nThe Fund have decline to comment on the report. Meanwhile the #ThisIsACoup hashtag is trending on Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) . \n= 22.13 = \n= Draghi: \"the strongest European in the room\" = \nMario Draghi's come in for some stick in recent weeks. He's among eurozone leaders in Brussels tonight, and according to an official speaking to Reuters, is \"the strongest European\" in the room. \nDraghi's ECB has the power to effectively cause a Grexit by cutting off Greek banks from euro support. \nBut Reuters reports, he is \"most opposed to the risky experiment of cutting Greece loose and braving Schaeuble's ire by interrupting him during a discussion on Athens' debt burden.\" \nLast night the central banker was involved in tussle with Germany's finance minister who reportedly snapped at the Italian. \n\"It was like kindergarten\" said one official. \n= 22.03 = \n= \"We are looking at a long, late night\" = \nThat's from a eurozone official whose been speaking to our man in Brussels, Matthew Holehouse. \nSeems the same news has trickled back down to a poor, dishevelled, Euclid Tsakalotos. The face of a thousand Grexit scenarios right there. \n= 21.50 = \n= Krugman: a grotesque betrayal of everything Europe stands for = \nNobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman has been one of the harshest critics of eurozone austerity. In his latest blog , he questions whether the European project can now ever recover from the events of this weekend. \nA snippet: \nThis goes beyond harsh into pure vindictiveness, complete destruction of national sovereignty, and no hope of relief. It is, presumably, meant to be an offer Greece can’t accept; but even so, it’s a grotesque betrayal of everything the European project was supposed to stand for. \nCan anything pull Europe back from the brink? Word is that Mario Draghi is trying to reintroduce some sanity, that Hollande is finally showing a bit of the pushback against German morality-play economics that he so signally failed to supply in the past. But much of the damage has already been done. Who will ever trust Germany’s good intentions after this? \n= 21.45 = \n= Tsipras wants to avoid banking meltdown = \nYet more pressure on the ECB tonight, as Mr Tsipras is reportedly asking for an immediate agreement to safeguard the financial system from collapse \n= 21.40 = \n= Greek hardliner on his way out of the government = \nLeftist energy minister Paniogotis Lafazanis is set to be reshuffled out of the government as early as tomorrow report Reuters. \nThat's hardly a huge suprise. Mr Lafazanis, who heads up the extreme Left faction of Syriza, abstained from voting in favour of Mr Tsipras' austerity deal. His departure is a clear signal of the move towards a more consensus and moderate coalition government the prime minister is being pressured to implement if Greece is to get a new bail-out. \nDeputy Labour Minister Dimitris Stratoulis, a former unionist \nMr Lafazanis, who has ties with Moscow, has pushed Greece to sign a gas pipeline deal with Vladimir Putin's government, and has consistently called for \"no surrender\" to creditors. \nHe spoke to The Telegraph last month, vowing never to surrender to creditors' austerity demands. \n= 21.34 = \n= Sounds like they're cooking on gas (finally) = \nThe eurogroup proposal is 4-pages long - the most contentious but is right at the end (the temporary Grexit plan), and leaders are almost halfway through their considerations, reports Politco's Tara Palmieri. \nWhether that means they're going through them putting a bit red cross or a green tick next to plans, we are yet to find out. \nMeanwhile, a Greek official has given short shrift to the plan that the Greeks would transfer their assets over to a private fund in Luxembourg and use it to pay off their debts. \n= 21.14 = \n= Draghi needs \"political commitment\" for ELA to continue = \nA Greek official has been quoted as saying Mario Draghi requires \"political committment \" from both parties to continue providing the liquidity that is keeping the banking system from going bust. \nThis suggests that should Greece say it is willing to carry out the legislative measures it needs to begin talks over a new deal, in just three days, Mr Draghi won't be pulling the plug tonight. \nMost analysts think the ELA is only sufficient to keep banks going to Monday at the latest. This means some raise on the ceiling will have to be forthcoming by Tuesday at the earliest. It currently stands at around €89bn. \n= 20.52 = \n= Greek minister: Europe wants to crush us = \nMore politicians on Twitter. The Greek government's defence minister and leader of the nationalist ANEL party, Panos Kammenos, has tweeted that Europe's actions today \"prove they want to crush us\"... \nMeanwhile, a Greek official quoted by AP describes today's draft deal as \"in its entirety very bad...We are trying to find solutions,\" \n= 20.48 = \n= Jean-Luc Melenchon: The Germans are destroying Europe again = \nNever a man not to court controversy, far Left French politician and former government minister Jean-Luc Melenchon has take to Twitter with some pointed comments about Germany's stance towards Greece. \n= 20.32 = \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) some flashes from a Greek official attacking the finance ministers \"synopsis of ideas\" as humiliating, and suggesting that Francois Hollande is still the man fighting the Greek cause. \nEarlier today, the Guardian's Ian Traynor reported a Eurozone official calling today's Merkel-Holland-Tsipras meeting as \"mental waterboarding\", which throws into some doubt just how supportive Monsieur Hollande really was. \n= 20.27 = \nSome flashes from a eurozone official being quoted on the MNI wire. They suggest today's eurogroup statement is less of a plan, more of a brainstorming session, but one that has split the eurozone. \nAlso notable that US secretary Jack Lew seems to think the Greeks have done enough to finally warrant some of the debt relief Mr Tsipras so craves. \n= 20.24 = \nThis is the type of euro holiday I'm happy to get on board with \n= 20.22 = \n= Why do creditors want \"prior actions\"? = \nThe buzz phrase of this weekend is \"prior actions\". That's eurocrat language for legislation which clearly spells out all the reforms the Greek government is promising to do on paper. \nCreditors are now demanding a host of bills are passed by the Greek parliament by Wednesday 15. That's an incredibly short deadline, but it reflects the severe unease Greece's paymasters have towards Mr Tsipras' government. It is a sure fire symptom of the credibility vacuum that has plagued the Leftist government after it decided to hold a referendum. \nSome cynics might say the July 15 deadline is an all but impossible task for Mr Tsipras, who is already facing a domestic rebellion among his hard Left parliamentarians. Should he fail, the next logical step would for a national unity government to take the helm and implement the punishing set of measures that Greece now needs to even begin thinking about a new bail-out. \n= 20.08 = \n= Tsipras has not left the building = \nContrary to some rumours, the Greek PM is still holed up with his fellow leaders and has not left the summit \n= 20.00 = \n= German, Greek and French finance ministers begin meeting = \nPlenty of talks going on at the sidelines of the main summit. The three main finance ministers in today's talks have now convened in Brussels, report Greek media. \n= 19.59 = \n= What will the ECB do? = \nTonight's leaders' summit, whatever the outcome, will have immediate repercussions on the stance of the ECB. The central bank has continually stated that it is a \"rules-based institution\", but in recent weeks has come in for criticism for taking seemingly politically motivated decisions to squeeze Greece's banking system. \nAs it stands, the ECB has frozen the ceiling on the emergency liquidity (ELA) it provides the Greek banking system. The implication from tonight's deadline day talks was that if there were to be no deal, the ECB would then likely withdraw the funding, sending the Greek banking system into collapse. \nHowever, one consistent theme from Mario Draghi's is that he is loathe to be the man with his finger prints on the Grexit murder weapon. Thus, even if no decision is reached tonight, but talks continue until Wednesday, expect the ECB to keep the ELA ceiling in place. \nJuly 20, the day Greece needs to pay back ECB bonds which it doesn't have the cash for, may then become the day Draghi has to finally pull the trigger. \n= 19.50 = \n= European leaders statement coming = \nLooks like those earlier proposals we saw from finance ministers are now being drafted into tonight's Council statement. Whether or not they will entirely mimic some of the more incendiary elements of the former, remain to be seen. \n== \n= 19.38 = \nJack Lew, the US Treasury Secretary, has pitched in, saying he is \"encouraged\". Here's his statement via Reuters: \nSecretary Lew spoke by telephone this morning with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on the ongoing situation in Greece. \nSecretary Lew noted that he is closely monitoring the discussions in Brussels and has been encouraged by reports of some progress, though additional work clearly remains. \nHe noted that Greece has made substantial movement and demonstrated the political will to implement difficult reforms and that continued flexibility will be required by all parties. \nSecretary Lew underscored that rebuilding trust requires demonstrating that a program will be implemented and that there will be measures to make the debt sustainable. \nSecretary Lew reinforced that it is in the best interests of Greece, Europe, and the global economy for all parties to reach a constructive outcome that would put Greece on a path toward necessary reforms as well as debt sustainability and growth within the eurozone. \n= 19.28 = \nThe first reports of that meeting between Greek, German and French leaders are coming through. From the Guardian's Ian Traynor: \n= 18.55 = \nJoseph Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate economist, has attacked Germany over its position in the Greek talks, saying the country has shown a \"lack of solidarity\". \nStiglitz tells AFP : \nWhat has been demonstrated is a lack of solidarity by Germany. You cannot run a eurozone without a basic modicum of solidarity. It is really undermining the common sense of vision, the sense of common solidarity in Europe. \nI think it's been a disaster. Clearly Germany has done a serious blow, undermining Europe. Asking even more from Greece would be unconscionable. If the ECB allows Greek banks to open up and they renegotiate whatever agreement, then wounds can heal. But if they succeed in using this as a trick to get Greece out, I think the damage is going to be very very deep. \n= 18.15 = \nSo, the draft statement is being widely circulated around Brussels and the whole thing is now online. \nThe most interesting thing is at the end. As we've seen below, it presents the possibility of debt restructuring , but also a \"time-out\" from the eurozone. \nCrucially, all of the most controversial points are in square brackets, which means they may or may not end up in the final statement. The issues are being bumped up to that meeting between Tsipras, Merkel and Hollande. \n= 17.30 = \nHere they are, joined by Euclid Tsakalotos , Greece's finance minister: \n= 17.17 = \nThe leaders of France , Greece and Germany will meet on the sidelines of the eurozone leaders summit, presumably to discuss a potential deal in more detail, according to a Greek official. \n= 17.08 = \nMore tough talk from the Slovaks , who says that when it comes to the Greek situation, there is \"no room for mercy\". Robert Fico , the country's prime minister, told reporters: \nIf Slovakia managed to carry out reforms then Greece has to be able to do it, too, there is no room for mercy from our side. For any negotiations on the third program to start, the Greeks have to adopt legislation in parliament. We want to see what they will do with VAT, with the pension system, individual laws. \nThis is a basic pre-condition for the start of the talks and doesn’t necessarily mean that we will agree with the aid package. \n= 16.58 = \nThe slow drip of leaks from the Eurogroup's statement begins. The \"time out\" statement is in there (see 13.35 ) \n= 16.21 = \nAsked about plans to grab €50bn of Greece's assets to pay off its debt, Schulz says it was not an German idea, but one that came from Luxembourg . \n[Jean-Claude] Juncker launched the idea that assets for privatisation can be used to manage Greek debt ... The idea is to stabilise Greece’s capacity to stabilise its debt. \nHowever, Mr Schulz insists that it should be Greece's responsibility to manage asset sales. \"I don’t think you can see Greek national weath put in others hands to manage,\" he says. \n= 16.20 = \nMartin Schulz , the head of the European Parliament, is holding a press conference in Brussels. \nHe says that Europe is now “at a crossroads”. \nAre we going to move forward with a spirit of unity or are we going to start falling apart? This is what is really on the agenda. \nWe are very rarely in the sort of situation where the time allowed for a decision relates not just to one country but to the eurozone and the whole of Europe - which will be affected by any decision. \nThere’s must be a decision and I hope it will be a constructive decision. An overwhelming majority are keen for Greece to remain in the eurozone…but people have different views. Some ascribe to the view that Greece should leave the eurozone and don’t see risk attached to Grexit. A broader number are of the opposite view that Grexit is not an option. \nI can't remember in all my years a situation like this. It’s not any decision. It’s really about the European Enion. If the EU is going to be a credible force it has to demonstrate a capacity to solve its own problems. And [doing this] will be important for its prestige on the international stage. We’re talking about the fate of millions of people. So there is a responsibility on both sides and on the other partners in the eurozone. \nAfter a few questions, he adds: \nWe need a compromise today, I don’t know whether we’ll get one. We’ll be a whole lot better off to get an agreement today then to put this off until doomsday. \n= 15.43 = \nYou can always rely on the tactile Jean-Claude Juncker to show Mr Tsipras some love: \nFrench President Francois Hollande, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras at the start of eurozone leaders' summit on the Greek crisis at the European Council (Photo: EPA) \n= 15.34 = \nCAPTION COMPETITION: \nGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (C) talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel (L) and French President Francois Hollande at the start of eurozone leaders' summit on the Greek crisis at the European Council headquarters (Photo: EPA) \n= 15.29 = \nMatteo Renzi , Italy's prime minister, says the Greek debt drama risks losing European citizens' confidence. \nAny deal should take into account Europe as well as Greece, he tells reporters, but he's hopeful that an agreement will be reached. He adds: \nWe are doing everything to reach an accord. Compared to the starting point, we are now very close. The distances have narrowed greatly. \n= 15.15 = \nOK - the Eurogroup is over, and ministers have failed to agree on \"big issues\" in Greek talks. \nAlex Stubb , Finalnd's finance minister has revealed three conditions to a new Greek bail-out deal: \n1.) New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) laws that have to be pushed through by the Greeks by July 15 - that's t his coming Wednesday . \n2.) These involve tough reforms on the labour market, pensions and taxes. \n3.) The Eurogroup also want a commitment on privatisations. The statement includes no fewer than four bullet points on this, he says. \nHe adds: \nThe bottom line is if there is to be the opening of negotiations on ESM [the eurozone's bail-out fund], these conditions must be met and approved by the Greek government and parliaments. \nHe says that talks took a \"good leap forward\" but insists that the ball is in the court of the Greek government. \n= 15.07 = \nNext (Other OTC: NXGPF - news ) up, Enda Kenny , Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) 's Taoiseach, who complains that this is his \"umpteenth visit\" to Brussels. \n[The situtation is] very serious. Every day this goes on the eventual solutions become more costly. \nHe says there has been a \"very frank\" and \"forthright\" series of exchanges. \"Rebuilding trust is fundamental,\" he adds. \nHe says the only way Ireland built up trust with its creditors on an \"incremental\" basis. Look at us now, he says. \nLooking forward, he wants to see Greece “demonstrating their conviction to remain a member of the eurozone” \nI’d like to see them demonstrating starting tomorrow in their parliament they’re serious about implementing the changes, legislative and structural, that need to be put in place. And there are many of them. They need to show conviction about being serious here about building trust with their other colleagues around the table. \nWe don’t want to look back in ten years time have a situation whereby this could have been saved but wasn’t. \n= 14.59 = \nGreece's prime minister is keeping in touch with America, according to Greek officials, who say Mr Tsipras spoke to US treasury secretary Jack Lew today. \n= 14.52 = \nJoseph Muscat , the prime minister of eurozone minnow Malta , has just given us an interesting insight into negotiations: \nThe fact that this summit has been convened in itself shows a willingness to go the extra mile. This summit should have only been if we were discussion Plan B [of Grexit] but as far as I'm concerned we are discussing all options. We should rely on what the institutions [Euoprean commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund] have been saying and definitely what was enough 10 days ago might not be enough today because [the Greek economy] has deteriorated in a very rapid manner. \nGreece should be kept in the eurozone but not at any cost. \nHe is asked if there is unanimity among the eurozone leaders. His response: no \nHe repeats that the situation in Greece has deteriorated in a \"tragic manner\" \n= 14.42 = \nEarlier on, Miro Cerar , Slovenia's Prime minister, repeated this week's buzz word: trust. \nHe said: \nFor our country we would like to see the Greeks remain [in the eurozone] in a show of solidarity and for humanitarian reasons but of course there must be obligations on the Greek side if there is to be a deal. The Greek government has to fulfil its obligations and to show responsibility. There is a sense in the negotiations that we have lost a lot of trust in the Greek government and we hope this loss of trust can be forgotten. \nOn whether patience has run out on a Greek deal, he said: \nI wouldn’t be here if I believed patience had run out. Leaders of European countries must show all patience here in order to reach an agreement if possible, It is also on greek side to prove it can be a reliable and trustworthy partner. \n= 14.40 = \nMartin Schulz , president of the European Parliament, is singing from the same hymn sheet as Mr Hollande : \n= 14.29 = \nFighting talk from Jean-Claude Juncker , head of the European Commision: \n= 14.21 = \nMeanwhile Francois Hollande , the French president, has dismissed the idea of a temporary Greek exit. \nGreece is either in or out, he says. He tells reporters in Brussels: \nWhat’s at stake is Europe. It’s not just about the future of Greece. It’s the concept we have of Europe. There is Grexit or no Grexit. Greece is in the eurozone or out of it. But if it’s out of it, it’s Europe that is shrinking. \n= 14.18 = \nUp next: German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who's chosen to wear the white version of her regular single breasted suit jacket today. Is she ready to make peace? \nShe says (in German) that the situation is \"extremely difficult\" and it remains to be seen whether the talks will succeed. She says that tough discussions lie ahead, and Germany will not agree to a new deal at any price. \n= 14.09 = \nAlexis Tsipras , Greece's prime minister, has arrived for talks. He tells reporters he is \"ready for an honest compromise\". \nWe owe that to the people of Europe who want to see Europe united not divided. We can reach an agreement tonight if all parties want it. \n= 13.43 = \nStatement expected soon. But remember. The \"final deadline\" was supposed to be today and the Greek crisis was meant to be solved after the first bail-out package. \nMoral of the story: expect delays. \n= 13.35 = \nWoah. The Eurogroup has floated the idea of a temporary Greek withdrawal from the eurozone in a draft statement, according to the Wall Street Journal. The paper said the statement that a Grexit was a \"potential option\" was added at the request of the Germans . \nNothing confirmed though. I will keep you updated. \n= 13.07 = \nRussia is considering direct fuel deliveries to help Greece through the crisis, according to the country's energy minister. \nAlexander Novak was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying: \nRussia intends to support the revival of Greece's economy by broadening cooperation in the energy sector. Accordingly we are studying the possibility of organising direct deliveries of energy resources to Greece, starting shortly. \nWhile some have warned that Greece could fall under the influence of the Russian bear if Europe denies it vital aid, the country has problems of its own, and is currently dealing with the impact of harsh sanctions imposed on it by the West. \nNew ally? Alexis Tsipras, Greece's prime minister, talks to Vladimir Putin, Russia's president. \n= 12.50 = \nWhat are the press making of it all? \nBen Martin rounds up the best of the European papers this morning . \n= 12.47 = \nReuters has got hold of extracts of a draft Eurogroup statement , which is calling for the same primary surplus target (revenues minus expenditure, minus debt interest payments) of 3.5pc pf GDP, despite the likely downturn the Greek economy has suffered in recent weeks. This means they want more belt tightening for rescue funds. \nThe Eurogroup say Greece's package of reforms must be \"significantly strengthened and broadened in order to provide for appropriate conditionality for a possible three-year ESM program.\" It also wants a \"scaled up\" privatisation drive with \"improved governance\". \nHere are the top five bullet points (my emphasis): \n• [Greece must] fully comply with the medium-term primary surplus target of 3.5pc of GDP by 2018, according to a yearly schedule to be agreed with the institutions; \n• carry out ambitious pension reforms and specific policies to fully compensate for the fiscal impact of the Constitutional Court ruling on the 2012 pension reform and to implement the zero deficit clause; \n• adopt more ambitious product market reforms with a clear timetable for implementation of all OECD toolkit I recommendations, including Sunday trade, sales periods, over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, pharmacy ownership, milk, bakeries. \n• develop a significantly scaled up privatisation program with improved governance . A working group with the institutions shall provide proposals for better implementation mechanisms; \n• on labour markets, undertake rigorous reviews of collective bargaining, industrial action and collective dismissals in line with the timetable and the approach suggested by the institutions. Any changes should be based on international and European best practices, and should not involve a return to past policy settings which are not compatible with the goals of promoting sustainable and inclusive growth; \nCheer up Wolfgang: French Finance Minister Michel Sapin (left) puts his arm around German colleague Wolfgang Schaeuble \n= 12.34 = \nTrust remains an issue with the current Greek government, according to Ireland , the eurozone's austerity poster child. \nSimon Harris , Ireland's junior finance minister, said the Irish people were against debt writedowns, but could stomach a \"reprofiling\", which he said was needed to get Greece's debt pil on a sustainable path. \nIn other words: Ireland is not prepared to sit in the barber's chair and take a haircut (like the private sector did in 2012). \nHowever, it is willing to give Greece more time to repay what it owes. \n= 12.17 = \nA backlash against the Schaeuble Grexit plan is building: \nGermany's Green Party , which has been touted as a new coalition party with the CDU should it win elections in 2017, has described it as \"unconstitutional\" \nMeanwhile, Luxembourg's foreign minister has said that Germany would provoke “far-reaching conflict with France” if it continued to try to push Greece out of the single currency bloc, even on a temporary basis. \nJean Asselborn told Sueddeutsche Zeitung that such as conflict could destroy the bloc's Franco-German axis which “would be a catastrophe for Europe”. He said: \nIt would be fatal for Germany’s reputation in the EU and the world if Berlin doesn’t seize the opportunity now provided by the Greek reform proposals. \nHowever, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel confirmed last night that he backed the plan, although he said Greece would not be forecd to accept the proposal. Writing on his Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news ) page, he said : \nIn a difficult situation such as this, every conceivable proposal must be examined without prejudice. This proposal would only be achievable if the Greek government itself views it as the better alternative. \n= 12.04 = \nMinisters are warming to the softly spoken Oxford graduate though: \nOuch. \nHere's a profile of Mr Tsakalotos. \n= 11.51 = \nEuclid Tsakalotos , Greece's finance minister, cuts a lonely figure this morning. At least he's not using his hotel paper to write notes on. He's upgraded and brought an iPad with him - in a big red case to shield any notes about triumphalism or anything else from prying eyes: \nGreek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos attends a meeting of the Eurogroup finance ministers \nGreek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos sits quietly as he attends a meeting of the Eurogroup finance ministers \nSecret notes? Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos has brought an iPad with him today, plus two phones \nAt least he has one friend: \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde (L) and Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos talk at the start of a special Eurogroup finance ministers meeting. \n= 11.38 = \nPictures from inside the Eurogroup meeting are coming in thick and fast. \nGermany caused a stir yesterday when it mooted a plan that either involved a temporary Greek exit from the eurozone or a €50bn grab of the country's assets to pay off its debts. Greece's would also have to cede control of its public administration to Brussels if it wanted to remain a member of the club in the short term. \nIt was a drastic plan tabled by a minister who has hardened his stance on Greece substantially since its first bail-out in 2010. However, Germany signs the bulk of the cheques, and has enough voting power to veto any third rescue package. \nIn short, if Germany says no deal, there will be no deal. \nMehreen Khan wraps up all the action from yesterday here . \nHere's a snapshot of the plan from Alberto Gallo at RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) : \n...While Schaeuble says the Grexit paper was backed by Angela Merkel , here's what our international business editor Ambrose Evans-Pritchard thinks about it all: \nGerman Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble (R) and French Finance Minister Michel Sapin talk at the start of a special Eurogroup finance ministers meeting (Photo: EPA) \n= 11.29 = \nThe pics are coming in from today's Eurogroup. This one is my favourite: \nGreek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde (back C) attend an euro zone finance ministers meeting in Brussels (Reuters) \n= 11.19 = \nOn his arrival to the Eurogroup meeting today, Pier Carlo Padoan , Italy's finance minister, said the main obstacle going forward is a “lack of trust.” He told reporters: \nI would like to see the Greek government to take concrete actions starting tomorrow in parliament to implement measures that are needed for Greece in the first place. \n= 11.14 = \nEnough is enough, we must reach a deal. That will be Matteo Renzi , the Italian prime minister's message to the rest of the eurozone today. Alice Philipson has more: \nItaly PM Matteo Renzi is to tell Germany that Greece must not be allowed to exit the Euro, according to the Itailan daily Il Messagero, who was quoted in the newspaper as saying \"enough is enough\" and that \" we must absolutely sign a deal\". \nHe said that Italy did not want Greece to leave the Euro and that \"humiliating a European partner after Greece has given up on just about everything is unthinkable\". \n\"Now common sense must prevail and an agreement must be reached,\" he said. \"Italy does not want Greece to exit the euro and to Germany I say: enough is enough.\" \n= 11.08 = \nTo give you an idea of just how (un)happy this eurozone family is at the moment: here's just one of the rumours swirling around the Greek and Italian press this morning: \nTensions: Wolfgang Schaeuble (left), Germany's finance minister, reportedly snapped at Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB \n= 10.59 = \nFinland's prime minister Juha Sipila has been speaking to reporters in Finland this morning. \nWhile his finance minister (and predecessor) Alex Stubb insisted this morning that \"no-one is blocking a deal\" ( see 09.43 ), Mr Sipila is keeping his cards close to his chest. He described Finalnd's stance on Greece as \"confidential\", and not necessarily the toughest around the table. \nHe did, however, say that Greece's proposal was \"not at all sufficient to start talks\". I see this rolling on until July 20, when Greece must repay €3.5bn to the ECB. \n= 10.39 = \nJust to remind everyone of today's events. \n• The meeting of the 19 finance ministers of the eurozone is underway. It started at 10am BST and will continue for most of the afternoon. \n• At 3pm BST , the heads of the eurozone will arrive - so Angela Merkel , the German Chancellor and Francois Hollande , France's president, will meet Alexis Tsipras , Greece's prime minister. \n• Leaders will \"take stock of the situation and set out the political guidelines for the next steps\", according to a press release sent out this morning. \"President Donald Tusk confirmed that the euro area authorities were ready to do all that is necessary to ensure financial stability in the euro area,\" it said. \n= 10.21 = \nNext to arrive is Pierre Moscovici . He says he is still hopeful that a deal can be reached, but sugggests the ball remains in Greece's court. \nGreece needs to commit to reforms, he tells reporters. \n= 10.13 = \nChristine Lagarde , the head of the International Monetary Fund, has also just arrived. No words from her this morning. \n= 10.08 = \nOne of the most vocal opponents of a new Greek bail-out is Slovakia . Its finance minister Peter Kažimír has been speaking to reporters this morning - reluctantly. \nIn reference to the special Sunday summit, he joked: \nI cannot speak to media because I'm Catholic and I don't work on Sundays. \nAsked what he expected to happen today, Mr Kažimír said: \nNothing. It's not possible to reach a deal today. \n= = \nNot hopeful of reaching a deal: Slovakia's finance minister Peter Kažimír \n= 09.58 = \nMario Draghi , the head of the European Central Bank, has just arrived in the back of a grey Mercedes Benz.

Asked about the cancellation of the EU leaders summit this evening he said: \nIt certainly sounds like they don't have a deal yet, that's certainly clear. It's also a reminder of just how difficult it's been for the Greek people for a number of years. For any country to go through a decline of GDP of 25pc , the Greek people are really suffering. \nWe want to see a resolution to the solution to this as soon as possible, but clearly it's got to be something that comes from within the eurozone. I hope they can reach a deal as soon as possible. \nI've always said the euro was a flawed proposal right from the start. It was always gonig to lead to these types of problems. I think it was entirely predictable, and countries that are in the eurozone - they have to draw lessons and realise if they want to have a single currency, have to have a single country to go with it. \n= 09.43 = \nFinland , which has always been uneasy about Greece's bail-out, insisted this morning that \"no-one is blocking a deal\". Mr Stubb said: \"We are all constructively trying to find a solution in a very difficult situation. \"We are very far away from the conditionality that we need. More from Mr Stubb : \nIf this was a negotiation from one to 10, I think we’re still standing somewhere between 3 and 4. So making progress but not there yet. \nThere are basically three litmus tests here. Number one is the stability of the euro zone and Greek finances. Number two is debt sustainability and then number three is basic financing. \nIf we get those right and we link those to very tough conditionality which has to do with pensions, which has to do with VATs, which has to do with structural reforms, etc, then we might find a deal \nNo one is blocking a deal, we’re all constructively trying to find a solution in a very difficult situation. The conditionality that has been presented by the Greeks is simply not enough at this stage. \nWe need to have clear commitments, clear conditionality and clear proof that those conditions will be implemented at the end of the day. \n= 09.32 = \nYou can read all about events yesterday here . \nEurozone finance ministers have already started to arrive for day two of crunch talks. \nHans Jörg Schelling , Austria's finance minister, says there are still \"many differences\" between the Eurogroup and Greece . Alexander Stubb , his Finnish counterpart, also told reporters this morning that the 19 nation bloc was still \"very far away\" from reaching a deal. \nGreek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos arrives for the start of a special Eurogroup meeting on Sunday \n= 09.20 = \nGood morning and welcome to our coverage of the Greek debt crisis . Today was meant to be the day when the crisis was either solved or Europe prepared for a Grexit. \nJust days after Donald Tusk , the president of the European Union, said \"loud and clear that the final deadline ends this week\" , he's just announced that a summit of the 28 leaders of the European Union - including UK prime minister David Cameron has been cancelled.
