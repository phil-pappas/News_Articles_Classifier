Daniel Munoz by Joanna Mather Ben Potter Some of the world's biggest oil and gas companies have been let off the hook from a possibly embarrassing grilling by a Senate committee – for now.\nA public hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics chaired by one of Labor's key attack operatives, Sam Dastyari​, was scheduled for August 4 but has been cancelled.\nThe committee wants to focus on completing other inquiries, including examination of embattled IOOF Holdings.\nIn the meantime, Santos wrote to the committee to say it has no marketing hubs in Singapore and does not transfer money offshore to avoid tax.\n\"We do not transfer money between our international and Australian operations for the purpose of avoiding tax,\" says the letter signed by chief financial officer Andrew Seaton.\n\"Our international dealings have been subject to regular risk review and monitoring by the Australian Tax Office.\"\nThe committee has been looking at the use of offshore tax havens by multinational companies.\nOn 10 July it wrote to eight companies including Santos to request information about the relationship between their Australian operations and operations in foreign jurisdictions, particularly Singapore.\n As Fairfax Media reported at the time , the others are Chevron, ExxonMobil, Caltex, BP, Woodside, Origin and Viva Energy.\nThe committee wants to know how these companies might make use of marketing hubs. A typical marketing hub arrangement involves a company that does business with Australian customers but books its profit with a subsidiary in a low-tax country: Singapore, for example, where the corporate tax rate is 17 per cent.\nSwitzerland is also likely to come up as a low-tax jurisdiction.\nThe committee has already called before it representatives of technology giants including Apple and Microsoft, along with BHP and Rio Tinto and pharmaceutical empires Novartis and Pfizer .\nIt is due to report by August 13 but is considering whether to produce an interim report before probing the use of marketing hubs by oil and gas companies in months to come.\nBHP Billiton is facing a tax bill of $522 million on its Singapore marketing operations.\nIn April, Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan told the committee that Rio Tinto had settled a tax assessment on its Singapore operations for more than $100 million.\nBHP will soon have more staff in Singapore than its head office in Melbourne, where the workforce is being trimmed.\nThe cuts are in keeping with the slimmed-down, super-efficient BHP Mr Mackenzie has been pitching, The Australian Financial Review reported this week.\nChief commercial officer Dean Dalla Valle​ said Singapore offered a highly-skilled workforce, not just lower tax rates.\nHe insisted that the bulk of the profits from Australian resources are taxed in Australia and \"the issue with the ATO is really just about a tax valuation issue, it's not tax avoidance by any means\".", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/energy-giants-called-to-explain-billions-in-tax-havens-20150715-gid1wj.html"], "published": "2015-07-29T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T16:39:59.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
