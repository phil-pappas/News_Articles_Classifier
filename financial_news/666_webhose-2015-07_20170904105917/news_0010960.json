A daily close below the 0.7559-97 area (triple bottom, June 1 low) exposes the 61.8% Fibonacci expansion at 0.7499. Alternatively, a push above the 14.6% Fib retracement at 0.7680 clears the way for a test of the 23.6% threshold at 0.7731. The available trading range is too narrow to justify entering a trade on the long or short side from a risk/reward perspective. With that in mind, we will remain flat for now, waiting for price action to offer a more compelling opportunity down the road.
