Domestic Bank, Corporate and Investment Bank, and Treasury increased their profits before tax by 153%, 18%, and 5%, respectively Customer loans grew 1% in the second quarter (April-June) and customer deposits 3%, following decreases in the first quarter (January-March), reflecting loan growth in Corporate Bank and deeper customer engagements We strengthened our balance sheet with a Tier 1 capital increase of US$1.0 billion from the prior year and reduced by 4% our risk-weighted assets (RWA). Our capital adequacy ratio was 22.0% at the end of June compared with 16.1% in the prior year, and 20.4% in December 2014 \nCommenting on these results, Albert Essien, Group Chief Executive Officer said: “Our results for the six months ended June 2015 reflected the strength of our balanced business model and pan-African strategy. We increased profit after tax by 26% to US$244 million and generated a return on average equity of 18.5% for our shareholders. \nDespite a difficult operating environment, we stayed committed to our customers – households and businesses alike – by focusing on providing them with the financial solutions they need. In the second quarter, loans and deposits grew gradually, following tepid growth in the first. We continued to drive cost efficiencies in our businesses and our cost-income ratio improved to 62.5% compared to 68.1% in the previous year.” \nEssien concluded: “Our balance sheet remained healthy, as evidenced by a capital adequacy ratio of 22.0%. Ecobank is well positioned to gain from resumption in economic activity in Africa and I am confident in the ability of our 19,000 plus employees to serve our clients with pride and excellence.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T15:39:07.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
