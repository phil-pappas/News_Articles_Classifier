Peter Rae Share on twitter by Michael Smith Asciano chief executive John Mullen has long held ambitions to take the Australian ports and rail group global.\nThat plan will now be realised, but perhaps not in the way he imagined, after Canada's Brookfield Asset Management lobbed an $8.8 billion takeover bid for the company on Wednesday.\nThe offer, which is a 36 per cent premium to the company's last trading price, is the largest takeover offer for an Australian company since SABMiller bought Foster's in 2011. The last deal that came close was Japan Post's bid for Toll Holdings, which has historic links to Asciano, last year.\nThe offer underscores the enormous appetite for infrastructure assets.\nAsciano handles nearly half of the container imports coming into Australia and owns an extensive rail-freight network. Mullen has turned around the company, which came close to collapsing during the global financial crisis, after being called in to replace former boss Mark Rowsthorn.\nMullen believed Asciano had a bigger future and had been exploring potential partnerships in Asia and elsewhere as a precursor to global expansion.\nCanada's Brookfield Asset Management, already an active player in Australia's infrastructure space, was a logical partner for Asciano. There has been speculation for some time it was looking to buy a stake in Asciano's Patrick container ports division, but a bid for the entire company caught the company by surprise on Tuesday.\nMullen is now out of the country.\n Thirty-six per cent premium Asciano confirmed it had received a cash-and-scrip offer valuing the company at $9.05 a share. The company last traded at $6.65 a share.\nAsciano went into a trading halt on Wednesday after The Australian Financial Review 's Street Talk column said Asciano was in talks with Brookfield about taking a stake in the port division. The report also said Asciano had received an approach for the company in its entirety.\nAsciano's Patrick Ports business was at the centre of a bitter 1998 waterfront dispute in Melbourne when it was run by Chris Corrigan. Patrick was later bought by Toll Holdings, which has also been taken out by a foreign bidder and later spun off into Asciano.\nMullen has talked about making the ­container ports business part of a \"global network\". Patrick has long-standing relat­ionships with customers in Australia, but not overseas. There are also cost-saving opportunities around suppliers and equipment like cranes and saddles.\nIf Brookfield is successful, it will enter an increasingly crowded stevedoring market when Australia's ports sector is heading for a big shake-up. Stevedores have been under pressure to forge new alliances and deal with fresh competition for the first time in decades. The timing is interesting, considering Hutchison Ports' decision to cut jobs and services in a sign it is retreating from its Australian port ambitions.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-07-01T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T10:07:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
