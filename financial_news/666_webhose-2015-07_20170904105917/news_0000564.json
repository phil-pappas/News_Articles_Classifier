Debt collection is expected to be suspended for at least 120 days.\nSome 40,000 former students are believed to have defaulted on Corinthian loans to the tune of $3.5 billion.\nThe for-profit college filed for bankruptcy in May . Soon afterward, ED unveiled a plan under which tens of thousands of former Corinthian students could seek relief from paying off their federal student loans. It's not clear what, if any, workout is being contemplated on the loan balances or if ED is starting from scratch on a new solution. It’s also not clear whether interest will accrue during the 120 payment moratorium if the loans go back into active collection.\nThe drumbeat for loan relief has grown louder since Corinthian abruptly closed its 30 remaining campuses in April, having sold some 56 of them earlier in the year to ECMC Group, the Minnesota-based student loan debt collector. Job placement numbers at Corinthian's Heald Colleges, the litmus test for the viability of career or trade school, were deemed by ED to be unreliable--and extremely low.\n\"The Department recently determined that by misrepresenting job placement rates to students at its Heald College campuses, Corinthian committed severe violations of Federal law,\" said Robyn Smith, an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center in a statement. \"In light of these findings and those of state attorneys general, the Higher Education Act clearly authorizes the Department to cancel the Federal loans of Corinthian borrowers. Any claim that the Education Department lacks the power to automatically cancel loans based on this evidence is just plain wrong.\"\nA spokesman for the Department of Education could not be reached for comment. Meanwhile, ED has, for the time being, bowed to pressure from a tiny number of well-organized students.\nIn February, a group of 15 former Corinthian students calling themselves The Debt Collective, formed what they called a \"debt strike\" against repayment of their loans and became aligned with Rolling Jubilee, an organization that grew out of the Occupy Wall Street movement . By June, the Debt Collective students numbered about 200--still a relative handful--but along the way they picked up support from Senate Democrats, figures inside the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and numerous consumer watchdog organizations. They announced that 1,200 students at other colleges renounced repayment of their federal loans in a show of solidarity. An attorney for the group said he would like to negotiate debt relief for all Corinthian students.\nIt's not clear what precedent could be set by ED's decision to yield to the debt strike, even temporarily. Some observers believe that other for-profit colleges will eventually go the way of Corinthian and that ED will have to revisit a similar student loan fiasco with each one.", "external_links": ["http://www.mainstreet.com/article/corinthian-colleges-shuts-down-its-remaining-compuses-as-its-final-act", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13219478/1/ed-says-debt-collection-a-no-go-on-defaulted-corinthian-loans-for-now.html&title=ED", "http://www.mainstreet.com/article/the-for-profit-college-house-of-cards-collapse-continues-apace", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13219478/1/ed-says-debt-collection-a-no-go-on-defaulted-corinthian-loans-for-now.html", "http://www.mainstreet.com/article/debt-collective-wants-out-of-federal-student-loans-borrowed-to-attend-corinthian-colleges", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13219478/1/ed-says-debt-collection-a-no-go-on-defaulted-corinthian-loans-for-now.html", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13219478/1/ed-says-debt-collection-a-no-go-on-defaulted-corinthian-loans-for-now.html&text=ED", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13219478/1/ed-says-debt-collection-a-no-go-on-defaulted-corinthian-loans-for-now.html"], "published": "2015-07-15T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T07:36:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
