However, those who do must file IRS Form 8938. \nMany Kenyans expressed concerns that this requirement would mean their income is taxed twice and this would hinder development projects back home. \nTAX TREATY \nAddressing the concerns, Mr Githae said the Kenyan Government was pursuing a framework with the US, where one would be taxed in the country where they spent most of the time during a tax year or where one earned most of their income. \n\"This treaty will be in place by the beginning of the next tax filing season,\" he told the Daily Nation. \nBacking the envoy's assurances, the director of diaspora affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Washington Oloo, said he could not say at what stage the discussions with their US counterpart were, but that they were working on a long-term solution. \nIn December 2013, Kenyan banks started steps to comply with this new requirement. \nFailure by any Kenyan bank to disclose the necessary information may result in a US bank that has remittances to be sent to that Kenyan bank being mandated by FATCA to withhold 30 per cent of the cash and submit to the IRS as a penalty.
