Starts in buildings with at least five units made up 41% of total new home construction in June — the largest share in 42 years — up from 33% a year earlier. Meanwhile, the pace of new constriction on single-family homes was 41% lower than the average rate over the three decades leading up to a 2006 peak.\nBuilders are responding to demand from individuals and families who are unwilling or unable to buy a single-family home. Apartment demand is so strong that landlords are able to keep cranking up rents far faster than the pace of overall inflation.\nAlso read: Consumer inflation on rise again — but slowly\n“Construction in the multifamily segment has surged in the post-crisis years,” said Gregory Daco, head of U.S. macroeconomics at Oxford Economics. “Activity in the single-family segment still has much room for improvement.”\nBuilders are unlikely to maintain June’s breathtaking pace of apartment construction, and a strengthening employment market should further support sales of new one-family homes, economists said. That’s good news for the broader economy because building a single-family home creates more jobs than constructing an apartment unit.\n“While builders and lenders benefit regardless of the type of construction, the economic benefit ... is significantly greater from single-family construction as opposed to multifamily units, particularly rental properties,” said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income. “Single-family-housing activity results in additional spending and borrowing power as a result of equity building, which is not necessarily present in multifamily properties.”\nHome builders, themselves, are quite optimistic about single-family-home sales. The economy is adding jobs at a healthy pace and mortgage rates are still low. Major publicly traded builders recently reported strong annual growth for new orders. However, there are also still headwinds for the single-family-home market, such as lenders’ strict credit standards.\nRead more: Home-builder confidence stays at highest level in almost 10 years\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:42:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
