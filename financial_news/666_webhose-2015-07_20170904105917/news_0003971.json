Photo: James Alcock\nThe May federal budget prioritised small businesses by putting them at the forefront of government policy.\nThe centerpiece of the policy was a tax break that allows businesses with an annual turnover lower than $2 million to claim immediate tax deductions for purchases bought before 1 July 2017 that cost below $20,000.\nThis is a significant improvement from the previous instant asset write-off threshold of $1000.\nUptake of the instant asset write-off Advertisement There have been media reports of small businesses spending on items such as new cars and office equipment. But information gleaned from daily interactions with our 1.2 million customers suggest there is some reticence about spending to take advantage of the tax break.\nMYOB in-house data reveals customers' net outflows - that is, where more money is leaving an organisation than coming in - between May and June 2015 was 40 percent less than that of May and June in 2014.\nIt appears small businesses are thinking strategically about the right time to purchase items, taking into consideration cash flow.\nNevertheless, there was an immediate jump in business confidence immediately following the announcement of the tax break. So if this policy did nothing other than deliver a much needed shot in the arm to business confidence it is a win.\nHowever, the end of the financial year remains a difficult time for small businesses. The 2015 MYOB Business Monitor revealed 37 per cent of small businesses have worked weekends, and a further 22 per cent have worked past midnight, to meet financial deadlines.\nSo while the federal government has made progress in terms of small business policy, there's more to be done to reduce the red tape that makes it hard to run a small business.\nIdentifying the opportunity There are a number of points small businesses that plan to capitalise on the $20,000 instant asset write-off in the future should keep in mind:\nDon't expect a full $20,000 back. For every dollar spent, owners will only get a portion back as a deduction. The cash value of the incentive depends on the tax rate payable on business profit. Be aware of the benefit versus cost outlay. Business owners shouldn't buy something just to receive a tax deduction. Before buying, research the price of the product and be careful not to make a rash decision. Instead, look at where you will make the most significant savings and how that money can be invested back into the business.
