They have since recovered some ground but are still close to half their peak last year. \nBy 1230 GMT on Friday, benchmark Brent crude oil was trading around $59 a barrel. \nBut the IEA, which advises the world's biggest economies on energy policy, says this mini golden era will soon end. \nNew (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) refineries coming on stream this year and next, along with upgraded units at existing refineries, are set to reverse those gains. \n\"In 2015-2016, net capacity additions will be more than needed, which will cause the global utilization rate to decline, and casts a doubt on the continuation of current unusually high refining margins,\" the IEA said in its monthly report. \nThe bulk of the new capacity is coming in the United States, where refineries are adding pieces of equipment to enable them to process more oil from the shale boom, and also from China. \nIn the Middle East, ADNOC's Ruwais refinery in Abu Dhabi is set to join two 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) mega units that officially launched in Saudi Arabia in 2014. \nThe IEA estimates that global refining capacity will rise by 1.1 million bpd per year in 2015 and 2016, bringing worldwide capacity to just over 97 million bpd - a 2 percent increase. \nWhile some closures are already planned in Europe and Asia, the agency no longer thinks these will be enough to balance the new additions. \n\"On a cumulative basis, refinery additions remain below demand growth,\" it said. But it noted that some of this demand will be met by biofuels and natural gas. \n\"With ever-increasing measures to curb greenhouse gasses emissions and increase efficiency, we forecast OECD (oil products) demand to resume its downward trend from 2017 onwards,\" the IEA report said.
