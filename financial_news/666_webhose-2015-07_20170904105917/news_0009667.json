Pat Scala by Ben Potter A top BHP Billiton executive said the mining giant's Singapore marketing hub, which will be bigger than its Melbourne headquarters , made sense because 65 per cent of its customers were in Asia.\nChief commercial officer Dean Dalla Valle said Singapore also offered a highly-skilled workforce, not just lower tax rates.\nSingapore provides a \"single face to customers\" and has the benefits of a good regulatory regime, a lot of incentives, a central location and suitable time zone, and a highly skilled workforce, Mr Dalla Valle told The Australian Financial Review .\n\"It's culturally aligned with many of our customers, it's customer agnostic.\"\nBHP Billiton is facing a tax bill of $522 million on its Singapore marketing operations and has been criticised by the Senate committee on corporate tax avoidance chaired by Labor's Sam Dastyari.\nIllegal transfer pricing occurs when a multinational prices goods or services for intra-company transfers not through arms-length negotiations but in order to minimise taxes.\n'It's very plausible' Mr Dalla Valle said the bulk of the profits from Australian resources are taxed in Australia and \"the issue with the ATO is really just about a tax valuation issue, it's not tax avoidance by any means\".\n He said the sums involved \"are a small margin on the transfer price\" and 58 per cent is shifted back to Australia to be taxed.\n\"In the big scheme of things - and when you look at it in the company structure I think it's very plausible and it's something that we certainly feel strongly about and defend,\" he said.\n\"We're a global company, we have to compete on the global stage every single day and so we need to structure ourselves and set up ourselves so that we are globally competitive.\n\"I'd say it's effective rather than minimisation. I mean we play to the rules. So whatever the rules are we play to. And we don't aim to pay over and we don't pay under.\n\"We've got a 130‐year history, we're not in the game of pulling stunts to get away with short‐term stuff.\"\n'Maximised value' Singapore will soon leapfrog BHP's Melbourne global head office. The Collins Street HQ is being pared back to 300 employees as part of chief executive Andrew Mackenzie's 'shrink to greatness' drive to make the company the lowest cost operator in patchy post-mining boom markets.\nMr Dalla Valle, who previously headed BHP's vast coal operations, said Singapore also covered supply and information technology and the marketing hub \"allows us to understand our customers better...from a number of perspectives\".\nThe aim of that group is to create value by truly understanding the value of our product getting full value recognition for us as a company, and as a country we should be pleased that we're getting maximised value for our products,\" he said.\n\"We have our central view on global development deep dives in our commodities the supply‐demand analysis. It's a single face to customers whereas in the past you could have one customer buying multiple products seeing multiple teams.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T10:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T07:12:44.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
