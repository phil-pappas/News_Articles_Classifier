Mr Cornes warned of a similar trend last year, during which time premium prices increased before levelling off in the final two quarters of the year. \nLast week, price comparison website Confused.com, alongside consultants Towers Watson, produced data showing car insurance premiums had risen by an average 3.6pc over the last year. \nSeparately, JPMorgan Cazenove published a note on Esure in advance of its half-year results on August 10. The bank forecasts a trading profit of £51m with higher claims inflation putting pressure on underwriting profits. Ashik Musaddi, of JPMorgan Cazenove, reckons it will take around 12 to 18 months before motor premium increases are reflected in the underwriting book. \nAdmiral Group became FTSE 100 leader with a 65p, or 4.5pc, gain to £15.18, RSA Insurance rose 2.2pc to 440.2p, Direct Line advanced 0.7pc to 359.1p and mid-cap insurer Esure climbed 1.9pc to 269.3p. * Questor share tip: Avoid Admiral until its growth path is clearer In the broader market, the FTSE 100 tumbled into negative territory, inching 19.62 points lower to 6,769.07, despite gold mining stocks rebounding. Having hit its lowest level in more than five years on Monday, gold prices stabilised yesterday. Fresnillo (Other OTC: FNLPF - news ) was up 23p to 652p, Randgold Resources jumped 76p to £38.93 and mid-cap miner Centamin (Toronto: CEE.TO - news ) recovered from losses of over 9pc, to rise 3.4pc to 55.4p. * Why is the gold price falling and where is it going next? Elsewhere, SABMiller (Xetra: BRW1.DE - news ) bubbled higher after Nomura upgraded the stock from “neutral” to “buy”, lifting its target price from £30 to £40. An injection of fresh blood at management level, following the appointment of a new chairman and chief financial officer recently, could boost growth next year and help the company “rediscover its entrepreneurial spirit”, analysts said. * SABMiller appoints company veteran as new finance chief Edward Mundy, of Nomura, reckons the new appointments could renew M&A momentum in both beer and soft drinks. “SABMiller’s strong balance sheet offers debt-funded acquisition firepower of $26bn on our estimates,” Mr Mundy added. The FTSE 100 company was changing hands at £35.03 by close - up 8.5p. \nAmong the risers, specialty chemicals maker Croda International (Other OTC: COIHF - news ) made gains of 5.6pc to finish at £29.51, reporting strong half-year results, with pre-tax profit growth of 7pc. The FTSE 250 company said it was on track to meet its full-year expectations. The Life Sciences business became its star performer, posting a 15pc rise in revenue on the back of the Omega3 product launch. \nCommenting on the success of Omega 3, Adam Collins of Liberum noted Croda is the sole supplier of concentrated Omega3 fish oil for Lovaza, treatment for high blood triglycerides, produced by US pharmaceuticals giant Par. \nRetailer AO World soared by 9.5pc in early trade before retreating, to close 3.2pc higher at 123.5p, after the company said it is on track to meet market expectations for full-year revenue . Andrew Wade, of Numis, described the update as “better than the market appears to have feared”. Meanwhile, results of the AGM published in the afternoon, revealed a minor revolt by shareholders as 9.5pc of them voted against the re-election of chairman Richard Rose. \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in IG Group were knocked into the red as a trading update revealed earnings had been hit from January’s surge in the Swiss franc. The FTSE 250 company also said Tim Howkins, the chief executive, would retire in Octobe r , after 16 years with the group. Paul McGinnis, of Shore Capital, said costs, which rose by £27m, were one of the main reasons for results falling slightly short. “We have previously expressed some concerns on the level of catch-up spend needed in areas such as mobile and digital marketing,” Mr Ginnis said, as Shore Capital retained their “sell” rating for the stock. The stock plunged 55p, or 6.8pc, to 752p. \nMeanwhile, easyJet had a bumpy landing at the bottom of the FTSE 100 as Commerzbank (Xetra: CBK100 - news ) slashed its target price to £15 from £17, issuing a “reduce” rating. The airline fell 55p, or 3.2pc, to £16.66. \nFollowing a Telegraph report that GVC Holdings (LSE: GVC.L - news ) was considering a bid for Bwin.party without the backing of Canadian gambling giant Amaya (NasdaqGS: AYA - news ) , GVC released a statement confirming it was “considering its options regarding Bwin”. Last Friday, 888 Holdings announced it would buy Bwin for £898.3m. With confirmation that GVC is not ruling itself out of the battle for Bwin, shares in the aim-listed company jumped 3.8pc to 425p. Bwin was marginally higher at 106.2p, while 888 was flat at 171p. \nFinally, Aim-listed Amino Technologies (LSE: AMO.L - news ) jumped 6.9pc to 148.5p having agreed to buy US company Entone in deal valued worth £46.7m. Analysts at N+1 Singer said “Entone looks to be a good strategic fit and significantly enhances Amino’s presence in the crucial North American market”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T21:25:54.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
