Related Topics Kenya: Phyllis Wakiaga to Replace Betty Maina At KAM \n\"Very soon you will see us arrest the big fishes in this war. We will not focus this war on goods sold in small kiosks but from those big manufacturers,\" said Kigathe. \n\"We want to pursue international relations with friendly countries so that we can know the contents of the containers before they land at our ports and if they are really genuine,\" he added. \nThe agency chair noted that businessmen have been falsely importing goods meant for transit to neighbouring countries and later diverting them into the country. \nKigathe said ACA will start profiling clearing agents and shipping lines that have been frequently used in the transportation of fake products into the country. \n\"We need to win this war if we are to stop this erosion of job creation brought about by the counterfeit goods. The existence of this problem is causing a gap on our income,\" said Kigathe. \nKigathe spoke on Friday as the country joined the rest of the world in celebrating the global anti-counterfeit day in Mombasa. \nIndustrialisation Principle Secretary Wilson Songa who was the chief guest led the destruction of cigarettes worth over Sh50 million, as the country reiterated its commitment to stop the illicit trade. \nSonga said the country's manufacturing sector had taken a blow due to the proliferation of counterfeit goods circulating in the markets. \n\"Kenya will not be a dumping ground for these goods,\" said Songa. \nThe destruction was done at the Mombasa's Claywork s, at a function also attended by industry players and the Kenya Association of Manufacturers. \nEnd.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T00:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T15:17:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
