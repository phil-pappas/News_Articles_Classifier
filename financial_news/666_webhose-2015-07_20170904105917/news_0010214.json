In April, it expanded by 0.6 percent, or one tenth of a percentage point less than was originally reported, it added.\nCompared with the same month a year earlier, Latin America's second biggest economy expanded by 1.5 percent. That compared with a rate of 2.1 percent in April and was the slowest pace of expansion since August of last year, the data showed.\nSeparate data from the institute showed that the adjusted rate of unemployment held at 4.4 percent in June.
