Just wait a week. Share on twitter by John Davidson There's a philosophical debate raging in my household, and it's about progress, the march of human history, and Sony's new Android TVs.\nAdelgunde​ and I are on the hunt for a new TV, you see. We got our current Sony roughly a decade ago, and ever since then the only \"upgrades\" it had have come not from the manufacturer but from me, mainly in the form of hot glue, gaffer tape and cable tie patches to hold the old dear together, and in the form of an external HDMI switch to account for the proliferation of video sources in the intervening years.\nBut cable ties, indispensable as they are, will only get you so far in life, and the time has come to get a new one. The question is, do we want one that constantly patches itself, the way a mobile phone does? Or would it be better to get one that's a little more static, one that gets updated only every decade or so when it gets replaced?\nI'm in the former camp. Every time I turn the TV on, I want a little notification to appear somewhere, telling me that such and such an app has upgraded itself to the latest version. I don't even care if it's a better version, as long as it's a new version. And every now and then, no less than twice a year, I want my TV to tell me I need to reboot it in 30 seconds, right in the middle of some World Cup final, to perform a total and totally necessary system upgrade.\nCould anything feel more like human progress than a TV that is in a continuous state of upgrade? Forget watching the kids grow up. I want to see my TV grow up before my eyes.\nAdelgunde doesn't quite see it that way. If we get a TV that is constantly buzzing and beeping with stupid updates, she says, she'll move out.\nSo I don't know where that leaves me with regard to Sony's new Android TVs, quite possibly the most dynamic, updatable TVs ever to grace the market. I only reviewed one of them last week, a $12,000, 75-inch Ultra High-Definition X9400C, and I swear that in the intervening days there has already been at least one update to deal with one of the few gripes I had with it. Apparently it now has Netflix. Last week it didn't.\nWelcome to Android. Yeehaw!\n Not just an oversized version of Android Sony is the first, but hopefully won't be the last, TV maker to release a TV running Google's new Android TV operating system, a variant on its smartphone and tablet operating system that's been optimised to be viewed on a big screen.\nAndroid TV isn't just an oversized version of Android. The whole way you operate it is different from a phone or tablet, and has more in common with other smart TV operating system than with phones. You can't make calls with the thing, other than maybe with something like Skype (which I don't recall seeing last week but which is probably there already).\nBut what you can do is run Android games and entertainment apps on it, and that fact alone makes this a big deal.\nAt the moment the app store is being carefully curated by Google, to make sure any Android apps in there have had their interface rewritten for the big screen and for remote controls. This means Android TV doesn't have quite so many apps regular Android. Last week there were only a few hundred, but by the time you read this there will probably be billions of apps there now, any number of which will be able to do exactly what you always wanted to do with your TV. This is Android, after all.\nI had only three or four hours in front of the new Sony, in a brightly lit room, so there are some things I can't answer about it. Even if I could, the answers would soon be out of date. Like, can you record live TV onto an attached USB drive? As I write this you can't, but by the time you read this you might be able to. It's listed as an upcoming update.\nBut I can tell you that Android TV, even in its early incarnation, is an extremely easy operating system to use, even for people who don't use Android phones. And despite the modestly stocked App store, it also looks like it's going to be a very well supported by third-party app developers. Doubtless there will be all the apps you might expect – Netflix, Quickflix, the various catchup TV services – and doubtless there will be thousands of apps you might not expect.\nKodi, the greatest home theatre app ever written, is already there, which is reason enough for me to want one. I had to cable-tie a small Windows PC to the back of my current Sony to get Kodi. With Sony's new Android TV, I'll be able to get a fresh version of the app every other week.\nIf only Adelgunde could be so easily upgraded, to a model that loves constant upgrades the way I do.\nI see the peril in that statement.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DLLabs"], "published": "2015-07-13T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:07:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
