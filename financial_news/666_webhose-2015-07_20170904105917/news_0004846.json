Getty Images by Vesna Poljak Global bond fund manager Pimco has endorsed equities and corporate credit in its latest take on asset allocation because it believes neither asset class to be expensive if central banks keep the pace of interest rate tightening slow.\nPimco says interest rates will indeed rise, but emphasises investors need to be aware this cycle is different. The asset manager refers to a \"new neutral\" where the so-called neutral rate (neither contractionary or expansionary) is lower than in historical cycles, and inflation stays low at the same time.\nIn the past week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney and United States Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen have both conveyed their intention to raise interest rates – in the US as soon as this year – but stressed that any further increases would come gradually. Dr Yellen begins a two-day congressional testimony in Washington on Wednesday.\nThis is important because it supports a positive view of two asset classes routinely dismissed as expensive in current conditions – shares and corporate bonds or corporate hybrids. Indeed, Pimco advocates overweight positions for both, and is underweight government bonds, or core fixed income. It is staying bullish on the US dollar.\nDeveloped market equities are forecast to return 4 per cent to 5 per cent. European equities are particularly attractive, because \"the trend toward increased dividend payout and a higher equity risk premium provide a good backdrop for superior returns\".\n\"European equities offer high levels of earnings yields and valuations are lower relative to history. We think a resolution of the Greece crisis would remove a source of uncertainty and allow the market to outperform,\" Pimco's findings, published on Wednesday, say.\nFinancials stocks, hybrid securities and subordinated debt are suggested for a start. \"We believe European banks are now far advanced in raising capital and in reaching some degree of normalisation in yields, and the shape of the yield curve should lead to higher profitability, which is already buoyed by the cheap funding the European Central Bank continues to provide through sustained quantitative easing.\"\nJapan, China and India's sharemarkets are also singled out for being attractive – Japan, for example, is touted as having among the best earnings growth momentum of any developed market. And Pimco is not deterred by the correction in Chinese shares, highlighting a buying opportunity for H-class shares which are Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong.\n On the investor's analysis, Australian equities are trading on a price-earnings ratio adjusted for the cycle of 18.3 times, indicating more competitive value than equities in the US, which are trading on a similarly adjusted P/E of 23.2 times.\nSurveying the risks to its outlook, Pimco warns: \"...while we do not expect a major recession and continue to expect central banks to go 'all in' to support growth, should a recession occur when major global central banks are all operating at or near the zero bound and with already bloated balance sheets, they may have little room to manoeuvre to engage counter-cyclical policies\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:08:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
