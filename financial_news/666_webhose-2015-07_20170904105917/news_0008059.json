They didn’t disclose financial details.\nThe deal could turn Mengniu into China’s largest seller of baby milk powder. Danone had a 10.3 percent share of China’s milk formula market in 2013, behind Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. with 11.1 percent and Nestle SA with 10.6 percent, according to Euromonitor International data. Mengniu is ranked sixth with a 6.1 percent.\nMengniu shares have risen 19 percent in Hong Kong so far this year, outperforming the Hang Seng Index’s 7 percent rise. Yashili’s shares gained 1.8 percent year to date. Mengniu fell 0.7 percent today as of 9:31 a.m., while Yashili gained 1.3 percent.\nDanone, whose Dumex’s business in China was fined in 2013 in a government price-fixing probe, already owns a 25 percent of Yashili, after agreeing to pay HK$4.39 billion for the stake in October. Mengniu controls 51 percent of Yashili.\nMengniu is controlled by state-owned Cofco Corp., China’s largest food company that in May was said to have invited investment banks to submit proposals for a possible group restructuring .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T09:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T05:01:15.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
