This \"may have created a skewed damages horizon for the jury,\" he said.\nHe set a new trial only on the issue of damages for Sept. 14 in Tyler, where Smartflash is based.\nApple, its law firm and Smartflash's law firm did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nShares of Apple fell 1.8 percent to $123.43 in morning trading.\nSmartflash accused Apple in a May 2013 lawsuit of infringing patents for accessing and storing songs, videos and games, enabling the Cupertino, California-based company to sell more of its iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch products.\nThe lawsuit said Patrick Racz, a co-inventor of Smartflash's patents, had discussed some of his ideas in 2000 with officials of a European company, including Augustin Farrugia, who later became a senior director at Apple.\nSmartflash originally sought damages of $852 million.\nThe trial took place in the federal court for the Eastern District of Texas, a favorite for lawyers representing patent holders because of its reputation for high damages awards. Some companies generate most or all revenue through patent lawsuits.\nThe case is Smartflash LLC et al v. Apple Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, No. 13-00447.
