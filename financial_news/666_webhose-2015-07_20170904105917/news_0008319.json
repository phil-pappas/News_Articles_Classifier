Position: None \nGM Driving to Higher Ground Originally published at 10:17 A.M. EDT on July 23, 2015 \nDo wonders never cease? \nThe inexorable share price decline of General Motors ( GM - Get Report ) should now be stemmed after this morning's solid beat. \nAdjusted earnings per share of $1.29 were 20 cents better than consensus expectations principally due to strength in North America. \nEqually important, EBIT came in at $2.9 billion, which was $500 million ahead of forecasts, and operating margins set a company record at 7.5%. Imagine what would happen if Europe improved! \nCiting an expected second-half improvement in profits and cash flow, GM sees sustainable China joint venture profits, which have been a question mark moving forward. \nI see a steady improvement in the company's return on capital and profits in 2016, with EPS close to $5.75, which would be well ahead of this year's estimate of $4.60 per share. \nWith an historically low valuation of less than 6x next year, a dividend yield of 4.7% and a free cash flow yield estimated at above 15% for 2016, I am sticking with this undervalued stock, which seems to be more than discounting \"peak autos.\" \nI have been a consistent buyer of GM on the recent weakness and will add with a limit at $31.75 today.
