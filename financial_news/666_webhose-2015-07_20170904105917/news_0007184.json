He chooses to gamble billions of dollars on casinos rather than tens of millions in them.\nBut the loss of the right to develop and operate the latest casino in Queensland might indicate that the Crown boss needs to divert his attention from Mariah Carey 's assets to his casino business.\nFor starters, the Macau downturn could kick up a gear if the sharemarket meltdown does to the mass market gamblers what the Chinese government crackdown on corruption has done to high rollers.\nMelco Crown shares have more than halved since last year's peak.\nAdvertisement And one thing that has probably missed the attention of the average investor is that all six Macau casino operators face renewal of their licences by 2022. This includes Melco Crown.\nIn February, Packer was basking in the glow of his new venture in the Philippines, having spent $70 million on the promo video by Hollywood filmmaker Martin Scorsese , and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro​ .\nThe publicly listed Melco Crown Philippines stock has plunged about 65 per cent since December, indicating that this particular \"bet on China\" – or more specifically Chinese high rollers – is not going to plan.\nIt highlights why Crown was so keen to play in a tourism hot spot like Queensland. It is the sort of place where a casino operator like Crown needs to play if it wants to cap the leakage of Chinese high rollers who are having to look further afield than Macau.\n\"This is going to be the next mining boom,\" said Echo boss Matt Bekier​ , basking in his Queensland win. Packer could not have put it better himself. Ouch.\nThe bad bet And it looks like one of Packer's most stinging losses has come from a bet he took off the table.\nMore than two years have passed since Packer sold his 10 per cent stake in Echo to forge his own path in Sydney and ultimately win the right to build a rival casino operation at Barangaroo.\nThe sale crystallised​ a loss of about $38 million.\nAnd with Echo shares rocketing to record highs, the sale has cost him another $130 million in potential upside.\nThat's big money even by Packer standards.\nThe long bet At least he was allowed to play. Does anybody remember Echo's other potential suitor, Genting​?\nThree years have now passed since the Malaysian casino operator applied to the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (IGLA) to lift its stake in Echo above the 10 per cent cap.\nCrown got the green light more than two years ago. Genting​ is still waiting.\n\"The Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority continues to work with Genting Hong Kong in respect of their application to be authorised to hold a major stake in Echo Entertainment Group Limited. The matter remains under consideration and the authority will make an announcement as soon as it is in a position to do so,\" a spokesman said on Tuesday.\nASX Ole! It has been a sleepy confession season as our listed corporates prepare their fiscal year earnings for public consumption. So Brissie engineering group Ausenco​ could be forgiven for missing the fact that its share price had doubled in a matter of weeks to 52¢.\nLuckily, the ASX issued a speeding ticket on Monday. This was closely followed by a Ausenco trading halt and the news that its new Spanish partner, Duro Felguera​, will be buying up a further 10 per cent of Ausenco​ at 60¢ a share.\nThat would account for a big lift in the share price wouldn't it?\nAlas no. Ausenco​ said that discussions about the $10 million placement \"remained incomplete and, in the company's opinion, confidential\".\nIt blamed \"uninformed commentary\" on social media speculating that the Spaniards might launch a takeover bid.\nAnd who can blame the speculation given the presence of Qantas veteran Peter Gregg on the Ausenco​ board.\nLook what the Spanish crew from ACS did to Leighton Holdings last year when Gregg was ensconced as Hamish Tyrwhitt 's deputy.\nGregg trousered about $10 million after that Spanish takeover.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T22:09:01.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
