They had forecast an average net profit of AED1.44 billion. \nLoans and advances grew by 16 percent to AED148.9 billion at the end of June compared to AED128.2 billion in the year earlier period. \nIn comparison overall UAE bank lending rose by 8.8 percent in June its highest rate this year according to central bank data. \nFGB's performance in recent quarters has been aided by a general improvement in the amount of provisions it has had to set aside to cover bad loans as the local economy has rebounded. That trend continued in the second quarter as provisions dropped 34 percent on an annual basis to 258 million dirhams. \nFor the first half of the year the bank's non-interest revenue remained a solid growth driver with its contribution to total operating income reaching 31 percent at the end of June. Core fee income strengthened by 9 percent on an annual basis to reach AED978 million at the end of June. \nBanks have squeezed higher revenue from fees for their products and services as net interest margins have tightened as a result of several years of low interest rates. \nReflecting this trend FGB said net interest and Islamic financing income for the second quarter dropped by 2 percent on an annual basis to reach 1.61 billion dirhams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T13:37:02.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
