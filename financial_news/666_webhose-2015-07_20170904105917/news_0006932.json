Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett Tony Abbott and his MPs are delighted to have dragged Bill Shorten before the royal commission into trade union corruption. The hearings remind the public of Shorten's union background and detail the sorts of deals between unions and businesses that are so common in Australia's contorted system of workplace relations. They might still seem far more dubious to the industrially innocent. Not that the Abbott government is planning to do anything much about changing that environment.\nIndustrial relations remains a no-go area politically for the Coalition. So the latest polls should remind the Abbott government instead of what is even more difficult to stage manage. Despite all of Labor's obvious woes and weaknesses, a Shorten-led opposition is still well ahead of the government. The public remains extremely disenchanted with both options but voters are clearly unconvinced by the Prime Minister's attempts to renovate the look of his government. That's even though Abbott appears willing to rule out more than the most limited changes for any second term, as well as the rest of this one. All the talk about tax reform or federation reform and competition reform will mostly remain just that.\nAbbott's preferred tactic domestically is to focus more of his energy into fighting another successful scare campaign against Labor. Putting politics first is considered the necessary downpayment for managing to get even a lukewarm endorsement by the community for a second term with, at best, a diminished majority. That is certainly not all the fault of this Prime Minister, given the depth and breath of political resistance, the decimated tax revenue and the dramatic decline in the terms of trade and national income.\nBut it all threatens a very meagre policy legacy for an Abbott government.\nBasic promise Abbott's basic promise for the first term was to \"clean up Labor's mess\" – translated into abolishing the carbon tax and the mining tax and turning back the boats. These were necessary but never sufficient achievements for political or economic momentum in 2015 and beyond. And under the trappings of office the continuing focus on that agenda can make Abbott sound more like a successful leader of the opposition than a sure-footed prime minister leading a forward-looking government with a strong sense of policy direction. On the economy, Abbott is nowhere near as good as he must be at selling future possibilities rather than trading on past grievances.\nSo the harsh view is that the main appeal of the Coalition is not so much its potential to be a really good government but that it would not be nearly as bad as a return of Labor. Privately, most Liberals believe this appeal will be enough to get the Coalition through the next election, as long as its ministers don't do anything too challenging and can sell a modestly positive story in a few key areas. They will be heartened by the latest unemployment figures, steady at 6 per cent. That also explains why the government's second budget was so different from the first, concentrating on giving tax breaks to small business, rather than spending reductions or long-term reforms.\nThe catch is that the chaos in the Chinese sharemarket, complete with yet another alarming plunge in iron ore prices, should remind us all why this won't be enough to get the economy through the risks of the next few years. It's true the radical shift in the outlook for commodity prices, combined with the end of the resources construction boom, meant Abbott won office at a much more difficult time to be able to match promises with reality.\n More urgent But in such an instantly connected world it only becomes more urgent for a country to adapt to the sort of large structural shifts and choices necessary to underpin a modern and resilient national economy. And for a government to be able to explain coherently and persuasively why all this is necessary, why it will pay off over the longer term and why the overall direction makes sense. Despite haphazard attempts to explain, the combination of Abbott and Joe Hockey as Treasurer is nowhere near consistent or compelling enough in arguing such a case, let alone coming up with the policies to back it.\nThe government is not tone-deaf in all areas. The tough-sounding approach on national security issues is popular given the threat, although Abbott often over-reaches in language and instinctive combativeness. For example, the continuing virulence of the Prime Minister's attack on the ABC over Q&A and the \"ban\" on ministerial appearances on the program now look an overblown response rather than reasonable criticism.\nBut it's the paucity of the economic reform agenda that explains why the big business community is so frustrated as the stakes become ever higher. Not that Liberal strategists are paying much attention to such complaints, or to the various prescriptions for policy reform in areas from tax to industrial relations to skills development. After all, the experience of the Labor government is still seared into the consciousness of Australian boardrooms. That leaves the Coalition – for better or worse.\nNor can business just blame a lacklustre economy on the government. Their own investment decisions and risk-avoidance strategies play into it, as a frustrated Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens points out. The free-trade agreements with China, Korea and Japan offer incredible opportunities to Australian businesses, but only if businesses are willing or able to take them.\nThose combined trends offer the real choice for the future: an urgent change of approach, or a sluggish economy indefinitely and a growing concern the easy years are now well and truly over but with little sense of what comes next.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-07-09T11:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:04:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
