According to GE Capital’s recently released “Trucking Industry Economic Outlook Survey,” national and local carriers are finding fewer idle trucks available for capacity, and as a result, “companies have gotten smarter about the contracts and the routes that they take, and how they match those with the businesses available.” OMVS CEO Robert Wilson said this important finding plays right into the shared economy business model now under development. “The GE Capital survey shows truckers are putting more time and effort into selecting routes in order to optimize their business and profits. And our own market research matches the survey’s results. Both show there is a great need in the industry for our shared economy model and when it is released, we’re optimistic our revenues will throttle up quickly as truckers discover how this unique platform will positively impact their business.” The GE Capital survey also revealed other encouraging industry signs that bode well for OMVS’s shared economy model. Just under half of all respondents believed the trucking business will expand in the next 12 months. More than a third expected to increase their capital spending in the next year and just under 50 percent planned to add new equipment. OMVS continues to recruit trucking partners for its online platform as analysts predict sales in the shared economy could reach $335 billion by 2025. On the Move Systems, Inc. (OMVS) is focused on the development of cutting-edge technology across a broad spectrum of industries. The company is currently exploring new online tools to reduce costs and increase convenience in the tourism and travel industry and exploring new opportunities in trucking.
