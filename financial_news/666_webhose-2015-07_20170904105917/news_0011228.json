The company said the modernisation will increase production capacity by 48% and result in Kitimat becoming one of the lowest-cost smelters in the world. It is now focused on safely ramping up towards its annual production rate of 420,000 tonnes. \nThe modernised smelter, which was delivered in line with the revised schedule and budget, is powered exclusively by Rio Tinto's wholly-owned hydro power facility and uses the company's proprietary AP40 smelting technology which will effectively halve the smelter's overall emissions. \nAluminium chief executive Alf Barrios said: \"At full production, Kitimat will be one of the most efficient, greenest and lowest-cost smelters in the world. \"Positioned in British Columbia on the west coast of Canada, Kitimat is well placed to serve rapidly growing demand for aluminium in the Asia-Pacific region and to serve the North American market.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T11:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T11:49:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
