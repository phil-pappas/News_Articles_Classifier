Technical negotiations would be wrapped up by Friday, with \"follow up\" discussions over the weekend under exceptional circumstances, he added. \n\"Both sides aim to reach a deal as soon as possible,\" the official said. \nEuropean Commission officials dismissed that timetable, saying European mission chiefs were already on the ground and talks had begun on Monday. But they made clear the creditors would not be stampeded into a rushed agreement without detailed reform commitments in writing. \nCommission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said there was \"no fixed deadline\" for the conclusion of a Memorandum of Understanding, and if all parties kept to commitments made at a July 13 euro summit, \"an agreement by the second fortnight of August is possible\". \nGreek officials were at pains to play down what they see as the humiliating and intrusive aspects of the talks - access to ministries, the right to examine accounts and question civil servants, and the visible presence of the negotiators in Athens. \nThe finance ministry official said there had been no organizational issues and all discussions were taking place at the institutions' residence. When required, creditors' representatives had met with Greek officials at the Bank of Greece and the State General Accounting Office. \nEU officials said security and logistical issues had delayed the start of the talks, originally planned for last Friday. \nMORE REFORMS \nThe Greek official said suggestions that Greece needed to pass further reform legislation before a bailout deal were not justified by the euro summit statement or subsequent exchanges. \nHowever, euro zone officials made clear that Athens must enact measures to curb early retirement and close tax loopholes for farmers before any new aid is disbursed. Greece needs more finance by Aug. 20, when it owes a 3.5 billion euro payment to the European Central Bank. \nWhen Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' radical leftist Syriza movement won power in January, it initially sought to scrap the previous bailout, reverse austerity measures demanded by the creditors and exclude the IMF from any future talks. \nWhen negotiations on further aid eventually began, they were moved to Brussels, with no access to Greek ministries. Tsipras kept trying to escalate the talks to a political level to avoid detailed technical documents setting out reform obligations. \nHanging over the new talks is the legacy of Varoufakis, whom Tsipras sidelined in the final phase of the talks before accepting even more stringent bailout terms this month. \nThe Marxist academic resigned after Tsipras rejected his proposals for radical steps to create a parallel payment system to get around the closure of Greek banks and the imposition of capital controls on June 28. \nBut he continues to create problems for the premier by denouncing the bailout agreement and accusing the creditors of having treated Greece like a colony. \nEU Commission spokeswoman Andreeva denied as \"false and unfounded\" allegations by Varoufakis that the creditors had taken control of the finance ministry's general secretariat for public revenue. \nHe made the charge in explaining why he had devised a covert system for hacking into citizens' tax codes. \n\"The Commission and the IMF only provide technical assistance to the tax administration, but certainly do not control the secretary general for public revenues,\" Andreeva said. \"Alleging that the troika would be controlling the secretary general for public revenues is simply not true.\" \nA Greek government official stressed that Varoufakis' plan had never been carried out, and no laws had been broken. \n(Writing by Paul Taylor)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:42:10.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
