The positive response of our people to change, the continuing confidence of our customers in Balfour Beatty's expertise and the first signs of improving cash performance reinforce my conviction in the Group's long-term success.\" \nLast August, Balfour Beatty's rival Carillion (Other OTC: CIOIF - news ) ended its merger interest following an offer rejection for the third time. However, it stressed that it reserved the right to bring a new offer under the terms of the City code on takeovers and mergers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T11:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T12:51:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
