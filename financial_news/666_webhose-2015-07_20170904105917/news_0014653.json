He was eventually allowed to use a crew seat, the Brisbane Courier Mail reported. \nEtihad's lawyers last week attempted to have the case thrown out but District Court Judge Fleur Kingham refused their request and ordered Bassos to undergo a medical assessment. \nThe Abu Dhabi-based airline said it would continue to fight the lawsuit. \n\"Etihad Airways will continue to oppose the action and now that Mr Bassos will finally face a medical assessment in December 2015, as directed by court, we believe that the matter will proceed to an early conclusion,\" the carrier said in a statement Friday. \n\"The safety and comfort of Etihad Airways passengers and crew is of paramount importance and the airline has a zero tolerance policy towards unruly behaviour.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T05:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T06:04:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
