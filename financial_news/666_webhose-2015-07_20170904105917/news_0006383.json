The gap (NYSE: GPS - news ) between wage growth and inflation, which stood at just 0.1pc in May, is expected to climb to 3.2pc - its widest since September 2007. \n\"With consumer prices inflation still hugging zero, real wage inflation of 3pc year-on-year is very robust and great news for consumer spending growth,\" said Alan Clarke, an economist at ScotiaBank. \nLast month's data showed private sector pay is already growing at a pace of 3.3pc. Stripping out bonus payments, pay is expected to rise by 3pc, representing the strongest expansion since January 2009. \nWhile economists cautioned that the massive jump in pay growth was mainly driven by the effect of a sharp fall in bonuses in February dropping out of the calculation, most expect wages to continue rising at a consistent pace of 3pc by the end of this year, slowly moving towards pre-crisis growth of 4.5pc by 2017. \nSamuel Tombs at Capital Economics, said: \"I think pay growth around 3pc is sustainable for the next couple of years, with the risks mostly to the upside given that most recoveries have tended to see above average growth in productivity. \nGiven how strong business investment has been over the past couple of years, there's scope for it to come back quite strong.\" \nExperts said stronger productivity growth, which has been described as \"missing piece\" of Britain's growth puzzle, is the key to unlocking higher living standards. \nStephen Nickell, an economist at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), Britain's fiscal watchdog, has described predictions for stronger productivity growth as an \"act of faith\" . \nLast week's Budget presented a mixed outlook for wages, with pay caps of 1pc for around 5m workers in the public sector restraining wage growth until the end of the decade. The Institute for Fiascal Studies (IFS) warned that the cap could lead to a talent drain as workers look for higher paid jobs in the private sector. \nLast month's data showed private sector pay is already growing at a pace of 3.3pc \nThe OBR said its judgment that productivity growth would recover to pre-crisis growth rates was a \"key\" one. In its latest forecast, the OBR said: \"If productivity fails to recover as predicted but wage growth continues to accelerate, the MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) could be forced to raise interest rates more quickly, which could in turn have a negative impact on consumer spending and housing investment. Alternatively, lower productivity growth could mean that wage growth falls short of our forecast.\" \nThe Chancellor's decision to set a new national living wage has also come under fire. While George Osborne claimed \"Britain's pay rise\" would offset cuts to tax credits, analysts were less certain. \n\"At best this looks to be optimistic thinking and represents a major gamble,\" said Andrew Goodwin, an economist at Oxford Economics. \nBritain's unemployment rate is expected to remain at 5.5pc in the quarter to May, with slower employment growth reflecting a tighter labour market. Inflation, meanwhile, is forecast to have fallen back to zero in June. \nStronger pay growth will raise speculation that the Bank of England will begin pondering interest rate rises. While some policymakers, including Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, have hinted that they could start calling for rates to rise from a record low of 0.5pc in the coming months, Andy Haldane, its chief economist, has said the recent surge in pay was not a sign that the economy is starting to overheat. \"Wage growth is causing some fluttering, but not in this dovecote,\" he said in a speech last month . \nEconomists said it was unlikely that the Bank would start raising rates this year. \"We don't need to stamp on the brakes immediately,\" said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank (Xetra: CBK100 - news ) . \"In early 2016, once we start see to see the CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) inflation rate back to 1pc is when the Bank will probably think about starting to pull the trigger.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T00:05:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
