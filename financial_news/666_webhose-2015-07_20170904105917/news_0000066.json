Nic Walker Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Sydney's median house price has climbed higher than London to top $1 million, Domain Group figures show.\nThe 22.9 per cent increase in the year to June to $1,000,616 – the quickest pace of gain since at least the late 80s – put the NSW capital above London , where the equivalent was $900,000, but still below New York , where it was $1.5 million, and Paris, where it was about $2 million.\nThe rise – from $814,285 a year earlier – did nothing to dampen the city's attraction for investors, Domain senior economist Andrew Wilson said.\nEven though rental yields were falling as rental increases failed to keep up with rising dwelling prices, a better return than from alternatives such as term deposits, kept drawing investors into the sector, even with unheard-of price levels. Vacancy rates were holding. But the good news for investors was bad news for first-home buyers as it showed homes in the NSW capital were moving further out of reach.\n\"Those yields are still well ahead of deposit rate, so that's got to be attractive for investors,\" Dr Wilson said. \"We're ticking a lot of boxes for investors at the moment. The only box not being ticked is the entry-level price, which is climbing.\"\nThe next-fastest rate of growth after Sydney's houses came in Sydney apartments, which jumped 13.9 per cent to a median $656,078 from $575,824 a year earlier.\nInterest rates a drawcard Still, the figures by Fairfax Media-owned Domain also showed that the record-low interest rates were drawing investors to Melbourne, where annual house price growth was up 10.3 per cent to a median $668,030 and apartment price growth was up 4.5 per cent, putting the median figure at $443,549.\n \"Investors are now starting to target that Melbourne market,\" Dr Wilson said. \"We've seen a combination of what was the strongest auction market in 40 years in Melbourne, transferred to price growth.\"\nA surprise performer was Canberra. The nation's capital enjoyed a 5.4 per cent jump in house prices, even as apartments in Walter Burley Griffin's master-planned town shed 6.8 per cent of their value.\n\"The Canberra market improved for a third consecutive quarter on a better economic climate and a more user-friendly federal budget,\" Dr Wilson said.\nIn Brisbane, house prices rose a pedestrian 1.9 per cent and apartment prices shed 3.2 per cent, as part of an adjustment process the state was going through, he said.\n\"The Queensland state economy is still pulling that market back,\" he said.\nAn adjustment was also inevitable in Perth, but the 1.4 per cent decline in house prices and the 2.1 per cent fall in apartments was a \"reasonable result\", Dr Wilson said.\n\"That's a pretty good result for the Perth market,\" he said. \"It is a weakening market, but that weakness seems to be a modest outcome.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-07-22T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:07:59.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
