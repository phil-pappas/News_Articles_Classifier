Daniel Munoz Share on twitter by Joanna Mather Tax breaks would be more generous for bank savings but reduced for negatively geared investment property, under a sweeping plan to make the taxation of savings fairer.\nKPMG proposes a 25 per cent discount on bank savings, net rental income and unfranked dividends, in one of the first submissions to the federal government's tax reform process to go beyond general principles.\nThe big four accounting firm proposes a 26 per cent company tax rate, indexing thresholds to abolish bracket creep, a 15 per cent GST, as well as phasing out capital gains tax perks for family trusts and making death a trigger for the tax on certain assets.\nKPMG chairman Peter Nash said the firm had come up with 60 creative yet and achievable recommendations for genuine tax reform.\n\"The nature of this reform is difficult and it will take time to implement,\" he said. \"But we need to get on with that journey.\"\nSubmissions to the government's tax and retirement incomes white paper process, out of which will emerge a tax policy for the Coalition to take to the next election, closed on Friday.\nTax experts and the business community were buoyed by last week's meeting of federal and state leaders , where the premiers of NSW and South Australia managed to break some of the political deadlock surrounding tax reform.\nThe capital gains tax discount would also be reduced from 50 per cent to 25 per cent. Combined, these measures would make negatively gearing investment property less attractive.\n KPMG chairman Peter Nash, head of tax David Linke and tax partner Grant Wardell-Johnson. Daniel Munoz But it would be a boon for people earning interest on bank savings, which now attract no discount and can be taxed at rates as high as 70 per cent.\nOn the personal tax front, KPMG's proposal is to adjust tax brackets upwards according to growth in average full-time earnings.\nThis would help tackle bracket creep, which delivers revenue to the government but is a disincentive to work and a drag on the economy.\nThe bottom tax rate would be 15 per cent on incomes of between zero and $27,000. The top rate of 45 per cent would kick in at $160,000. The tax-free threshold would be abolished but low-income earners would get offsets.\nThe company tax rate would be reduced to 28 per cent in 2020 and 26 per cent in 2023. The superannuation system would be reviewed. In the interim, lifetime caps on the amount of tax-advantaged money people can put into super should be considered.\nAs an interim measure consideration would be given to life-time caps on non-concessional contributions and superannuation balances.\nThe KPMG plan relies on the $42 billion or so generated by changes to the GST to fund an overhaul of the rest of the system.\nMr Nash said KPMG had not done detailed modelling because the firmed wanted to encourage an open and frank debate about the conceptual underpinnings of the system.\nHe nonetheless insisted the changes would be revenue neutral at the very least and would include compensation for a GST rise to low-income households.\n\"There is nothing in here that we believe is naive, in terms of its capacity to be implemented.\"\nThere would be a flat universal payroll tax of 5 per cent and three new company structures for small businesses.\nStamp duty would be abolished on residential and commercial property transfers.\nInstead there would be a new property services tax to replace land tax, insurance and emergency service levies. The tax – rates for which are not given even as estimates – would be based on the square metre value of the land and buildings. People aged over 60 would be able to defer payment until deal or sale of the property.\nDividend imputation would be retained, with KPMG considering change to be politically untenable.\nUnfranked dividends would be afforded the 25 per cent discount to tackle the existing bias toward investment in Australian shares, which stems from the imputation system.\nThe KPMG plan requires the states and territories to hand their taxation powers to the Australian Tax Office. They would be given cash rewards for doing so.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-07-26T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T00:09:39.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
