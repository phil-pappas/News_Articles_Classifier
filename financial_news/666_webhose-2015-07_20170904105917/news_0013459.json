The index is projected to improve to 16 in September, with big companies across all industries planning to boost capital expenditure by 9.3 percent in the year through March 2016, the BOJ said.\nImproved business sentiment could help buttress an economy that BNP Paribas SA says may have slowed this quarter on weaker production and exports . The challenge for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is to get companies to follow through on their investment plans and plow more of their record cash hoard into the world’s third-biggest economy.\n“Japan’s economy is gradually recovering,” Hiroaki Muto, an economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Management Co, said before the report. “Business confidence should get better along with it.”\nExpansion in Japan’s economy is forecast to slow to 1.4 percent in the second quarter from an annualized 3.9 percent in the first three months of the year, a survey shows. JPMorgan Chase & Co. economist Masamichi Adachi predicts the economy will slow to a standstill , while BNP’s Hiroshi Shiraishi says a contraction is possible.\nEconomic Headwinds Abe is trying to sustain a recovery while reining in the world’s heaviest debt burden through spending constraints. More than two years since the Bank of Japan began record monetary stimulus to spur 2 percent inflation, consumer price gains are barely above zero.\nSentiment among large non-manufacturers rose to 23 from 19 three months earlier. The increase in capital expenditure planned by big companies across all industries this fiscal year compares with a cut of 1.2 percent projected three months earlier.\nLarge manufacturers based their plans on the assumption the yen will average 115.62 per dollar in the year through March 2016. The yen was at 122.42 against the dollar as of 9:04 a.m. in Tokyo.\nA weaker yen boosts overseas profits when repatriated to Japan while it increases the cost of imports.\nAbe urged Japanese business leaders in June to make “bold” decisions and step up investment spending. Companies held a record 241 trillion yen of cash and deposits at the end of March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T03:26:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
