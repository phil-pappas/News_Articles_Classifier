NLNG, located on the Atlantic (Shanghai: 600558.SS - news ) basin, has the capacity for 12 trains. \nNLNG, owned by Nigerian state oil firm NNPC, Royal Dutch Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) , France's Total (Swiss: FP.SW - news ) and Italy's Eni (Swiss: ENI.SW - news ) , has the capacity to produce 22 million tonnes of LNG a year. The company, set up 15 years ago to produce the gas for export, did not give current capacity figures. \nIt has long-term supply contracts with Spain's Repsol (Amsterdam: RP6.AS - news ) , Italy's Enel (Milan: ENEL.MI - news ) , Britain's BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) , France's GDF Suez (Swiss: GSZ.SW - news ) and Portugal's Galp. It also sells on the spot market. \nNigeria, one of the world's top-10 gas rich countries, has estimated reserves of 180 trillion cubit feet, Omotowa said, but it converts only about 1.5 trillion cubic feet per year to LNG. \nNLNG, which generates more than $10 billion in annual revenue, is also sponsoring the construction of the first major ship yard in Nigeria at a cost of $1.5 billion, in order to develop capacity for maintaining large vessels at home. \nOmotowa said LNG exports had not impacted domestic supply. The domestic gas market had been held back by a lack of infrastructure including a functional rail system to ferry gas around the country and government funding challenges, he said. \nGas demand in Africa's most populous nation is expected to rise to 3 billion standard cubic feet (scuf) per day by 2017 as gas-fired power plants ramp up generation, industry officials say. Demand has risen to 1.2 billion scuf per day, from 300 million six years ago.
