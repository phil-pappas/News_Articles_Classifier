Thank you, Ms. Cook; you may now begin. Katie Cook (Director - IR): Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin today's call I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website at NorfolkSouthern.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today's call will be posted on our website. Please be advised that during this call we may make certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results excluding certain adjustments -- that is, non-GAAP numbers -- have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section. Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfork Southern's CEO and President, Jim Squires. Jim Squires (President, CEO): Thank you, Katie. Good morning and welcome to Norfolk Southern's second-quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are our Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart. Now let's go straight to the financial results. Our reported second-quarter earnings were $1.41 per share, 21% lower than last year's record results. The decrease was largely due to lower coal volumes and lower fuel surcharge revenues. These are challenging conditions, but there is some good news, as our business mix undergoes a significant change. Our intermodal volumes topped last year's second-quarter record levels, and our merchandise items were up for the quarter as well despite pressure in the steel market. Moreover, revenue per unit excluding fuel surcharges was positive for merchandise as well as for intermodal, which was even more positive than the first quarter. Alan will provide more detail on our revenue for the second quarter and outlook for the remainder of 2015. I'm proud to report that our service improved significantly during the second quarter. Our composite service metric, an internal measure we used to assess network performance, is approaching 80%. And this quarter we will continue progress toward the higher service levels achieved in 2012 and 2013. We remain firmly committed to continued service improvement; and Mark will share the latest on our service and operations outlook. Marta will wrap up the presentations with a full review of our financial results. Before getting into the specifics, let me emphasize that we are confident in our long-term strategy and our prospects for growth and strong financials. We have a solid franchise and the right team in place to execute our strategy to be a top performer in the industry. On that note I will turn the program over to Alan, Mark, and Marta and will return with some closing comments before taking your questions. Alan? Alan Shaw (EVP, CMO): Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone. I'll begin by providing context to our long-term focus from a sales and marketing perspective, and then I'll review our second-quarter performance and our outlook for the balance of the year and beyond. 1 of 17", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T23:27:32.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
