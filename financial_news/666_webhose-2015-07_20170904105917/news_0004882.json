Belugas get wings thanks to €30m Airbus investment in Welsh factory By Alan Tovey | Telegraph – 19 minutes ago 1.36 0.00 \nFactory will be able to load aircraft wings onto Beluga (Brussels: BELU.BR - news ) planes in all weathers thanks to new loading dock \nAirbus has invested €30m (£20.9m) in a new loading dock at its plant in Wales, which will allow the company's distinctive Beluga cargo aircraft to transport wings to assembly plants in Europe in all weather conditions. \nThe move is part of a wider £2bn investment Airbus is making in the Broughton facility, which manufactures wings for all of Airbus' airliners. \nCurrently the Beluga - so named because it looks like the whale due to the ‘bloated’ fuselage that allows it to carry oversized cargo - is restricted as to when it can load the wings by prevailing weather conditions. \nAirbus Beluga \nIf gusts go above 30 knots, work has to be halted because the aircraft’s cargo doors act as a giant sail, making loading unsafe. \nThe new dock means loading operations are no longer exposed to the elements, allowing work to go ahead without delay. \nBeluga whale \nAirbus says this demonstrates the company’s commitment to the UK. \nIn May, Airbus weighed into the debate over Britain’s forthcoming referendum on EU membership , with Paul Kahn, head of Airbus UK, saying the aerospace company would reconsider future investment in the UK if the country were to leave the European Union. Airbus employs 16,000 people in Britain. \nChancellor George Osborne officially launched the facility on Friday with Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb. The tour of the Beluga dock coincided with the announcement of an order for a single A330 jet from China Southern Airways, a deal that was called “historic\" by the Chancellor. \nThe purchase was made possible by Britain’s recent decision to add the renminbi to the list of currencies supported by UK Export and Finance. \nGeorge Osborne screws some bolts into the wings of an Airbus on Friday \nThe sale is the first by an export credit agency anywhere in the world for a loan in Chinese offshore renminbi and opens up opportunities for UK exporters and their supply chain companies. \n• Renminbi trading in the UK is booming - and the Government loves it \n• London to become renminbi trading centre \n• It's time for Britain to become a nation of exporters \nUKEF is the country's export credit agency. It provides insurance to UK exporters against non-payment by their overseas buyers. In turn, it helps overseas buyers to purchase goods and services from UK exporters by guaranteeing or funding bank loans to finance their puchases. \nMr Osborne said: “This is a truly historic deal which paves the way for the best British companies to export much more easily to the Chinese market. \n“The UK is a world leader in financial innovation and I am determined that we become a centre for renminbi business so that many more of our brilliant exporters can benefit.” \nMr Crabb added: “The UK Government is making it easier for big employers like Airbus to do business in China, and that is great news for the economy of North Wales. \n\"Employers know that this country is business friendly and the kind of innovative arrangement put forward by UKEF is proof of that. \n\"It is particularly impressive to see the indoor facilities that have just been completed for the Beluga aircraft at Broughton. I hope that leads to ever busier order books for Airbus.” \n= Watch a preview of Friay's Royal International Air Tattoo at RAF Fairford =", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T17:48:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
