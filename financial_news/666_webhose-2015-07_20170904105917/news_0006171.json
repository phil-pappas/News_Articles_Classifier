UK rates have been at a record low of 0.5pc for more than six years and housebuilding stocks shuddered at the prospect of a rate hike. \nGavin Jago, of Peel Hunt, said “housebuilders’ share prices have reacted negatively to noise around interest rate rises”. However, Mr Jago added that the fundamentals for the sector remain positive and a gradual increase in interest rates should not have a material effect on housebuilders. “Interest rates are likely to be rising on the back of a strengthening economy and this should not be seen as a net negative for the sector.” \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) have endured a rollercoaster ride since the Budget last week when the reduction in the amount buy-to-let investors may be able to claim under mortgage interest deductibility rules would have on the sector knocked an average of 5pc off housebuilders. However, a day later they bounced back as investors fully digested the effects these changes would have on the sector. \nPersimmon fell 31p, or 1.5pc, to £19.83, Taylor Wimpey (Other OTC: TWODF - news ) was off 1.5pc at 189p, and Barratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) slipped 1.1pc to 634.5p. Mid-cap housebuilders also fell victim to Mr Carney’s comments. Bellway dropped 83p, or 3.5pc, to £23.05 and Bovis Homes (LSE: BVS.L - news ) slipped 3pc to £11.18. * UK house prices rise but autumn will be the 'true test' In the broader market, the euphoria that boosted equity markets on Monday disappeared as investors began to digest the terms of the Greek debt deal . “The key question is whether Alexis Tsipras can deliver on the necessary austerity legislation in order to receive the promised lifeline that Greece desperately needs,” Rebecca O’Keefe, of Interactive Investor said. Although broadly flat yesterday, the FTSE 100 (NasdaqGS: Z - news ) finished 15.80 points higher to 6,753.75. \nElsewhere, a closely-followed monthly survey of fund managers, revealed cash levels soared to their highest levels since the Lehman crisis in December 2008. High cash levels represented a trading “buy-signal” for European equities, Bank of America Merrill Lynch found, after polling 191 investors managing $510bn in assets earlier this month. However, the survey was conducted last week, before a deal was reached between Greece and eurozone leaders. * Greece news live: Germans back Osborne's fight against Juncker plan to bail-out Greece as IMF calls for more debt relief Back in London, energy stocks dragged Britain’s benchmark index lower in early afternoon as Iran and six global powers reached a landmark nuclear deal , lifting sanctions by the United States, European Union and the United Nations, and opening the door for additional Iranian oil supply. However, oil prices steadied in late trading, supporting shares such as BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) - up 6p to £10.77 - and Royal Dutch Shell A shares, which inched 20p higher to £18.38. \nDeutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) played the role of both friend and foe yesterday, upgrading Sky (LSE: SKY.L - news ) , while downgrading ITV . Given the demand for mobility, the bank believes online video is increasing fast and will open up five new income streams for pay-TV. As such, analysts say Sky (Other OTC: BSYBF - news ) is best positioned in Europe to capitalise on growth areas, including paid for mobility products and the DVD market moving online. \nHowever, Laurie Davison, of Deutsche Bank, reckons the market is stuck in Old Convergence theory, which predicted the demise of pay-TV. Nonetheless, the bank raised the stock from “hold” to “buy”, and lifted the target price by £5 to £15. Sky is also no longer constrained to the UK market, with underpenetrated German and Italian markets to pursue. \nMeanwhile, analysts failed to look as favourably on ITV (Other OTC: ITVPF - news ) , as Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock to “sell” from “hold” citing the group’s weakness online. Ms Davison said “ITV has been a relative laggard online, with only a 17pc share in online video ad spend”. Now (Other OTC: NWPN - news ) five years into their management turnaround, analysts say “ITV Studio’s organic growth rate has been disappointing”. Sky became FTSE 100 leader advancing 44p, or 4.1pc, to £11.22, while ITV was among the laggards, falling 0.8p to 275.4p. \nMeanwhile, Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS - news ) targeted the bookmakers, slashing the ratings of William Hill and Ladbrokes to “neutral” and “underperform”, respectively. Following last week’s budget, the bank updated their forecasts to take into account the increase in wage inflation . Analysts also expressed their concerns over regulation, the single biggest driver of earnings change for the sector, which they believe is being largely ignored in consensus earnings forecasts. Since 2012, William Hill and Ladbrokes have suffered earnings downgrades of 28pc and 46pc, respectively, in response to regulatory changes. * Battle over online gambling tax referred to Europe While Ed Birkin, of Credit Suisse, acknowledged the Conservative manifesto ahead of the general election in May was “the most sympathetic to the gaming industry”, negative rhetoric around the industry continues to build. Mr Birkin believes the government is facing pressure for further restrictions on gaming machines, pointing to a bill introduced in the House of Lords last month which could reduce gaming machines stakes to £2. Shares in William Hill fell 6.6p, or 1.7pc to 392p, while Ladbrokes dropped 0.4p to 129.7p. \nSpeculation defence and aerospace engineer Meggitt (Other OTC: MEGGF - news ) had begun a strategy review following an approach from a US peer earlier in the year pushed the stock 18.5p higher to 489p. \nFinally, Aim-listed Lifeline Scientific crept 1.3pc higher to 200p as the company, which recovers donor kidneys for transplant, announced a key contract win in the United States, which is expected to contribute over $1.2m in annualised revenues. Dr. Mike Mitchell, of Panmure Gordon, described the account win as “highly encouraging”, noting the additional revenue stream will provide further support to the business.
