At 0800 GMT, they were up 4 bps at 0.94 percent.\nDespite the optimism in markets, strategists warned the Greek saga may have one more twist.\nThe tough conditions imposed by international lenders led by Germany could cause an outcry in Greece and bring down Tsipras' leftist government. Even before the final terms were known, his labour minister went on state television to denounce the terms.\n\"The ball now is in the court of Athens if it wants to remain a full euro member,\" said Societe Generale strategist Ciaran O'Hagan.\nCapital controls imposed by Athens have limited trading on Greek bonds, but Tradeweb data showed yields on two-year notes down 4.81 percentage points at a two-week low of 25.81 percent.\nTen-year Greek bond yields were seen down 1.27 percentage points at 13.52 percent.
