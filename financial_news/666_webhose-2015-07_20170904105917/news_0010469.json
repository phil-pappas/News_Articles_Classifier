It is not clear when the regulators will issue their verdict on this year's round of submissions, the fourth. \nBanks say the refiled plans, the third time they've been revised, show they have massively improved their resilience to withstand shocks, bulking up on shareholder capital to shield creditors, and earmarking certain bonds as susceptible to losses in return for a higher yield. \n\"Our (plan) would effectively resolve the firm within a reasonable timeframe, without systemic disruption, without extraordinary governmental support and without exposing taxpayers to risk of loss,\" a JPMorgan (LSE: JPIU.L - news ) spokesman said. \nThe plans contained far more detail than those from last year. Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) , for instance, submitted a 102-page document, more than three times as much as the 2014 plan. \nSome banks showed which parts of their business could be disposed of through public stock offerings from businesses that would be sold privately should a crisis hit. \nFor example, Citigroup said that after stabilizing its banking operations, it would offer its U.S. consumer banking operations for sale in an IPO while international operations would be sold in private transactions. \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc included a table that showed it would consider selling its domestic and international asset management businesses, as well as its J. Aron commodities trading unit, in the event that the group failed. \nMorgan Stanley said it would ultimately sell its wealth management business, as well as major parts of both its investment management unit and its trading business in Japan, which is a joint venture with Mitsubishi UFJ Group. \nAnd Britain's Barclays said it is planning to shrink the size of its U.S. unit to $185-215 billion by July 2016, from $248 billion at the end of 2014. \nWhat is published on the regulators' websites is only the public portion of the plans. The actual documents are thousands of pages and contain detailed instruction including mundane facts such as how to access computer systems. \nThe banks involved are Bank of America, Bank of New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) York Mellon, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS - news ) , Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) , Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, State Street, UBS and Wells Fargo.
