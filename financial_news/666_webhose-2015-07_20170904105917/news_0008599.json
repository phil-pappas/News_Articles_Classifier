In fact, PG&E Corp., owner of California’s biggest utility, had its best performance since March, and the utilities industry led all sectors of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.\nWhile the S&P 500 is sinking for a fifth straight day, utilities led by PG&E rose 1.3 percent, the biggest gain since July 16.\n\\rMarket jitters and a sign of low interest rates made the S&P 500 Utilities Index pop.\n\\r \\r The reason’s twofold:\nUtilities are defensive stocks, purchased when investors flee other markets. They’re largely immune from booms and busts, with steady income, investment-grade debt ratings and profit margins set by regulators. So global jitters make utilities attractive.\nThey also pay dependable dividends that are more appealing when interest rates fall, as they did Monday.\n\\rYields on U.S. 10-Year treasury notes fell for five straight days.\n\\r \\r “Interest rates are down, which makes their dividends more attractive to investors,” said Kit Konolige, senior utility analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. “And this is a day when the overall market isn’t feeling too good.”\nBucking the overall market trend today were gains by every member of the S&P 500 Utilities Index except Exelon Corp. Gainers included Edison International and Duke Energy Corp. Utilities were the only index to show an increase.\nHow long can the utility rally last?\nSo long as the market’s scared and interest rates are down. “That’s all it is,” Konolige said.", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iB8szouv9yi8/v2/460x260.jpg\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iOEroQEzqtCc/v2/460x260.jpg\\"], "published": "2015-07-28T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T00:25:36.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
