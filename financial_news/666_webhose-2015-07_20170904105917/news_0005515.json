While on the freeway in California, he said, \"another vehicle crossed into our lane,\" and the Google vehicle responded \"seamlessly\" while avoiding a collision. \nHe said he thought the freeway incident \"was a little bit unusual\" and noted that driving on city streets \"gets a lot more complicated.\" \nTesting on the Mcity track will \"allow us ... to fully understand that very hazardous environment,\" he said. \nGoogle declined to comment on Peters' remarks. \nMichigan is among a handful of states to pass legislation enabling testing of self-driving cars on public roads. \nAmong the partners in Mcity are automakers Ford Motor Co , General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor Co. \nA Ford spokesperson said on Monday the automaker already has been testing a Ford Fusion equipped with self-driving hardware and software at Mcity. \nA similar facility, GoMentum Station, opened earlier this year on the site of a former U.S. Naval base in northern California. Several carmakers, as well as Google, use the private facility to test self-driving vehicles. \n(Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Richard Chang) Automotive Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T22:24:08.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
