The parking docks didn’t work. The accuracy-challenged map app seemed purposefully designed to screw up my day. \nBut the system’s new owners—including a real-estate developer and a fitness-chain mogul—invested $30 million and hired a new CEO. This summer, they completed a massive overhaul of the entire system. \nCiti Bike still isn’t perfect. Over the course of 15 test rides and 45 miles of biking, I encountered four docking snafus, a sticky gear shifter and one flat tire. But overall, the new Citi Bike experience is like cruising on a different planet: a magical world where a bright blue bike waits on every third street corner to provide fun, convenient transport—assuming you don’t get clipped by a cab.

And thanks to the new locking mechanisms, parking a bicycle no longer means a bloody, five-minute smashathon between bike and dock. \nThe bikes were always the best part of the system. Sturdy and tank-like, they breeze over cobblestones, curbs and potholes the size of kiddie pools. But the new model is even better. The brakes are tighter, the gears are smoother and there’s a blingy new light on the back fender. The handlebars collect a lot less schmutz. \nMy one gripe: Citi Bike has maintained the stingy time limits on how long you can keep a bike before returning it and borrowing another. Annual pass holders get 45 minutes; short-termers, just half an hour. If you’re obeying traffic laws, that isn’t enough time to get anywhere in New York. \nCiti Bike says the restrictions ensure everyone gets a ride. Depending on the time of year, each bike is used two to seven times a day on average. \nThe limits also generate big bucks. In the first six months of 2015, users racked up $1.57 million in overtime fees. It’s the two-wheeled equivalent of the city’s parking-ticket racket.

One said the company should invent a collapsible bike helmet; another suggested that Citi Bike install showers. \nThis anecdotal thumbs-up is reflected in Citi Bike’s call-center data. Last year at this time, the system hotline, which typically fields complaints, received 4.6 calls per 100 rides. Now, it’s down to 2 calls per 100. \nUsers say one issue lingers. It’s still hard to find a bike or docking space during rush hour, when everyone’s riding in the same direction. Lawyer Mitch Dinnerstein, who pedals every morning to his office in lower Manhattan, says he’s impressed with the improvements: “They’ve really got it down.” But he can’t always get a bike outside Penn Station. \nTo combat this problem, Citi Bike employs a team to redistribute bicycles between stations. Last month, it moved 2,140 bikes a day, compared with 1,370 in June 2014. But the problem is just getting worse. \nJules Flynn, the new general manager, says the more effort the company puts into rebalancing, the more demand there is for bikes: “We become victims of our own success.” \nUsers say they can live with this. Their concern now is whether the privately funded program will thrive. “I don’t know if these guys are making money yet,” says Brendan Hurley, a finance executive who Citi Bikes around the East Village. “I hope they are.” \nRevenue rose 11% in the first half of 2015 to $11.4 million. That’s due to an increase in sponsorship funding, to $4.2 million, along with last fall’s price increase on annual memberships from $95 to $149. \nDespite the service improvements, demand has declined. In June there were 13,500 annual membership sign-ups and renewals, a 26% drop from the year before. The total number of annual memberships also fell, from 96,300 to 86,700. \nCiti Bike spokeswoman Dani Simons says it might take a while for the improvements to generate more business. “It’s early days,” she notes. \nFor now, she says, Citi Bike is focused on building a solid foundation for expansion beyond the 330 original stations between Manhattan’s 59th Street and Brooklyn’s Bed-Stuy. \nNext month, to the relief of cowboys feeling confined in Citi Bike’s geographic corral, the expansion will begin. By the end of 2017, Citi Bike plans to double its fleet to at least 12,000 bikes at 700 stations stretching from Harlem to Bushwick, Park Slope and parts of Queens. \nGregory Kiss, an architect who commutes between Brooklyn neighborhoods on Citi Bike, called the expansion “way overdue.” \nSo what if it costs a bundle? “It’s by far the cheapest way,” he says, “to get a whole new transportation system.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T16:14:34.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
