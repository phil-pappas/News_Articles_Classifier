Simultaneously, the number of botched switches was 1pc, the energy regulator, Ofgem, confirmed. \nThere is a £400 difference between the cheapest energy tariff and average price paid by families, but the savings are available only to those who switch. \n• In full: what the Budget means for your finances • Income tax tables: How the summer Budget affects you • Budget 2015: winners and losers \n= Overcharge for loyalty is '£1.7bn’ = \nThe new switch guarantee was announced days after a major report highlighted that loyal energy customers are being overcharged by £1.7bn by firms. \nThe Competition & Markets Authority accused the larger energy firms of “exploiting” customers who do not switch suppliers, by transferring them to more expensive plans known as “standard variable” tariffs. \nLoyal customers will be moved to this rate, which is 10pc more expensive than a fixed tariff, when their contract ends. \n• More energy bungles: 1.5 million smart meters won't work when you switch energy supplier • Smart meters: will you pay more for 'peak electricity'? \nIt also cited “considerable concerns about the quality of service”, with problems relating to billing, customer services and payments. The regularity with which this newspaper hears of poor customer service and billing issues from Britain’s energy firms prompted us to launch our \"Energy Shambles Watch\" campaign last July. \nOut of the 60,000 failed switches, 70pc happened because the energy firm transferred the wrong gas or electricity meter, such as a neighbour’s meter. Around 15pc of switches fail because the supplier didn’t cancel their old account, leading to incorrect bills. \n= What will change? = \nDetails have yet to emerge of the new switching service, but it is likely to work in a similar way to the the current account guarantee run by banks. The new bank is responsible for moving all payments, such as direct debits. \nUnder the current account guarantee, if something goes wrong with the switch, the new provider promises to refund any interest or charges made on a customer’s old or new account as a result of the failure. \nThere is a 13-month window when the new bank arranges for any payments accidentally made to the old account to be automatically redirected. Customers can also choose and agree the switch date with their new provider. \nWhile banking received the much-needed reform in 2012, the energy market remains stagnant. Currently 90pc of households are on expensive “standard variable tariffs”, which is the plan customers are transferred to once their fixed energy tariff ends. \nBut there is hope that an improved switching service will drive competition and keep prices low. \nSome bigger energy firms have dropped their prices in light of the announcement. British Gas reduced gas prices this week by more than £50 for all customers, reducing the annual dual fuel bill by £41. \nSSE (LSE: SSE.L - news ) also dropped its rates to launch the cheapest tariff on the market last week. \nThis has also prompted a small increase in customer switches. In its latest update, Energy UK, the industry body representing the interests of energy firms, said 250,000 customers changed suppliers in June, 28pc more than the average for summer. \n“Switching numbers are still high, even though it’s summer when people may not be thinking about heating bills,” said Lawrence Slade, of Energy UK. \n>> Have you suffered a bungled energy switch?
