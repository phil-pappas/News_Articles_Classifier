The updated accord covers products that generate $US1 trillion ($A1.36 trillion) in annual global revenue, including $US100 billion a year for American companies. That worldwide total is equal to global trade in iron, steel, textiles and clothing combined, according to the WTO. Not all 161 WTO member countries signed on to the expanded deal. But all will benefit because it eliminates the tariffs on dozens of tech products no matter which WTO country they come from. Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. Dean Garfield, president of the Information Technology Industry Council trade group in Washington, said the deal \"will open markets, create jobs and spur economic growth around the world, as well as bring down costs for consumers\". Talks on revising the technology agreement began in 2012. The breakthrough occurred when the US and China worked out most of their differences during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Washington last November. Negotiators still must complete technical details and a timetable for eliminating the tariffs. The work is expected to be complete by the time WTO members meet in Nairobi, Kenya, in December.
