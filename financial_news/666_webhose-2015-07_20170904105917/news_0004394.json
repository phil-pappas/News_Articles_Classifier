All 10 main sectors on the index were higher.\nFinancials, the index's most heavily weighted sector, gained. Toronto Dominion Bank advanced 0.2 percent to C$52.24, and Sun Life Financial Inc climbed 0.2 percent to C$42.45.\nShares of energy producers added 0.3 percent. Suncor Energy Inc was up 0.6 percent at C$35.27, and Enbridge Inc climbed 1.1 percent to C$58.83.
