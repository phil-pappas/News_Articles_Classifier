Julian Smith Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Labor leader Bill Shorten has restated his ambition to lower the company tax rate for small business to 25 per cent and says if elected he will make it easier for such businesses to incorporate and take advantage of the lower rate.\nThis could include adopting the United States model of a specific class of corporation for small business. In a speech on Thursday night to the Council of Small Business Australia, Mr Shorten said there had to be a \"fair and fiscally responsible way to give small business the lowest corporate tax rate in Australian history\".\nThe rate was cut from 30 per cent to 28.5 per cent as part of the small-business package in the May budget. Mr Shorten used his budget reply speech to offer to work with the Coalition on a strategy to drive it to 25 per cent, something he acknowledged would take many years.\nThe government dismissed the suggestion but Mr Shorten said on Thursday \"my invitations stands\".\nAbout one-third of small businesses are incorporated, meaning the other two-thirds do not pay company tax. Mr Shorten said a Labor government would work to create a single, simplified structure tailored for small business. He cited the US model of a specific class of corporations for small business.\n\"This differentiated approach recognises that compliance measures should be tailored to match the size of businesses,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, shadow treasurer Chris Bowen made a pitch to business in Western Australia by promising that a Labor government would establish a Treasury office in Perth.\n\"Being in the same time zone as Asia, Perth has a serious competitive advantage and can benefit greatly from the opportunities in our region as it expands and develops,\" he said. \"Given these advantages, the Perth office will partly be responsible for Treasury's international engagement with Asia.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-16T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:57:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
