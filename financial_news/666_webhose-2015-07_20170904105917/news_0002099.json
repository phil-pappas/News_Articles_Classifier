I have been able to exchange ideas with a number of entrepreneurs. This has really changed my perspective on Africa.” \nAn excited Maalainine Mohamed Bouya, from Morocco also said “The boot camp has been a blast! Right from our journey from the airport down to the boot camp, we have been discussing and sharing ideas among ourselves. Africa has huge potential.” \nAfter the boot camp, the Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship Programme will focus on providing the seed capital and support for the entrepreneurs to put into practice the knowledge gained from the bootcamp and the 12 weeks of training carried out prior to the event. \nIt will also continue to foster increased collaboration between them and the rest of the Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship Network as it seeks to promote cross-border trade within the continent. \nThe application portal will re-open on January 1, 2016 for emerging entrepreneurs across Africa to compete for places in the TEEP Class of 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T07:34:06.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
