Stanmore will assume obligations on the contracts, according to Jorss. \nStanmore, with a market capitalisation of A$29 million after its stock soared 74 percent to 12 Australian cents on Thursday, has also assumed a A$32 million obligation to eventually rehabilitate the mine site once the coal reserves are depleted. \nStanmore is breathing new life into the mine while the sector as a whole contracts. \nMore than 4,000 jobs have been lost at Australian coal mines alone in the past two years, including ones in the collieries that pepper the Bowen Basin in Queensland state, where Isaac Plains is located. \nPrices for metallurgical coal used in steel making have fallen from $300 a tonne in 2011 to around $85, reflecting a global supply glut and a slowdown in steel production growth in China, a key destination for Australian coal. \nChina's metallurgical coal imports fell 25 percent year-on-year in the first four months of 2015 to 15 million tonnes, according to Australia's Department of Industry and Science. \nConsultancy Wood Mackenzie forecasts it will be 2020 before the market returns to balance. \nChinese-controlled coal miner Yancoal Australia last week said it was cutting close to half the jobs at two Australian collieries, citing depressed prices. \nSumitomo bought its interest in Isaac Plains from Aquila Resources for A$430 million. \nTwo years later the mine was part of 30 billion yen in writedowns booked by the Japanese company on Australian coal holdings. \nFor Vale, the mine represented a potential stepping stone into Australian iron ore mining with Aquila (Paris: FR0010340711 - news ) , which held a large undeveloped deposit, a strategy that failed to play out after Aquila sold to Sumitomo. \nAquila was subsequently acquired by China's Baoshan Iron & Steel Co.
