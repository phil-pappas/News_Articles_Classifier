Lord Green, who has rarely spoken publicly about his role at the bank since becoming trade minister in late 2010 , expressed regret that HSBC did not grasp the urgency of the problems in its global business units before they were caught up in tax evasion and money laundering investigations. “We did a lot of acquisitions that went just fine, but nevertheless you can’t help but becoming conscious of the risks…. We were maybe stretching ourselves quite quickly, and with the benefit of hindsight one might reflect on some of the wisdom of that,” Lord Green told the House of Lords economic affairs committee. Responding to criticism of the Swiss private banking unit, Lord Green said: “I do not believe anyone was aware of, to use your phrase, an industrial scale of tax evasion.\" He said the theft of data from its Swiss arm became apparent in 2010, and that some executives were not aware of the contents until after that. HSBC paid £28m to the Geneva authorities last month to settle an investigation into “suspected aggravated money laundering”, and remains under investigation in other jurisdictions. Leaked documents show that HSBC's Swiss unit helped more than 8,800 British people avoid tax. Lord Green “I think it would be right to acknowledge that it would have been good to drill into this systematically a bit earlier and we didn’t get everything right,\" said Lord Green. HSBC acquired Bital, a Mexican bank, in 2002 as part of its push into central America. “Of course, in the case of Mexico you could hardly ignore the fact it was an emerging market. But the business case was also clear. There were plenty of good reasons to believe this was the kind of emerging market which HSBC has flourished in, in so many other parts of the world,” said Lord Green, who was chief executive from 2003 to 2006, before serving as chairman until 2010. HSBC was fined $1.9bn in 2012 for poor money laundering controls in Mexico, with the US Senate upbraiding the bank for providing a channel for “drug kingpins and rogue nations”. “With the benefit of hindsight we should have drilled in more closely and more quickly on the anti-money laundering side. [Our checks] didn’t help us understand that there was a sufficiently serious problem in that bank to need very close attention very urgently, and I’m sorry about that,” he added. Sir Win Bischoff Before HSBC began its global spending spree by acquiring Midland in 1992, the bank was more “cohesive” and able to keep tabs on its operations, according to Lord Green. “You could rely on the person on the spot because you knew them and probably went to school with them,” he added. Lord Green and Sir Win Bischoff, the former chairman of Lloyds Banking Group, both appeared before the Lords on Tuesday to discuss the culture of the banking industry. Both former executives said they were concerned about the rate of pay for bankers. “It certainly kept me awake. The issue of remuneration is the most difficult one that we wrestled with,” said Lord Green. “How can anybody be comfortable where the most senior people are paid… an enormous multiple of the compensation of the head of an inner-city school. There’s no possible way on moral grounds to justify it. “Did that leave me uncomfortable? You bet it did.” Lord Green was paid $1.97m in 2009, his final full year at the bank. Stuart Gulliver, HSBC's highest earner that year and chief executive from 2011, was paid more than $15m. Mr Gulliver has also apologised recently for the Swiss scandal, saying that top management were not made aware sooner because of the group's \"federation\" management structure.
