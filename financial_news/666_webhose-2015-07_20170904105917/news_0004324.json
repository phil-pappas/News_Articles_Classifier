PUBLISHED: 15:26, Wed, Jul 15, 2015 | UPDATED: 15:47, Wed, Jul 15, 2015 GETTY Britain's unemploymemt has increased \nIn a surprise reversal of trends, the number of people in work dropped by 67,000 in the three months to February 2015 to 30.98million, the first quarterly fall since the beginning of 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). There are now 1.85million unemployed people, an increase of 15,000 over the same time period, with the unemployment rate rising to 5.6 per cent from 5.5 per cent. However, wages continue to rise with pay for British workers increasing by 3.2 per cent over the three months to May 2015 compared with the same period last year. Excluding bonuses salaries increased by 2.8 per cent - the highest rate since 2007 - said the ONS. Andrew Hunter, co-founder of recruitment firm Adzuna, said the increase in unemployment could be as a result of job cuts recently announced by large employers. He said: \"Unemployment has marginally increased, but the wider trend is still for more vacancies opening up. \"The momentary hovering has in part been caused by several large companies that have recently announced significant staffing cuts, including both Rolls Royce and the BBC. \"Our data also shows that the General Election had a clear impact on hiring behaviour in the UK with employers pausing for thought as the election loomed, and many job advertisers treading water and holding back on hiring in March and April 2015. \"The forward looking data for June and July suggests a bounce back in recruitment, which will no doubt lead to unemployment falling again over the summer.\" Related articles The 10 best and worst cities to find a job in Britain \nHowever, critics said the numbers were an embarrassment to Chancellor George Osborne, coming just days after his emergency Budget in which he boasted that his measures would boost growth and the economy. Chris Williams, chief executive at wealth manger Wealth Horizon, said: â€œIf the Government is unable to cut unemployment, then the Conservative plan to drive economic growth by putting people to work and pulling the country up by its boots straps, is effectively redundant. \"The Chancellor and his team will be desperately hoping that these unemployment figures represent a temporary blip and that they can nip this trend in the bud and get Britain back on track.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T00:30:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
