Getty Images by Jocelyn McClurg Jean Louise Finch - better known to millions of To Kill a Mockingbird fans as Scout - is all grown up and on a train from New York City, headed home to Maycomb, as Go Set a Watchman opens. (Now we understand the train illustration on the book's jacket.)\nReaders can get a taste of the highly anticipated book by Harper Lee by reading the first chapter.\nThe chapter has been posted online by The Wall Street Journal, the UK's The Guardian and the Sydney Morning Herald ; the papers bought first-serial rights from publisher HarperCollins. Watchman , written in the 1950s and long thought lost, was recently rediscovered and is only now being published, as a sequel of sorts to Mockingbird.\nIn the opening chapter, it's Jean Louise's \"fifth annual trip home\" from New York, where she now lives, to visit her father, Atticus Finch, the heroic figure of To Kill a Mockingbird .\nJean Louise is her 20s and as she gets off the train, expecting to see her father, she's instead grabbed in a bear hug by Henry \"Hank\" Clinton, \"her lifelong friend.\" (He's a new character not seen in Mockingbird.) Jean Louise is barely in his car (complete with automatic transmission and power steering) when he asks her to marry him.\nShe's not sure; \"she's almost in love with him,\" but not quite. She appears to be the same old Scout, independent-minded, with a sharp tongue. \"For the present she would pursue the stony path of spinsterhood.\"\nWe also learn that Hank, 30, is a veteran of World War II (the novel is set in the 1950s) and that he went to law school and works with her lawyer-father, who is 72 and suffering from rheumatoid arthritis.\nWe also learn in the first chapter (spoiler alert) that Scout's brother Jem, a major character in Mockingbird, \"dropped dead in his tracks one day.\" That's when Atticus decided that Jem's friend Henry would instead become his \"legman.\" Henry \"regarded (Atticus) as a father,\" but he \"did not regard Jean Louise as his sister.\"\n Scout Finch is all grown up, indeed.\nThe entire book will be available on July 14, when Go Set a Watchman goes on sale with a planned first hardcover printing of 2 million copies (it will be published as an e-book as well).\n(c)2015 USA Today", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/to-kill-a-mockingbirds-scout-and-atticus-20-years-on-harper-lees-go-set-a-watchman-20150710-gi9ctl.html"], "published": "2015-07-10T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:08:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
