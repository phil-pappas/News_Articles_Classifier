More than ever, I am convinced GM has the resources to be the most valued automotive company in the world: great leadership, product excellence, total customer focus and a winning mentality. \nArdila recently has led the company's efforts to grow Chevrolet through a renewed product lineup with a focus on technology, fuel-efficiency and quality. As part of this product overhaul, he also has led an initiative to raise the percentage of component localization for cars made in Brazil. Ardila, 60, has held his current position since 2010.

I'm particularly looking forward to working with my colleagues in South America as we manage through some near-term macro challenges while building and positioning the business for continued long-term leadership in the region.\" \nEngle, 51, has previously held management positions in South America including President of Ford of Brazil and Mercosul from 2005 to 2006, and Director of Marketing, Sales and Service for Ford of Brazil from 2001 to 2003.

He speaks both Spanish and Portuguese. \nSince 2011, Engle has been CEO of Agility Fuel Systems based in Santa Ana, Calif.
