The new software will replace the EasiRec reconciliation system. A Citrix deployment allows GroupIT to be accessed from two separate locations with the project due to go live this summer. The implementation will take less than a week to complete. Once live, GroupIT will reduce the time required for reconciliations whilst improving cash management. \nLangleys Solicitors LLP is a major UK law firm with almost 400 employees including 29 partners. It offers a comprehensive range of legal services from offices in Lincoln and York. Management of its financial reconciliations will be migrated from EasiRec to GroupIT. The new system will reconcile entries on Langleys’ bank statements, with transaction details held on the LexisNexis accounting system, freeing up staff time and improving accuracy. \nIan Torkington, Senior Finance Executive at Langleys said: “It is important that we continue to invest in our IT infrastructure to ensure we deliver efficient and cost-effective services. We were impressed by GroupIT’s reconciliation capabilities in the legal market and by the proven migration path. Additionally, the fact that Aurum are working with Legal Support Network showed us that they are serious about being the right vendor to meet our long term reconciliation needs.” \nTim Andrews, Chief Operating Officer, Aurum Solutions added: “Reconciliation of client funds remains a critical activity for legal firms. Additionally, ensuring the correct allocation of receipts to the right client account is vital, for example, it is a necessary step in the completion process for house purchases. GroupIT also helps legal firms to meet their reconciliation obligations under the Solicitors Accounts Rules with ease, whilst ensuring peaks in transaction volumes do not impact on customer service standards.” \nShare:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T03:54:15.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
