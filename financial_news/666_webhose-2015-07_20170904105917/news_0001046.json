Affirm — through a partnership with schools such as General Assembly, Dev Bootcamp, Bloc and Metis — is the latest to join a handful of lenders offering loans for these so-called coding boot camps; these are classes run by companies that help students learn skills to change careers or just improve their performance at their current job, but don’t offer a formal degree.\nPresident Barack Obama has praised the courses as offering students a pathway to the middle class on the cheap (relatively speaking), but because they’re not accredited, borrowers can’t use federal student loans to pay for them. And at anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 a pop, the courses are often out of reach for many of the students who might benefit from them the most.\n“Given the price the programs charge, some sort of loan product feels almost inevitable,” said Ben Miller, the senior director of postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. “If you restricted it to only people who can afford it, it would be all white dudes.”\nStill, in the wake of the collapse of for-profit college chain Corinthian Colleges amid accusations the company used inflated graduation and job placement rates to lure students into taking on loans , the growing prevalence of lending in the coding boot camp space raises concerns about students saddling themselves with debt to attend a different type of for-profit school.\nIt’s this worry that’s pushed Jake Schwartz, the CEO of General Assembly, arguably the most prominent company offering these coding and design courses, to proceed with caution when working with loan partners. He said he’s had “probably hundreds” of conversations with different companies interested in lending to his students, but only partners with “millennial-focused” firms who offer the loans close to at cost and work closely with the company to develop the loan products. About 15% to 20% of General Assembly students use loans to finance their classes there.\n“We are learning the lessons of (for-profit colleges) and trying to be the ‘anti-them’ in every way,” Schwartz said. “I want to learn from history, I don’t want to solve the problem of the previous generation of proprietary schools with the tools that caused that problem.”\nSchwartz said he requires his lending partners to offer short-term loans so students aren’t saddled with debt for decades. Affirm, which is led by PayPal co-founder and tech personality Max Levchin, offers borrowers a choice between 12, 15 and 18 month loans. Interest rates for the loans start at 6% and they run as steep as 20%, for borrowers who are “probably not going to get financed anywhere else,” said Brad Selby, Affirm’s vice president of merchant services.\n“We are focused on the people who actually need the working capital to train,” Selby said.\nAs coding literacy becomes increasingly valuable for a growing number of jobs, the appetite for these courses looks poised to grow. About 16,000 students are expected to graduate from coding boot camps in 2015, compared with just 6,740 last year, according to trade website, Course Report . Selby said Affirm expects to do anywhere between 2,500 and 10,000 loans a year.\nWhile it might seem risky to take out a loan for a program that doesn’t earn you a degree, the debt should be manageable if borrowers manage to parlay the course into a better paying job down the line, Miller said.\nStill, it’s important for borrowers to do their homework before taking out one of these loans, particularly because they’re offered by private companies. Federal student loans provide borrowers with protections such as the ability to make payments tied to their income or temporarily halt payments during periods of financial instability.\n“There’s a lot of excitement around these coding academies, they seem like they do great work, but we don’t know a ton about their outcomes,” Miller said.\nGeneral Assembly’s Schwartz said graduates of their full-time programs, which are eight- to 12-week all-day courses, end up with a pay bump of 25% on average. He’s confident in the return on investment offered by his courses, but he said his “dream model” for financing the classes would involve very little financial contribution from students; instead bosses would pony up to expand their employees’ skills. Right now, about 30% of the company’s part-time students are funded by their employers, according to Schwartz.\n“That to me is the healthiest model for this career-focused education,” he said.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://www.coursereport.com/resources/ultimate-guide-to-coding-bootcamp-loans-financing", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/09/fact-sheet-president-obama-launches-new-techhire-initiative"], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:43:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
