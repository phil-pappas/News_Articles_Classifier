The stock has recovered 50 percent of its March to June drop, from a record high of A$96.69 to A$79.19, and outperformed the other major lenders with that retracement. \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) eased 0.2 percent after the world's second-biggest iron ore miner trimmed its full-year guidance for ore shipments. \nFor more individual stocks activity, click on \n\"July is historically, over the last five years, our best month and we obviously haven't performed for the first part of it with all the issues around China and Greece,\" said Evan Lucas, market strategist at IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) in Melbourne. \"We're now starting to pick back up to where we should be.\" \nCash-strapped Greece took a further step towards securing a bailout package on Wednesday, while Chinese stocks drifted in and out of positive territory, showing no signs of the panic meltdown seen recently. \nNew Zealand shares pushed to a one-week high as solid gains for big-cap stocks led the market for a third session. \nThe benchmark NZX50 index rose as high as 5,838.3, before edging back to 5,825.0, up 0.3 percent on the day. \nImproving risk sentiment and the prospect of further central bank rate cuts encouraged investors to pick up recently sold-off stocks. \nAmong the leaders Contact Energy (NZSE: CEN.NZ - news ) was up 1.2 percent, Fletcher Building (NZSE: FBU.NZ - news ) put on 1 percent, and telecommunications company Spark gained 1.1 percent. \nThe index of the top-10 companies, which make up more than half the market benchmark index, climbed 0.6 percent. \nPrice falls were generally modest, although Air New Zealand , which has risen strongly in recent sessions, suffered a 2.2 percent drop. \nThe Fonterra Shareholders Fund dipped 1.1 percent as the dairy co-operative said it would cut more than 500 jobs in the next couple of months with more to come as it tackles falling prices and pressure on earnings.
