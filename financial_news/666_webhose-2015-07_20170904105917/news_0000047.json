Always'.\" \nThe comments come after Fairfax's barrister Sandy Dawson told the Federal Court earlier this month the case \"was an unmitigated disaster for Mr Hockey and a costs order should reflect that\". @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T20:52:05.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
