Group revenue rose 2pc in the 40 weeks to June 20 at constant exchange rates, but was flat at actual exchange rates. \nThe weakness of the euro versus the dollar and sterling could weigh on full-year revenue to the tune of £25m, the company warned. \nSales at Primark were up 13pc at constant currency rates, and 9pc at actual rates, ABF said. The chain is close to its long-anticipated launch in the US, with the first branch opening in Boston in September. \nHowever, ABF warned that the dollar's strength would also have “an adverse effect on margins in the new financial year”, as the clothing chain sources much of its merchandise in dollars. \nSugar prices are starting to recover in Europe \nPrimark’s like-for-like sales in the 16 weeks to June 20 were flat on last year's “very strong comparatives”, ABF said, with new stores in the Netherlands and Germany taking a bite out of sales at existing stores, while sales in the UK grew. \nItaly was the second biggest apparel market in Europe after Germany, said John Bason, ABF finance director, and would be Primark's 10th European territory. \"We're following on from tremendous success in France. We only went into France 18 months ago and that was the most successful new market entry we've had.\" \nThe US stores would be a \"total consumer offering\", MrBason added. \"We're offering amazing prices, great stores and fashionability - that's fashionability judged by American standards.\" \nBoth US and Italian ventures would keep a \"keen eye on variations\" in taste, he said. \"There's a large degree of overlap between the US market and the European market. And in fact the European market has a lot of variation within itself. On a broad canavas it's the same offer, but there will be some items that are different.\" \nABF’s grocery division remained “on track”, the company said, with Kingsmill winning a boost following the relisting of two loaves in Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) . The brand had been delisted in March. \"Kingsmill 50/50 is a great product and we're pleased to have it back,\" Mr Bason said. \nSugar production was expected to be down to one million tonnes from 1.45 million the year before, as ABF reacts to continuing oversupply. However, EU sugar prices were showing some signs of recovery , the company said. The sugar dvision \"had turned the corner\", Mr Bason said, citing an agreement with UK farmers to set the cost of the beets for the next two years. \n“Our earnings expectation for this financial year is unchanged and reflects a modest decline in adjusted earnings per share for the group for the full year,” the company said in its statement. \n“The impact of currency on results for the next financial year will be more significant than this year and arises from transactional currency exposures, primarily in British Sugar and Primark.” \nABF's shares rose 3.5pc in early trading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T16:33:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
