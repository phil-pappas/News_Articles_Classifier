However, there is no justification for continued rampant importation, since locally manufactured products are readily available,\" he said. \nHe also proposed to increase surtax from 25 percent to 35 percent on second-hand light passenger motor vehicles aged more than five years from the date of manufacture at the time of importation, with effect from September 1 to curb their importation. \nThis was because such motor vehicles continued to account for a significant import bill despite measures to mitigate their importation. \nThe increase in surtax is expected to reduce the current account deficit. \nIn other major highlights of his mid-term policy review Minister Chinamasa said agriculture output was projected to decline by about 8,2 percent in 2015. \n\"The poor rainfall pattern not only resulted in some of the area under cropping having to be written off, but also adversely affected the quality of some crops. \n\"Deceleration in overall economic growth signifies the contribution of agriculture, and the need for drought proofing the economy given the adverse effects of climate change,\" said Minister Chinamasa. \nThe impact of the drought, among other factors, reduced yields for both cereals and cash crops, such as tobacco, cotton and soyabeans. \nOutstanding payments to farmers for deliveries of grain to the Grain Marketing Board now stood at $29,2 million down from $48,5 million in January. \nTherefore, Treasury would prioritise payments to farmers for outstanding and new deliveries as a way of enhancing confidence in delivering to the GMB to capacitate farmers for the next season. \nIn light of challenges faced by agriculture and the impact on economic growth, Minister Chinamasa said Government would reduce power tariffs for strategic minerals and sectors such as irrigation, tourism and manufacturing to drive growth and compensate for the loss in agriculture, which impacted growth prospects. \nMinister Chinamasa said the cereal deficit this year necessitated imports of 700 000 tonnes of grain to ensure food security. \nAlready, the importation programme has begun with about 16 670 tonnes having been imported by Government. Permits for the importation of 819 704 tonnes of maize by grain merchants have already been issued. \nMID-TERM BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS Economic growth revised downwards to 1,5 percent Government to reduce wage bill from 80 percent to 40 percent of total budget.
