We should not expect much in the way of penitence.\nRemember the 46-metre-high hot air balloon in the shape of Christ the Redeemer?\nIt floated over Melbourne at the start of last year's World Cup promotions, sparking complaints the stunt was offensive to Christians.\nAdvertisement Paddy was so chuffed that it devoted a whole double page spread in this year's annual report to the publicity generated by the stunt.\nThe lurid spread, in the style of a classic horror movie poster, was titled with a Quote: from an outraged Reverend Tim Costello : \"Extraordinary arrogance and hubris, is nothing sacred?\"\nAccompanying the headline was an outraged pastor bearing a passable likeness to our Reverend Tim who chairs the Australian Churches Gambling Taskforce.\n\"Planet Earth has spent 2,014 years waiting for the Second Coming. His return certainly didn't disappoint,\" said Page 13 of the Paddy Power report.\n\"Jesus Christ himself would have got less publicity, even if he turned up in Australia's second city riding Kim Kardashian .\"\nCBD can already feel the outrage building in Melbourne. First the balloon stunt, and now being referred to as Australia's second city.\nHandy Andy When you are following in the footsteps of a giant like Telstra boss, David Thodey , you take the accolades where you can get them.\nSo don't expect your columnist to sniff at the new boss Andy Penn , being accepted into the project management hall of fame.\nThis week he bagged an Honorary Fellowship from the Australian Institute of Project Management (the AIPM) for his \"leadership and support of the profession of project management in Australia.\"\nPenn has become the first Australian-based Honorary Fellow of the AIPM, and in doing so his efforts to promote and acknowledge the importance of project management in the delivery and implementation of successful business strategies has been recognised.\n\"Each and every Project Manager is critical to the success of their own organisation. I believe that project management is truly a very important profession, and one that can make a profound difference to the success, or otherwise, of the companies that project managers work for,\" said a rather chuffed Mr Penn.\nIt does not get any sexier than that.\nWe can only hope the award comes with a free subscription to Project Manager Magazine which \"aims to stimulate debate among PM practitioners\".\nFor those who are not in the know, the PM stands for project management.\nViva Bris Vegas Echo Entertainment made some pretty big promises to the banana benders, should it win the right to rule the casino roost in south east Queensland.\nThis includes moving its corporate headquarters to the sunshine state.\nThe Queenslanders have form at this particular game.\nTatts moved its HQ to Brisbane a few years back after being screwed by the Victorian government over the loss of its poker machine duopoly.\nNot everyone at Tatts made the migration north, of course.\nSo what would a migration mean for Echo and its very Sydney-centric executive team?\nWell, a promise is a promise, but Echo's people made it clear that the bags are not being packed just yet.\nThe first sod will not be turned on the development until 2017, and it is expected to take another five years to finish.\nSo it will be more like 2022 before Echo can think about the big migration.\nCBD suspects current boss Matt Bekier is not worrying himself with a long commute.\nPot shot Erin Resources, the Australian listed explorer which bit the dirt in the Birimian gold belts of Senegal, has once again shown its fellow miners a thing or two about ingenuity.\nFirst there was its astute move into ancillary mining services, otherwise known as the cannabinoid resin market, via a reverse takeover by Israel-based MGC Global.\nIt has now broken new ground in the cross pollination of mining and marijuana.\nIts mining strategy in Africa has presumably gone to pot, so it has followed suit with its new business.\nIt said MGC has \"secured an option\" with a Namibian company to acquire a licence to grow the legal cannabis crop.\nThe pot plan will give it access to crops every day of the year, which also ensures a constant cash flow, said MGC.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:36:14.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
