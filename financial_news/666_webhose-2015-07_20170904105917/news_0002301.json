We must find out,” said Ivy Loi, whose husband Captain Eugene Choo was one of the pilots on board the flight.\nLoi, who was greeted by many Malaysia Airline employees at the event, attended the service with her two sons and relatives.\n“We’re just trying to cope,” she added as she wiped away tears.\nRita Phang, 62, lost her cousin when the plane was downed.\n“I know it’s almost a year, but we still feel sad, even though we know we have to accept the way things are,” she said. “But action needs to be taken. I want justice to be served.”\nThe event saw grieving families observe a minute’s silence. Many cried and became emotional when the names of the passengers scrolled across screens in tribute to the dead.\nThe Boeing 777 passenger jet was travelling between Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down in eastern Ukraine on July 17, during some of the worst fighting between government forces and pro-Russian separatists who took up arms against Kiev’s pro-Western government a few months earlier.\nAll 298 passengers and crew on board the Malaysia Airlines jetliner — the majority of them Dutch — died.\nSuspicions immediately fell on the separatists, who may have used a surface-to-air missile supplied by Russia to shoot down the plane.\nBut Moscow flatly denied it was involved and pointed the finger instead at Ukraine’s military.\nSpeaking at the memorial, Najib said the international criminal probe into the downing of the plane was ongoing and could be completed by the end of the year.\n“Detailed investigations are still continuing.. and they are expected to be finished by the end of 2015 at least,” he said.\nFirst Published on July 11, 2015 12:38 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T23:46:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
