The most traded iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange followed, slumping to the lowest since April 24 of 402.5 yuan ($64.86) a tonne.\nAnalysts interpreted the declines as further evidence that China was awash in too much iron ore - with more on its way.\nIron ore stocks at 42 Chinese ports rose 1.7 percent to 81.97 million tonnes by Friday from a week before, data from industry consultancy Umetal showed.\nEven as stockpiles grow, fresh cargoes of ore continue to arrive, mostly from Australia and Brazil.\nShipments from Australia's Port Hedland to Chinese ports rose 3 percent to 32.61 million tonnes in June from a month earlier, the latest port data showed.\nThe June increase at the world's biggest iron ore terminal helped sweep iron ore exports for the fiscal year to June 30 to 21 percent higher to a record 439.6 million tonnes. Of that, 373.24 million tonnes were destined for China, according to the Pilbara Ports Authority.\nSTEEL CONSUMPTION\nSteel consumption in China from January to May tumbled an alarming 8 percent from a year before, according Zhao Chaoyue, an analyst with Merchant Futures in Guangzhou.\n\"China's real steel consumption will fall further over the rest of this year,\" he said.\nAnalysts do not expect Australian miners, or the world's top supplier, Vale of Brazil, to slow shipments to China given their low mining and freight costs, pressuring the price and spelling trouble for smaller producers struggling to stay afloat.\nChina also said on Friday it will allow Valemax 400,000-tonne cargo ships to dock at its ports for the first time since the mega-vessels were commissioned.\nAustralia's Department of Industry and Science is forecasting more ore and less demand will drive the price of iron ore down to an average $54 a tonne this year and $52 in 2016.\n\"This is the downside of the $50-$60 range where iron ore belongs in this stage of the cycle,\" said Morgan's Wilson.\nAny benefits to Chinese steel mills of lower iron ore prices have been offset by softer steel demand. Reinforcing bar futures have showed little change since hitting the lowest level on record Thursday.\n\"The industry's cycles have caught some unprepared and others looking for answers,\" Rio Tinto Chief Executive Sam Walsh told a London business group this week.
