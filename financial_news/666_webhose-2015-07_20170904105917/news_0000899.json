This is very welcome,\" said Sri Lankan Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. \n\"Our tea industry has been going through a very difficult patch last year. Opening up of the Iran market will be a big boost,\" he told reporters. \nBefore the restrictions on banking put the squeeze on exports, Iran was the largest overseas market for Sri Lanka's trademark Ceylon brew. \nAnd even after those restrictions began being rolled out in 2008, more than 30 million kilos (66 million pounds) of Sri Lankan tea were sold to Iran. \nIndustry bosses say the number of exports to Iran could now double, which would be a fillip to a sector that has been hit by a global glut of tea and an increase in the domestic costs of production. \n\"With sanctions gone, there is a potential to double our tea exports to Iran,\" said Anil Cooke, chief executive officer of the Sri Lankan tea firm Asia Siyaka Commodities. \nHe said a majority of tea growers in Sri Lanka will see better demand for their produce while Iranian consumers will also benefit thanks to lower intervention costs in directly importing Ceylon tea.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T17:25:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
