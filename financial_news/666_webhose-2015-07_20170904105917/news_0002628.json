Share on twitter by John Stensholt Billionaire John Gandel, who owns half of the southern hemisphere's biggest shopping centre, Melbourne's Chadstone, has quietly doubled his money on another investment.\nGandel, who placed 8th on this year's BRW Rich List with wealth of $4.4 billion, is a big beneficiary of one of the best floats of the past year, Aconex.\nA provider of technology services to the construction sector, Aconex listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in December last year at $1.90 a share.\nThe move to take the company public, long mooted by Aconex co-founder and BRW Young Rich list member Leigh Jasper and Robert Phillpot (a former Young Rich lister), was not without its problems.\nAconex originally planned to list at at about $2.20 a share, only to abandon those plans at the bookbuild stage last November after lukewarm interest from potential investors.\nBut investing in the company by long-term shareholders like Gandel has paid off. Aconex shares have doubled in value since January 1 and are among the top performers on the All Ordinaries Index for the year so far.\nAnother former Young Rich List member, Martin Hosking, is also a major shareholder, as is the Baillieu family and construction firms Hansen Yuncken and Probuild.\nContinuously outperformed Aconex has continuously outperformed expectations. Its first-half result beat prospectus forecasts for revenue and earnings. It came before a solid quarterly report in April and a profit upgrade in mid-June helped drive the share price upwards.\nThe company is now forecasting a $2.7 million to $3.2 million loss in the 2015 financial year from $79 million to $81 million of revenue, compared with a $3.2 million loss from $76.5 million revenue in its prospectus. That is thanks to the falling value of the Australian dollar, which makes its income overseas higher when reported in Australian currency.\nGandel's shopping centre business was an early customer of Jasper and Phillpot, who formed Aconex in 2000 as a document management technology for the construction industry in 2000, and then became a shareholder of what was then a private firm.\nJasper and Phillpot came up with the idea for Aconex after a game of squash in 1998, eventually forming the company two years later after raising $2 million from friends and contacts.\nTheir software – for which Aconex typically charges clients 0.1 per cent of a project's value – integrates document and information management systems across different firms that work on projects, while verifying and checking data and eliminating data errors.\nGandel has also had success with other stocks this year. A stake in small copper and gold miner Straits Resources has also doubled in value, while shares in communications services company Service Stream are up about 67 per cent since January 1.\nThe billionaire also has large shareholdings in listed property company Charter Hall and the Charter Hall REIT. But Gandel's biggest listed investment is in the newly merged retail property giant Federation Centres.\nHe has emerged with a stake worth about $2 billion after Federation engineered a $12 billion merger with rival Novion Property Group, which owned the other half of Chadstone, in June.", "external_links": ["http://www.brw.com.au/p/lists/young-rich/2014/brw_young_rich_leigh_jasper_92stdIZTnq8SM6kNN7yLbN", "https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt", "http://www.brw.com.au/lists/rich-200/2015/"], "published": "2015-07-08T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T04:05:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
