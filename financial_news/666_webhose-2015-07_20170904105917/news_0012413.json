At Vodafone, our commitment has remained unchanged over the years – to provide unmatched experience for our customers. The Loyalty package is one of the many avenues being utilised to ensure we are always leading the way”. \nThe scheme is also expected to help Vodafone’s enterprise customers make cost-effective decisions that will deliver convenience and accessibility all year round. \nVodafone Business Solutions (VBS) was adjudged the ‘Telecom Business of the Year’ at the just ended Ghana Telecom Awards (GTA).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T01:50:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
