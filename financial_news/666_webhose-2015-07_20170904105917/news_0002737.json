Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! Despite the burden of opening accounts under Jan Dhan Yojana and selling insurance schemes, the silver lining in the lives of bank chief executives in the Narendra Modi government is that New Delhi doesn't tell them how to go about expanding their business. But all that changed for bankers on July 15, at least in West Bengal, a state headed by the mercurial Mamata Banerjee, when she ordered that every gram panchayat (village council) should have a bank branch at the earliest. For bankers who have been busy recovering loans and correcting the past mistakes, the order came as a jolt. Indeed, with New Delhi-based Arun Jaitley as finance minister, there is hardly any compulsion to open branches even in ministers' constituencies, a prolific activity when P Chidambaram and Pranab Mukherjee headed the ministry. It was during the 100th administrative review meeting that Banerjee found that hundreds of gram panchayats in her state are without banks. With just about a year to seek re-election to the Assembly and a chit fund taint to dim her prospects, who better than banks to brighten her chances of returning to power? \"That means, no work has been done on this front,\" frowned Banerjee once she was provided the statistics that one-fifth of the gram panchayats in the state are still unbanked. \"Opening more branches will prompt poor people to save in banks, which will be safe for them. They will not be lured by unscrupulous money-circulating firms.\" The reasoning that the so-called business correspondents (representatives of banks who do basic functions such as deposit taking and dispensing money) are good enough in small villages, did not cut much ice with her government. \"Bankers have committed to open branches in all unbanked GPs by the end of this fiscal. The business correspondent model is not effective,\" finance minister Amit Mitra told ET. \"I am determined to see banks fulfilling their commitment. The government will provide whatever support they need.\" Of course, Banerjee is not just talking through her hat. She is doing her bit to help banks reduce costs. The state government has offered to rent out space in panchayat offices at an annual rent of Rs 1 for opening branches. When the Mamata government came to power in May 2011, about 1,000 of 3,354 gram panchayats were bereft of banking presence. Banks have since opened 284 branches in unbanked gram panchayats. Last year, Canara Bank grabbed the government scheme to open 51 branches â€” inaugurated by Banerjee simultaneously from Nabanna, the temporary state government headquarters. This helped the number of unbanked GPs to come down to 716 but Banerjee wants more to win brownie points before the next election. \"There is a need to open more branches, no doubt. At the same time, it may not be economically viable to open full-fledged branches in every GP,\" said United Bank of India executive director Sanjay Arya. The state-level bankers' committee led by UBI has formed a subcommittee to look into the aspect. But banks are hesitant given the magnitude of politicisation of even business in the state. A case in point is a recent event in the Howrah branch of Uco Bank , where a mob headed by ruling party Trinamool Congress's local leaders laid siege to the branch demanding loans for self-help groups. The mob barged into the branch on June 27 and locked it after throwing out staff and customers. The branch manager was forced to climb up a protest stage to declare that he would accept the leader's demand for loans to self-help groups. The police were mere spectators. The lack of banking penetration allowed firms like Saradha Realty or Rose Valley to raise public deposits at will bypassing all rules. Thousands of people lost their life savings after the eventual collapse of Saradha in 2013 triggering a political crisis for Banerjee. The Trinamool government largely faces the blemish, allegedly for supporting these pyramid firms to grow out of proportion. Credit-deposit ratio is perennially low in the state, which suffers from the dearth of big industries. The ratio now stands at 68%, less than the national average of 76%. The loss-making experience of many bank branches in the remotest villages opened during the United Progressive Alliance government on the requests of Chidambaram or Mukherjee at Sivaganga (Tamil Nadu) or Jangipur respectively is still fresh in most minds. Even though bankers may not be at the mercy of state governments, they can hardly ignore the state diktats, especially when it comes from someone with grassroots support such as Banerjee. Bankers are now looking at their own way of coming up with a solution. \"We need to strike a balance,\" said Arya. \"We may think of alternatives such as two-days' banking or mobile banking.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T02:53:36.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
