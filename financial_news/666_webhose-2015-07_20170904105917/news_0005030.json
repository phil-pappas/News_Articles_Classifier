In an apparent reference to regulatory hurdles in India, he said, some friends have been asking him whether he lost hair after coming here. \nAt her witty best, Sathiyavathy responded to his remarks saying he might have lost his hair in Singapore but not in India. \nVistara, a full service carrier to enter the Indian aviation space recently, is a joint venture of Singapore Airlines and Tatas. \n\"I have been seeing him for the past one-and-a-half years... He (might have) lost his hair in Singapore, not here,\" Sathiyavathy said in a lighter vein, eliciting a peel of laughter from the audience. \nShe also listed out measures that were being taken to ensure that the domestic aviation sector meets global standards after the US watchdog Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) upgraded India's safety rating this April. \nSathiyavathy also said the DGCA has already completed recertification of six airline and for the rest the process would be over in 4-5 months. \nAs far as ensuring the compliance on the part of all flying training schools, she said, the process of certification is expected to be completed by March next year. \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T19:20:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
