Section 1.4 of the GAC Act of 2014 posted at www.gac.gov.lr , states that \"the General Auditing Commission is autonomous and shall be a separate employer, not part of the Civil Service\": Also, under PFM Regulations K.3 (1) \"The Auditor General shall not be subject to the direction and control of any person or authority\". \nThis clause was inserted in the law to ensure that the Office of the Auditor General remains independent. By the Civil Service Agency/Cabinet approved salary structure for the office of the Auditor General and by extension staff of the GAC, the President/Cabinet would be controlling and directing the office of the Auditor General and the General Auditing Commission. \nSection 2.1.4 of the GAC Act of 2014 under remuneration, states: \"The Auditor General shall be paid a remuneration package that commensurate with equivalent regional heads of Supreme Audit Institutions, as determined through an independent and transparent salaries and remuneration vetting process\". \nThese safeguards where enshrined in the laws to ensure that there is no interference from the Executive or any other authority of how the Auditor General Performs his/her duties. The new policy does not state whether the Auditor General's new salary approved by the Cabinet is consistent with the requirement of the new GAC Act. Under the new policy, the Government reduced the salary of the Auditor General by 47 percent effective July 1, 2015. \nIn 2006 the European Union competitively recruited Liberia's first post war Auditor General John Morlu and paid the salary and other benefits to Mr. Morlu. The rationale for the European Union (EU) recruiting and paying the salary of former AG Morlu was to ensure the independence of the Office of the Auditor General. The EU did not want a situation where the Government of Liberia could have manipulated the former AG by reducing or withholding his salary if Government disagreed with his professional opinion. \nLACC, IAA and PPCC Potentially Compromised \nThe Liberia Anti-Corruption (LACC) the Internal Audit Agency (IAA) and the Public Procurement and Concessions Commission (PPCC) could be potentially compromised as the result of GoL's new policy. These institutions are critical integrity institutions that need to be compensated reasonably well to ensure that staff does not compromise investigations and internal audit work. If the reductions in their compensation of the heads and deputies stand, there could be a trickle- down effect. \nThese integrity institutions could also reduce the salaries of their staff because it would be unequitable for example, the Deputy Director General of IAA and an audit director of IAA to make the same monthly salary. Further impact could be the IAA staff, LACC or PPCC staff could compromise their work because of the reduced salaries. Sources have informed FPA that the targeted by the new policy were not contacted by the CSA for their input before making the document policy. It remains to be seen whether there would be mass exodus from the Government as a result of the new pay policy. \nThis is not the first time however that the former CSA boss has introduced policy that created chaos in some element of the Liberian society. Sometime last year, the former CSA boss Werner attempted to introduced a policy to redundant all the staff the Government sent home to reduce the risk of the Ebola virus Disease infecting and killing more people. His attempt backed fired as the National Legislature interceded and pressured him to squash the plan. \nRecently, appearing before the National Legislature, Mr. Werner denied having a plan to close primary and secondary schools before the end of the Government approved academic calendar, but the next day he appeared at a Ministry of Information press briefing to announce a Ministry of Education policy to close school by July 31, 2015 to the indignation of the House of Representatives and the affected students of primary and secondary schools. It remains to be seen whether the new policy would be implemented or it would end up like previous policy interventions by Mr. Werner.
