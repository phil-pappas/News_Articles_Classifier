( bloom.bg/1GbJRIZ )\nThese would be the first charges against Deutsche Bank traders in connection with the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, Bloomberg said.\nReuters could not confirm the report. Spokesmen from the Justice Department and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.\nDeutsche Bank has struggled to restore an image tarnished by a raft of regulatory and legal problems that also include probes into alleged mis-selling of derivatives, tax evasion and money laundering.\nThe German bank agreed in April to pay $2.5 billion to U.S. and British authorities for manipulation of Libor.\nThe German lender presented a management shake-up on May 21 in an attempt to restore confidence, but some investors demanded more changes.\nIn June, a source told Reuters that Germany's financial watchdog Bafin criticized Deutsche Bank in its report investigating attempts to manipulate inter-bank interest rates such as Libor.
