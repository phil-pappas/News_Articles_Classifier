The Typhoon is a joint project between BAE Systems with partners Airbus Group (Swiss: AIR.SW - news ) and Finmeccanica (Other OTC: FINMF - news ) . \nChief Executive Ian King confirmed on a call with reporters that sales campaigns were underway. \n\"There are a number of active campaigns and a number of potential customers and I think we've been clear that the Middle East is an area where there are requirements,\" he said on Thursday. \nMeeting forecasts is also dependent on a review of options for a shipyard in Australia, where it could take a provision, estimated by UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) analysts to be between 50 to 60 million pounds, if it was to decide to scale down facilities there. \n\"It's conditional on determining with the Australian government what the future of the shipbuild industry is, it's not necessarily about orders, we need to take a long term view on what they want as capabilities,\" King said. \nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) said that the absence of a new order for Typhoon would be of greater concern than any restructuring of BAE's shipbuilding business in Australia. \n\"Nothing in today's statement changes our view that negotiations could yet yield a positive outcome,\" they said on a possible new Typhoon order. \nSaudi Arabia has grown more aggressive this year in countering Iran across the region and analysts said that the muclear agreement struck between Iran and six world powers to release it from sanctions, could encourage Saudi to buy more jets. \nBAE said overall it had performed well in the first six months of 2015, reporting underlying earnings per share of 17.1 pence, slightly behind the 17.7 pence it made in the same period last year but ahead of the consensus market forecast and helped by a favourable exchange rate. \nThe half-year dividend was increased to 8.4 pence from 8.2 pence last time. \nShares in BAE were up 1 percent at 474.3 pence at 1113 GMT.
