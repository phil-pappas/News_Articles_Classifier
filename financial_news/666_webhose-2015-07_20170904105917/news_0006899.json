The growing demand for ICs is expected to drive investments in manufacturing capacities, leading to large-scale production of semiconductor chips, which are primarily manufactured in Taiwan. \n“The foundry capacities in Taiwan are expected to account for about 70% of the semiconductor industry during the forecast period,” says Faisal Ghaus, Vice President of Technavio. \nThe report also indicates that the next big things for integrated circuits (IC) are Internet of things, smartwatches, and augmented reality. Foundries in the region are expected to manufacture ICs for these applications in the next 2-3 years. \n“Foundry services such as Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company are developing new processes like fully depleted silicon-on-insulator technology to meet the requirement for chipsets in smart devices,” adds Ghaus. \nTechnavio currently has more than 3000 market research reports on a huge range of topics, including:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T18:30:38.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
