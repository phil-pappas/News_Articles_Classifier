After all, unlike abroad, it’s not necessary for medical treatment. So is it worth buying or a waste of money?\n“Many people assume that it is an unnecessary expense in the UK,” says Kevin Pratt at moneysupermarket. “Less than half of travellers bother to take out cover for a staycation.”\nBut, he adds, travel insurance is about more than medical cover.\n“What happens if you fall ill before the date of departure and have to cancel? Without insurance you could lose your deposit, or even the full cost of the trip. And what if your camera is stolen or you lose your favourite necklace?”\nFirst, check to see whether any expensive items you intend to take with you are already covered under your home contents policy.\nSome policies cover items taken oputside the home, but not all. And be aware that any claim you do make, would affect your no-claims discount.\nRelated: Our holiday checklist: find the best deals for your wallet\nMore importantly, perhaps, is the cover for cancellation and curtailment.\n“If you’ve booked in advance and have to cancel, you’ll want a policy that allows you to reclaim your costs,” says Nolan Mortimer, partner at law firm Colemans CTTS.\nAnd they can really add up – hotels in the UK can be as expensive as abroad plus there’s any pre-booked trains or internal flights.\nCircumstances under which you can claim include serious illness or death of the policyholder or a close relative (policies vary in how they define “close relative”, so check your documents).\nIf you’re in the armed forces policies often cover you if you’re ordered back to work in an emergency. You’re also often covered for jury service.\nIf you plan a number of trips abroad and in the UK an annual travel insurance policy will work out better value. But again, check the UK is covered and for exclusions.\nAccording to Which? you may not be covered if your accommodation is less than 25 miles from home, and your policy may stipulate that you must stay a minimum number of nights. Some state that the accommodation needs to be pre-booked and/or pre-paid, says Halifax Travel Insurance.\nMortimer adds that most cover those aged 18-70, but there may be restrictions or a revised premium if you are older.\nThere are some elements of your holiday you cannot claim for, such as unsatisfactory accommodation. For losses resulting from disruption to travel, you may be get some back, dependent on the circumstances.\nIt’s worth knowing your rights under consumer law before you fork out for insurance. Different problems come with different solutions:\nMany people assume it is an unnecessary expense in the UK. Less than half bother to take out cover\nDelays If a coach, train or plane travelling within the UK is delayed, the operator’s compensation arrangements kick in first.\nMost train operators provide compensation for a delay of more than 30 minutes through the “delay repay” scheme. Keep your ticket and go back to where you bought it from within 28 days of travel.\nHow much you’re entitled to depends on the operator’s terms and length of delay – it’s usually paid in rail vouchers.\n“If your train was cancelled you’ll only be eligible for compensation if there was no replacement service to get you to your destination,” adds Claire Alderson of travel website redspottedhanky.com.\nYou also can’t claim if the reasons were outside the train company’s control, such as severe weather.\nWhat about those add-on policies sold with train tickets? They vary, but may offer redress in areas where the law doesn’t give you any rights, says Citizens Advice. This could include a cancellation right if the person you’re travelling with gets ill, injured or dies.\nYou’re covered for delayed or cancelled internal flights through the EU’s Denied Boarding Regulation. This includes claims up to £460 compensation if a flight arrives more than three hours late, but only if the delay was something within the airline’s control – not severe weather.\nIf you’re unhappy with what’s offered you could consider claiming on your insurance. Pratt advises you may be able to if you miss your flight, ferry or train due to circumstances beyond your control. Again, check the small print as some policies don’t cover internal flights.\nPoor accommodation The law requires descriptions and adverts of property to be accurate and that if they are “inaccurate or misleading” it is a potential criminal offence under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008”.\nSo you are legally covered if you arrive at your holiday cottage and it’s got two bedrooms instead of four. You won’t be able to claim on your insurance.\nCitizens Advice advises that you:\n■ Keep a copy of the original advert, brochure or web page.\n■ Decide whether to stay and claim damages or ditch it and pay for an alternative.\n■ If you book alternative accommodation try to find something of the same standard or be ready to show that more expensive accommodation was the only option.\n■ Take pictures of the original accommodation.\nIf your complaint is not resolved to your satisfaction find out if the trader is a member of a trade association that offers a resolution service.\nOr, if you paid by credit card or Visa debit card, you may be able to claim back money through your card provider.\nDays out that end up as days in If the attraction you have booked for a day out is not as advertised you should be entitled to some, or part, of your money back depending on the effect it had on your holiday, says Mortimer.\nHowever, most attractions have robust terms and conditions that don’t allow for a refund or compensation if an attraction is closed.\nDaniel Landen, managing director at Protected Travel Services, which offers advice and tools to the travel industry, says: “As a rule of thumb, if a theme park closed one ride for maintenance it would be considered that this wasn’t a major impact on the whole experience.\n“But if you arrived at a theme park and half an hour later they closed it because of a staff strike, you should be entitled to claim back your money.”\nCitizens Advice says that a claim would be for “loss of enjoyment or disappointment”. You should complain as soon as the issue becomes apparent. You won’t be able to claim through your travel insurance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T09:22:35.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
