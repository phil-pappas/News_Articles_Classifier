(July 9, 2015) – Political and economic upheaval in the Middle East, Greece and Puerto Rico continues to capture news headlines and the collective attention of investors across the country.\nTuning out the noise and staying dedicated to a long-term investment plan can be a challenge. But it’s a challenge that fiduciary firms like Hewins Financial Advisors are determined to navigate, relying on time-tested research, resources and expertise to help keep clients on track and focused on their financial goals — instead of the headlines.\nIn line with this approach, Hewins has appointed Rafia Hasan , CFP®, CFA, Senior Associate Consultant, as the newest member of its Investment Committee in an effort to expand its capabilities, deliver more value and help fulfill new investment needs for clients.\nDrawing on her experience in both the advisory and investment sides of the industry, Rafia brings unique perspective and expertise to the team. Prior to joining Hewins, she worked as an Analyst in the Alternative Investments Division at Credit Suisse Securities, before moving to Citibank, where she served as a Risk Analyst for the Emerging Markets Corporate Bank. In these capacities, Rafia gained valuable experience in due diligence and private equity research, which has played a crucial role in the development of Hewins’ private equity program for clients.\nA Certified Financial Planner (CFP®), Rafia’s investment knowledge is coupled with considerable experience in financial advisory and client care, which is drawn from her tenure with Dimensional Fund Advisors. It was there that Rafia honed her ability to effectively communicate complex financial ideas and methods, which will make her an invaluable asset to the committee and to Hewins, as a whole.\n“Not only does Rafia bring a CFA designation and an MBA to our Investment Committee, her knowledge of alternative investments and investment communications will further­ expand the expertise we can leverage to meet our clients' investment needs,” says Martha Post, Chief Investment Officer at Hewins. “We’re excited about the value she will add to the committee and to our advisory teams in their work with clients.”\nAbout Hewins Financial Advisors\nHewins Financial Advisors is a national, CPA-based advisory firm that has delivered objective advice to high-net-worth individuals and families, small businesses and retirement plans since 1999.
