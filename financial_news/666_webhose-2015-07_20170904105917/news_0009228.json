The allegations that members of the public have been pressurised into making donations is something I take very seriously as a charity leader. There is a problem that needs fixing.\nSupporters – donors and volunteers – are the beating heart of British charities. The relationship between them and the organisations they support has to be one of mutual trust and respect.\nWe have to continue to make the case to the British public about why we should help\nThe time has come for better regulation over how charities fundraise from the public. We need one strong body to regulate charity fundraising, like the Advertising Standards Association, rather than the current confused structure. And, there needs to be sanctions against any charity which fails to meet the new standards set. That could include publishing mistakes on our own websites, like newspapers do, to show when we have been found wanting.\nBut there is a balance. The donations provided by the public are a lifeline to many in need – in our case it helps families who are caught up in wars and natural disasters. It is our role as charities to strike the right balance between raising much-needed funds and ensuring that every member of the public who wants to help feels respected and valued.\nRelated: Everything you need to know about the charity fundraising crisis\nThis is why Save the Children has chosen to make a promise to our supporters. Our Supporter Promise , launched last week, gives people greater control over how they donate and ensures that no one is aggressively targeted. The promise guarantees no telephone cold calling to members of the general public, no sharing or selling of individual’s details and allows supporters to choose how they are contacted. If they never want to hear from us again, or only want to be contacted by text or email, we will honour those wishes.\nThis could cost us money in the short-term. But what is most important to Save the Children, is that we maintain the trust and confidence we have built over 95 years.\nCharities are being increasingly relied upon. As our annual report out this week reveals, we worked on 97 emergencies in 54 countries last year – up from 88 the year before. From Syria to Ebola to South Sudan, millions of children urgently needed our help.\nRelated: Charity fundraising: how do we fix this mess? – Open thread\nIn more than a quarter of a century working in the humanitarian sector, 2014 was one of the hardest years I’ve seen. And, in light of funding cuts I know that it was challenging for the voluntary sector as a whole.\nMeeting this challenge is a huge stretch. The voluntary sector must continue to make the case to the British public about why we should help those in need and how, with their support, we can do it. I have seen for myself the difference we can make, whether it’s at a classroom for Syrian refugee children in Lebanon who haven’t had the chance to go to school for four years or at a treatment centre for Ebola victims in Sierra Leone. These are things our donors, whether they are major philanthropists or people giving £5 a month, have made possible.\nAt Save the Children, we have a vision of a world where no child dies of preventable causes and every young person has the chance to learn. In order to achieve this, we will continue to seek new partners and new supporters to change the world together. But we cannot do it without the generosity and support of the general public. My charity, and the rest of the voluntary sector, need them with us as we fight for a better world for everyone.\nFor more news, opinions and ideas about the voluntary sector, join our community – it’s free!", "external_links": ["http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/2015-07/new-supporter-promise-launched-impact-reaches-record-high"], "published": "2015-07-13T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T14:46:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
