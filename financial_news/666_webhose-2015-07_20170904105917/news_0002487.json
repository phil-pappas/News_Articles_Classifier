Credit Suisse Hong Kong research led by chief regional economist Dong Tao said the biggest threat to the economy from a sharp market correction was though the consumption and finance channels.\n Mr Tao noted a major shift in household savings from banks into brokerage accounts, and exposure to equity markets had surged from 10 per cent of liquid assets to at least 30 per cent. Further plunges to the market could result in retail sales figures returning flat or declining.\n\"[A decline] would take away the final growth engine, when investment and exports are all facing structural issues and have already decelerated,\" Mr Tao said.\nBut Nomura's Mr Zhao said while there used to be a correlation between equity market performance and consumption or production, \"this has weakened since 2011 and almost faded last year\".\nChina's household savings rates were higher than in other economies, he said, lowering the wealth effect - the link between capital gains and economic activity - on consumption.\nAdditionally, equity market swings have resulted in a transference of wealth rather than creation and destruction of it.\nCredit Suisse's head of China research Vincent Chan agreed the effect of the market falls on production and investment activities would be limited, as equity financing accounted for just 4 per cent of total social financing from January to May, when the market rose its sharpest.\n\"Consumption sentiment probably would get hurt... but given consumption not not been boosted at all during the market rally... equity still only accounted for a small portion of net household wealth; and the labour market is still healthy with strong wage growth, impact on consumption should not last for too long,\" he said.\n'Whatever it takes' Mr Tao said the Chinese government had a stronger political will to do \"whatever it takes\" to keep the market afloat than seen in previous examples in US in 2008 and the European Central Bank in 2012.\nWhile Beijing had already thrown a boatload of measures including easing policy, boosting liquidity and even banning short-selling, IPOs and suspending stocks, it still had options up its sleeve if needed.\n\"We are inclined to believe that Beijing will escalate policy responses until they start working,\" Mr Tao said.\nâ€‹Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets fund manager Mark Mobius said he still saw \"compelling\" reasons to invest in China.\n\"The bottom line regarding the recent correction in China's markets is essentially a story of too much euphoria and a natural correction,\" Mr Mobius wrote in a note.\n\"These types of bear markets (and I would deem this a bear market) tend to be short in duration; they don't last too long, and when the recovery comes, it tends to be bigger in percentage terms,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-07-10T09:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T06:04:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
