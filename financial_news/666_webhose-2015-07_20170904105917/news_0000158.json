If we can get India down to the same position (as in the previous match), we will be happy,\" he said after the toss.\nOn the other hand, India skipper Ajinkya Rahane stressed on the need of settling in on a wicket that is expected to offer some movement in the early stages of the match.\n\"We are playing the same eleven. The boys are looking forward to the match. There will be some movement initially, if we can take our time, the wicket will get better later on. I am not sure what's a good score on this wicket, but we need to bat well,\" Rahane said.\nIndia lead the three-match series 1-0 after securing a close four-run win in the first ODI on Friday.\nTeams:\nZimbabwe: 1 Vusi Sibanda, 2 Chamu Chibhabha, 3 Hamilton Masakadza, 4 Elton Chigumbura(c), 5 Sean Williams, 6 Sikandar Raza, 7 Richmond Mutumbami(w), 8 Graeme Cremer, 9 Donald Tiripano, 10 Brian Vitori, 11 Neville Madziva\nIndia: 1 M Vijay, 2 Ajinkya Rahane (captain), 3 Ambati Rayudu, 4 Manoj Tiwary, 5 Robin Uthappa (wk), 6 Kedar Jadhav, 7 Stuart Binny, 8 Harbhajan Singh, 9 Axar Patel, 10 Bhuvneshwar Kumar, 11 Dhawal Kulkarni\nFollow TOI Sports on Twitter >> @TOISportsNews\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Zimbabwe vs India 2015,Neville Madziva,Elton Chigumbura,Cricket news,Ajinkya Rahane Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://twitter.com/TOISportsNews", "http://www.cricbuzz.com/live-cricket-scores/14860/zim-vs-ind-2nd-odi-india-tour-of-zimbabwe-2015"], "published": "2015-07-12T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T10:48:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
