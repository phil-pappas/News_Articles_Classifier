While the index is off nearly 22% from its mid-June high, pushing it back into bear territory, values have still doubled over the past year. A bear market is defined as a fall of 20% from a high.\nThe smaller Shenzhen market 399106, -4.79% ended 4.8% lower, after being up 2.4% earlier Wednesday. The ChiNext board 399006, -3.47% fell 3.5% after being up as much as 5.2% in earlier trade. Both have lost more than a quarter of their value from highs reached in June.\nLate in the trading session, China Financial Futures Exchange issued a statement on its official microblog account, denying rumors that have been circulating on Chinese social media over the past few days that “foreign institutions” had engaged in “massive” short selling of mainland A-shares using index futures. The exchange named Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and China Southern Asset Management, a Shenzhen-headquartered company with an asset-management subsidiary in Hong Kong, adding the latter didn’t have a registered account with the exchange.\n“CFFEX will continue to strengthen market monitoring, effectively protecting market order, and will severely punish and crack down on market manipulation,” the statement said.\nGoldman Sachs declined to comment, and China Southern couldn’t be reached for comment.\nLofty valuations make mainland-listed shares a tempting target for short selling, a practice when investors sell borrowed shares in hopes of buying them back later at a lower price and pocketing the difference. Still there are limits for foreigners seeking to short China-focused exchange-traded funds or derivatives listed outside the country, and Chinese regulators remain wary of the practice.\nOver the past few days, Beijing announced a raft of policies aimed at soothing market tensions, including plans to allow the state pension fund to invest in stocks and lower the stamp duty on share purchases. The central bank cut interest rates over the weekend, its fourth such move since November. China’s main index rallied 5.5% on Tuesday, which some market participants put down to state entities buying blue-chip stocks.\nStill, market sentiment remains weighed down by expectations that investors who have taken on huge amount of debt to fund stock purchases during the rally will be forced to sell stocks in coming weeks to pay back loans to brokers, exacerbating market weakness.\n“We don’t think that the deleveraging process in the stock market has run its course and the market may stay volatile in coming weeks,” said analysts from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nWeakness in China’s economy is another drag on the market. A private sector gauge of Chinese manufacturing conditions compiled by HSBC and Markit released Wednesday fell to 49.4 compared with 49.2 a month earlier, missing a preliminary estimate, and below the 50-mark that separates contraction from expansion.\nExports from the region have been dismal in recent months amid China’s slowdown, patchy demand in the U.S. and Europe’s fragile recovery. Nations that export heavily to China also are feeling pain: South Korea’s manufacturing purchasers index slipped to 46.1 in June from 47.8 in May, the deepest contraction since September 2012. Earlier Wednesday, South Korea reported its exports fell for a sixth straight month by 1.8% in June.\nElsewhere, global markets stabilized even as Greece ended up defaulting on its €1.55 billion loan ($1.73 billion) to the International Monetary Fund, with creditors rejecting a last-ditch effort to buy more time. The euro EURUSD, -0.3052% was lower in Asia trade, down 0.3% to the U.S. dollar at $1.1101.\nIn Japan, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average NIK, +0.46% closed up 0.5% after the Bank of Japan’s quarterly tankan survey showed improving confidence among big manufacturers in the second quarter.\n“The default itself had been expected from last weekend and therefore should not result in any new shock to the stock market,” says Hideyuki Ishiguro, strategist at Okasan Securities. “Investors remain wary of taking on any new risk, however, and that should limit any gains today until Sunday’s Greek referendum, on whether or not to accept conditions for another bailout, is done.”\nSouth Korea’s Kospi Composite SEU, +1.14% gained 1.1%, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, +1.04% rose 1%. Hong Kong’s market is closed for a holiday.\nBradford Frischkorn contributed to this article.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T14:58:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
