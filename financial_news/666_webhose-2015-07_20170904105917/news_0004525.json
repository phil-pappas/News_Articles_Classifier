Photo: QSuper\nTurning traditional asset allocation on its head and favouring bonds over stocks has helped Queensland public sector superannuation fund QSuper rank as the top-performing balanced fund for the past financial year with a return of 12.3 per cent, according to Chant West research to be released on Monday.\nQSuper chief investment officer Brad Holzberger, who oversees the investment strategy for the $29.5 billion fund, said the main difference between QSuper's balanced option and the typical fund measured in the closely watched annual survey of super funds, was that it had much more of its members' money invested in long dated sovereign bonds and much less in local shares.\nSkew to sovereign bonds \"The biggest contributor to our excellent relative performance over the past year has been a heavy skew to long duration sovereign bonds, that left us better positioned for the extended period of low US interest rates that caught many investors by surprise this year.\"\nThe typical asset allocation strategy for \"balanced\" funds, in which most Australian workers are placed by default, is 70 per cent growth assets (mostly stocks) to 30 per cent defensive assets (mostly bonds). Most super funds have the majority of their stock portfolio invested domestically.\nQSuper's allocation to equities is only about 35 per cent, of which roughly two thirds is offshore.\nMr Holzberger said the fund also had a broader base of \"alternative\" investments, such as infrastructure and private equity.\n\"It is great our members have got a good result from the strategy this year, but it is a long-term strategy we have been instituting since 2009 and expect to keep for many years to come. There will be some years it doesn't do so well relative to other funds, but it is a long term call to guard against a number of risks, including the possibility of sustained low global growth and deflation,\" he said.\nMy AutoSuper ranks second MTAA My AutoSuper ranked second in the Chant West league tables with an annual return of 11.7 per cent. The balanced fund MySuper options from Statewide Super, AMP Future Directions, VicSuper, UniSuper, and HOSTPLUS, all delivered 11 per cent or more. Rounding out the top 10 was Intrust Super, MLC Horizon 4, and AustralianSuper â€“ all with an annual return of 10.9 per cent. The median return was 9.8 per cent.\nConsistent with the long-term trend, industry funds beat retail funds over the year, returning 10.2 per cent versus 9.6 per cent. Over the 15 years to June 2015, industry funds returned 6.9 per cent per annum against 5.8 per cent from retail funds. REST Core ranked as the number one balanced growth option fund over 10 years with an average annual return of 7.7 per cent.\n\"Over the longer term, industry funds have outperformed retail funds largely because, as a group, they tended to have lower allocations to listed shares during periods when shares underperformed, although that no longer applies. However industry funds still have 20 per cent invested in alternative assets against 4 per cent at retail funds,\" Chant West boss Warren Chant said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T12:21:07.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
