ADVERTISEMENT The measure advanced on a 57 to 1 vote, with Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) the lone lawmaker to oppose it.\n“Multi-million dollar paydays for the CEOs of Fannie and Freddie represent a failed grasp of reality on the part of both the [government sponsored entities] and their regulator,” said Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), who is the lead co-sponsor on the bill. \nEarlier this month, financial disclosures revealed that Fannie Mae CEO Timothy Mayopoulos and Freddie Mac CEO Donald Layton will each earn target compensation of $4 million. \nRoyce's bill would have reduced their salaries to $255,000. That's the top salary at the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which regulates Fannie and Freddie. \nAn amedment to the bill, though, raised the cap to $600,000. \nThis story was updated at 6:48 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T06:09:05.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
