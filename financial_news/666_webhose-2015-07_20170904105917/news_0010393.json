The tax department has decided to usher these new protocols soon, as the new ITRs for the assessment year 2015-16 have recently been notified, heralding the onset of the tax filing season. The deadline for filing ITRs is 31st August. A senior official involved in the processes told PTI that the new ITRs will capture the Aadhaar number of an individual and, after doing a ‘back end’ matching of the Aadhaar number with the mobile number and other vital personal data of the individual, an OTP will be generated and sent for validating and final submission of the return.
