In 2012, the most recent year Eurostat published data, Greek authorities recorded almost 88,000 cases of burglary. A 76 per cent increase from five years earlier. Greece: \"No\" we won't pay IMF debt on time, says Varoufakis on deadline day 1:18 Play video\nGreece will not make its payment to the IMF, rejecting the June 30 deadline on their debt package, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis announced in a short statement as he entered the Ministry of Finance in Athens, Tuesday. A small group of cleaning ladies that work in the building were protesting outside the Ministry of Finance, calling for a wage hike. On seeing the finance minister after his statement, the women quickly surrounded Varoufakis, some of them hugging him. The announcement that Greece will default on its 1.60bn ($1.79bn) debt to the IMF was not unexpected following Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras announced that the country would hold a referendum on whether to accept the austerity measures imposed by the so-called troika (IMF, ECB, EC). The Greek government closed the country's banks on Monday, as well as imposing limits on withdrawals until July 6, the day after Greeks are due to vote in a referendum. A 'No' vote by the Greek people would reject new austerity measures that are demanded by Greece's creditors, while a 'Yes' would accept the institutions' conditions for a new Greek bailout package.\nRightster 01 Jul 2015 News/World The case of one elderly couple who had their entire life savings of €80,000 stolen by home invaders earlier this year illustrates the danger faced by those stashing their savings at home.\nThe only problem is Greeks are becoming increasing suspicious of banks and the government that controls them — a fear that was likely exacerbated by the forced closure of all banks this week.\nSecurity deposit boxes at banks offer a safe alternative to the product Mr Moschopoulos is selling, but there’s no certainty.\n“There’s always the chance that some law will get passed to investigate what’s inside all those boxes, and they could all be frozen,” he told Time.\nThe must-have asset in Greece right now.

And Mr Moschopoulos couldn’t be happier about it.\n“Cash is king”, denotes an old adage, and a king needs to be secure. In Greece lately, the safe-selling business is about as secure as it gets.
