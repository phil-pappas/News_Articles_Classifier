Tamara Voninski by Jamie Freed Frequent flyer points are already so popular in Australia that they are like a second currency – and now the federal government is looking to get in on the game.\nIn a draft discussion paper in relation to an upcoming tender for $377 million of annual air travel spending, the government has expressed interest in receiving the pool of frequent flyer points earned by its travellers to be used at a department or agency level – presumably for redemptions on future flights to cut travel costs.\nAt present, travellers do not receive frequent flyer points when on government business but they do receive status credits that can help accrue perks like lounge access. The idea up for discussion would allow the government to accrue the frequent flyer points on behalf of its flyers – a move that would lead to an added cost for the airlines involved.\n\"Organisations are invited to provide information about … any opportunities, current or emerging technology and systems that are available to enable loyalty reward points to be accrued and be used at a government department/agency level,\" the discussion paper said.\nThe government also indicated it will seek fixed price, discounted fares on key airline routes and perks like limousine transfers for members of parliament and top officials when it places its air travel spending out for tender as early as next month. But airline industry sources said that such arrangements were already in place.\nThe Whole of Australian Government air travel contract began in July 2010 and is due to expire in April 2016. The panel includes domestic carriers Qantas, Virgin Australia, Jetstar and Regional Express and 11 international carriers, including Air New Zealand, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific and United Airlines.\nThe government is seeking industry feedback on the draft discussion paper by July 20. The proposal involves combining domestic and international airlines under a single deed, potentially for up to 11 years, and creating two tiers of airlines.\nTop tier requirements To reach the top tier, one requirement could be to fly a particular number of the government's international routes. The government has also expressed interest in receiving \"fixed price route deal fares\" for the top domestic and international city pairs.\nIn the 2013-14 financial year, the government spent $377 million on air travel, of which 64 per cent was domestic and the remainder international.\nThe spending covered 150 agencies and 100,000 travellers. The government is the largest air travel user in Australia, ahead of BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and the big banks and it has unique requirements, including the transport of prisoners, asylum seekers, witnesses and dangerous goods such as firearms, handcuffs and chemicals.\nThe fares being sought by the government range from economy class to first class, with VIP treatment being sought for members of parliament and other top officials, including an airport liaison offer to assist the traveller at the airport, priority check-in and baggage, limousine transfer services where applicable and identification during the trip that the traveller is a VIP.\nFor all travellers, the government is interested in fare conditions that offer increased baggage allowances, complimentary lounge access, the flexibility to amend or cancel bookings with minimal or no financial impact and flexible or no ticketing limits, along with priority check-in and priority baggage.\nThe top domestic routes flown by the government include Sydney-Canberra, Melbourne-Canberra and Canberra-Brisbane, with the top international routes including Perth-Christmas Island, Sydney-Los Angeles and Sydney-Singapore.\nTigerair Australia, now owned by Virgin, is the only major domestic carrier missing from the current panel, while Air Niugini and Solomon Airlines fly some of the top 10 international routes but are not on the panel. Air Niugini is the only carrier offering commercial flights from Port Moresby to Manus Island, the fourth biggest international city pair by volume of travellers.\nThe government has been looking to cut travel costs as much as possible. Earlier this year, it appointed Helloworld's QBT division as the sole travel management provider . It had previously used a panel of five travel managers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:08:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
