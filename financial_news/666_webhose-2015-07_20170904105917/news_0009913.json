The entity has more than 1 billion dirhams ($272 million) of assets in the Middle East, UK and India. \nThe Kerala-born businessman is the latest in a slew of foreign buyers who have shaken off mounting fears of a 'Brexit' from the European Union and possible economic contagion from the stricken euro zone, to invest in prime UK real estate. \nThe asset class, particularly London trophy property, is widely seen as recession-proof, thanks to consistently rising values and robust rents that appear to defy domestic and global economic shocks. \nChinese buyers seeking safe quarters for their cash against a backdrop of increasing turbulence in their domestic stock markets are among those competing for prime London property. \nAn ultra-low interest rate environment and central bank money printing have driven down bond returns and fuelled demand for UK hotel investment, with first-quarter deal volumes up 38 percent year-on-year at 1.22 billion euros ($1.35 billion), data from property adviser CBRE shows. \nThis is almost double the investment volumes recorded in the second-most attractive market of Germany, CBRE said. \nPrime London hotel investments offered typical yields of 4.25 percent in the first quarter, compared with 1.91 percent offered by 10-year UK Gilts or 0.63 percent offered by 10-year German bunds, according to latest market data. \nSteigenberger Hotel Group has been selected to operate the 92,000 square foot hotel when it opens early next year. \nThe property, made famous by novelists Charles Dickens and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, was occupied by the capital's fledgling 'Met' police force between 1829 and 1890. It was here that the famous Jack the Ripper crimes were investigated. \nNew Scotland Yard, the most recent headquarters, was sold to Abu Dhabi Financial Group for 370 million pounds in December. \n($1 = 0.9027 euros) \n($1 = 0.6442 pounds) \n($1 = 3.6730 UAE dirham)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T15:07:27.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
