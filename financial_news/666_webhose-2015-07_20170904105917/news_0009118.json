That's the lowest level since September 2004. \nThe loonie has been on a downward slide since last summer, when the price of oil started to weaken. \nOil prices dropped below the US$50 mark in trading Wednesday, while gold traded for less than US$1,100 an ounce. \nCompounding the loonie weakness was a decision by the Bank of Canada to cut its key interest rate last week. \nThe central bank's overnight rate target stands at 0.5 percent.
