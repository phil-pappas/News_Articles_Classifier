Daniel Munoz by Joanna Mather The influential Group of 100 says it would support changes to the tax regime, including the capital gains discount, as a trade-off for increasing and broadening the GST.\nThe Group of 100 is urging the government to come up with a 10-year tax plan and chairman Neville Mitchell said both business and the community needed to bring something to the tax reform table.\nHe cited a modification of the 50 per cent discount on capital gains as something the business community could support, if brought as part of a package of reforms including a higher GST rate and broader base.\n\"There will have to be compromise on both sides in order to get some long-term settings in place,\" said Mr Mitchell, who is Cochlear's finance boss.\n\"The capital gains tax discount is one area that should definitely be reviewed.\"\nThe government's 'Rethink' tax discussion paper says CGT concessions for business were worth about $1.4 billion in 2013-14, which went to small businesses.\nThe G100 is comprised of the chief finance officers of the nation's 100 biggest companies.\nThe 50 per cent CGT discount is blamed by some for increasing the investor appetite for housing, thereby locking first home purchasers out of the market .\n Mr Mitchell said Australia's corporate tax rate was uncompetitive internationally and proposed cuts to the research and development tax concession were short-sighted.\n\"The other area the Group of 100 is absolutely looking at is this whole area of deregulation and complexity,\" Mr Mitchell said.\n\"The Rethink paper brings out the fact that $40 billion is spent on collecting taxes worth $380 billion. That's a very high collection rate and we think there is scope to simplify that whole collection process.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T04:45:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
