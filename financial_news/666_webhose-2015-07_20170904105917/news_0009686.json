Official documents say the FBI went through Morgan's computer at the town office and later confiscated it.\n\"They did take the base of the computer. The FBI did, but they backed up all the files that we needed, so we just had to put them onto another computer,\" said Patricia Gardner, deputy town clerk.\nMorgan was soon arrested on federal charges for conspiracy to produce child pornography. Authorities say he allegedly had 27,000 videos on a hard drive, and that he and six other men lured children into video chat rooms to perform sex acts. Morgan originally pleaded not guilty to the charges,\n\"I think that what I've read of the deposition and all the charges and everything that he pleaded to that justice will be served on it,\" said Edward Gardner, Essex town supervisor.\nNow, Morgan has pleaded guilty. Town officials say that by law, they had been continuing his pay through the end of June. On Thursday evening, they plan to terminate his pay and replace his position.\n\"The town clerk will present the charges, and that he's pleaded guilty. From there we will probably pass a resolution to stop all payments to his retirement, and his hospitalization and his pay,\" said Edward Gardner.\nPatricia Gardner has been working in his place since Morgan's arrest earlier this year. Officials expect that Patricia Gardner will be appointed this week, but she then will have to be elected by voters in November to continue serving as town clerk for the next two years\n\"I'm hoping to be appointed, which will expire Dec. 31. I am running. I do have my petition sent in so I will be on the ballot in November,\" said Patricia Gardner.\nWilliam Morgan will face 15 to 30 years in prison.\nGardner says she's relieved that the town can move on after a painful time.\n\"You know, it's just unfortunate,\" said Patricia Gardner.\nWe reached out to Todd Richman, the public defender representing Morgan, but he declined to comment on the case.\nRelated Stories:\nNY town clerk pleads not guilty to federal porn charges\nEssex, NY, requests town computer seized as evidence", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T04:26:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
