Insee , as the institute is known, said the GDP would grow by 1.2% this year, marking a “significant acceleration” after an average growth of just 0.4% over the past three years.\nThe forecast is slightly rosier than the one given by the government, which is expecting 1% growth through to December.\nInsee said growth would be boosted by cheap fuel, a weak euro and easy access to credit, coupled with government steps to reduce taxes on business.\nThe statistics bureau said the faster expansion this year will allow a stabilization of unemployment at a rate of 10.4% during the second half of the year, but will not translate into significant new hirings until the next year.\nPresident François Hollande pledged to lower unemployment when elected in 2012. Instead, the number of people out of work has reached record highs under his tenure.\nHollande has also promised not to seek re-election in 2017 should he fail to lower unemployment before the end of his term.\n 06-19\nTweet print", "external_links": ["http://www.insee.fr/en/default.asp", "http://f24.my/1et98Jf", "http://f24.my/1et97oN&title=French&#x20;economy&#x20;eyes&#x20;rebound&#x20;but&#x20;job&#x20;market&#x20;still&#x20;lags&newwindow=1&sr=worldnews", "http://f24.my/1et98Jj", "http://f24.my/1et97oJ", "https://twitter.com/share", "http://f24.my/1et97oF"], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T15:58:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
