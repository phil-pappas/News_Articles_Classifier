Brazil's auto industry production shrank 14.8 percent in June from a year earlier and sales fell 19.4 percent.\nTo this end, the government has been increasing the amount of money available to finance exports through the import-export arm of state-owned development bank BNDES.\nIt is also hoping that a 18 percent decline in the value of Brazil's real against the U.S. dollar will boost exports.
