I have been working in Singapore for the past 20 years. Could you tell me what are the tax liabilities of a returning non-resident Indian (NRI)? —Baiju Raman The taxability of a person in India depends on one’s source of income and residential status. Any income, the source of which is located in India is taxable in India (irrespective of residential status). Residential status is determined on the basis of physical presence of an individual in India during a financial year. If the individual satisfies any of the basic conditions mentioned below, she would qualify as a resident, otherwise she would qualify as an NRI: Basic conditions: *Stay in India during the financial year is 182 days or more, or *Stay in India during the financial year is 60 days or more, and in the four years immediately preceding the financial year is 365 days or more. However, if she comes to India on a ‘visit’ and the ‘visit’ has not been defined under the Indian tax law (but would not include visit for an employment), the 60-day period in the above basic conditions would be substituted for 182 days. A resident may either qualify as an ordinarily resident or not ordinarily resident. If any of the additional conditions mentioned below are not met, then the individual would qualify as a not ordinarily resident, otherwise one would qualify as an ordinarily resident. Additional conditions: *One has been a resident in India in 9 of 10 financial years preceding the relevant financial year, or *Stay in the seven years preceding the relevant financial year is in the of aggregate 729 days or more. An individual with residential status of resident and ordinarily resident is taxable on her global income and is required to report those global assets in her India income tax return. However, a non-resident or a resident but not ordinarily resident is liable to pay tax on India source income. With regards to your query, given that you have been out of India for the past 20 years and would not have substantial physical presence in India in the past 10 years, you are likely to qualify as a not ordinarily resident in the financial year that you returned to India and you will taxable only on Indian source of income. Furthermore, your residential status has to be determined for every financial year.
