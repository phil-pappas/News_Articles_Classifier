He wouldn't give the figure, saying it will be announced when the contract is cancelled. \nFrench President Francois Hollande has acknowledged that France will have to give Russia a refund if it doesn't deliver the warship, whose handover to Russia was suspended last year over the Ukrainian crisis. \nThe 1.2 billion euro deal was supposed to be the biggest arms sale ever by a NATO country to Russia.
