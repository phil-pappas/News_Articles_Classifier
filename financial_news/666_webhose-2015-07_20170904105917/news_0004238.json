Revenue slipped 4% annually to $797.7 million but topped the consensus estimate by $24.6 million. Excluding currency impacts, revenues would have risen 5%. Net earnings rose 25% year-over-year to $41.8 million, or $0.33 per share, beating estimates by four cents. \nMixed growth Despite the earnings beat, growth was uneven across its main segments. Sales at its boys category, which accounted for 43% of the top line, rose 1% annually, thanks to strong demand for Jurassic World , Marvel, and Star Wars merchandise, which offset lower demand for Transformers products. However, sales at the girls segment, which accounted for 16% of sales, fell 22% due to lower demand for Furby, My Little Pony, and Nerf Rebelle products. \nSales of games, which accounted for 26.5% of revenue, slid 6% due to unfavorable comparisons to the prior year quarter when the division launched a major new set for Magic: The Gathering . However, those declines were partially offset by growth in classic games like Monopoly, Trouble, Clue, and Twister. Sales of preschool products rose 14% annually and accounted for the remaining 15% of revenue. That growth was fueled by strong demand for Play-Doh and Jurassic World products, which offset lower demand for its core Playskool line. \nHasbro paid out $57.4 million in dividends during the second quarter. Earlier this year, the toymaker hiked its dividend from $0.43 to $0.46 per share. The stock currently pays a forward annual dividend yield of 2.4%, which is considerably lower than rival Mattel with its 5.9% yield. However, shares of Hasbro have also risen nearly 50% over the past 12 months, versus Mattel's 33% decline. \nThe bottom line Hasbro quarterly numbers were considerably better than Mattel's. Last quarter, Mattel posted a net loss as sales only rose 1% on a constant currency basis, mainly due to weak sales of Barbie and its other brands for girls. Looking ahead, the upcoming Marvel and Star Wars films could keep lifting Hasbro sales as Mattel falls further behind. \nThe $18 million fortune about to be ripped from your credit card Bad news for your credit card company.
