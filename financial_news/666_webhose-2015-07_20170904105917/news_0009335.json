The redevelopment will increase the centre's food and fashion retail offer in response to the growing customer demand for aspirational fashion and new casual food and dining formats.\nAdvertisement Broadway Shopping Centre took out the honours this year when it became the first mall in Australia to crack the $12,000 sales per-square-metre mark. Broadway increased its moving average turnover per square metre by 6.4 per cent to a record $12,248 a square metre a year.\nThe redevelopment comes as Australia benefits from a continued influx of foreign entrants, with 40 new-store openings last year by new or expanding retailers and a further 12 openings in the first half of 2015.\nCBRE head of research Australia Stephen McNabb said this was helping to drive CBD rental growth, with Sydney CBD rents having increased 20 per cent in the past 12 months and rental growth having also been recorded in the shopping centre sector.\nHe said the conditions were improving with the leasing spreads moving back into positive territory, and there remained a low risk of oversupply for malls.\nIn the core of the city in Pitt Street Mall, activity is also hotting up with the Swedish giant H&M set to take over the keys at its site at the Stockland-Investa Glasshouse, in readiness for an internal fit-out. It is likely to open about September.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T06:56:58.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
