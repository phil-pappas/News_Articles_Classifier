Delivery of the jets is scheduled to begin from 2016, it added.\nChinese airlines are speeding up their expansion at home and abroad amid rising business travel and a surge in outbound tourism fuelled by an increasingly wealthy middle class in coastal and inland cities.\nThat has also helped pushed up Boeing and Airbus' aircraft orders. In September, 2014, Boeing said it expected China to need more than 6,020 in the next 20 year, an 8 percent rise over its 2013's estimates.\nIn April, Hainan Airlines announced a 24 billion yuan private placement deal and nearly half of fund raised would be used to buy 37 aircraft.\nThat was followed by similar initiative by China Eastern Airlines' to fund the purchase of 28 planes.\nThe Shanghai-based carrier also plans to work with new investor Delta Air Lines to expand its global footprint.
