Although this was the worst result amongst listed companies it was an improvement on the previous year's rate of 16.3.\nCiti looked at ASX100 companies, of which 94 reported injury data, 84 using the LTIFR system.\nThe report, Safety Spotlight: ASX100 Companies & More , also looked at 32 companies' remuneration plans and found Metcash was one of only four that did not list safety as a criterion for the assessment of its CEO's remuneration.\nThis claim was disputed by a Metcash spokesman who said a KPI to improve safety had been in place for the company's CEO and all senior executives for the past two years.\nWoolworths ranked second worst based on LTIFR data (10.4), followed by Qantas (8.9) and then Coles owner Wesfarmers (7.6).\nOther retail and hospitality businesses feature prominently on the list, with Myer at seventh, Westfield shopping centre owner Scentre Group 10th and hotel and casino group Echo Entertainment 11th.\nWesfarmers listed the worst score for Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate, with 31.9, down from 38.7 in the 2013 financial year. Metcash and Woolworths do not report TRIFR data.\nA number of companies in the ASX100 do not report their safety data, including in the high-risk fields like hospitality (Domino's Pizza), hospital operations and medical logistics (Healthscope and Sonic Healthcare) and telecommunication infrastructure (TPG Telecom).\nMacquarie Group is the only company in the ASX's top 20 that does not report safety data.\nThe Citi report points out that while companies in hospitality and retail have among the highest lost time rates, many involved in mining, materials and heavy industry have among the lowest, including AGL Energy with a rate of three injuries per million work hours, and packaging company Amcor with a rate of 0.5 hours.\nHowever, resources and heavy industry companies dominate in workplace deaths.\nMetcash reported only one death between 2005 and 2014, which was that of an employee who died in a single-vehicle road crash while making a delivery.\nWoolworths reported seven fatalities in the same period, which included five customers, two of whom were struck by workplace equipment.\nWesfarmers did not report any deaths related to its Coles operation.\nThe report says that investors are increasingly expecting companies to report safety data, and that companies that did not raised doubts about if they were managing the issue properly.\nThe authors write that while it is difficult to compare companies' safety rates because of different reporting boundaries and inherent difference between industries, the report said the figures nonetheless provided \"useful perspectives and insights\".\nCiti also looked at the degree to which work safety plays a role in CEOs' remuneration and bonuses, which was the case in 28 of the 32 companies examined which had references to safety ranging from brief, generic mentions through to companies that specify metrics and set targets.\nFor example, chemicals manufacturer Incitec Pivot withheld a safety bonus in 2013, while Cimic Group, formerly Leighton Holdings, applied a 10 per cent penalty for fatalities in the 2012 and 2013 financial years.\n\"Companies are becoming more explicit in how fatalities affect bonuses,\" the report says.\nA Woolworths spokesman said the company was pleased its reported injury rates were falling and that it was continuing to improve safety at the company.\nA Metcash spokesman said the company took its safety obligations seriously and complied with all regulatory obligations, including occupational health and safety.\nThe spokesman said Metcash had rolled out new technology to increase safety for employees, including automated robotic picking systems in its warehouses.\nA Wesfarmers spokeswoman said the the company was pleased it reported a significant improvement in its recorded injury rate across all divisions in 2014.", "external_links": ["http://images.theage.com.au/2015/07/13/6682109/1407injuries_729--1-.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-13T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T05:05:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
