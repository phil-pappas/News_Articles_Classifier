Foreign exchange reserves have fallen for four straight quarters, prompting experts to wonder where the funds are going By staff reporter Huo Kan \n(Beijing) – What happened to China's foreign exchange reserve? \nThat's the question economists and analysts have been asking after the country's forex reserve, the largest in the world, posted its fourth straight decline in the second quarter. This is the longest such streak since 1998, and several financial institutions have predicted the declines will continue. \nAs of June, the amount of forex reserves held by the central bank stood at US$ 3.69 trillion, down from an all-time high of US$ 3.99 trillion in the same month last year, official data show. \nForex reserves fell US$ 36.2 billion in the second quarter of this year, after dropping US$ 113 billion in the first quarter. The final two quarters of last year also saw the forex reserves shrink. The third quarter's fall was 105.2 billion, and the fourth quarter's was 47.7 billion. \nOne obvious explanation for this streak – one that has some analysts concerned – is foreign capital leaving the country because investors lack confidence in the economic outlook and because the U.S. dollar is expected to become stronger. \nEstimates for how much capital has left the country vary widely because of a lack of reliable data. The Chinese government does not publish many details of its forex holdings and investments, and there are many unexplained overlaps and potential conflicts in the ways different authorities report activities involving cross-border capital flows. \nConsider this: Goldman Sachs reported on July 21 that about US$ 200 billion left China in the second quarter, a record amount. But a spokeswoman for the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said two days later at a press conference that there were no significant capital outflows in the first half year. \nGoldman Sachs cited an unusually high surplus of commodities trading in the first six months of the year, arguing that an increase this great would have led to a surge in the central bank's forex reserve, unless it was canceled out by a greater outflow of foreign capital. \nYet SAFE said less capital flew out of the country from March to June than in the first three months because its forex reserve shrunk less severely during the second quarter. The spokeswoman did not give numbers for the capital flows. \nHow much did \"hot money\" contribute to capital outflows? \nTo answer this, Zhu Haibin, chief China economist of JPMorgan Chase & Co., broke down cross-border capital flows into companies' forex deposits and debts, direct net foreign investment and yuan payments across borders. The rest was categorized as \"hot money.\" \nHe used the central bank's forex reserve change minus the current account surplus to approximate the total amount of cross-border capital movements, which resulted in a net outflow of US$ 340 billion from last July to June. Of that, hot money contributed US$ 235 billion. \nHe argued that the changes in all three categories apart from hot money were actually positive. For example, companies were more willing to hold onto forex deposits and reduce forex debt because they had little expectation the yuan would continue appreciating. This marked progress for the central government's initiative to encourage private holdings and investment of foreign exchange. The central bank would be pleased to see its forex reserve decrease for this reason, Zhu said. \nLu Zhengwei, chief economist at Industrial Bank, and Xie Yaxuan, chief macroeconomic analyst at China Merchants Securities, also said the increase in forex holdings by companies and individuals caused the central bank's forex reserve to decline. \nZhu also pointed out the forex reserve may have fallen because of several recent projects, including the US$ 40 billion Silk Road Fund, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank. China has pledged forex investments to each of them. The central bank has also said it will bolster the capital of its two policy banks with forex reserve . \nHowever, it is unclear whether or how much of the investments were reflected in the change of forex reserve in the first half year, Zhu said. \nXie said the depreciation of euro-denominated assets in the forex reserve, which would strengthen if the U.S. dollar continued to appreciate, would also lead to falls in the forex reserve. \nMany analysts expect the decline to continue. Lu said it had entered a period of continuous decline primarily because of changes linked to a stronger US dollar. Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS, said she expected the forex reserve to fall by US$ 150 billion this year and a smaller amount next year. \n(Rewritten by Wang Yuqian) China's Billion Dollar Question: Why Are Forex Figures Falling?
