Carried interest – capital gains treatment and computation \nUK individuals will now be charged capital gains tax, at the current rate of 28%, on the full amounts they receive in respect of their carried interest. Deductions will only be allowed in respect of sums actually given by the individuals as consideration for acquiring the right to that carried interest. \nThis means that it will no longer be possible to use the so-called \"base cost shift\", which often resulted in lower effective rates of tax on carried interest receipts. The base cost shift resulted from the long-standing computational rules based on HM Revenue & Customs' published practice. It had the effect of increasing the capital gains base cost of the carried interest holder's interest by some of the amounts subscribed by limited partners, when the profit-sharing ratios changed under the terms of the limited partnership agreement (for example, when the fund started to pay out carried interest). \nCarried interest – Non-doms \nduties. \nConsultation on performance-linked rewards \n\"CGT\") treatment. One option in the consultation is to set out in legislation activities which are to be treated as long-term investment activities – examples given include acquiring controlling equity stakes in trading companies intended to be held for a period of at least three years, and making equity and debt investments in venture capital companies, provided they are intended to be held for a specified period of time. Another option up for consultation is to have a graduated system for access to CGT treatment, with full CGT treatment only available if the average investment holding period exceeds two years. \nto be effective in April 2016. \nLong-term non-doms", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T01:57:31.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
