The legislation is opposed by Democrats who argue that the 2010 Dodd-Frank law strengthened protections for consumers and reduced the odds for a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. \nThe measure cleared the Banking Committee two months ago but appears unlikely to pass the Senate soon. The underlying spending bill has a troubled path as well, since Democrats oppose its additional cuts to the IRS and other agencies. \nGOP author Sen. John Boozman of Arkansas praised the measure for protecting political groups from a potential IRS crackdown. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
