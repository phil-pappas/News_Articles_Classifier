It’s practically a tradition here.\nNow Mayor Mike Duggan is trying to do something about the high insurance costs based on concerns that they are deterring new residents and investment from coming to Detroit as it rebuilds after emerging from bankruptcy last year.\nThe chief reason for the high rates: Michigan is the only state that requires auto insurance policies to come with unlimited lifetime personal-injury protection, meaning that people who are hurt in car crashes get 100 percent of their medical expenses covered, sometimes for years or even decades. The protection applies regardless of who was at fault.\nThe law also allows care providers to charge much more for treatment of auto injuries.\n“Every doctor in every hospital in this state understands … that if you schedule an MRI for a rehab case for somebody who fell off a ladder and has Blue Cross, you get paid a certain amount,” Duggan said. “If that person got hurt in a car accident, you get reimbursed triple.”\nThe mayor wants to bring down insurance premiums by capping medical expenses tied to motorists’ policies.\nWhen the Michigan insurance law was adopted in 1972, the intent was to save money by reducing lawsuits resulting from crashes. But rising medical costs have steadily pushed costs up.\nMedical expenses now make up about 30 percent of total insurance premiums, said Nicole Bradshaw, a research associate at the Citizens Research Council of Michigan and author of a 2013 report on medical costs associated with so-called no-fault auto insurance.\nDetroit’s insurance rates are higher than those in the suburbs or in rural Michigan because urban areas tend to have more claims, and those claims are often more expensive.\nAll of the nation’s 25 priciest insurance ZIP codes are in Detroit, according to an industry ranking. Some motorists pay more for auto insurance than rent. And many people who wouldn’t think of going without health insurance or life insurance regularly take the risk when they drive.\n“I just do what I have to do,” said Jean Ford, 56, who let her $285 per month policy lapse in May because it took too much of the $1,400 per month she gets in disability and Social Security. “I get my daughter to drive me to the grocery and to doctor appointments. But when she can’t, I have to drive myself.”\nFord lives in an area where an unmarried 40-year-old man with a clean driving record and good credit pays about $4,700 for full coverage.\nDetroit’s highest annual rate reaches $5,100 in a ZIP code where the median household income is about $29,000 and nearly 36 percent of residents are below the poverty level.\nBy comparison, the insurance rate in one ZIP code in Brooklyn, N.Y., is $3,900, in Los Angeles about $2,400 and in Miami nearly $2,250, according to a study commissioned by CarInsurance.com.\nNationally, the average annual cost of insurance was $815 in 2012, the most recent year for which figures were available.\nDriving without insurance is usually a secondary offense discovered when a motorist is stopped for another violation or involved in an accident. Penalties in Detroit can include fines of almost $700 and a suspended license.\nMichigan is one of 12 states in which a driver’s car insurance covers injuries and medical bills no matter who caused the crash, according to carinsurance.com. All other no-fault states have drivers choose a limit to their personal-injury coverage.\nUnder Duggan’s D-Insurance plan, drivers could save up to $2,300 annually. The city would seek bids from auto insurance companies to provide at least $25,000 for medical care and cap catastrophic coverage at an additional $250,000. Costs beyond that level would be the responsibility of a driver’s health insurer.\nThe mayor argues that the changes would also bring more drivers into the system, which would help lower insurance rates even more.\nCorey Williams,\nThe New York Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T05:54:42.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
