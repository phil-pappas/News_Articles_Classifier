A source at one of the producers also Quote: d the same number.\nBut another end-user source said some deals were struck earlier in June at $90. Negotiations are still continuing between global miners and buyers.\nMajor producers had in May offered metal to Japanese buyers at $130-160 premiums for the third quarter, versus an April-June premium of $380 PREM-ALUM-JP. But sharply lower spot aluminium premiums in Japan and higher local inventory forced miners to lower their offers, traders said.\nPremiums around the world have more than halved from January, although they recovered slightly in June. This drop, along with weaker metal prices that hit a 16-month low in June, may put producers under renewed pressure to cut loss-making capacity.\nIn Japan, aluminium stocks held at three major ports rose for a fourteenth month to hit a record high of 502,200 tonnes at the end of May, doubling from a year ago, due to high imports and slow housing sector demand.\nJapan's aluminium ingot imports for the year ended in March rose 15 percent from a year ago to 1.725 million tonnes, while aluminium alloy arrivals rose 6 percent to 1.141 million tonnes.\nMeanwhile, China's exports of unwrought aluminium and aluminium products, including primary, alloy and semi-finished aluminium products, have risen 35 percent so far this year from a year ago.\n\"We think premiums won't drop further as overseas premiums are hitting floor and China will curb exports due to lower metal prices,\" a trader said. \"But that may change if China gears up output and exports again for some unexpected reasons.\"\n(Reporting by Yuka Obayashi, Editing by Himani Sarkar)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T16:37:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
