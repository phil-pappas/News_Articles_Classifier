We will not have a contest until there are women standing there beside the men going for preselection,\" Dr Stone said.\nThe comments come as Labor agreed to achieve 50 per cent target for all it's party positions in the next ten years at their national conference in Melbourne.\nMr Abbott's Chief of Staff has also called for more women in preselection battles in June, saying: \"our women are not in the safe seats, so when we lose government, we lose our pipeline\".\n Speaking on the ABC on Monday night, Education Minister Christopher Pyne said while he did not support quotas, the party needed to give more support to potential female PMs.\n\"I think we have suffered in the last decade or so in not having enough women in our party room.\n\"We need to make it a lot easier for younger career-minded women to choose public life, to choose politics and to choose families at the same time,\" he said.\nAn internal review of the Victorian Liberal Party found earlier this year that the party needed to establish a code of conduct to prevent bullying and aggressive behaviour towards women, and showed some women were \"actively dissuaded\" from standing for leadership positions.\nDr Stone said in the last few years she had been approached by party members in her electorate about a few \"mildly\" suitable men to replace her when she eventually retires, but not once had she been approached about a potential woman candidate.\nShe also said the rule in the Victorian Liberal party that each branch has to have both a male and female vice president had not been effective.\n\"This has never translated into more female members of parliament,\" she said.\nThere are just two female minsters in Mr Abbott's Cabinet, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Health Minister Sussan Ley.", "external_links": ["http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/female-victoria-liberals-asked-who-would-cook-for-their-families-and-bullied-in-own-party-20150329-1ma90h.html", "https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-07-28T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T05:49:24.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
