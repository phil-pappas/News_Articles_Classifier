For married couples wishing to divorce peaceable, wisely and economically, divorce mediation may be the best alternative.

Making certain the lawyer you choose has an extensive background in mediation can make a significant difference in the efficiency with which your divorce is settled. At the Law Office of Polly A. Tatum (Mediation Advantage Services), their domestic relations attorney is a trained professional mediator who has conducted well over 1800-2000 divorce and family law mediations since 1997.
