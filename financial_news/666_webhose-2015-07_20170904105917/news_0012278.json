Pinnacle Consulting LLC, with offices in the United States, India and Colombia; Gijima holdings and American multinational technology and consulting corporation, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). \nOther companies interested in the TTMS are: Chinese companies -- Huawei, Xing Wang Technologies, Shangai Sunstar Telecom Technology, Connectiva and Analytics and Insight limited, and Enova Technology, Taiji Computer Corporation, China Telecom Global limited and Genew Technologies. \nOthers are Vas-X billing solutions, United Kingdom-registered companies Neural Technologies, Ascom Network Testing, Agento limited, SFM Technology and Sofrecom, which is a subsidiary of UK mobile network operator Orange. \nAsian company International Gateway Technologies, SGS Switzerland, WeDo Technologies, which has its headquarters in Portugal and offices in 15 countries, French company General Engineering Marketing and Zimbabwean trading company Frolgate Technology are also on the list. \nZimbabwe's three mobile operators, Econet Wireless, Telecel and NetOne have been operating without intensive monitoring such as TTMS, resulting in customers being prejudiced. \nThe move to introduce TTMS by Potraz will protect mobile users from unfair treatment and ensure quality in services rendered to them by their respective mobile service providers. \nEconet Zimbabwe this week announced that its financial services platform, EcoCash, transacted over US$11 billion in the last three and a half years. \nEconet head Business and Marketing Development Natalie Jabangwe-Morris said at least 450 million transactions were conducted on the platform with agencies now in excess of 20 000 countrywide. \nShe said EcoCash wallets are currently at 4,5million while the EcoCash Save platform has 1,5 million accounts. \nAccording to Potraz, as at end of 2014 Econet had a total of 8,9 million subscribers, but only 6,5 million subscribers were active, while Telecel had a total of 4,8 million subscribers even if 2,2 million were active and of NetOne's 4,3 million subscribers, with 2,7 million active.
