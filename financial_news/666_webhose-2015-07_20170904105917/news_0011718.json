It said the reactions of the Greek government, the Eurogroup and the European Central Bank are going to be crucial to how the crisis unfolds. Once the dust settles, however, it pointed to five factors that should add support to Eurozone equities. \nIt said a Greek exit from the Eurozone is still by no means a certainty, while a policy response from the ECB is a distinct possibility. \nIn addition, if the euro weakens, this will boost earnings prospects. \"As a rule of thumb, we expect a 10% fall in the trade weighted euro to boost earnings by at least 10%,\" it said. \nEarnings and margins are depressed and could rise strongly over the next three to five years if the Greek crisis does not derail global economic growth, said HSBC. \nFinally, it noted that valuations for European equities are by no means stretched. \nThe bank said a 'Grexit' is too early to call. \"Whilst it is undeniable that the result has taken Greece closer to the exit door, it is important to remember that 'no' does not necessarily mean that Greece will leave, especially given that the opinion polls have consistently shown that the majority of Greeks want to stay in the Eurozone. \" It said that while there has been no policy response from the ECB as yet, arguable one of the biggest takeaways from the Eurozone crisis was that in times of need, \"we usually get some form of policy response.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T11:35:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
