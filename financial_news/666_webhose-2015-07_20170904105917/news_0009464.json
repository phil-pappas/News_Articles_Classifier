GSK shares responded with an immediate rise of more than 3 per cent in London, closing at £13.75. \nThis is the first full quarter for GSK since it sold its cancer drugs to Novartis and acquired the Swiss company’s vaccines, while beefing up its consumer health business through a joint venture. \nSir Andrew has been under pressure to turn around GSK which last year became embroiled in a bribery scandal in China, issued a profits warning and suspended share buybacks. \n“Our integration and restructuring plans are on track and we remain confident that we can achieve our targets for this year and return the group to earnings growth in 2016,” Sir Andrew said. \nHis emphasis on research and development allayed investor fears that the “new GSK” following the Novartis deal represented a retreat from the fastest growing and most innovative pharmaceutical fields. \nGSK will unveil more details about its pipeline on November 3 in New York when it holds its first “R & D day” since 2003. “It will be a key moment for the company,” Sir Andrew said. \nThe standout performance in the quarter came from GSK’s new HIV/Aids drugs , Tivicay and Triumeq, which did much better than analysts expected. Together they contributed sales of £294m to a total HIV turnover of £559m — an increase of 59 per cent. And GSK says there is more to come, with two promising new HIV drugs in its R & D pipeline. \nSir Andrew also singled out forthcoming drugs for asthma and lung disease in the pipeline, as well as experimental cancer treatments. Although GSK sold its existing oncology business to Novartis, it is free to bring forward new cancer drugs — two of which are showing promising results in clinical trials. \nThe consumer healthcare business, consisting mainly of the majority-owned joint venture with Novartis, had sales of £2.9bn. Sir Andrew predicted strong profit growth there: “We will see the leverage of the GSK scale across some very exciting products brought in from Novartis.” \nGSK’s guidance for 2015 sees earnings per share “declining at a percentage rate in the high teens”, due to continuing decline in Advair sales and costs from the Novartis deal. \nIn 2016, the company said it expects to see a significant recovery in core earnings per share, with percentage growth expected to reach double digits on a constant exchange rate basis.
