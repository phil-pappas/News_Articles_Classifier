NASA by KENNETH CHANG The first close-up image of Pluto has revealed mountains as tall as the Rockies, and a complete absence of craters - discoveries that, to their delight, baffled scientists working on NASA's New Horizons mission and provided punctuation for a journey 9 1/2 years in the making.\nOnly 112 years after the Wright Brothers were barely able to get their airplane off the ground, a machine from Earth has crossed the solar system to a small, icy world 3 billion miles away. The flyby on Tuesday, when New Horizons buzzed within 7,800 miles of the former ninth planet, came 50 years to the day after NASA's Mariner 4 spacecraft made a similar first pass by Mars.\nPluto until a few weeks ago was a blurry dot. Within the past couple of days, it has been transformed into a dynamic world with varied geography, discoveries that point to the possibility of ice volcanoes and churning tectonics. All of this new information could provide clues to how planets form and even to the origins of some of the building blocks of life.\n\"I don't think any one of us could have imagined that this could have been a better toy store,\" S. Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator, said during a news conference on Wednesday.\nWant to read more like this? Like The Australian Review on Facebook.\nWilliam Grundy, an investigator working to analyse the surface composition of Pluto, chimed in: \"This is what we came for.\"\n\"This exceeds what we came for,\" added Catherine Olkin, the deputy project scientist.\nEarlier in the day, New Horizons had sent back the first batch of a bountiful trove of data that it had collected during its close flyby of Pluto. Stern said the rooms where teams got their first look at the images were \"something close to bedlam.\"\n A day before, NASA had released a mesmerising image of the full 1,472-mile-wide disc of Pluto, highlighted by a bright heart-shaped swath of terrain. The newer image focused on a much smaller patch, about 150 miles across, near the bottom of the heart shape, and captured features as small as a half-mile across.\nThe first surprise was the rugged topography - mountains up to 11,000 feet high. But these mountains are almost certainly made of frozen water instead of rock.\n\"There may be higher ones elsewhere,\" said John Spencer, an investigator on the mission.\nThat was a surprise because observations of Pluto from Earth have not found any signs of water ice. Frozen nitrogen and methane have been detected, but those ices are too weak to be bent and lifted into mountains.\nNew Horizons took measurements that should be able to confirm that the mountains are frozen water, but that data remains on the spacecraft, to stream back over the next year and a half. Stern, however, had no doubt. \"We can be very sure that water is there in great abundance,\" he said.\nA second surprise was that the dwarf planet's surface was unmarred by craters.\n\"We have not yet found a single impact crater in this image,\" Spencer said.\nCollisions happen everywhere in the solar system. Planetary astronomers count craters to determine whether a surface is ancient, formed billions of years ago and then pockmarked by impact craters over the eons, or young, a smooth expanse that formed recently, erasing the impact craters. Spencer said that the lack of craters suggested that this part of Pluto's surface was less than 100 million years old, extremely young given that the solar system is 4.5 billion years old.\nWeather and tectonics can erase craters, but both require heat to stir things up. And Pluto, small and far away, possesses no obvious sources of heat.\nFor moons of giant planets, the heat can come from tidal forces squeezing the moon, but the tidal forces between Pluto and Charon are small.\n\"We have to get a little more clever,\" Spencer said.\nOther aspects of the surface were so unusual that he found it difficult to describe them in geological terms. When asked about perplexing features in the lower right part of the image, he stumbled and said, \"It's like piles of stuff with grooves on it.\"\nSpencer also announced that the team had decided to informally name the heart feature Tombaugh Regio, after Clyde Tombaugh, the astronomer who discovered Pluto in 1930. (Regio is Latin for \"region.\")\nOn Tuesday night, celebrating the success of the flyby, members of the mission team held up a large poster of a stamp that the US Postal Service issued in 1991: \"Pluto: Not Yet Explored.\"\nThe words \"Not\" and \"Yet\" were crossed out.\n\"This is truly a hallmark in human history,\" said John M Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for the science mission directorate.\nMore than capturing a close-up of Pluto, the mission is opening the door to a new neighbourhood of the solar system that is bigger and stranger than the solar system that astronomers thought they had catalogued by the 1990s. Back then, the roster of planets memorised by schoolchildren ended with Pluto.\nBeyond Pluto, New Horizons is now speeding into the Kuiper belt, which extends a couple of billion miles beyond Pluto and likely contains billions of icy worlds, including one, Eris, that is slightly smaller than Pluto yet more massive.\nKuiper belt objects are remnants of the earliest building blocks of the solar system, too far apart and too sparse to coalesce to a planet.\nHowever, these small worlds are not bland as once thought. Pluto's largest moon, Charon, also surprised scientists. The light and dark areas seen from Earth had pointed to some intriguing possibilities on Pluto, but Charon is smaller and thought to be largely inert.\n\"Originally, I thought Charon might be an ancient terrain covered in craters,\" said Olkin, the deputy project scientist. \"Charon just blew our socks off when we had the new image today.\"\nCraters there are also few.\nThe image provided a clearer look at the dark region at Charon's north pole. \"Informally, we've been referring to it as Mordor,\" said Olkin, referring to the fictional realm of the evil lord Sauron in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings .\nOlkin said some small bright craters suggest that the dark colour is just a thin veneer on top of other ices. In another region, the picture revealed a series of cliffs and troughs extending 600 miles across. There was also a canyon four to six miles deep, surprising for a body less than 800 miles wide.\n\"There is so much interesting science in this one image alone,\" Olkin said.\nLike Spencer, Olkin was at times at a loss for words to explain what she was seeing. \"We are going to have to put our thinking caps on,\" she said.\nEven Hydra, one of the small moons, proved interesting. New Horizons's picture of it spanned only a few pixels, but Harold Weaver, the project scientist, pointed out that until a few weeks ago, this was the resolution that could be seen of Pluto.\nNow the scientists finally have a good measurement of its size and shape, 28 miles long and 19 miles wide. Hydra is also reflective, bouncing back 45 percent of the light that hits it.\n\"That can only mean Hydra's surface is composed primarily of water ice,\" Weaver said. \"It's the only way to get it that bright. That's cool.\"\nNew Horizons reported that it was in perfect health, with no problems cropping up during the flyby, and that it had gathered all of the scientific data it was supposed to. But with the slow communication rate from a 12-watt transmitter 3 billion miles away, it will take 16 months before scientists can examine all of that information.\nMission scientists hope that New Horizons is far from done, that NASA will grant it an extension to take a look at one of two small Kuiper belt objects close to its trajectory.\nA decision on the next destination is expected in August, and the spacecraft would adjust its course in late October and early November.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/7iyd-gh2rhM?rel=0", "http://on.fb.me/1Hzxqc2"], "published": "2015-07-16T12:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:06:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
