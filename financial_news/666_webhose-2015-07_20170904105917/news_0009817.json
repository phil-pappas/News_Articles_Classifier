The banker is of the view that the Rwandan economy will be growing faster by the end of the second quarter. \nIt remains to be seen whether the Rwandan economy will feel relief against the turbulence brought on by a super strong dollar by then. \nCentral Bank (BNR) Governor John Rwangombwa too is optimistic that the situation will soon improve. In a phone interview with The Rwanda Focus he said, \"You have to put it in the context that the dollar has been strengthening against all currencies, but it will not be very long before the franc stabilizes.\" \nHe didn't go into specifics however, but said BNR would hold a media briefing this week to give more detailed explanations. \nI&M's Anand said he would like to keep some things in perspective, giving praise to the resilience of the Rwandan franc, in comparison to some other regional currencies. \nHe said: \"You have to understand that it (franc) has since the beginning of this year depreciated by six to seven percent against the dollar, while some other currencies in the region have fallen by 20 percent, or 25 percent or 27 percent. These are things you can easily find out.\" \nHardships persist for Rwandan businesses \nMeanwhile, the shortage of dollars hasn't abated. \nMany businesses The Rwanda Focus has spoken to are deeply worried. Some are implementing drastic measures like laying off workers. Trying to increase the prices of their services, \"will only lose us business and we can hardly afford that,\" said a manufacturer who requested we do not reveal his, or his company's name. \nThe manufacturer added: \"We can only buy the materiel for production of our goods from abroad or overseas, and for that of course we have to pay in dollars. Yet there aren't any dollars to be found in the commercial banks, and very few from the foreign money dealers. It is even possible that these (forex bureaux) are deliberately hoarding dollars so as to sell them whenever the dollar is higher!\" \nA source within one of Kigali's commercial banks disclosed to this newspaper that scarcity had become so bad that for the past three weeks BNR could only disburse about US$ 900,000 per day to each of the banks, whereas before the central bank easily gave out 3.5 billion dollars, and even more, daily, for the commercial banks' transactional needs. \nThis scarcity has led to another source of grievance for manufacturers, who see discrimination in the way some commercial banks are giving out dollars sector by sector. \nManagement of one factory said banks are now reserving for petroleum importers at least 50 percent of the dollars they get from BNR. Of the remaining amounts much goes to forex bureaux. \"Manufacturers only get the crumbs and leftovers!\" said our factory sources.
