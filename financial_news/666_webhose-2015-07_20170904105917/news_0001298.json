Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 36.75 points, or 0.83 percent, on volume of 50,330 contracts, while Dow e-minis were up 128 points, or 0.72 percent, with 49,993 contracts changing hands. \nHopes of a deal helped U.S. markets close higher on Friday. But indexes finished off their highs after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said she expected the central bank to raise interest rates at some point this year, while expressing concern that the country's labor market remained weak. \nInvestors have long expected a rate hike in 2015, though opinions have been split on whether it would come in September or December. Yellen gave no direct hint about whether the Fed would raise rates more than once over the course of its four remaining meetings in 2015. \nThe Treasury Department is scheduled to issue its June budget report at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). The department is expected to post a budget surplus of $51.0 billion, compared with a $82.4 billion deficit reported in May. \nAsian stock markets were higher as Chinese stocks rose for a third straight session, following their recent rout, and as data from China showed exports increased while imports slipped in June, in a tentative sign global demand might be on the mend. \nHowever, oil prices tumbled as Iran and six world powers closed in on a nuclear deal that would end sanctions on the Islamic Republic and let more Iranian oil on to world markets. \nApple shares were up 1.3 percent at $124.85 in premarket trading after Socgen upgraded the company's stock to \"buy\" from \"hold\", saying it expected a successful launch of the new iPhone 6S handset in September. \nAscena Retail Group slumped 11.1 percent to $14.55 after the retail chain cut its full-year profit forecast. \nRemy International (NasdaqGS: REMY - news ) soared 42 percent to $29.15 after auto parts maker BorgWarner (NYSE: BWA - news ) said it would buy the company for about $1.2 billion in cash, including debt. BorgWarner's shares rose 0.7 percent to $54.01.
