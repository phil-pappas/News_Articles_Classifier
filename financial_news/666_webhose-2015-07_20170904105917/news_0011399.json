Mayu Kanamori Share on twitter by James Eyers After a week-long delay, Westpac Banking Corp has lifted its standard variable interest rate for investment property borrowers by 0.27 percentage points to 5.75 per cent.\nAs the last of the Big Four moved its investor interest rates higher in response to regulatory action, data released on Friday showed investor lending growing by a larger amount than initially thought with the Reserve Bank of Australia revising up previously reported figures .\nWestpac's consumer bank chief executive, George Frazis, said the higher investor rates \"is an important step in ensuring that Westpac meets APRA's benchmark that investor credit growth should be no more than 10 per cent \". Westpac has been growing above the cap.\nIn a statement on Friday afternoon, Westpac also said its fixed rates on residential investment property loans would rise by \"up to\" 0.30 percentage points from August 4, while fixed rates on owner-occupier home loans would fall by \"up to\"' 0.30 percentage points, also from August 4.\nWestpac, the nation's largest lender to landlords, has spent the past week fixing computer systems and processes that had prevented it immediately following its big bank competitors , who increased rates on property investment loans last week. The delay has cost it millions in lost interest income.\nWestpac shareholders on Wednesday expressed confidence the bank's systems issue would be resolved and said the higher rates were a positive for net interest margins and profits . Banks are lifting rates in response to regulators insisting that they hold more equity against mortgages, which is more expensive for the banks to raise than debt.\nSuncorp Bank also made its move to raise investor home loan rates on Friday afternoon.\nIts investor standard variable rate, back to basics and access equity/line of credit rates on both new and existing loans will rise by up to 0.27 percentage points on August 31. Variable rates on owner-occupied loans remain unchanged.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating...

National Australia Bank followed on Monday, increasing rates on interest-only loans by 0.29 percentage point s.\nAnalysts said NAB's move was a workaround to similar problems facing Westpac, given both banks were using a single \"reference rate\" for owner-occupier and investor borrowers, preventing them lifting the standard variable rate for property investors without also hitting owner-occupiers.\nWestpac said its changes would take effect for new borrowers on August 10 but this would extend to September 25 for existing customers. NAB's change for existing interest-only variable rate loans will be effective on September 10.\n\"This timing is to ensure that there is a smooth transition to the differentiated rates structure for the mortgage portfolio,\" the Westpac statement said.\nIn a separate statement, Westpac subsidiary St George said its standard variable rates on investment property loans for new and existing customers would increase by 0.25 percentage points to 5.79 per cent from August 21.\nWestpac is understood to remain cautious about correctly classifying owner-occupiers and investors given borrower status can change over time, and is believed to be writing to customers to check information and ensure the rates are being raised on the right accounts.\nNAB CEO Andrew Thorburn said on Friday NAB is being \"watchful\" on property markets , as regulators have imposed growth caps on investor lending to ensure unnecessary risk does not build up in the banking system as property prices continue to rise.\nIn a dramatic week for banks, AMP Bank went even further than the big banks on Wednesday, announcing interest rates on existing investment property loans would rise by a big 0.47 percentage points and, more remarkably, stopped accepting all new applications .", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/amp-bank-stops-lending-to-housing-investors-jacks-up-rates-20150729-gimqjt.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/apra-launches-crackdown-on-loans-to-property-investors-20141209-123lko.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/cba-joins-anz-in-raising-investor-interest-rates-by-027-percentage-points-20150724-gijihx.html", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/eyersj", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/interest-rate-computer-glitch-costs-westpac-more-than-1m-a-day-20150727-gilml5", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/property/housing-investor-credit-growth-revised-up-to-107-per-cent-20150731-giol5t.html"], "published": "2015-07-31T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T10:04:40.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
