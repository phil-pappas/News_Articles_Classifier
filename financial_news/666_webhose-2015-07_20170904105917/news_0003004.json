Business investment will be weak, but maybe not enough to cause a recession. AFR Share on twitter by Philip Baker Investors around the globe have been quick to price in a happy ending to the situation in Greece , but if the local economy doesn't start to engineer some genuine growth in the next 12 months, investors face the prospect of the bull market in stocks coming to a halt.\nStock prices are also driven by interest rates, so there might be some joy if the Reserve Bank cuts rates again but the rate of earnings growth also needs to improve.\nSince 1950, the average length of a bull market in Australia is 47 months and if September 2011 is taken as the starting point then this one has been going for 45 months.\nIn the US the average bull market since the Second World War has averaged 64 months and if March 2009 is taken as the starting point then this one has been going for 75 months.\nUsually bull markets can last between three to five years, so in the US in particular it is getting long in the tooth.\nBut then, it can depend on how the recovery plays out. Is there any inflation, which there isn't at this stage, or how euphoric and willing investors are to push stocks to their extreme, and then some.\nAs a result, it's always said that bull markets do not die of old age but of exhaustion.\nThis time there is no euphoria in markets; indeed, valuations are not stretched, but are still leaning towards the expensive side as opposed to cheap. Still, they have been much higher.\n Clearly the first phase of the bull run is over, when economic conditions are weak and confidence is very poor. But again, this time it is different as growth and confidence haven't been robust and perhaps not as strong as they should have given the length of the bull market.\nThe second phase of a bull run is normally driven by better profits as economic growth turns up and scepticism slowly but surely turns into optimism.\nAgain, the coming profit season will also be important for shares if the rally is to continue.\nOne key area that economists will look for signs of growth will be the so called capex survey.\nThe survey is important for two reasons. One, the estimates are a good gauge of the actual national accounts investment changes, despite the differences in coverage between these measures.\nTwo, as the local economy tries to transition itself towards new areas of growth now the resources boom has faded one of the main indicators of business investment in Australia is the private capital expenditure survey.\nUnfortunately, the latest reading was by far the biggest negative economic news this calender year.\nThe survey's estimate of business capital spending for next financial year was 25 per cent lower than the comparable estimate for this financial year.\nAs BetaShares chief economist David Bassanese notes, that is the largest percentage decline in a second-estimate spending survey report from a previous year since the survey began in the late 1980s.\nBut it might not be as bad as investors think.\n\"We should be reasonably confident business investment will be weak next financial year; it is still, at this stage, by no means clear it will be dire enough to produce recession,\" said Bassanese.\nThere have been two other occasions when this survey has fallen by 20 per cent when compared to the previous year.\nOne turned out to be a recession in 1991 to 1992, but in 1999 to 2000 the second-estimate slump turned out to be way too pessimistic.\nIndeed, investment intentions were in the end revised up and actual investment rose by 5.5 per cent that year.\n\"The relationship between surveyed investment and actual (national accounts) investment gets tighter as the financial year unfolds. Indeed, statistical analysis suggest the annual percent change in the final (7th) survey estimate of investment spending can explain 80 per cent of changes in the national accounts measure of investment spending,\" said Bassanese.\nBut his base case is that investment intentions will be not revised up significantly over the coming year â€“ leaving the investment outlook still weak.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-07-02T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:15:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
