The market is sceptical of the sustainability of any bailout without a major debt haircut,\" said Lawler. \nEuropean markets rallied after the outlines of the bailout was agreed on July 13 and the Greek parliament has supported the major tax hikes and spending cuts that must be made. \nSoaring Amazon shares after a surprise profit report failed to lift US stocks. \nIn midday trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average had shed percent to 17,637.55 points, while the broad-based S&P 500 gave up 0.47 percent to 2,092.33. The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.22 percent at 5,134.92 points. \nAmazon shares jumped 15.2 percent to $555.32 on the online retail giant's unexpected swing into profit in the second quarter. \nAsian shares mostly fell on the disappointing Chinese data and the strong US dollar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T23:47:15.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
