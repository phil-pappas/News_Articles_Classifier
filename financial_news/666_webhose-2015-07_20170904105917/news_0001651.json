First, Clear A Path To Lower Rates \nAccording to Chicago attorney Adam Holguin, Chapter 11 bankruptcy will allow 50 Cent the opportunity to reorganize his debt and finances with the goal of eventually paying the majority of his debts. \nChapter 11 “doesn’t mean you’re broke” Holguin said; in fact, it's quite the opposite. Unlike Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which involves paying creditors sometimes pennies on the dollar with what few assets a debtor has left, or Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which seeks to liquidate debt entirely, Chapter 11 allows filers the opportunity to restructure their debt and find cash-flow solutions while suspending collection. \nTo compare the forms, Chapter 11 bankruptcy focuses on reorganizing debt with the goal of eventually paying most of it off, while Chapters 7 and 13 focus on discharging it entirely. \nThe filing speaks to an enormous amount of outstanding liabilities for the rapper. \nIt also, Holguin emphasized, speaks to the kind of protection offered by the bankruptcy system. Chapter 11 is typically sought by companies, emphasizing the fact that Jackson operates his personal finances as much as the 50 Cent brand as an individual. \nBankruptcy protection creates the opportunity for people to take risks, Holguin said. Whether it’s a family buying a dream home or a multi-millionaire opening a new recording label, the bankruptcy code creates incentives by ensuring a way out if things go badly enough. \n“My clients don’t think of it as free money,” Holguin said. “It’s taxed them far more than what they owe emotionally… Most of these individuals have struggled for a while to preserve not filing and have just come to the conclusion that they can’t avoid it.” \nOf course, Sleek Audio won a suit over 50 Cent for more than $16 million in 2014 over using the company's intellectual property in his SMS Audio headphones. That loss and his new liabilities have driven him to find shelter in bankruptcy law. \"It’s the risk of him being able to make business decisions, knowing that worst case scenario he can file and have his debts reorganized ,\" Holguin said. \"It allows some entrepreneurial spirit, it allows people to take risks knowing that if they take these risks and it doesn’t pan out it can be reorganized.” \nFiling for bankruptcy protection will allow 50 Cent to manage major debts, including outstanding lines of unsecured credit and payments on secured property like homes and cars. It has also, for the time being, halted progress on Levinston’s lawsuit. In other words, she can't get a dollar out of him . \nJackson was due in New York state court on Monday to determine whether punitive damages should be added to the $5 million award against him. Although filing for bankruptcy protection generally suspends collection on outstanding lawsuits, Holguin pointed out that the law also requires an element of good faith generally considered under “look back” provisions. \nThat means creditors and the courts look for “a pattern of abuse” in bankruptcy filings, Holguin said. If creditors believe that a debtor is acting in bad faith, they can request that the court look back and exclude certain debts from bankruptcy protection -- for example, if a creditor ran up enormous, unusual expenses on several credit cards shortly before attempting to have that debt liquidated. \nIn the case of a wealthy musician who files for protection immediately after getting a $5 million judgment against him, according to Holguin, the motivation is crystal clear: to shirk, if momentarily, paying what he owes. Levinston’s attorneys may ultimately request that the bankruptcy judge exclude the current lawsuit from protection, based on allegations that Jackson is using Chapter 11 to interfere with and delay Levinston's lawsuit. \nIn May, Jackson put his promotion company SMS Promotions, LLC into bankruptcy as well, also reportedly due to the Levinston lawsuit. \nIn filing for bankruptcy, 50 Cent puts himself in good company. Financial troubles are commonplace among rappers, many of whom make their fortunes young.
