But how does our regime compare to other countries? \nThe newly raised £1m inheritance tax limit should prove a boon for families with large homes. \nBritain currently has one of the most punishing death tax regimes of all developed nations. But the change means thousands of Britons will soon pay less inheritance tax than their counterparts in Japan and France. \nCurrently someone passing on an £800,000 home and £200,000 cash to their children will pay £270,000 in inheritance tax. But once the new regime is fully in place in 2020‑21, they will pay just £200,000, according to calculations by PwC, the accountancy firm, for Telegraph Money . \nData source: PwC \nSomeone with the same wealth in France would currently pay £249,000. The change will put British beneficiaries on a par with Belgians, who pay £184,000 on a £1m inheritance. \nInheritance tax regimes vary widely between countries, with different complexities affecting people of varying wealth. In Belgium, Italy and Spain widows and widowers must pay inheritance tax when their spouse dies and leaves them cash. In Belgium a spouse inheriting £50,000 cash would have to pay £2,000. \nBritain is one of the few countries to apply the same rate of tax no matter who you leave your money to. \nIn France, progressive tax rates apply after the first €100,000 and there are extra taxes if you wish to bequeath wealth to people you aren’t related to or charities. For inheritance between non-related parties, inheritance tax is charged at 60pc after an allowance of €1,594 per beneficiary. \nIn the US the threshold for IHT is five times higher than the UK at $5m. \n• See all our investment stories on your Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news ) page like us at facebook.com/telegraphinvesting", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T10:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T10:31:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
