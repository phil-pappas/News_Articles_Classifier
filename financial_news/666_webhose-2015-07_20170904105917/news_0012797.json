But, according to a Fidelity survey, 82% of respondents say they and their partners disagree about key planning issues such as the age at which they'll stop working and the lifestyle they plan to maintain. \nEconomic conditionslayoffs, home-equity changes, and pension freezesmake synchronizing retirement planning even more important. Here are questions to ask: \nWhat are key retirement issues and what's important to us? Brainstorm individual wish lists then compare notes. When do you want to retire? Will you work part time? Where would you like to live? What kind of lifestyle do you want? Do you or your spouse have aspirations of starting a business, traveling, or learning a new skill? \nHow much do we have? It's imperative for spouses to know the value of their own retirement accounts as well as the value of their partner's accounts. In the Fidelity survey, about half of respondents didn't know the balance in their own 401(k) accounts. Only 37% of husbands and 21% of wives knew the value of their partners' accounts. Couples should take time to sit down together with their most recent retirement statements and review details. \nAre we investing in sync? Many couples make the mistake of not looking at their asset allocation as a household. Looking at each other's investments can help each of you decide if you have proper asset allocation. You'll be able to see if you're exposed to more risk than you should be and if you have overlapping investments. It's a good move to choose a household allocation that caters to the growth needed to cover the younger spouse's life span. Each account does not have to be set up exactly the same. For example, the more conservative spouse might feel better holding a larger amount of bonds versus stocks. Also, be sure to examine the benefits of each of your work planslook at employer matches, better investment choices, and lower fees. Examine benefits of each of your work planslook at employer matches, better investment choices, and lower fees. \nWill money affect timing? Almost 60% of couples disagree about when they'll leave the work force, although when to leave work can have a huge impact on what type of retirement lifestyle you'll be able to afford. If you or your spouse will be getting a pension, review details of payouts and what will happen if one of you dies.
