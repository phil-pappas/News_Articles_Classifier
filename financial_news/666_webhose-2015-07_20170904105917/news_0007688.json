His appointment was heavily criticised by current and former students of the institute.\nFTII students have been boycotting classes, abandoning academic work in protest against the appointment of Chauhan, who they allege lacks “stature and vision” to head the institution.\n“I personally feel that FTII represents a certain art form… it does certainly need a person having a great body of work which means he is supposed to know world cinema, he is supposed to know the present state of cinema like editing. But certainly FTII needs somebody who is much more qualified than whatever Ganjendra ji’s qualifications are coming across,” Kher said here today.\n“I certainly do not think Gajendra ji is qualified as a producer, director or actor,” 60-year old actor said.\nAsked whether the government institution should be an autonomous body, Kher said, “It should be autonomous certainly.”\nKher also advised protesting students to attend their classes.\n“I feel students who are on strike, should go back, make movies, attend classes because the Chairman is not directly involved in day-to-day functioning of FTII,” Kher said.\n 10, 2015 5:30 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T04:48:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
