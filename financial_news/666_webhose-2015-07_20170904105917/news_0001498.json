I am against Grexit.\" \nHe is wounded by the criticism he has received since a speech last week. \n\"It is time to stop these outbursts, this shooting from the hip. It is unacceptable for the European Commission to be deemed terrorists by the Greek government. That is not the kind of Europe we want. We have tried hard and if only everyone else had tried as hard.\" \nHe gives a lengthy defence of a speech last week, in which he warned Greeks not to \"let down the European Union\". He also attacks newspaper reports that he has disappeared. \n\"I have not disappeared. I come to the European Parliament to talk about the referendum. This is the home of democracy,\" he says. \nHe says it is \"extraordinary and unacceptable\" that he cannot talk about Greece. \n\"I am not a technocrat.\" \nManfred Weber, a senior German Conservative, says they must respect the demands of all EU states. There are rules \"that need to be respected and applied.\" \n\"Sunday was not a good day for Europe. It harmed Europe.\" Juncker -who last week told Greeks not to commit suicide for fear of dying - now asks for toning down of rhetorical volume #Greece — Jennifer Rankin (@JenniferMerode) July 7, 2015 07.59 \nJean-Claude Juncker is speaking to the European Parliament. \nTo give you a flavour of his speech: Today's speech appears to be defence of last week's speech, in which he said he felt \"betrayed\" by Syriza for ruining \"my life's major work\" — Matthew Holehouse (@mattholehouse) July 7, 2015 07.47 Timeline: What next for Greece after 'No' vote? Key events in the next 48 hours and beyond for the Greek crisis Tuesday 7 July European Parliament address Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker are expected to address Europe's elected representatives at the Parliament in Strasbourg. Nigel Farage is lined up to speak. Expect oratorical fireworks. Eurozone heads summit The Eurozone heads of government will meet in Brussels. They last convened last Saturday, the morning after Alexis Tsipras tore up a Euro 1.5 billion bailout deal by calling a referendum. Looming deadlines With or without emergency liquidity, Greek banks are likely to run dry. July 13 Greece must find another Euro 465 million currently owed to the IMF. It is already in default. July 20 Most crucially, on July 20 it must find Euro 3.5 billion to pay the European Central Bank. Default on this will force the withdrawal of those emergency bank loans. Financial collapse and Grexit follows. 07.43 French PM: there's a basis for a deal \nFrench prime minister Manuel Valls has said that the basis for a deal with Athens was there. \nHe said: \"France is convinced that we can't take the risk of Greece leaving the eurozone,\" a move that would affect economies across the globe, Manuel Valls told French radio. \"The basis for a deal exists... There is no taboo subject when it comes to (Greek) debt, on the restructuring.\" \nOptimism! A brief timetable for today \n(All times BST) \n07.30 European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker to address European Parliament \n09.30 European Parliament president Martin Schulz to give press conference \n12.00 Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers to meet \n17.00 Eurozone heads of government to meet \nAll this, plus keeping a watch out for more announcements from the ECB, and on the markets - on which the result of the referendum had surprisingly little effect. If hopes of deal are dashed once again today, expect to see some more movement there and in bonds. 07.31 Good morning \nToday marks another Eurogroup meeting with finance ministers and a eurozone summit scheduled for after - the idea being that today will be a day of action, and a deal will be made. \nThe Greek leaders have been told that they have a deadline of this afternoon to come up with far-reaching proposals. But noises coming out of the ECB, Germany and EU leaders does not indicate total optimism about today's outcome. \nGreek banks remain closed, and will remain so for at least another two days. \nYesterday, the ECB continued its freeze on emergency liquidity assistance (ELA), rather than raise it as Tsipras wanted. But in a highly contentious move, opted to tighten the collateral rules it imposes on lenders to access the lifeline, intensifying the squeeze on the cash-starved banks, which are set to remain closed for another two days. \nThe ECB said the move was based on the deteriorating quality of the bank collateral, most of which is made up of Greek government bonds. It declined to specify the level of haircut imposed. \nGermany's vice-chancellor Sigmar Gabriel issued a humilitating ultimatum to Greece , and said the landslide rejection of EU austerity demands in the Greek referendum changed nothing, demanding that the Left-wing Syriza government must accept further belt-tightening without any prospect of debt relief if it wishes to remain in the eurozone.

Tsipras rallied Greece's five main political parties behind a national unity declaration. \nIt called for “substantive talks” on debt relief, an investment blitz to fight mass unemployment and an immediate shot of liquidity for the country’s banking system. \nThe White House intervened again last night, as President Barack Obama spoke by phone with Francois Hollande and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew spoke with Tsipras and new finance chief Euclid Tsakalotos, urging a constructive outcome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T10:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T11:06:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
