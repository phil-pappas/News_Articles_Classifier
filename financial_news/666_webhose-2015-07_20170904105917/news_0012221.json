What and when you collect will make a huge difference to your lifetime benefits.\nToday’s Social Security question is about whether taxes paid as an owner of a C corp will increase Social Security benefits.\nQuestion : I am one of two owners of a C corp .

We are actually paying once through our individual W2 as well as through the corporation.\nAnswer : No, the taxes you “pay” via your C corp are really just transmittances of taxes on your earnings that are divided in two by Social Security, with half called the employee contribution and the other called the employer contribution.\nMy weekly Social Security column appears on PBS NEWSHOUR’s website .", "external_links": ["http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/c-corporation.asp", "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/lkotlikoff/"], "published": "2015-07-31T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T20:27:13.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
