Thirty years after enrolling in prestigious Tsinghua University, the billionaire is using the backing of his alma mater to build a technology empire.\nDeals to buy chip designers, along with partnerships with Hewlett-Packard and Intel, have helped his Tsinghua Unigroup assemble a business spanning cloud computing, mobile and semiconductors.\nNow the company is said to plan offering $US23 billion ($31 billion) for Micron Technology to take on Samsung Electronics in the hotly-contested memory chip industry. The deal would be the biggest takeover of a foreign firm by a Chinese company.\nTsinghua Unigroup chairman Zhao Weiguo. Photo: Tsinghua Unigroup/Bloomberg\nTsinghua Unigroup's acquisition spree comes as President Xi Jinping's government tries to free China from a heavy reliance on foreign technology, with semiconductors seen as vital to national security. Zhao said his strategy is driven by the needs of building a sustainable business, rather than any political agenda.\n\"I am an entrepreneur. My main job is to manage well the operation of our enterprise,\" he said in an e-mail to Bloomberg News, declining to comment on Micron. \"Food should be eaten piece by piece. The road should be hit step by step. Our decisions will be combined with industry trends and Unigroup's own conditions.\"\nHis company, the investment arm of Tsinghua University, has announced more than $US4 billion of acquisitions in the past two years. Tsinghua Unigroup hasn't commented on Micron and the US company said it has yet to receive an offer.\nRaising pigs\nZhao's emergence as a tech billionaire is a long way from his birth in remote Xinjiang province in northwestern China, a region that borders Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan. His childhood home in a small village is closer to Kabul than Beijing or Shanghai.\n\"I raised pigs and herded sheep for living. I knew that only education could change my fate,\" he wrote.\nThe 48-year-old paid his way through college by fixing televisions and writing computer software. After graduation, he found a job in Beijing's Zhongguancun area, which has gained a reputation as China's Silicon Valley with companies including Lenovo Group and Baidu calling it home.\nTsinghua founded what later became Unigroup in 1988, acting as an investment arm of the university. In a 2010 privatisation, a firm controlled by Zhao became Unigroup's second-biggest shareholder after the university.\nCollege donation\n\"Zhao Weiguo has his unique way for investments. When he targets a company, he considers it for a long time and then makes an offer very quickly,\" said Gu Wenjun, chief analyst at iCwise, a Shanghai-based consulting company. \"He has said that China lacks a memory chip business, so this is a chance here.\"\nWhile the potential takeover of Micron comes less than two months after Zhao cautioned that the valuations of Chinese chipmakers are becoming too expensive and entering a \"serious bubble,\" he rejected suggestions that he had changed his mind.\n\"I never changed my passion and determination for the chip business,\" he wrote. \"I like to choose positively, rather than passively accept.\"\nTsinghua Unigroup said in February it received 10 billion yuan (2.2 billion) of state-backed funding over five years to invest in chip companies, while one of its affiliates agreed in May to buy control of Hewlett-Packard's Chinese networking and server businesses for $US2.3 billion.\nOther deals from Tsinghua include the acquisition or RDA Microelectronics and Spreadtrum Communications.\nZhao has amassed a fortune of at least US2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nHe said he has already donated $US100 million toward education and pledged the bulk of his fortune to his 104-year-old alma mater in Beijing, which counts Xi and former leader Hu Jintao among its alumni.\n\"Education has changed my life so I have passion for the education sector,\" Zhao wrote in the e-mail. \"I have promised to donate 70 per cent of my personal wealth to Tsinghua University.\"\nBloomberg", "external_links": ["http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-14/micron-has-better-options-than-a-cheap-bid-from-china-real-m-a"], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T05:10:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
