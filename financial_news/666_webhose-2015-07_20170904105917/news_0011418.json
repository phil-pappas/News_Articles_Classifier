The money will allow Greece to clear its arrears with the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of Greece and to repay the European Central Bank, according to the statement.\nGreece needs short-term financing to help it meet a repayment of 3.5 billion euros to the ECB on Monday and keep the country afloat while negotiations continue on a three-year bailout of as much as 86 billion euros.\n“What we are witnessing is European solidarity in action,” Dombrovskis said. “Those who say Europe lacks solidarity are mistaken; but solidarity comes with responsibility.”\nSome governments outside the euro area earlier expressed concern the bridge financing could have an impact on them because it’s coming from the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism, which involves all EU nations rather than just those in the single currency.\nThe exposure of the EU’s nine countries outside the euro “will be fully guaranteed by liquid collateral under legally binding arrangements,” according to the statement. “If Greece were unable to repay the loan in accordance with its terms, any liabilities incurred by non-euro area member states would be immediately reimbursed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T17:38:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
