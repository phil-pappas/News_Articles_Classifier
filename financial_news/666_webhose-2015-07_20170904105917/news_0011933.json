It is still up in the air whether a more serious top is in place or not, but the steady erosion of Gann supports over the past few days is negative. The 200-day moving average and the 38% retracement of the April – June advance coincide around 1.5440-15 and this area looks to be the next important test for the exchange rate. Traction below exposes critical support at 1.5170 (June low), while a successful hold raises the possibility of another leg higher. The first part of next week looks quite important for the pound from a medium-term cyclical perspective.
