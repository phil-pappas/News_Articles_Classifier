Share on twitter by Christopher Joye There are several important take-aways from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's excellent new study on the major banks' capital. Winners are depositors, senior and subordinated bond holders, and the regional banks. Losers will likely be shareholders and investors in the majors' hybrid securities.\nThe first learning is that APRA backs the financial system inquiry's (FSI) finding that while the majors might be \"well capitalised\" they are not \"unquestionably strong\" . The latter characterisation is a key FSI principle that APRA has embraced.\nAPRA finds that on an internationally comparable basis, Australia's major banks crucial \"common equity tier one\" (CET1) capital ratios are \"are above the median, but not in the top (fourth) quartile [or above the 75th percentile]\". Specifically, they are situated in the middle of the 50th and 75th percentiles or the third quartile.\nAPRA revealed it will start using the FSI's recommended benchmark of keeping the majors' CET1 ratio in the 75th percentile (top quartile) of internationally active banks as a \"sense check\" or sanity test of their capital adequacy and will republish comparison studies from \"time to time\".\nUnderstandably, it will not use the 75th percentile benchmark to calibrate the majors' specific capital levels, which avoids the need to adjust capital simply because the 75th percentile has shifted, which can happen for reasons unrelated to the prudential supervision of local deposit-takers.\nTo lift the majors' CET1 ratio towards the 75th percentile, APRA concludes they would only have to expand equity by about 70 basis points over their June 2014 levels.\nBut APRA warns that because the report makes several assumptions that are unrealistically favourable to the majors, and the majors' CET1 ratios have fallen behind global peers since June 2014, it believes they \"are likely to need to increase their capital ratios by at least 200 basis points … to be comfortably positioned in the fourth quartile\".\nIn dollar terms, UBS's No. 1 ranked analyst Jonathon Mott estimates that this represents a CET1 shortfall of about $24 billion today, accounting for the extra equity the majors have started sourcing since June 2014 (the short-fall would otherwise have been $30 billion). That's consistent with the lower bound of estimates I previously canvassed here.\n Yet this number may be a low-ball for two reasons. First, APRA has yet to respond to the FSI's recommendation of introducing a minimum average residential mortgage \"risk-weighting\" of between 25 per cent and 30 per cent. Second, the majors are likely to be slugged with higher risk-weights on their non-residential assets as a consequence of the new Basel 4 rules.\nUBS's research implies that the combined impact of this will be another $16 billion in CET1 on top of the $24 billion shortfall, which gives a total CET1 capital deficiency of $40 billion.\nThe Australian Financial Review's Chanticleer column says the majors will only be given 12 months to boost CET1 in response to APRA's looming decision on residential mortgage risk-weights, which the regulator says it will make \"shortly\".\nFrom a shareholders' perspective, higher equity means lower leverage and associated returns. Whether that translates into a fall in the majors' valuations is an open question and depends on whether reduced returns on equity are offset by repricing of deposits and loans and cheaper overall funding costs. As I have explained before , there are arguments for and against. My base-case is that we see a 200 basis point dilution in returns on equity from current world-beating marks that results in a circa 18.5 per cent reduction in major bank valuations.\nWhat is undeniable is that bigger equity buffers are ostensibly news for all higher ranking securities, including additional tier one capital (AT1) hybrids, subordinated bonds, senior bonds, and depositors.\nHere, however, APRA says that when examining the major' Tier 1 capital ratios, which include AT1 hybrids, and their Total Capital ratios, which include Tier 2 subordinated bonds, they look even further behind global peers. Yet, APRA carefully explains, this is mainly because it has deliberately chosen not to impose a so-called \"statutory\" bail-in of the banks' old-style AT1 hybrids and their subordinated bonds and is instead allowing them to be replaced over time with new Basel 3 compliant securities.\n\"The exclusion of legacy [hybrids and subordinated bonds] results in approximately half of these capital instruments issued by the Australian major banks being excluded from their [tier one and total capital ratios],\" APRA points out. It cautions that \"the effect of this issue will diminish over time as legacy instruments are replaced…[and means] there is less comparability in non-CET1 ratios at the present time\".\nAPRA's analysis does not, therefore, necessarily portend a surge in non-equity capital security supply. It is certainly clear APRA's focus is on the majors' CET1 and Tier 1 capital ratios, rather than Total Capital, which is a less useful conception that has limited relevance to investors. \"Market participants generally focus on the CET1 ratio as the prime measure of capital adequacy for banks, as it comprises the highest quality capital,\" APRA says.\nIn this context, APRA stresses that \"Tier 1 [capital] includes AT1 [hybrids], which [are] capable of absorbing losses on a 'going-concern' basis\" while the Tier 2 bonds included in Total Capital ratios only absorb losses \"when a non-viability event is triggered or in liquidation\".\nReiterating the primacy of the CET1 and Tier 1 capital ratios, APRA quantifies how the major banks rank relative to peers on the basis of their \"leverage ratios\". This increasingly important metric divides equity capital by the dollar value of a bank's assets rather than their \"risk-weighted\" assets.\nAPRA's chairman, Wayne Byres, maintains that markets tend to discount risk-weighted capital ratios during crises, probably because they are artificial constructs that may not be accurate proxies for the real likelihood of loss. \"At the height of the financial crisis, investors turned away from the risk-based ratios as a measure of financial health, and quickly reverted to a basic leverage ratio,\" Byres remarked.\nAPRA did not historically require the majors to meet a minimum leverage ratio, but will do so in the future. Irrespective of whether APRA measures the majors' leverage ratios using CET1 or Tier 1 capital, it finds they rank just below the 50th percentile of global peers. This equates to a leverage ratio of about 4.5 per cent versus the 6.0 per cent held by 75th percentile global banks as at June 2014.\nAcross the majors' capital structure the regulatory pressure will be demonstrably to boost loss-absorbing \"going concern\" equity and (potentially) hybrid AT1 capital to improve the banks' CET1, Tier 1 and leverage ratios.\nThe FSI and APRA have been more sceptical about the efficacy of converting investment-grade bonds into \"gone concern\" loss-absorbing capital, which is only helpful when banks have become non-viable or are in liquidation (ie, they don't do anything to prevent banks going bust in the first place). This contrasts with perpetual AT1 hybrids that are required by APRA to automatically convert into equity if the banks' CET1 ratio falls below 5.125 per cent. In APRA's stress-tests last year it found that several AT1 hybrids would have been forced into ordinary shares as a result of this trigger.\nIn summary, the majors' depositors and bond holders will benefit from much stronger equity buffers that mitigate the probability of loss and moral hazard related risks. Smaller banks, which have carried less than half the leverage of the majors when lending against housing, will also win as the playing field in capital terms is levelled. The biggest losers will be equity and hybrid investors who suffer from a surge in supply.", "external_links": ["http://www.apra.gov.au/MediaReleases/Pages/15_18.aspx", "https://twitter.com/cjoye", "https://mail.ybr.com.au/owa/redir.aspx?C=Cl-jAS4YfkWvsnXCXyR5IfqKgPxDkdIIMOrw0CcSDRvlT7_h8S4I_hgQ8CSFIWS48BB2y6bWV3Q.&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.apra.gov.au%2fSpeeches%2fPages%2fPerspectives-on-the-global-regulatory-agenda.aspx"], "published": "2015-07-14T08:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T05:08:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
