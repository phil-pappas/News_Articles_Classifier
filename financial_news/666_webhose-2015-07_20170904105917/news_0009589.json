Considering an appeal filed by the husband, a sessions court had ordered for reducing Rs 45,000.\nDuring the hearing at the high court, it was argued by the woman's counsel that she is suffering from a serious illness and had incurred Rs 2,31,000 towards medical expenses. The woman demanded that the medical expenses should also be ordered to be paid by the former husband.\nPointing out that the law permits courts to order a former husband to provide an amount that is fair and sufficient for the woman to lead her life forward, the high court said medical expenses can also be included in it if there are sufficient records. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=treatment,maintenance,Divorce Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-07-29T05:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:46:18.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
