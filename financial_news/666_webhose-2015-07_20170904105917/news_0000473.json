If it were to happen, there are likely to be changes in the industry. Intel Corporation is likely to benefit from this, as it owns 20% of the Tsinghua Unigroup, which is China's largest chip design company . The combined company could be a serious challenge to companies like Qualcomm Inc. . \nSo, what are the best semiconductors investors should be buying? Here are the top three, according to TheStreet Ratings , TheStreet 's proprietary ratings tool. \nTheStreet Ratings projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and dividends. Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings.

Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a buy yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nCheck out which semiconductors made the list. And when you're done, be sure to read about other semiconductor stocks to buy now. Year-to-date returns are based on July 14, 2015, closing prices. The highest-rated stock appears last. Market Cap: $20 billion Year-to-date return: 12.8% \nAnalog Devices, Inc. engages in the design, manufacture, and marketing of analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing integrated circuits (ICs) for use in industrial, automotive, consumer, and communication markets worldwide. \n\"We rate ANALOG DEVICES (ADI) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its robust revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, expanding profit margins, good cash flow from operations and solid stock price performance. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had somewhat disappointing return on equity.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The revenue growth came in higher than the industry average of 5.4%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 18.2%. This growth in revenue appears to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, improving the earnings per share. ADI's debt-to-equity ratio is very low at 0.18 and is currently below that of the industry average, implying that there has been very successful management of debt levels. Along with this, the company maintains a quick ratio of 3.26, which clearly demonstrates the ability to cover short-term cash needs. The stock has not only risen over the past year, it has done so at a faster pace than the S&P 500, reflecting the earnings growth and other positive factors similar to those we have cited here. Turning our attention to the future direction of the stock, it goes without saying that even the best stocks can fall in an overall down market. However, in any other environment, this stock still has good upside potential despite the fact that it has already risen in the past year. The gross profit margin for ANALOG DEVICES is currently very high, coming in at 70.56%. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Along with this, the net profit margin of 25.01% is above that of the industry average. Net operating cash flow has increased to $344.03 million or 44.29% when compared to the same quarter last year. The firm also exceeded the industry average cash flow growth rate of 28.71%.
