That means the lockup agreements, which restricted those holding substantially all of the company’s outstanding shares from selling any stock, have now expired.\nThose betting against the stock had increased significantly since Shake Shack went public. Short interest totaled about 2.3 million shares as of July 15, or more than triple what it was five months ago, according to FactSet.\nPeter Cohan, a venture capitalist and president of Peter S. Cohan and Associates, said the stock’s surge Wednesday, was likely the combination of the expiring lockup period, investor confidence in the company’s growth and short sellers trying to cover their positions. Cohan said he didn’t have a financial position in the stock.\nFactSet Short interest rises sharply since IPO The stock had run up to a record close of $92.86 on May 22, which was about a week after the company reported first-quarter results. Since then, it plunged as much as 48% to a 3 1/2-month low of $48.73 on July 15, before recovering slightly through Tuesday.\nShake Shack is scheduled to report second-quarter results on Aug. 10. The shares of some of its fast-casual restaurant peers have rallied to record levels after they reported results.\nPanera Bread Co.’s stock PNRA, +8.17% jumped 8.6% on Wednesday, after the company reported earnings late Tuesday . Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.’s shares CMG, +1.05% have surged 9.6% since quarterly results were released after the July 21 close.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T13:05:28.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
