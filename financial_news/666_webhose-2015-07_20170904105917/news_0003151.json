Increased foreign participation will help boost demand for local bonds as issuance by regional authorities surges.\n“This is the most critical step in the yuan’s internationalization,” said Huang Wentao, a Beijing-based analyst at China Securities Co. “It will help further expand the interbank market and increase trading in the long run.”\nLocal governments are set to issue 2.8 trillion yuan ($451 billion) of bonds this year. The nation is considering expanding a debt-swap program for provinces and cities, which seeks to convert high-cost existing debt maturing this year into low-yielding municipal bonds, according to people familiar with the matter. The existing 2 trillion yuan quota may be expanded to 3 trillion yuan, they said.\nThe opening of China’s markets has the potential to boost global holdings of the nation’s onshore bonds to as much as $500 billion in five years, JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimates. Overseas institutions held the equivalent of $118 billion of the debt as of April 30, 2 percent of notes outstanding. By early next year, the holdings may reach $175 billion, at which point China will surpass Brazil as the world’s biggest emerging market for local-currency global bond investors, according to JPMorgan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:21:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
