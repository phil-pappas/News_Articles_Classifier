Now it is bidding for another with 229 years of history. \nBHF Kleinwort Benson, a firm that includes one of the most storied names in European banking, is on course to be purchased by Fosun after it announced a €498 million ($542.8 million) bid for the private bank. \nThe offer of €5.10 a share – in cash – is roughly a 10% premium to the current share price. \nThe Chinese conglomerate has already agreed to buy 9.12% from an unnamed shareholder, according to a person familiar with the situation. It already owns 17.2%, thanks to an investment last year. This means Fosun’s potential holding could already be over a quarter of the private bank. \nBHF Kleinwort Benson is a well-known name in European private banking. The group is listed in Belgium, but its history stretches back to 1786 via a pair of private banks based in London, Liverpool, and Holstein. A spokesperson for BHF Kleinwort Benson could not be reached for comment Friday. \nThe group, with around €60 billion of assets under management, predominately offers wealth management services. But more interestingly, it is another financial institution in Fosun’s already bulging portfolio. \nEarlier this month Fosun made a binding offer for Hauck & Aufhäuser, a Frankfurt-based private bank founded in 1796. It also owns Caixa Seguros, a large Portuguese insurance group, and is also in the bidding for Novo Banco, the Portuguese bank created out of failed lender Banco Espírito Santo SA. \nFosun is looking at a number of wealth managers across Europe and the U.S., according to a person familiar with their plans. The strategy is simple. In Europe, private banking is a ‘sticky business’ – with families remaining with the same private bank for generations. In China, a major proportion of this wealth is first generation, and looking to invest offshore. Fosun hopes that by acquiring well-known European names, it can tap into this flow of assets, and keep it. \nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal in March, Fosun chief executive Liang Xinjun said he aimed to buy five insurers in U.S., Europe and Asia this year. \nIn April, the conglomerate bought a stake in Cirque du Soleil, the Canadian circus firm, as part of a consortium with led by private equity group TPG. Fosun said it was adding the circus troupe to its “happy lifestyle area”, adding that the purchase was the latest example of it “combining China’s growth momentum with global resources.” More from The Wall Street Journal", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T20:42:34.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
