Data from FDIC-insured institutions shows that the proportion of commercial and industrial loans under $1 million (used to measure small business lending) has fallen to 21% of all commercial loans from a peak of 34% before the “credit crunch.”\nA new breed of alternative lenders, such as Lending Club, On Deck, Biz2Credit, Kabbage and recently, Goldman Sachs, have emerged to address the gap between small business needs for financing and the willingness and capacity of banks to serve these needs effectively. Collectively known as “FinTech firms,” they are pioneering a distinctive online and digital-based approach that promises to greatly enhance small businesses access and efficiency to funding for growth. The new FinTech disrupters are benefiting from the fact that small businesses are increasingly turning online to search for financing, especially through mobile devices.\nLike other disrupters, these firms are growing fast and attracted $12 billion of investments in 2014, an increase of $4 billion from 2013. Further, nearly one in five credit-seeking small businesses surveyed in the first half of 2014 applied for funding through an online lender, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey.\nThe Information Challenge\nTraditionally, mainstream lenders who underwrite small business loans have been challenged by the fact that the required information for the loan decision is both asynchronous and asymmetric. In essence, every small business is its own unique entity, with distinctive needs that vary with time and are different from other small businesses even within the same industry. Additionally, their cash flows are much more variable than large corporations. Thus, it is both hard and expensive to monitor such businesses on a day-to-day basis to ensure their ongoing viability and hence the ability to repay the loan.\nIn contrast, cutting-edge FinTech companies are asking prospective small business borrowers to opt-in to share information and data about themselves, both at the time of initial application and on an ongoing basis. Such data includes their funding priorities for the business, as well as bank statements, tax records and authorizations to review credit and public records. Moreover, the behavior of such small businesses through digital loan applications is creating a wealth of data that can be harnessed effectively to better serve their financial needs while also increasing the likelihood that the risks associated with lending to such businesses are better understood for improved loan decisions.\nBy systematically combining this information with other local, regional and national economic data and also with that of thousands of other small business applicants, they are able to quickly respond to the funding needs of applicants and provide a rigorous and analytically-based approach to evaluate the risk of such lending.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T23:41:24.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
