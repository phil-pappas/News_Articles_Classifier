He said that in India, changing areas in hospitals are rare because of space constraints, so white coats are commonly worn by students coming from college and outside the hospital. They are also often left on chairs, tables, and in corridors. He added that in many cities in India some junior doctors are also now seen wearing white coats in shopping malls and cinemas too, and then they enter sterile zones in the hospital in the same attire. \"Given India's tropical climate, common sense indicates that we should discourage wearing white coats that are washed perhaps only every few weeks,\" Fernandes said. In 2007, the United Kingdom took the landmark decision to ban long sleeved white coats - and that in 2009, the American Medical Association wanted to follow suit and dump the white coats, \"but the proposal was dismissed because clinicians wanted to keep their traditional gowns\", he said. \"White coats are mere symbolism and wearing them does not itself confer status or professionalism,\" Fernandes added. \"Dressing presentably and sporting a smile are more important than white coats and that institutions should give every medical student and doctor a recognisable name badge to wear,\" he said.
