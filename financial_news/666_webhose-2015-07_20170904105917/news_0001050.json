Photo: Robert Rough\nConsolidation continues to be king in Melbourne's suburbs as developers lure a growing number of home owners with windfall gains for their properties.\nA group of six landowners in Melbourne's south-east suburb of McKinnon gained a 40 per cent premium on their houses in an $8.88 million, off-market sale to a developer.\nSavills Australia's Julian Heatherich said the properties at 3 to 9 Claire Street sold for what was believed to be a record $2913 a square metre for the area.\nThe four residential lots totalling 3049 square metres with six individual property owners in a general residential zone sold with plans for an apartment project.\n\"Six neighbours have come together with the common aspiration to create a one-off opportunity by combining their properties to form an attractive development prospect,\" he said.\nThe trend appears strongest in Melbourne's south-eastern suburbs where large blocks, high land values and strong demand are creating incentives for landowners to combine blocks.\nIn Hampton two neighbours pooled their properties to offer a potential multi-apartment development site and pocketed an $800,000 premium each, based on market expectations, Teska Carson director George Takis said.\nThe owners of 2 and 4 Littlewood Street would have got about $1.9 million each for their homes as individual sites, but a developer paid $5.4 million for both ($2.7 million for each) because of the block's potential for a three-level apartment, he said.\nBoth sites had older-style, brick houses on them.\n\"We are seeing more and more of these developments,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T05:10:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
