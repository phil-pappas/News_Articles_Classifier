Several employees of the commission who spoke on the basis of anonymity said they have resolved not to sit the exam because the essence of the exam has not been explained by management. \nSome of the employees are contending that they have been working at the entity for more than eight years and have attended numerous audit trainings sponsored by the European Union, World Bank and other donors and as such the rationale behind such exam by management is not clear. \nA group comprising Master degree holders sponsored by the GAC to the University of Nairobi are said to be strongly opposed to the exam and have decided to shun the test. Another group of graduates from China are also said to have consented to stay away from the test which they say is intended to target them. \n\"I have been working here for more than eight years and have attended many trainings but since the announcement about salary cut the AG and Deputy AG administration came out announce test. I we are not qualified than but happen to all the audit reports we have produced\", one angry GAC employee told FPA. \nAccording to sources, Auditor General Yusador Gaye has been expressing anger over the salary cut measure put in place by the Government, allegedly complaining that some employees of the GAC are politicians who are in the habit of taking issues taking place at the entity to the public. \nSources within the GAC confided in GAC since the mandate about salary cut for senior officials of government, the Auditor general and her Deputy for Administration Foday Kiazolu have been threatening employees with administrative actions.

The GAC is not new to tension between employees and management as during the regime of former Auditor General Robert Kilby, he redundant over forty employees, which led to street protest and law suit from some of the employees against the entity. \nThe GAC under Kilby came to the public glare over arbitrary salary increment and is amongst one of the entities of government with very high payroll. The Auditor general earns around US$15,000 with her two deputies making around US$9,000. The pronounced reduction by government will greatly impact senior officials of the GAC who earn bonanza salaries. \nBesides basic salary, only senior officials of GAC are entitled to gas slip, scratch cards and other incentives as AG Gaye in 2014 stopped the distribution of gas slip and other incentives to managers, directors and other senior level employees of the GAC. Written test is normally common during recruitment processes in Liberia but exam for employees with long years of work within in an agency of government is strange in the public sector.
