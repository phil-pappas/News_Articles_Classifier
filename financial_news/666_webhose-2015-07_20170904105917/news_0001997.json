Mr Bloxham identified industries like tourism and education to be the next key contributors to local growth. \"There's strong growth in tourism arrivals particularly from China, we've also seen ... international student enrolments hit new highs this year,\" he said. He expected the sector to be helped by Asia's emerging middle class, low interest rates and the falling Aussie dollar - which dropped below US 75 cents this week for this first time since 2009. Foreign demand for local services would also continue to be supported by free trade agreements recently signed with China, Korea and Japan, Mr Bloxham said. The prediction comes in the wake of upbeat recent data on services sector activity, with AI Group's PSI index edging up to 51.2 in June - past the 50 level which separates expansion from contraction. Those figures showed three of the five activity sub-indexes were in expansion territory led by robust gains in sales and new orders. Mr Bloxham urged politicians to focus on infrastructure investment that could help lift services-driven growth. \"What would help is a focus on tax and regulatory reform and building infrastructure to improve local competitiveness and support a services-driven upswing in growth,\" he said.
