Talks with lenders are then expected to formally begin on Thursday. \nA 971-page list of the laws, which include implementing EU-wide regulation over banking rescues, was sent to parliamentarians on Tuesday night. \nBut prime minister Alexis Tsipras will have to fight down a rebellion in his Leftist Syriza party, a week after more than 38 of his MPs rejected a raft of tax hikes and pension cuts . \nMr Tsipras needs at least 120 MPs to vote in favour of the measures to avoid triggering a vote of confidence in his leadership. Should he fail to get the backing of his party, snap elections are set to be held as soon as September. \nDespite capitulating to punishing bail-out demands and disowning the measures , the Leftist premier remains the most popular politician in the country, with opinion polls showing he has a 10-point poll lead over his nearest rivals. \nThe embattled government still faces a number of legislative hurdles before cash disbursement can begin. Parliamentarians will have to ratify laws on ending early retirement and increase the tax rate paid by farmers from 13pc to 26pc by early August. The tax hikes are strongly opposed by the pro-European New Democracy opposition, who have so far pledged to vote in favour of any deal that keeps Greece in the single currency. \n• How the Greek crisis changed Europe forever \nAlthough the immediate threat of Grexit has receded, analysts warn the government's shaky ownership of the reforms could still precipitate a fresh political crisis in Greece. \n\"The inherent contradiction of programme implementation by a government from within which the bulk of opposition originates will have to be resolved,\" said George Saravelos, at Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) . \n\"It is unlikely that uncertainty around the stability of the Greek economy and banking system recedes until this is the case.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T21:45:20.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
