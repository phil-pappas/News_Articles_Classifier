Meanwhile commodity prices are again falling rapidly,\" Goldman Sach said. \nAnalysts said that China's general oil demand should remain strong this year despite the stock market trouble and an economy growing at its slowest pace in a generation. \n\"Oil demand growth this year has been disconnected from the fundamental realities of China's growth trajectory,\" Michal Meidan of consultancy China Matters said in a report. \n\"The rapid increase in China's apparent oil demand growth has been due first and foremost to stockpiling, while real demand has also been supported somewhat by low oil prices,\" she added. \nWhile low oil prices hurt oil producers, importers stand to benefit. \n\"Lower oil prices deliver a favourable mix of stronger growth and lower inflation for all countries in the (Asia) region, except Malaysia,\" Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report. \n\"Thailand, Korea, Singapore and India are the biggest beneficiaries of lower oil simply because they are the biggest net importers of oil,\" it added. \n(Editing by Ed Davies)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T06:31:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
