PUBLISHED: 14:01, Fri, Jul 10, 2015 | UPDATED: 15:59, Fri, Jul 10, 2015 GETTY The cost of solar panels could rise under the new ruling \nThe price of solar panels, insulation, boilers and other home efficiency measures are set to soar after Brussels pen-pushers outlawed a UK discount on energy-saving products.Eurocrats took the decision despite simultaneously issuing Britain with strict energy consumption targets, with the threat of huge fines if the levels are exceeded.It also comes as many British families are investing in energy-saving measures in a bid to reduce their electricity and gas bills that have soared in recent years.Britain now faces a price hike of around 15 per cent on green home measures, after the European Court of Justice (ECJ) said a VAT tax perk to promote sales is illegal. It could mean homeowners take another two years to break even on the cost of solar panels, according to experts, with the price of an £8,000 installation leaping to £9,500. Under the current UK rules, energy-saving measures for housing qualifies for a VAT rate of five per cent, rather than the standard 20 per cent. But last month the ECJ said the incentive violated the EU's VAT Directive, which only allows reductions on rates in the housing sector if it's part of a social policy.
