Bush years, was raised 23.8 percent under Barack Obama, and Hillary would jack up the rate to as high as 42 percent - with the rate falling the longer the asset is held.\n\"This is the worst economic idea of I've heard in years,\" Larry Kudlow of CNBC marvelled. \"It's a wrecking ball to the economy.\"\nHillary's plan reveals such a deep and disturbing ignorance of the effects of the capital gains tax and its impact on growth that it's time to bust some of the key myths about how this tax affects the economy:\n1. The tax on capital gains income is much lower than the tax on wages and salaries of the working class.\nHillary says she would merely tax income from capital at the same rate as middle class Americans have taken from their paychecks. She would tax capital gains as ordinary income for those who make over about $450,000 a year. But this would make taxes on capital income punitive and here's why.\nFirst, most capital gains come from the sale of financial assets like stock. But publicly held companies have to pay corporate income tax at a rate of 35 percent. Capital gains is a second tax on that income when the stock is sold. So the actual tax rate on capital gains income is closer to 40 - 50 percent and Hill‎ary would raise that to 60 percent.\nSecond, ‎capital gains is a tax on the increase of the valuation of a stock, but is not adjusted for inflation. So when inflation is high, the capital \"gain\" can be mostly due to inflation. In other words the gain can be illusory and the tax rate can even rise above 100 percent.\nFinally, although we require investors to pay tax on all of their capital gains, they only get to deduct a small share of their losses. So this skews the tax code against risk taking.\n2. Raising the capital gains tax will raise billions of dollars for the government.\nThe Hillary plan is almost all pain with no gain. It's highly unlikely the tax hike will raise any money for the Treasury and if history is a guide it will lose revenue.\nAfter the capital gains tax hike in 1986 from 20 percent to 28 percent, capital gains revenues actually fell from $44 billion a year to $27 billion a year by 1991. After Bill Clinton cut the capital gains tax down to 20 percent again, capital gains revenues surged from $54 billion in 1996 to $99 billion in 1999. Lower rates, more revenues.\n3. Raising the capital gains tax is a good way to make the rich pay their \"fair share\" of taxes.\nDespite Hillary's assurances that her plan is meant to discourage \"short termism\" in the boardroom, the real agenda here is hardly a secret: she wants to sock it to the rich.\nBut the irony of this is it won't hurt the Warren Buffett's and the Wall Street hedge fund managers much. They might have to pay a higher tax bill - but more likely they will simply hold on to their stock longer to avoid the higher tax penalty.\nBut the people who will get hurt are the middle class, minorities, and young people - the same group that has been clobbered during this so-called recovery.\nWages rise when workers can produce more, and they can produce more when they get smarter, better trained, and have more capital to work with. A tax on capital is thus an invisible tax on wages. When Ronald Reagan and Hillary's husband Bill Clinton cut the capital gains tax, wages and productivity surged.\n4. Raising capital gains taxes won't reduce investment.\nHillary herself says that businesses aren't investing enough - and she's right - so it's a head scratcher that she has come to believe that more investment will come from higher tax rates on investment.\nBack in the 1980s even Democrats like Bill Bradley and Dick Gephardt appreciated that high tax rates have a negative effect on the economy. Then in the last decade the orthodoxy on the left became tax rates don't matter at all. Now they think higher tax rates are good for us, which may explain why Bernie Sanders of Vermont wants a 70 percent tax rate on the rich.\nFor at least 40 years, funding for venture capital in new enterprises and the rate of new business start ups has been inversely related to capital gains taxes. The higher the penalty on risk capital, the fewer new entrepreneurial ventures get started.\nIf we want to accelerate the next generation of Ubers, Groupons, Home Depots, and Googles, we need investors willing to put their money at risk, and if they are going to be taxed at 50 or 60 percent, they are more likely to take a pass.\n5. Raising the capital gains tax will help the economy.\nThe American Council for Capital Formation finds that the Hillary Clinton plan would raise the capital gains tax to nearly the highest in the industrial world. The U.S. already has the highest corporate tax rate in the world, so this would be a double whammy.\nThe Tax Foundation finds that bang for the buck, lowering the capital gains tax rate is one of the most pro-growth measures Congress could adopt. The optimal capital gains tax is zero.\nBy contrast, raising the capital gains rate will hurt small businesses, workers, and American competitiveness - and it won't raise any money. How this is fair, is beyond me.\n*Stephen Moore i‎s a CBN economics contributor and an economist at the Heritage Foundation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T23:09:33.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
