While sales of the kind of bonds that fueled the 2008 housing crisis have stalled, investors have driven up the value of older notes and are snapping up newer types, including securities from taxpayer-backed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that allow buyers to share in their risks.\nThe planned notes tied to United Guaranty policies resemble those risk-transfer transactions, which have totaled about $20 billion since beginning in 2013. They’re also similar to so-called catastrophe bonds sold by insurers and some of the transactions tied to mortgages that existed before the crisis.\nJo Fleischer, a spokesman for United Guaranty, declined to comment. Drew Benson, a spokesman for Credit Suisse, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.\nUnited Guaranty, the most active mortgage insurer, typically offers protection to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac against losses on loans to borrowers who don’t have 20 percent to put down or an equivalent amount of home equity in a refinancing. Premiums usually get paid by borrowers.\nThe new notes, which would carry three different levels of risk tied to the amount of losses from homeowner defaults, aren’t expected to be rated initially, the document shows. Proceeds from the sale would be placed into a reinsurance trust and be available to pay United Guaranty or noteholders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T21:39:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
