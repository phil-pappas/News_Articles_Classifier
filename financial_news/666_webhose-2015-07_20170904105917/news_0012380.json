There have been rumours of the possibility of BlackBerry releasing an Android device this year. The device, called Venice, will run Google's mobile OS and complete suite of apps, Droid Life reported. According to a leaked press render, the device looks rather elegant, featuring a rounded front display, complete with microUSB, headphone jack, and large speaker. However, this is not all. The display can slide up, revealing a full keyboard for those who wish to use one. Venice, in that way, seems to be a blend of modern design and a bit nostalgia. The Venice will be hitting AT&T's network, but there is no timeframe for the release. As shown in the render, the device looks to be running all of Google's applications, meaning the device will likely have access to Google Play.
