However, it is likely that more stimulus measures will be required to ensure that the sector can regain growth momentum and to encourage job creation.\"\nChina's central bank lowered lending rates last weekend for the fourth time since November and trimmed the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves, stepping up efforts to support an economy that is headed for its poorest performance in a quarter century.\nSaturday's combined easing highlights Beijing's concerns that money isn't flowing to some of the most-needed sectors in the economy and that stubbornly high borrowing costs could fuel bankruptcies and more job losses.\nThe last time the central bank simultaneously cut interest rates and reserve requirements was at the height of the global financial crisis in late 2008.\nThe latest move could also be aimed at comforting investors following a more than 20 percent plunge in the country's stock markets over the last two weeks, some analysts said.\n(Reporting by Pete Sweeney ; Editing by Kim Coghill)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T05:18:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
