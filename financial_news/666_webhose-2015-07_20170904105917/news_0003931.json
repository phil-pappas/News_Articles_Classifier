Heralded as a stealth tax by many commentators, the 60% rise in IPT will result in a firm paying a £50,000 professional indemnity premium incurring an additional £1,750 of costs. This is not an insignificant increase given the fact that many firms continue to struggle with rising Professional Indemnity costs and continued pressure on margins. \nThe increase will of course, not only impact professional indemnity but all classes of incurance from private motor through to office and contents. Commenting on the rise in IPT, Steve White, CEO of the British Insurance Brokers Association said, \"We are extremely disappointed in this rise in Insurance Premium Tax ... Those hit by this stealth tax will include the 20.1 million households with contents insurance; 19.6 million with motor insurance and 17 million with buildings insurance.\" \nWhilst the Treasury has stated that IPT in the UK continues to be lower than that of several other European countries, the increase will nonetheless see the treasury coffers boosted by an additional £1.5 billion of income per annum. The impact of theincrease on the insurance industry may be softened by the Government’s promise to crack down on claims management companies by capping charges and undertaking a fundamental review of how they operate. However it has still resulted in critics stating that this will result in both private and commercial customers under insuring in an attempt to manage costs. \nIn terms of Professional Indemnity insurance, we will where possible offer all solicitors practices seeking renewal terms from Howden, the opportunity to purchase an 18 month policy extending their renewal date from 1st October 2016 to 1st March, 2017. This will at least enable firms to enjoy an additional 6 months of insurance with the current rate of IPT attaching. \nShare:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T01:32:27.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
