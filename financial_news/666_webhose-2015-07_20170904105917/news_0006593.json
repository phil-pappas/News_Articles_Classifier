When I buy shares I focus on momentum and I look at whether earnings are growing faster than analysts’ expectations. \nWhen this happens share prices tend to start gathering momentum. I then look at the valuation and take a view on whether the business is cheap for all the wrong reasons. When this is not the case I will then buy. \nBut I am prepared to wait to see clear evidence that the earnings growth is coming through, rather than trying to \"bottom fish\". This is why I waited until the end of last year to buy Greggs , the baker. \nThe share price had started creeping higher and the management team were sending out the right noises, but it was only in late 2014 when I could see the earnings numbers coming through that I felt comfortable enough to invest. \nWhat have been the best performers over the past three years? \nSince 2012 the housebuilders I hold, Berkeley Group and Bellway , have performed well. \nThe best two performers in the fund have been Howden Joinery , the kitchen maker, and Ashtead , the construction equipment rental group. I still hold both. \nThankfully there has not been any big casualties, which has also helped the fund outperform the FTSE 250 index. \nWhat have you been buying over the past couple of months? \nI have purchased two companies that have this year made their stock market debuts; Wizz, the low cost eastern European airliner and Aldermore, the challenger bank. \nI am really bullish on the challenger banks growing their market share in the coming years and have also been adding exposure to Shawbrook Bank and One Savings Bank . These newer entrants are well equipped to serve small and medium sized businesses that the big banks are turning away. \nI am keen to add to shares that will benefit from consumer spending on the back of wage growth starting to come through. With this in mind I recently bought Card Factory (LSE: CARD.L - news ) , the greetings card retailer. \nAre you still buying shares that performed well over the past three years? \nI am still buying the housebuilders, even though they now come with more expensive prices. \nA year ago, when it looked like an interest rate rise was on the cards, I reviewed the sector. My conclusion was that there will still be strong house buying and mortgage demand even when rates go up, particularly when the Bank of England has signalled rates will go up gradually, rather than jumping back up to 5pc overnight. \nWhat have you been selling? \nI have sold Hikma Pharmaceuticals (LSE: HIK.L - news ) and Inmarast, the satellite technology firm, following their promotion to the FTSE 100. I do not have to automatically sell when this happens, but in both cases the shares had a good run and become too expensive. \nDo you invest your own money in the fund? \nI do indeed, mainly through Isas. Part of my remuneration is also connected to the fund. \nWhat would you have done if you hadn’t become a fund manager? \nI am a qualified barrister, so if I had not decided to make a career change I would still be serving the Bar. \n= Our view = \nThe FTSE 250 has beaten the FTSE All Share index in four of the past five years, so it is no surprise to see the dozen funds that invest exclusively in mid-cap companies near the top of the fund charts. \nThe JP Morgan fund has been the best performer since Ms Brittain took charge three years ago, according to FE Trustnet, the data firm, with analysts putting this down to “clever use of gearing “. \nTim Cockerill of wealth manager Rowan Dartington said: “Investment trusts can borrow to help magnify returns and this has paid off. The trust currently has gearing of 9pc, whereas the other similar trusts, Schroder UK Mid Cap and Mercantile, do not borrow. But investors need to bear in mind that gearing works in reverse in down markets, so therefore funds that borrow come with an added dose of risk.” \nJason Hollands, of Bestinvest, the broker, expects mid cap funds to continue their fine form. \nInvesting in the FTSE 250 is seen as a direct a play on the UK economy because the majority of business make their money here in Britain rather than oversees. \n“This slice of the market has a greater domestic and flavour to it than the FTSE 100 and I expect the UK economy to continue performing well.” \nMr Hollands tipped AXA Framlington UK Mid Cap fund, managed by Chris St. John, as another fund to consider. \nThe fund holds between 35 to 45 shares, with Betafair, the bookmaker, and Rightmove (LSE: RMV.L - news ) , the property website, two of the top holdings. \nJohn Monaghan, of Square Mile, the fund rating analyst, favours Franklin Templeton UK Mid Cap and Old Mutual UK Mid Cap as alternatives. \nMr Monaghan said both funds are run by experienced investors, but have different investment styles, with the Franklin Templeton fund more suitable for cautious savers. \n“It focuses on capital protection, which should mean a less bumpy ride during periods of heightened volatility. Whereas the Old Mutual (Other OTC: ODMTY - news ) fund holds a reasonably concentrated portfolio of around 50 shares,” Mr Monaghan said. \n= How to buy the fund as cheaply as possible = \nThe trust is listed on the London Stock Exchange (Other OTC: LDNXF - news ) so it can be bought like any other share through a stockbroker or investment shop. It has a total cost of 0.97pc, slightly higher than other rival funds. \nBut remember there will also be a separate annual broker charge to pay. Some will charge a percentage of the amount invested, others will apply a flat annual fee.
