The decision follows a threat by Indian buyers to stop imports of rough diamonds because of over-supply. De Beers offered about $450 million of stones to its handpicked customers, known as sightholders, compared with about $550 million in June, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information isn’t public. Prices were unchanged, they said.\nDe Beers and other diamond producers are under pressure to cut supply and lower prices as traders, cutters and polishers struggle to turn a profit amid a squeeze on credit and as jewelry sales languish. De Beers last week said it was giving buyers the rare chance to reject rough stones at the sale in Botswana.\nAbout 200 diamond companies in India, where almost 90 percent of stones are cut and polished, decided July 7 to shelve a proposed ban on imports of rough gems that was tabled amid complaints about high prices and oversupply. De Beers had sought to support rough diamond prices by cutting supply earlier this year.\nDe Beers, which is owned by Anglo American Plc, sells diamonds at prices it sets at invitation-only sights held 10 times a year at its offices in Botswana. Sightholders risk losing the privilege of taking part in future sales if they walk away.\n©2015 Bloomberg News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:52:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
