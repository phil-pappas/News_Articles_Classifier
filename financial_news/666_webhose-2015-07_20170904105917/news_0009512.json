Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO.L - news ) slipped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 — down 39.5p to 589p, BHP Billiton also fell, by 44.5p to £11.24, and Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) slid 9.9p to 210.2p. \nAnglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) hovered at 13-year lows — down 28.4p to 3.5p — as it announced plans to axe thousands of jobs and may offload more assets. Despite the gloomy outlook, analysts at Jefferies believe the mining giant is “positioned to weather the storm”. * Gold price falls again to new five-year low On the mid-cap index, Aggreko (LSE: AGK.L - news ) and Lonmin (LSE: LMI.L - news ) were hardest hit. Temporary power company Aggreko plunged 175p, or 12.2pc, after it issued a profit warning . The FTSE 250 company said its full-year earnings would fall at least 8pc short of expectations due to lower prices for contracts in Bangladesh. \nMeanwhile, Lonmin nosedived 13.2p, or 17.4pc, to 62.4p as it announced plans to close several mine shafts, putting about 6,000 jobs at risks. However, analysts at Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) questioned whether further action would be required by the platinum producer to cope with tough market conditions. \nVodafone rose to the top of the FTSE 100, jumping 6.5p, or 2.8pc to 238.45p, after quarterly results impressed investors . RSA Insurance (LSE: RSA.L - news ) , which was buoyed by bid speculation earlier this week, rose 8.1p, or 1.8pc, to 452.1p in late trade. \nHouse builders also made gains after mortgage approvals rose in June to their highest level since March last year. Land Securities (LSE: LAND.L - news ) advanced 12p, or 0.9pc, to £12.97 and British Land (LSE: BLND.L - news ) edged 1p higher to 829p. Elsewhere, investors piled into British insurer Beazley — up 6.6pc to 340.9p — after it reported a better than expected pre-tax profit of $154.5m, beating analysts’ expectations of $136m. \nDiageo (LSE: DGE.L - news ) fell into the red, down 47p to £18.60, after it came under scrutiny in the US over claims it had artificially boosted sales. \nFinally, CSR (LSE: CSR.L - news ) soared to its highest level in eight years after its acquisition by US company Qualcomm (Swiss: QCOM.SW - news ) was cleared by China’s Ministry of Commerce. \nThe Cambridge-based company also confirmed yesterday that it had made an application to the London Stock Exchange (Other OTC: LDNXF - news ) for shares to be suspended on August 12. The stock was among the biggest risers in the mid-cap index, jumping 27p, or 3.1pc, to 897p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T23:16:42.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
