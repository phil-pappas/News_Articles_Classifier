Slovenia, which is selling a new 10-year benchmark via a syndicate of banks, and Portugal are the only sovereign bond issuers this week.\n\"Negative net supply is a driver and there's a general feeling that as we are entering the summer period, PSPP (central bank bond buying) is going to keep the market supported,\" said Mizuho senior rate strategist Peter Chatwell.\n\"And we've got the global disinflation force after the falls in commodity prices which I think is having less of an impact in the euro zone but is a reason to be buying fixed income.\"\nMarkets are also calmer due to a more stable situation in Greece, where banks reopened as Athens began the process of paying off billions of euros owed to international creditors after it agreed to a new reform plan in exchange for another bailout to keep it in the euro zone.\nThe Greek government submitted legislation to parliament on Tuesday required by its international lenders to start talks on a third multi-billion euro rescue package. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has until Wednesday night to get those measures adopted in the assembly.\nGreek 10-year yields were a touch lower at 11.28 percent.
