The government believes that different leadership is required to build on those foundations and take the organisation to the next stage of its development,\" Mr Osborne continued. \nTracey McDermott, director of supervision, will take over as acting chief executive following a period when the FCA has cracked down on banks' wrongdoing during the financial crisis. \nLenders have been forced to pay out billions of pounds in fines over scandals such as the manipulation of Libor and the mis-selling of payment protection insurance. \nInternational banks operating in the UK were also included in the FCA data. Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) was visited 57 times by the watchdog, last year, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) 44 and Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) 46.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T05:10:05.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
