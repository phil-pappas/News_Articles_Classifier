More \nThe proposal was one of the remedies unveiled by the Competition and Markets Authority after a year-long probe into the energy market — to prevent people who fail to switch to cheaper deals from becoming stuck on expensive products. \n“The prime minister would be prepared to consider it,” the spokeswoman said. \n“This is an important report and the prime minister was clear in the last parliament, about the need to investigate what is going on and getting the best deal for consumers.” \nShares in Centrica fell 2.8 per cent and those of SSE dropped 2.1 per cent. \nThe CMA’s initial findings found that average domestic prices for the big six energy suppliers were about 5 per cent “above the competitive level” from 2009 to 2013. \nHouseholds paid £1.2bn a year too much, while small and medium-sized businesses paid £500m more than they should. \nHowever, Centrica-owned British Gas, EDF Energy, Eon , RWE Npower, Scottish Power and SSE escaped more serious censure and any prospect of an industry break-up after the watchdog found no evidence of market abuse or tacit co-ordination over price moves. \nThe competition authority ’s report argued that the big six had “unilateral market power” in a retail market of tens of millions of households. \nThey had earned an average 28 per cent return on capital over 2009-13 in their supply businesses compared with an estimated 10 per cent cost of capital.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T06:04:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
