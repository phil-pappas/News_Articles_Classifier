However, this threshold will rise to £40 from July 28. \nThe move sparked anger among Tesco's customers. \nOne shopper, Lisa Weston , wrote on Tesco's Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news ) page : \"Why is Tesco minimum online basket changing from £25 to a massive £40? Think I need to change supermarkets.\" \nKeith King tweeted: \"Click and collect minimum spend going up from £25 to £40 next week @Tesco no thank you. I'm off.\" \nTesco did not immediately return calls for comment but told one customer on Twitter (Swiss: TWTR.SW - news ) : \"We want to continue offering customers good deals for online, including £1 one-hour delivery slots and Click & Collect.\" \nBritain's biggest retailer offers free delivery when customers sign up to its Delivery Saver programme. However, this costs from £3 a month to £60 for a year, depending on when households want their items delivered. \nThis method offers Tesco a more reliable revenue stream than customers ordering items online whenever they see goods they like. \nIt is the latest blow for shoppers, after John Lewis announced plans earlier this month to start charging shoppers £2 to collect online orders in shops. It claims that web-based business models have become “unsustainable” and “bonkers”. \nFrom the end of this month, John Lewis will charge £2 for click-and-collect on orders of less than £30. Orders worth more than £30 will still be free to collect in John Lewis and Waitrose stores. \nAndy Street, managing director of John Lewis \nAndy Street, managing director of John Lewis, said the charge would account for roughly 18pc of the retailer’s orders. \nJohn Lewis made the announcement as Amazon revealed that it planned to deliver some online orders within an hour in London. Amazon Prime Now will allow shoppers to pay £6.99 to get 10,000 products, including everyday items such as coffee, within an hour of ordering. \nSome retailers already charge for click-and-collect, including Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T04:11:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
