Call it cord-cutting 2.0. According to a recent study by Coupon Cabin , 46% of cell phone customers have a monthly bill over $100, while 13% have a bill over $200 a month. Ask any parent of teenagers and you'll hear horror stories of bills $300 up, thanks primarily to budget-sucking \"data overages\" that telecom companies like Verizon or AT&T use to lard up monthly fees. Now, no-contract providers like GIV Mobile, Metro PCS, PTel, and Republic Wireless are popping up with low-cost alternatives to the large carriers, with some plans (like GIV Mobile), starting as low as $20 per month with 250 MB of 4G data. (The company also donates 8% of the monthly bill to the charity of the customer's choosing.) Going to a no-contract carrier isn't the only way to save cash on your monthly cell phone bill. But if you do, take some precautions first. \"You can sign up with a non-major cell phone provider such as T-Mobile, Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, Cricket or Metro PCS,\" says Harrine Freeman, chief executive officer at H.E. Freeman Enterprises, a Bethesda, Md.-based financial services firm. \"Before switching, verify if your cell phone runs on a CDMA or GSM network. Not all phones can be used on all networks.\" Freeman also advises getting a basic plan with basic features. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T23:54:39.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
