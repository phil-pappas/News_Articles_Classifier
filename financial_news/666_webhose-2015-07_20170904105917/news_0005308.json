Amaya last year bought PokerStars for $4.9 billion, while GVC teamed with William Hill Plc to take over Sportingbet Plc in 2013. Bwin.party Chief Executive Officer Norbert Teufelberger has been considering a sale since at least November, when the company said it was in early talks with several parties.\n“Based on our experience with the successful Sportingbet acquisition and restructuring, we believe that the potential combination of GVC and bwin.party would result in substantial financial and operating synergies and represent an excellent opportunity for both GVC and bwin.party shareholders,” GVC CEO Kenneth Alexander said in a statement.\nBwin.party said it will work with GVC so that the bidder can finalize the offer in the coming days.\nThe bid price is 11 percent above Bwin.party’s Wednesday closing price of 99.1 pence. The shares rose 1.2 percent to 100.3 pence as of 8:01 a.m. in London.\nThere’s no guarantee there will be a formal announcement of a transaction, GVC and Bwin.party said. GVC said May 15 it had submitted a proposal to buy Bwin.party, and four days later it said Amaya, based in Point-Claire, Quebec, would help finance the bid. 888 said last month that its proposal to buy Bwin.party includes cash and shares. It didn’t specify the price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:11:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
