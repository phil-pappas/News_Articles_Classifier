The venture is bidding 37 euros a share for NextRadioTV, 16 percent more than the stock’s closing price of 31.80 euros on Friday in Paris.\nWeill will ultimately own 24 percent of a subsidiary of Altice dedicated to investing in media companies and help the cable and telecommunications empire expand beyond France, Luxembourg-based Altice said.\nSince its 2014 initial public offering, Altice has become one of Europe’s most acquisitive telecommunications companies. Drahi is in the process of converting the company into a new entity to gain a new stock for bigger takeovers.\nNextRadioTV owns assets including BFMTV, which last month was among France’s 15 most watched TV channels with a 2 percent share of the national audience.\nAmong Drahi’s media assets are magazines including France’s L’Express and L’Expansion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T10:04:41.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
