It said at the time it expected to raise about $4.7 billion from the sale. \nKMG's consolidated net debt exceeded $18 billion this month, the Samruk-Kazyna source told Reuters. \nKMG, which has been hit by a fall in world oil prices, holds 16.81 percent in Kashagan, the world's biggest oil find in decades which is located on the Caspian Sea shelf. \nThe field started output in September 2013 but halted production a few weeks later after gas leaks were detected in its pipelines. KMG said this month it expected Kashagan's oil production to resume in early 2017. \n(Reporting by Mariya Gordeyeva; Writing by Dmitry Solovyov; Editing by Mark Potter) Tweet WHAT DO YOU THINK?
