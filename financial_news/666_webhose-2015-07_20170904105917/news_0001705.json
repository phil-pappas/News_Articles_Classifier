Photo: Ryan Stuart\nFinancial system inquiry chairman David Murray has backed the banking regulator's approach to making the industry more resilient to shocks, even though it fell short of supporting all his recommendations.\nUpping pressure on banks to strengthen their balance sheets, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority on Monday said the big four would need to raise 200 basis points in capital in order for them to be \"unquestionably strong\", as Mr Murray recommended last year.\nIn a partial win for banks, APRA did not endorse Mr Murray's recommendation for banks to carry enough capital to put them in the top 25 per cent of international banks, only saying that relative measure would act as a useful \"sense check\".\nDespite this, Mr Murray on Tuesday backed APRA's approach as the right response to the fast-moving regulatory environment.\nAdvertisement \"The approach they've adopted seems a sensible one, and from the inquiry's perspective we're pleased that they've adopted the principle of unquestionable strength,\" Mr Murray told Fairfax Media.\nMr Murray said he was not concerned by APRA decision not to adopt the top quartile idea as a hard target, and the regulator's approach would provide more certainty for industry.\nIt came as analysts tallied up their estimates of how many billions in capital the banks will need to raise in years to come – most likely through asset sales, retained earnings or issuing new stock.\nMost analysts said banks would need to raise less than $30 billion to hit the target, though these estimates will be refined when APRA provides further clarity soon about how much it will increase mortgage \"risk weights\".\nAPRA is expected to provide greater clarity on risk weights – financial models that determine the riskiness of loans – over the coming weeks.\nCiti's Craig Williams said the APRA report on Monday significantly reduced the chances of banks launching \"big bang\" capital raisings to hit targets outlined by Mr Murray.\n\"From a sector perspective, we would argue that today's APRA release reduces some of the 'black swan' risk that Australian major banks will need to undertake large big bang capital raisings as a result of the FSI Inquiry findings,\" Mr Williams wrote in a note to clients.\nWhile APRA provided some much-anticipated guidance on its thinking on Monday, how it will define \"unquestionably strong\" remains unclear.\nAnother big unknown for many experts is how capital rules may be affected by discussions among global regulators.\nUBS analyst Jonathan Mott said he believed banks may ultimately need to raise near $40 billion in capital, because of ongoing global regulatory negotiations known as \"Basel IV\". The outcome of these talks will not be known until earlier next year.\nMr Murray also highlighted the uncertainty created by talks overseas in interview on ABC Radio.\nHowever, APRA chairman Wayne Byres said on Monday shareholders in banks should not fear the trend towards higher capital ratios, as Australian lenders were still relatively well capitalised and there was no need to rush.\n\"We've made a commitment that however we deal with these issues, it's done in an orderly fashion,\" Mr Byres said in an interview with Fairfax Media this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T17:27:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
