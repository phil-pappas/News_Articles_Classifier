Nic Walker by James Eyers The shock bank tax announced in the UK budget this week will complicate National Australia Bank's sale of Clydesdale Bank, says Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Victor German, who has sliced his valuation of NAB's difficult UK asset by $425 million.\nUK chancellor George Osborne surprised the market when he announced an 8 per cent tax on bank profits in the UK budget on Wednesday, which also removed a controversial bank levy that HSBC and Standard Chartered had argued could force them out of the UK.\nShares in smaller UK banks (where they are known as \"challenger banks\") fell by as much as 15 per cent after the announcement on Wednesday.\n\"Proposed changes announced in the UK's 2015 budget appear to be detrimental to NAB's aspirations in listing its UK assets,\" Mr German said.\nNAB is planning on selling as much as 80 per cent of Clydesdale Bank later this year by demerging it to NAB shareholders and conducting an initial public offering.\nCBA said the tax will reduce Clydesdale's full-year 2016 pro forma earnings by around 10 per cent and its full-year 2020 forecast earnings by around 8 per cent. This reduced Clydesdale's valuation by around $425 million.\nThere was \"a further downside risk should these changes result in a permanent de‑rating of the smaller peer banks in the UK,\" Mr German said. \"Moreover, all other things being equal, we believe NAB may need to sell a larger percentage of shares to meet its capital targets (that is, be at the upper end of the 20‑30 per cent range).\"\nOn Tuesday, NAB released broad-brush details about the outlook and strategy for Clydesdale as an independent entity and new Clydesdale chief executive David Duffy presented to investors in the UK. NAB has overhauled Clydesdale's management and cut costs at the bank after it was hit by a fallout from the UK's grinding recession and costs from a mis-selling scandal that has dogged the British banking sector and complicated the exit. Now the bank tax is the latest headache.\n NAB CEO Andrew Thorburn has made it a priority to focus on Australian and New Zealand operations, as outlined in a recent profile in The Australian Financial Review's BOSS Magazine .\nCBA reduced its valuation of NAB by 15c per share as a result of the UK budget. The Financial Times reported on Thursday that challenger banks are outraged at the tax and are meeting with the British Bankers' Association on Friday to voice their concerns .\nIn Australia, the banks have been lobbying against plans to introduce a tax on bank deposits, a budget measure worth $2 billion in revenue over four years.\nThe financial system inquiry recommended against an upfront levy to charge banks for deposit insurance, but the measure was not ruled out in the last federal budget. The government is expected to announce its position in its response to the financial system inquiry, expected within the next month.\nThe Customer Owned Banking Association, which represents mutual banks, credit unions and building societies, recently launched an advertising campaign entitled \"Save Your Savings\" arguing against the tax on the basis it hits smaller banks relatively harder because they receive a larger proportion of their funding from deposits.", "external_links": ["http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ecdf6974-2639-11e5-bd83-71cb60e8f08c.html?siteedition=intl#axzz3fGwDcdEi"], "published": "2015-07-10T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T06:09:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
