Louie Douvis by James Eyers and Clancy Yeates National Australia Bank has created an \"innovation fund\" that plans to invest $50 million over the next three years in Australian and offshore start-ups to enhance the bank's development of customer-centric products and applications.\nNAB Ventures will seek equity investments or partnerships with mobile platforms, payments and data analytics companies and will be run from NAB Labs, an innovation hub established by chief executive Andrew Thorburn earlier in 2015 on the top floor of the bank's office on 700 Bourke Street in Melbourne.\nThis structure is different to Westpac Banking Corp, which seeded a venture capital fund, Reinventure Group, with $50 million earlier in 2014. While Westpac is working with the start-ups Reinventure has invested in, the fund is managed independently.\nOther Australian blue-chips are also creating units to invest in disruptive start-ups. Earlier in 2015, AMP created AMP New Ventures, which is looking for start-up investment opportunities in Australia and overseas. Wesfarmers, and telcos Telstra and Optus all have venture units.\nNAB's head of products and markets Antony Cahill said the new fund would help create an \"end-to-end innovation ecosystem\" in the bank, which has put 15 full-time staff into NAB Labs and has established a digital acceleration program to foster innovation.\n\"We don't fear disruption,\" Mr Cahill said. \"We need to embrace it and understand how do we give the best possible experience to our customers. Traditional models of banking are changing. There are new ideas and thinking identifying how the banking model can change.\n\"We aren't saying [disrupters] are the enemy. We are saying if we can find the right companies to work with, even though they might be approaching the banking model in a different way, if they present new, innovative solutions that give a better experience to customers then we will be talking to them.\"\nNAB is recruiting staff to run the fund, which is expected to start investing in 2016.\n NAB chief Andrew Thorburn said banking was undergoing a digital transformation and NAB Ventures \"will ensure NAB is able to embrace changes to deliver innovative solutions for our customers\" and \"build a culture of innovation and customer-led design within NAB and position the bank to be agile and adaptive to rapidly changing digital advancements\".\nMeanwhile, NAB said on Wednesday it had completed its exit of Great Western Bank in the United States, after selling down the final 28.5 per cent following its partial float in October 2014.\nThe sale of the final tranche will result in a $67 million loss that will be excluded from NAB's cash earnings and will release 34 basis points of common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital, further strengthening its capital ratio. Net proceeds from the full sale of Great Western are about $1.46 billion, a $396 million loss relative to its book value.\nMr Thorburn said the sale would allow NAB to \"continue to refocus on building a stronger core Australian and New Zealand business\" and improve shareholder returns, in line with the strategy he outlined when announced as chief executive in April 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T16:33:34.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
