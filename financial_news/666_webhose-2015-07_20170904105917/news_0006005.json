Both presided over an 80 per cent rise in the share price before being dumped by Tinkler in November 2011 as he prepared to merge Aston with Whitehaven Coal.\nBoth Hannigan and Todd have been members of the BRW Young Rich list over the past five years. Todd was said to have $84 million against his name in 2013 and $36 million in the 2014 list.\nThe pair have worked together on the Tiger investment, which is worth about $3 million combined.\nTiger has had a difficult year; shares in the miner fell from 17¢ in January to below 5¢ in April after the company's flagship Kipoi mine made a loss in the December quarter, stoking fears the company could not repay its debt.\nHowever, much of that debt has been refinanced and obligations for about $US163 million have been pushed back to 2021 and 2023, respectively.\nThe rise of the \"two Todds\" above the 5 per cent significant shareholder status came barely two weeks after the refinancing was completed.\nSpeaking to Fairfax Media on Wednesday, Mr Hannigan said he and Mr Todd believed the stock had become \"very undervalued\" in recent times, and were happy to grow their stakes above 5 per cent after seeing the debt refinanced and a change of strategy over an expansion of the processing facility at Kipoi.\nTiger was originally planning to double the size of the processing plant at Kipoi, but recently decided to undertake cheaper \"debottlenecking\" works, which would increase its capacity by 30 per cent within 15 months at less expense.\nWhen asked about sovereign risk in the DRC, Mr Hannigan said the potential rewards justified the risks.\n\"Clearly, it is high political risk and it typically carries a discount to reflect that. We think the risk and reward is appropriate,\" he said.\nIf predictions for copper prices over the next decade prove true, the plunge by the \"two Todds\" on Tiger should bring handsome rewards.\nDespite falling to five-year lows in early 2015, most pundits expect a copper shortage to emerge between 2017 and 2019 amid growing demand for electronics and heating appliances.\nCopper was fetching $US2.51 per pound on Wednesday. It is forecast to return to at least $US3.50 per pound by 2018.\nTiger is expected to produce 25,000 tonnes of copper cathode in 2015 at an all-in sustaining cost of between $US1.57 per pound and $US1.67 per pound.\nTiger shares closed at 7.8¢ on Tuesday and were marginally higher at 8.1¢ in early trading on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:12:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
