The nation&apos;s budget is \"hostage&apos;&apos; to global iron ore prices, with a $10 drop taking up to A$10 billion from forecast revenue, he said.\nThe global iron ore price has dropped more than $12 in the past month, further exposing Australia&apos;s lack of export alternatives.\n\"Australian governments have been operating on the assumption that, once the mining boom passed, low interest rates and a falling dollar would be enough to bring the non-resource sectors dancing out of their graves,\" Charlton, now director of consultancy AlphaBeta , said in a research report. \"Unfortunately, no such resurrection is occurring.\"\n\"Australia watched idly as the rust-belt manufacturing suburbs around Sydney and Melbourne were transformed from red-brick factories into red-hot real estate,&apos;&apos; he said. \"Even some low-income countries like Nepal, Kenya, and Tanzania have greater export diversity than Australia.&apos;&apos;\nHis analysis again raises the question of what Australia will fall back on as the resources tide recedes. Exports have gone backwards as a proportion of the economy over the last 15 years in almost every non-resources industry, and services are now too small to offset mining.\nHis concerns hark back to problems in 1986, when weak international commodity prices led to a collapse in exports, prompting then-Treasurer Paul Keating to warn Australia risked becoming a \"banana republic\" if it failed to change.\n\"If this government cannot get the adjustment, get manufacturing going again, and keep moderate wage outcomes and a sensible economic policy, then Australia is basically done for,&apos;&apos; Keating said in an interview on radio in 1986, after the nation recorded what was then its biggest current account deficit. \"We will end up being a third-rate economy.&apos;&apos;", "external_links": ["http://www.alphabeta.com/#!our-team/cjg9\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iBdrlJCYX6.Q/v1/460x260.jpg\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iDFygzWLlQl8/v1/460x260.jpg\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iKnUExa5PFpU/v1/460x260.jpg\\"], "published": "2015-07-07T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T05:43:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
