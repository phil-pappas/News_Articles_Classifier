However, the bursting bubble means value is unlikely to factor into thinking in the interim. The repercussions haven't completely played out yet,\" Evan Lucas, market strategist at IG in Melbourne, wrote. \nChina's securities regulator took the drastic step late on Wednedsay of ordering shareholders with stakes of more than 5 percent from selling shares for the next six months in a bid to halt a plunge in stock prices.L3N0ZO5WX \nU.S. shares slid sharply overnight on growing fears that nose-diving Chinese shares could destabilise the world's second- largest economy and have global implications. \nThe doom-and-gloom mood - already heightened earlier in the month by prospects of Greece leaving the euro - benefited the yen, often sought in times of economic uncertainty. \nThe dollar stood little changed at 120.815 yen, within reach of a seven-week low of 120.41 touched overnight when it suffered a bruising 1.5 percent fall. \nThe greenback was weighed down further as U.S. Treasury yields continued falling on flight-to-safety bids and new signs that the Federal Reserve may be hesitant about raising interest rates, as shown by their policy meeting minutes. \nThe dollar's tumble against the yen helped the euro, which climbed to $1.1075 (EUR=), pulling further away from a one-month trough of $1.0916 plumbed on Tuesday. \nCommodities, far from immune to the slide in global equities, remained subdued. U.S. crude (CLc1) nudged up 0.4 percent to $51.86 early on Thursday but has shed nearly nine percent so far this week. \nCopper received a reprieve overnight thanks to the dollar's plunge, but the metal still remained within reach of a six-year low. Copper on the London Metal Exchange was down 0.4 percent at $5,495 a tonne after hitting the six-year trough of $5,240 a tonne on Wednesday. \n(Editing by Kim Coghill)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T04:34:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
