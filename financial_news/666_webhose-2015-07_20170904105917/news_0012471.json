Bloomberg Share on twitter by James Chessell Rio Tinto chief executive Sam Walsh may not have mentioned Fortescue Metals Group or Glencore by name.\nBut the rival mining companies were clearly on his mind as he delivered the speech at the Melbourne Mining Club's annual gathering in London on Wednesday.\nAddressing a 560-strong crowd packed into a marquee next to Lord's cricket ground, Mr Walsh said 2015 had been characterised by \"a lot of commentary, free expert advice, and even some sledging\".\nMr Walsh, who has held the top job at Rio since January 2013, argued it was in Australia's national interest to stick to the principles of open markets at a \"chellenging\" time for many commodities including iron ore, coal and aluminium.\n\"Some have called it a crisis of confidence and talked themselves and others into a gloom,\" he said.\n\"It's been suggested to me there's a direct correlation between your position on the cost curve, and the volume of your opinion. The higher on the curve, the louder you get.\"\nThe Pilbara's two biggest and cheapest producers of iron ore, Rio and BHP Billiton, have been accused in the past six months by Fortescue and Glencore of deliberately distorting the market.\nBy pushing ahead with expansion plans at time when Chinese demand for the key steel-making ingredient is weakening, they been accused of attempting to put smaller rivals out of business.\n Glencore chief executive Ivan Glasenberg in December described the industry's decision to ramp up production as a \"big bet\" that could \"kill\" smaller miners. The Rio board rejected a merger approach by Mr Glasenberg in August last year about a Â£100 billion all-scrip \"merger of equals\" that would have created the largest mining company on the planet.\nFortescue chairman Andrew Forest, whose company produces iron ore at a higher cost than its larger rivals, has been particularly critical of Rio and BHP and even suggested a regulated approach to production would restore prices and boost Australia's budget.\nHowever, the CEOs of the big producers have argued they have a responsibility to shareholders to maximise profitable production and cannot be held responsible for smaller companies with higher costs of production. They argue the gap created by a cut in Pilbara production would be filled by Brazillian producer Vale.\n\"The industry's cycles have caught some unprepared, and others looking for answers. There also seems to be a view that you can talk markets into submission or bend reality to suit your will. Some even question the invisible hand of the market,\" Mr Walsh said.\n\"In times of economic uncertainty, it might sound seductive or comforting to want to put up the barriers, but we must keep markets and trade open.\n\"It's worth remembering in Australia for a quarter of century iron ore exports were banned. Look at the wealth created since that artificial barrier was lifted.\"\nAt an investment conference in May, Mr Glasenberg said miners were suffering from a \"crisis of confidence\" by feeding too much supply into commodity markets.\nMr Walsh, who has previously decribed a merger with Glencore as \"fantasy\", acknowledged the end of the mining boom meant producers needed to be more careful about costs and investment decisions.\nBut he argued population growth in India and Africa as well as cotinued urbanisation in China would create solid long-term demand for commodities such as coal, iron ore and copper.\n\"As an industry, we need to be very careful of the signals we send to our customers, our host governments, and our communities. Talking the industry down risks becoming a negative feedback loop,\" he said.\n\"It feeds public anxiety about our industry's crucial role. It feeds the narrative we are of a previous century, not this century.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jameschessell"], "published": "2015-07-02T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T05:41:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
