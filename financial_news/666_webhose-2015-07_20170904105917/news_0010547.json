During the news conference, Dung had put the value at $1.4 billion over a 20-year period. \nIn a veiled reference to the assertiveness of neighbour China in the South China Sea, Dung said he and Cameron \"share deep concern\" over recent developments that threatened security and freedom of navigation, \"particularly the large-scale land reclamation activities\".
