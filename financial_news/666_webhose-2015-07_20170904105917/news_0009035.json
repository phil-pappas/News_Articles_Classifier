On Friday Brent closed at 54.62 its lowest finish since March 19. \nUS crude for September was down 96 cents at 47.68 a barrel. \nChina is the world's biggest energy consumer. Investors worry that a stock market crash could destabilize the Chinese economy and cut fuel demand. \nGlobal oil supplies are ample with major oil producers in the Middle East Gulf competing for market share and pumping 2-3 percent more oil than needed analysts say. \nOil market speculators have also cut their bets on a longer-term rise in oil prices InterContinental Exchange data showed. Hedge funds and money managers cut their net long positions on Brent futures for the first time in four weeks in the week to July 21. \nIn a further sign of good supply weekly US drilling rig data showed on Friday that 21 oil rigs had been added the highest gain since April 2014. \nIn Iraq exports from its southern oilfields are on course for a monthly record having topped 3 million barrels per day so far this month. \n'In the next couple of months even if the global oversupply and seasonal weakness are becoming priced in it is difficult to see where any price uplift will come from' said Societe Generale oil analyst Michael Wittner. \nInvestors were also looking to the US Federal Reserve for direction this week. The central bank on Tuesday starts a two-day policy meeting which could result in a September interest rate increase that would strengthen the dollar. \n'There is scope for the dollar bulls to be disappointed this week (which) might be a driver for oil prices and the commodities complex overall' said Ben Le Brun market analyst at Sydney's OptionsXpress. \nA weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities including oil cheaper for consumers using other currencies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T09:46:04.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
