Big companies have a tendency to crush you,\" he said, adding that people would tend to favour the version of the European aviation giant, criticising an attitude from Airbus which he said was \"not always very fair play\". \nAn Airbus spokesman said the group \"applauds all exploits that advance electric and hybrid aviation but we are not in the same category.\" \n- Silent, emission-free future - \nAirbus's all-electric E-Fan aircraft, a hit at the 2015 International Paris Air Show, is seen as paving the way for silent, zero-emission planes of the future. \n\"This machine will allow us to deal with the problem of noise, and make steps to control greenhouse gas emissions. These are the two environmental problems of aviation,\" said Patrick Gandil, director general of France's civil aviation authority. \nThe two-seater plane has carried out over 100 test flights since April 2010. It weights 600 kilogrammes (1,322 pounds) , is 6,7 metres (22 feet) long and 9.5 metres wide. \nAccording to Airbus the plane used its on-board lithium-ion battery system for 53 minutes during the crossing to Dunkerque, and 21 percent of its energy was remaining after the flight. \nThe European aerospace giant is planning to commercialise a version of the aircraft, E-Fan 2.0, by 2017. A four-seater version E-Fan 4.0 is planned for 2019. \n\"Within 20 or 30 years we could at least have regional flights with about 60 passengers onboard a hybrid electric propulsion aircraft,\" said Airbus chief Thomas Enders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:07:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
