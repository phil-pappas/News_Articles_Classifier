Peter Bennetts Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Macquarie Group's renovated 50 Martin Place has won the top NSW commercial architecture award for a design that gives the company a good working space and central Sydney a new public space.\nThe JPW-designed renovation that increased the central void of the heritage building and added two floors under a rooftop steel-and-glass dome also won the Colorbond Award for steel architecture and a commendation in the sustainable architecture category.\nThe original 10-storey building, completed in 1928, is overlooked by neighbouring buildings and the new two-level domed roof has created a \"fifth facade\" for the building that gives occupants of surrounding buildings a vastly improved view, while also letting passersby at ground level see in, juror Leone Lorrimer said.\n\"We have this ... beautifully crafted and engineered vision on the top of the building and there are people out on the roof balconies activating it,\" Ms Lorrimer said.\nEnabling a framed outlook over the ocean while guarding privacy: Light House, designed by Peter Stutchbury Architecture, winner of the top NSW architectural award for new houses. Peter Stutchbury In contrast to most building rooftops, covered with plant and equipment, the roof that the banking group let out to other users was a \"tremendous addition\" to the area, Ms Lorrimer said.\n\"It's become a bit of a city asset,\" she said.\nWelcoming to use The win shows the way private developments are increasingly having to accommodate and factor in public users and the needs of a wider community. Macquarie bought the former Government Savings Bank of NSW building – the most expensive building in Australia when it was built – from CBA in 2012. The country's largest 6-star Green Star heritage building is also welcoming to use. Visitors enter at ground level through the preserved original banking chamber and travel up in glass lifts to the reception without going through any visible security measures.\n \"They've managed to achieve all the functionality without that heavy-handed overlay of things like security,\" Ms Lorrimer said.\nThe $110m Westmead Millennium Institute in Sydney's west, designed by BVN, won the state's top award, the Sulman Medal, for successfully bringing research staff together from six sites across the Westmead hospital campus.\nThe new research centre was a flexible and \"even unfinished\" building that would allow it to change over time with different uses and occupants, the jury said.\n\"Generous service zones integrate the huge array of engineering required now and into the future and many of the spaces now set up as offices can become labs as this use expands,\" it said.\nThe top residential award for new houses went to Light House, a family-sized home on the cliffs of Dover Heights on Sydney's South Head, designed by Peter Stutchbury Architecture. The upper level of the two-storey house is shaped like a painter's palette to shelter the exposed structure from the winds that come from different directions. The shape and facade of precast concrete planks and perforated copper sheets also gives the inhabitants views in different directions while guarding their privacy from the surrounding houses.\n\"It's like a shell – an inner and outer shell,\" juror Fergus Scott said. \"Not only does it enable a framed outlook over the ocean, it deals with the privacy issues that come with the proximity of neighbours and filters the sun and attenuates the wind.\n\"The building feels quite private even though the neighbours are close.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-07-02T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:12:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
