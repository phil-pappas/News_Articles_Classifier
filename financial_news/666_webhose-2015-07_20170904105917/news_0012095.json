After the NFL rejected Brady’s appeal of his four-game Deflategate suspension, he filed a lawsuit Wednesday with the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) in Minnesota against the NFL to overturn his four-game suspension. Tom Brady Lawsuit Vs. NFL Lawsuit \nBrady’s legal team is claiming that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell was biased against the football player during his appeal. \n“We’ve long believed that a biased arbitrator was likely to yield a biased result, so I can say that we’re disappointed, but not entirely surprised,” said Jeffrey Kessler, Brady’s lead attorney assisting the NFLPA in the suit, to The Boston Globe . \nMeanwhile, the NFL filed its own preventative suit on Tuesday in New York, reports ESPN. The NFL’s lawsuit is asking a judge to uphold the Tom Brady suspension and force Brady’s lawsuit be brought to court in New York. The U.S. District Court in Minneapolis has a record of ruling favorably for the NFLPA, according The Boston Globe, so the state in which the suit goes to court could have a significant effect on its outcome. \nESPN reported Thursday that the case would be heard in New York. Tom Brady’s Suspension Appeal: No Game Suspensions and a Fine \nThe original Tom Brady suspension handed down by the NFL for his general knowledge of some Patriots staff members’ ball deflation scheme was a four-game suspension, which could cost Brady around $1.8 million in lost game salaries . \nBrady’s counteroffer to the NFL was much lighter. George Atallah, an NFLPA executive, said Brady suggested a penalty that included no game suspensions and a fine that would have likely been much less than what he’d lose from missing four games, reports USA Today. \nWith the NFL and Brady lawsuits both filed, Brady’s salary for the upcoming season will depend on the outcomes of those suits. \nRead: How Dan Marino, Vince Young and Other Broke NFL Players Lost Their Fortunes Tom Brady’s Destroyed Cell Phone Led Goodell to Uphold Suspension \nMore details on Brady’s behavior around Deflategate have continued to come out. The quarterback reportedly ordered that the cell phone he used during the period around Deflategate be destroyed as the NFL investigated the incident in March, according to ESPN. Goodell said in a paper to uphold Brady’s suspension that this destruction of “relevant evidence” affirmed the NFL’s penalties against Brady. \nBut, Brady said in a Facebook post on July 29 that he was simply replacing a broken phone. “To suggest that I destroyed a phone to avoid giving the NFL information it requested is completely wrong,” he wrote. \nBrady also pointed out that his cell phone was destroyed after his lawyers made it clear to the NFL that it would not be included in the evidence Brady was to provide and that he was unaware “that failing to subject my cell phone to investigation would result in ANY discipline.” \nShare This Article Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T23:42:16.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
