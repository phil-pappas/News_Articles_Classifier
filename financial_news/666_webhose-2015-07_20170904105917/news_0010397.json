It could be time to save more. Illustration: Stephen Webster for The Wall Street Journal By 0 COMMENTS \nAmericans are getting some tough news from investment advisers these days: U.S. stocks have risen so fast since the financial crisis that future gains are likely to be weaker. \nThe S&P 500 index, for example, has tripled from its 2009 low, which is great news. Through this year’s first half, however, it was up only 0.20%. \nStocks around the world have gotten so expensive that many professional investors are in a quandary. “If someone dumped a boatload of cash on me and said ‘Put this to work,’ I would have a difficult time putting new money into the stock market,” says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, which oversees $68 billion. Journal Report Four Stock-Options Mistakes \nSo, investors have been looking far afield for big gains. Some individuals are holding their noses and throwing money into unstable countries that promise big rewards along with the big risks. Few money managers would direct clients to any of these places, though, so many pros are chasing returns in Europe, Japan or developing Asia. Others have turned to less common investments, including hedge funds, master limited partnerships or real estate. \nIn the end, though, many money managers and analysts say, investors need to accept a hard truth: Future stock returns will be lower than they have been since 2009. To save enough for retirement, people need to rely less on expectations of double-digit market returns, and set more money aside. \n“Returns will be positive but somewhat lower” on average in coming years, says Lori Heinel, chief portfolio strategist at State Street Global Advisors, in Boston, which oversees $2.4 trillion. Diminishing returns \nMs. Heinel expects a 6% to 9% annual return for the S&P this year, including dividends, but David Kostin, chief U.S. stock strategist at Goldman Sachs , GS -0.55 % says investors should expect less. David Kostin of Goldman Sachs says he is skeptical of moving too much money abroad. Photo: Scott Eells/Bloomberg News \nMr. Kostin recently published a report projecting an average annual return of 5% over the next 10 years, with 46% of that coming from dividends. That is roughly half the 9% historical average return, without adjusting for inflation. Removing the effects of inflation, Mr. Kostin expects 3% a year, compared with 7% historically. \nHe arrives at his forecast by tracking the S&P 500’s price compared with its companies’ average earnings over the preceding 10-year period. He removes one-time write-offs from the financial crisis and other periods. This is similar to a method popularized by Nobel Prize-winning Yale economist Robert Shiller , although Mr. Shiller uses net profits rather than adjusted profits. \nForecasting short-term gains this way doesn’t work well, because stocks can do almost anything in the short run. But looking out over a 10-year period, you can get a more reliable forecast of average gains, Mr. Kostin says. \nRight now, by this measure, the S&P 500 trades at about 23 times average operating earnings for the past 10 years, well above the historical average of 16. When stocks have been this expensive in the past, average returns over the following 10 years tended to group around 5% a year, without adjusting for inflation. Various predictors including the swaps market for dividends indicate that future dividends should represent 46% of that return, almost exactly their share over the past 25 years, Mr. Kostin says. That means annual price gains would average only 2.7%. ENLARGE A dividend oasis \nMr. Kostin doesn’t expect stocks simply to plod ahead at a 2.7% pace (plus 2.3% in dividends). Usually, stocks jump to an unsustainable level, slump and rise again, and ups and downs like that could produce the 5% average annual return. Mr. Kostin recommends a long list of dividend-generating companies that he thinks will be able to keep expanding dividends even in a difficult economy, including stocks such as Cisco Systems Inc., CSCO -0.40 % Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.02 % , Ford Motor Co. F -0.54 % , International Business Machines Corp. IBM -0.22 % , Verizon Communications Inc., VZ -0.34 % Pfizer Inc., PFE -0.36 % International Paper Co. IP -0.60 % , Valero Energy Corp. VLO 0.96 % , Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT 0.37 % and Regions Financial Corp. RF -0.97 % \nSome speculators are chasing returns in shaky places—with dramatic effects. Driven by foreign investments, markets in some of the world’s riskiest economies have been top performers so far this year. \nAmong markets that allow foreigners to invest, the biggest gainer in 2015’s first half was Venezuela, up 233%, even though the autocratic oil producer is in severe economic trouble. Argentina was second, up 36%, despite defaulting on its foreign debt last year. Russia was fifth, ahead 19%, never mind that its economy is sagging under diminished oil prices and U.S. sanctions. \nMost money managers wouldn’t go near this kind of risk. Mr. Kostin, for one, is skeptical of moving too much money abroad because of the cost of hedging currency risks and the overall dangers of overseas markets. \n‘ We have been telling people for four years that they should expect slower economic growth [than before the financial crisis] and lower equity returns. ’ — Henry Herrmann , CEO at Waddell & Reed Financial \n“The return may be modest for the U.S. market relative to history, based on my forecast, but what are the opportunity sets elsewhere?” Mr. Kostin says. \nOthers do recommend shifting some money to more-stable foreign markets. Anwiti Bahuguna, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, which manages $506 billion, examines foreign alternatives closely. Her firm was a big fan of Europe, but pulled back earlier this year because European stocks had risen sharply and the Greek controversy was looming. She remains a proponent of Asia and Japan in particular, but even there, stocks are getting pricey. \nOf 16 major global markets, only two look cheap, with price/earnings ratios below their medians of the past 10 years, based on earnings forecasts for the coming 12 months. Those are Greece and Russia. All the others, including the U.S., Japan, China, France, Germany, Britain and Italy, are expensive, most near their historical extremes. \nIf you look back 20 years, adding in the high P/E ratios from the bubble years of the late 1990s, Japan, China and Korea join Russia and Greece as cheaper than their medians. The rest are still more expensive. \n“I would agree that returns are likely to be lower given where valuations are in the equity market,” Ms. Bahuguna says. “I’m not expecting a very strong return.” \nFor 2015, she says, she anticipates that the S&P 500 will rise 5% to 7%, including dividends. Stocks on the shelf \nInstead of going abroad, many money managers are chasing domestic alternatives to stocks, but those come with their own problems. \nHedge funds have had trouble outgaining the S&P. Master limited partnerships can generate tax issues if you sell them. Real-estate investment trusts are expensive, and physical real estate requires management skills. If the Federal Reserve is right and the U.S. economy is improving, bond yields will rise, meaning bond prices will fall, making bonds a potentially losing investment. \nGiven all that, some experts have a simple piece of advice: Save more. The logic is simple. If your investments are going to be growing more slowly, the only way to reach your goal is to put more money in the pot. \nHenry Herrmann, chief executive officer at Waddell & Reed Financial Inc., WDR -0.62 % which oversees $124 billion in Overland Park, Kan., says, “We have been telling people for four years that they should expect slower economic growth [than before the financial crisis] and lower equity returns.” \nMr. Browning is a Wall Street Journal staff reporter.
