In its early days, the only model available for equity crowdfunding investors was the company-led model whereby companies dictated the investment terms, often unfairly in their favour to the detriment of online investors . A plethora of the early platforms still operate along the same lines but in the past 18 to 24 months the space has been taken by storm by sophisticated platforms taking an investor-led approach. Investor-led platforms allow individual online investors to co-invest with business angels, family offices, venture capitalists and other professional investors. This approach is a game-changer for the industry; now operations cater for sophisticated individual investors to co-invest in the deals the professionals also want to invest in.\nThe first obvious impact is the sectors that are attracting funding. Crowdfunding used to comprise almost exclusively of lifestyle businesses, restaurants and consumer-oriented businesses. This has changed dramatically with the arrival of investor-led platforms. SyndicateRoom, one of the leading platforms in the United Kingdom , reports that a third of the deals funded via the platform have been in life sciences with another 25% in engineering and 25% in business-to-business – all sectors that were previously absent from crowdfunding.\nThe impact the investor-led approach has had so far in the industry is, by any measure, astonishing. Interestingly, a similar disparity in growth is observed on both sides of the Atlantic. SyndicateRoom has helped companies raise over £20m in its first 18 months alone, many times the amount raised in the comparable period by company-led platforms. A similar trend is observed in the United States: according to three leading researchers from MIT, Sloan School of Management and University of Toronto (Agrawal, Catalini and Goldfarb) AngelList investor-led syndicated deals have raised over 5 times more than company-led non-syndicated deals in the same period of time – “ Are Syndicates the killer-app of crowdfunding ”.\nAs crowdfunding grows up and muscles in, the early stage finance industry will have to adjust and adapt. Early stage venture capitalists are likely to move into later deals but will have a larger number of deals to choose from thanks to crowdfunding. Fund managers and individual investors will be able to diversify their portfolio across all levels – geography, sectors and networks of contacts (i.e. lead investors) – and companies will benefit from the larger pool of capital available to finance their growth across all stages of the curve.\nThe investor-led model also makes crowdfunding a collaborative and complementary part of the early stage finance industry. Instead of competing with business angels and venture capitalists, the platforms are collaborating with them, leveraging the capital of the professionals whilst giving online investors access to professional grade investments that they would otherwise struggle to access.\nThe trends observed show:\n- Greater number of investors and amount being invested in the investor-led model;\n- Larger number of companies available on the company-led model.\nThis is not surprising considering that company-led platforms tend to offer better terms for companies and investor-led platforms tend to offer better terms for investors . Only time will tell which model will outgrow the other, but early signs show that the investor-led model will soon be leading the way.\nGonçalo de Vasconcelos is the CEO of leading equity crowdfunding platform SyndicateRoom that gives its members access to the top deals Business Angels and leading VCs invest in.\nGet The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["https://www.syndicateroom.com/", "http://www.catalini.com/research/2015/2/25/are-syndicates-the-killer-app-of-equity-crowdfunding", "https://twitter.com/goncalotv", "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5f7ce680-038c-11e5-b55e-00144feabdc0.html"], "published": "2015-07-06T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T20:43:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
