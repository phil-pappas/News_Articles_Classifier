Supervalu Inc. has been getting smaller in recent years, selling its Albertson’s, Jewel-Osco and other chains. \nRival chains have been combining. Last month, the owner of Stop & Shop and Giant stores said it will merge with the parent company of Food Lion to operate 6,500 stores around the world. And discounter Dollar Tree completed its deal to buy Family Dollar earlier this month, bringing its store count to about 13,000. \nSave-A-Lot has more than 1,300 stores around the country, selling fresh meat, vegetables and other groceries. The company has plans to open 100 new Save-A-Lot stores by early next year, some in new markets. It will open its first Las Vegas store later this summer. Supervalu said it doesn’t have a timeline for when the Save-A-Lot separation may happen. \n“Save-A-Lot is a business with great growth prospects,” said Supervalu CEO Sam Duncan in a conference call Tuesday, adding that the new stores will help it compete with other discount retailers. \nBased in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, Supervalu distributes grocery items to nearly 3,600 stores and also operates the Cub Foods, Shop ‘N Save and Hornbacher’s chains. \nSupervalu shares rose $1.17, or 15.9 percent, to $8.53. Its shares are down about 9.3 percent in the last 12 months.
