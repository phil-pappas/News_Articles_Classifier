This decision will now be reviewed in order to confirm that there is no impact on the connectivity commitments agreed with IAG.\" \nAdding Aer Lingus to its portfolio of airlines - British Airways, Iberia and Spanish budget carrier Vueling - opens a new avenue of growth for IAG, allowing it to expand capacity on lucrative transatlantic routes by using Dublin Airport.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T02:07:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
