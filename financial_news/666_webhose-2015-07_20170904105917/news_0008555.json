Photo: Bloomberg\nThe Australian sharemarket recovered from a slow start to the week's trading, led by BHP whose share price neared multi-year lows before recovering despite persistently weaker commodities prices.\nThe S&P/ASX 200 added 23 points or 0.4 per cent to close at the day's high of 5589.9, snapping a three-day losing streak, while the broader All Ordinaries Index climbed 22 points or 0.4 per cent to 5579.2.\nThe local market closed before a sudden sell-off on Chinese sharemarkets sparked one of the biggest plunges of the year, pulling the Shanghai Composite Index down 8.5 per cent to 3725.6 points, the biggest one-day fall since 2007. The fall came after Beijing earlier this month took unprecedented steps to stop a rout in equities, which had stabilised the market until Monday.\nThe ASX had opened sharply lower on a weak lead from Wall Street, hitting an intraday bottom of 5538.4 early, after heavyweight miner BHP Billiton's share price fell below $25 to hover near six-year lows. But BHP's share price rebounded strongly in the afternoon session, leading the index to close in the black.\n\"This is the first day where the market has closed above where it opened since last Tuesday,\" CMC chief market analyst Ric Spooner said.\nBut the market overall was still in a downward trend, which is characterised by chartists as recording lower lows and lower highs, he said.\nMiners drive gyrations The miners were the drivers of Monday's ASX market gyrations. BHP Billiton rose 1 per cent to $25.52 and Rio Tinto ended the day flat, down 0.02 per cent to $51.19, while Fortescue Metals Group climbed 3 per cent, despite iron ore prices shedding 0.6 per cent over the weekend.\n\"BHP turned a corner during the day, we also saw a little bit of a bounce in the gold stocks, including Newcrest, which has been under significant pressure,\" Morgans senior private client adviser Bill Chatterton said.\nThe gold miners, including Newcrest, Northern Star Resources and Evolution Mining were the day's best-performing stocks, with Northern Star leading the gains, adding 7.3 per cent; Newcrest rose 4.5 per cent to $11.78.\nMr Spooner attributed the mining stocks' turnaround to a spot of bargain hunting.\nBut fellow miner Atlas Iron's share price plunged 70 per cent to 3.6 cents after returning to trading following a 16-week halt as iron ore prices collapsed.\nThe banks were mixed, with Commonwealth Bank and Westpac both up 0.3 per cent, while ANZ Banking Group recorded a 0.2 per cent gain. National Australia Bank ended the session flat.\nSoft launch to reporting season Woolworths and Wesfarmers also ended the session flat, down 0.07 per cent and up 0.02 per cent respectively. Meanwhile, Telstra rose 0.5 per cent to $6.39.\nEducation provider Navitas was among the first companies to kick off in a soft launch of reporting season. Its results came in line with expectation, but still disappointed shareholders, which led the stock to a 6.3 per cent fall to $4.27.\n\"The current overall mood of the market is one where disappointing results may be more harshly treated, the market is generally cautious of the revenue outlook, cautious of the economic outlook and likely to take a safety-first approach with companies that appear to have underlying issues,\" Mr Spooner said.\nThe strongest performing sector for the day was utilities, up 0.7 per cent, followed by financials up 0.6 per cent.\nInvestors are bracing for more guidance from the US Federal Reserve on the timing of raising interest rates after the Federal Open Markets Committee meets on Wednesday.\n\"That is one of the key events on this week's calendar, with the potential for things to go either way,\" Mr Spooner said.\n\"There's a general expectation the Fed is going to begin moving interest rates in the second half of this year, but unless they really say anything that upsets that view, there may not be too much reaction,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T06:53:50.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
