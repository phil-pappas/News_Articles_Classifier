They can rupture and spill petrol, causing a fire. \nAt least 75 people have died in crash-related fires, although Fiat Chrysler maintains they are as safe as comparable vehicles from the same era. \nBoth the Jeep and Ram measures are part of a larger settlement between the government and the carmaker over allegations of misconduct in 23 recalls covering more than 11 million vehicles. \nBesides the civil penalty, which was reported Saturday by The Associated Press, Fiat Chrysler agreed to an independent recall monitor and strict federal. \nIt's unclear just how many Rams the carmaker will have to repurchase, but the cash outlay could be substantial. \nAccording to a trade book, a 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 - one of the smaller, less-expensive trucks involved in the recalls - could fetch $US20,000 in a dealer trade-in, assuming the truck has 96,000 kilometres on it and is in \"good\" condition. \nAt that rate, if Chrysler had to buy back even a quarter of the trucks at issue, it could spend $US2.5 billion. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Fiat Chrysler must offer 500,000 buy-backs AAP \nFiat Chrysler must offer to buy back from customers more than 500,000 Ram pickup trucks and other vehicles in the â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T06:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T06:25:47.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
