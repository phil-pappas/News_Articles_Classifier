(is) no longer possible,\" said Eric Gross, a credit strategist at Barclays.\nThey point to events like the wild swings in bond prices last fall, the difficulty of executing large trades and other factors as evidence that the market is not as deep and smoothly functioning as before the financial crisis.\nFed officials acknowledge the anecdotal evidence to that effect and agree it could cause trouble in times of financial stress if investors cannot freely buy and sell safe haven securities at other than fire-sale prices.\nBut they also note alternative explanations - that investors have changed their preferences or that more large pension funds and other institutional players are holding their inventories of bonds and decreasing the supply that is for sale.\nBrainard said it may all be part of a \"transitional\" phase as banks, investors and other institutions become accustomed to a market that may function differently than it did in the past but would, on the whole, be safer and more stable. Powell last week said a new \"equilibrium\" was likely emerging, and \"it is not obvious to me that it is a worse equilibrium than we had.\"\nBut Gross at Barclays said that the transition was not without difficulties for fund managers, who each had to have their own plans to manage their daily positions.
