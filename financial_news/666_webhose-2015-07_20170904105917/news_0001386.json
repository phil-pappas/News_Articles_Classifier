St Vincent de Paul chief executive John Falzon said the government needed to act quickly to implement a jobs plan for young people. \"Australia's rate of youth unemployment remains unconscionably high,\" he said. \"The labour market is unequipped to get youth into jobs and a national approach is needed.\" CommSec economist Savanth Sebastian said above-trend economic growth was needed to significantly reduce unemployment among 15 to 24 year olds. \"We've got an environment where young people are not able to find a permanent place in the workforce,\" he said. The youth unemployment rate was as high as 14.4 per cent in November 2014.
