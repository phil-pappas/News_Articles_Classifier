Doing It for Car Insurance May Put Money in Your Pocket Written by: Valerie Young 07/27/15 - 7:37 AM EDT Tickers in this article: ALLTST BRK.A \nNEW YORK (TheStreet) -- When was the last time you looked at your car insurance policy? Better yet, when was the last time you checked to see if you could get a cheaper rate? \nUnless you just bought a new car, got married, moved to another state, or added one of your children to your policy, chances are it's been more than 12 years, according to a recent survey by Princeton Survey Research Associates International for insuranceQuotes.com . \nDamian Callender, 34, whose first car was insured through Allstate with his dad, said he stayed with the company for years. He didn't switch until he bought his second car, when he decided to look around for a better rate.

After shopping around, though, he found he could pay less for what he wanted at Geico, a subsidiary of Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway . That's not the case for everyone: Buffett himself has said that Geico offers the best rate only about 40% of the time. \n\"With insurance I feel like its the cheapest one that you can get and make sure it covers the entire car,\" said Callender, who sold his car when he moved to New York City. \nIf you're not ready to sell yours, you can probably still save money on auto insurance just by shopping around. \nIt's something almost 36% of drivers never do, according to the survey, which identified millennials and senior citizens as the least likely to examine their policies. Another 30% of drivers said they usually wait a few years before seeking new rates, making for a total of about 66% of Americans who never or rarely bargain-shop for their insurance. \nThe three main reasons are automatic deductions and policy renewals, procrastination, and confusion about when you can switch, said Laura Adams, a senior analyst for insuranceQuotes.com, which offers free rate checks . \n\"I was really surprised by how many people mistakenly believe that you have to wait until your policy actually expires or the renewal date comes up until you can shop,\" said Adams. \"There's a lot of confusion out there about whether it's beneficial to shop and even if there are any negative consequences.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T14:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T15:56:46.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
