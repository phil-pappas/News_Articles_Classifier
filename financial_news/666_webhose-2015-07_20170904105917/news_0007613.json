Impeachment would require proof, none of which exists so far, that she committed crimes or other wrongdoing, particularly with regards to a bribery scandal involving state-run energy company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras.\nBut the mere notion of political instability illustrates how far Brazil has fallen from its zenith just five years ago. Back then, as Rousseff rode the coattails of her predecessor into office, Brazil was aloft a commodities boom and considered a star among developing nations, posting annual economic growth of 7.5 percent even as the developed world staggered.\nNow, Brazil's economy is likely in recession, unemployment is climbing and inflation is galloping at nearly 9 percent, or double the official target rate, eroding purchasing power for the working-class most buoyed by the boom.\nMeanwhile, the Petrobras scandal edges uncomfortably close to top aides, a federal auditor may soon reject the government's 2014 bookkeeping and her approval ratings have plummeted to single digits, lower than any president in a quarter century.\nOn Tuesday, the Eurasia Group, a consultancy, raised the probability of Rousseff leaving office early from 20 percent to 30 percent.\n\"There is political risk beyond what anyone expected,\" said Neil Shearing, senior economist at Capital Economics in London. \"It's not good for anyone trying to make investments or plans.\"\nRousseff remains defiant amid the criticism and even recent rumors that suggested she attempted suicide, a claim she vigorously denied. \"Don't bet on that, people,\" she said in an interview published Tuesday in the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper.\n\"I will not fall,\" she told the paper, calling talk of her exit as \"golpista,\" or putschist.\nStill, even members of her ruling Workers' Party are rebelling.\nThe leftist party opposes her ongoing efforts to impose austerity measures, seen by most economists as essential after a prior term of bloated budgets and interventionist policies. Some party legislators have even voted to increase spending.\nFormer President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the party's biggest star and a possible candidate in 2018, has increasingly distanced himself from Rousseff, whom he plucked from obscurity and named the party standard bearer when he faced a constitutional term limit. Recently, he compared Rousseff's standing to near-empty reservoirs of drought-plagued São Paulo.\nA second term was not supposed to go like this.\nThough Brazil's economy stagnated soon after Rousseff began her first term, she retained enough blue-collar support to clinch re-election last October. Campaigning on a promise to expand social welfare programs, she vowed to improve education, health and other precarious services.\nBecause of the eroding economy, though, she changed course soon after, scrambling for ways to slash spending. Not only would few new investments be made, but some social programs, like a student loan mechanism, lost funding.\n\"It was really damaging to the base,\" says one official who managed Rousseff's response to a student backlash.\nSupport in Congress collapsed, too.\nIn February, the lower house elected Eduardo Cunha, an Evangelical Congressman, to head the chamber, with twice as many votes as those cast for Rousseff's candidate. Although Cunha's party in theory is allied with Rousseff, he has slowed her legislative agenda and recently said she was so weak that Brazil should switch to a parliamentary system.\nFew are as emboldened as the centrist Social Democracy party, which last weekend re-elected as its leader Aécio Neves, the senator Rousseff defeated last October. The administration, Neves told reporters, was headed toward an \"an interruption.\"\nHis party, Neves said, is ready to govern.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T14:08:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
