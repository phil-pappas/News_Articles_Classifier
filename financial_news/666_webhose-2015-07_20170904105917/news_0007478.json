The company raised the low end of its previous guidance by 5 cents per share. \nAdjusted earnings of $1.41 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36 by 3.7% and also increased 6% from the year-ago figure of $1.33 per share. Year over year, earnings were boosted by organic sales growth, cost savings, input cost deflation, margin improvements and lower share count owing to share buybacks. However, earnings were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate effects and higher other expenses. Kimberly-Clark Corporation - Earnings Surprise | FindTheBest \n\nQuarter in Detail \nThe company reported sales of $4.643 billion in the second quarter. Though sales slightly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.625 billion, it declined 6% from the prior-year quarter due to foreign currency headwinds. \nExcluding the aforementioned headwinds, organic sales grew 4% from the prior-year quarter, driven by 3% volume gains and 1% improvement in product mix. \nAdjusted operating profit in 2015 (excluding charges for pension settlements, organization restructuring costs, restructuring costs for European strategic changes) grew 1.7% to $790 million in the second quarter. This reflects an increase in organic sales, $105 million of cost savings from the FORCE (Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere) program and $20 million of savings from the organization restructuring announced in 2014. Input costs also decreased $40 million in the quarter. However, currency fluctuations reduced adjusted operating profit by $80 million. The company noted that the currency impacts were most significant in Latin America and Eastern Europe. \nSegment Details \nPersonal Care Products: The segment includes products like disposable diapers, training/ youth/swim pants; baby wipes; feminine and incontinence care products. \nSales decreased 6% on a year-over-year basis to $2.3 billion in the quarter due to unfavorable currency impact. However, volumes increased 3% and net selling prices and product mix each improved 1%. Sales declined in North America, developed markets outside North America and developing and emerging markets. \nSegment operating profit increased 4% to $473 million in the quarter, benefiting from organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input costs, partially offset by unfavorable currency rates. \nConsumer Tissue: The segment includes bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins and related products for household use. \nSegment sales declined 8% to $1.5 billion in the second quarter due to unfavorable currencies and lower selling prices, which offset the impact of higher volumes. While sales in North America were flat, other two developed markets outside North America and developing and emerging markets declined in the quarter. \nSegment operating profit increased 8% to $260 million owing to benefits of cost savings, reduced manufacturing costs and lower marketing, research and general expenses, partially offset by unfavorable currencies and lower net selling prices. \nK-C Professional (KCP) & Other: The segment consists of facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins, wipers and a range of safety products. \nSegment sales declined 4% on a year-over-year basis to $0.8 billion in the second quarter of 2015 due to unfavorable currency and lower selling prices, offset by positive sales volumes and product/mix. While sales in North America increased 1%, other two developed markets outside North America and developing and emerging markets declined in the quarter. \nUnfavorable currency effects led to a decline of 5% in segment operating profit to $145 million, which overshadowed the gains from organic sales, cost savings and lower input costs. \nOrganization Restructuring in 2014 \nIn Oct 2014, the company initiated a restructuring program in order to improve organization efficiency, improve its underlying profitability, increase the company's flexibility to invest in targeted growth initiatives and offset overhead costs stemming from the spin-off of the company's health care business. \nThe restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, with total costs anticipated to be $130 million to $160 million after tax. It will result in cumulative pre-tax savings in the range of $120 million to $140 million by the end of 2017. \nDuring the second quarter of 2015, restructuring costs were $8 million after tax while savings amounted to $20 million. \nGuidance for 2015 \nThe company has updated its 2015 earnings guidance. Adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to be $5.65 to $5.80 compared with the company's previous guidance of $5.60 to $5.80. This is up 2.5% to 5% from adjusted earnings per share of $5.51 in 2014. \nForeign currency exchange will negatively impact sales by 9% to 10% and operating profit by 10% to 11%. \nDuring the fourth quarter 2014 conference call, the company had stated that it expects adjusted operating profit to grow in the range of 1% to 4% in 2015. Cost savings of at least $300 million are expected from the company's FORCE program, whereas savings of $60 million to $80 million are expected to come from the 2014 organization restructuring initiative. \nKimberly-Clark has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). \nBetter-ranked stocks in the consumer staples sector include Dean Foods Company DF, Reynolds American Inc.
