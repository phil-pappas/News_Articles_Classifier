More than half a million of the vehicles subject to buybacks have faulty suspension parts that can cause a loss of control.\nFiat Chrysler's U.S. unit FCA US LLC, formerly Chrysler Group LLC, said it accepted the consequences of the agreement with \"renewed resolve to improve our handling of recalls and re-establish the trust our customers place in us.\"\nThe fines include a $70 million cash payment, an agreement that Fiat Chrysler will spend $20 million improving its recall process and an additional $15 million payable if the automaker is found to have committed any further violations.\nThe two sides have been engaged in discussions since NHTSA held a July 2 public hearing on Fiat Chrysler's recall performance. At the proceedings, NHTSA staff cataloged alleged failures in 23 separate recalls including what they termed misleading behavior, while an FCA executive pledged to work with the agency to improve the automaker's recall programs.\nFiat Chrysler has had a contentious relationship with NHTSA for years, pushing back on the agency's efforts to secure recalls and threatening lawsuits to avoid mandatory action, according to former auto regulators.\nFiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne told reporters this month that the company needs to change the way it deals with regulators going forward.\n\"We are intent on rebuilding our relationship with NHTSA,\" the automaker said on Sunday.
