Other attacks include email spamming targeting both banks' websites and customers' emails with intent to slow the websites and steal customer financial data. \nEasy Solutions, which presented these findings at a one-day e-payment anti-fraud forum organised by Winigroup Ltd in Lagos last Wednesday for chief information officers (CIOs) of banks and CBN officials, also showed that the banks are under constant cyber defacement attacks. \nDirector, Banking and Payments System, CBN, Mr Dipo Fatokun, noted that the new development was a threat to the stability of the banking industry and said that to battle the upsurge of e-fraud, CBN would work with relevant stakeholders to establish an industry security operations centre and a risk information centre in order to reduce e-payments frauds and enhance trust in the payments system. \nIn February this year, Deloitte said phishing and insider threats will con-tinue to be biggest cyber threat sources in Nigeria, especially as crude oil prices continue to fall. \nIn May, the Nigerian Interbank Settlement System (NIBSS) ePayment Fraud Landscape Report stated that there was 85 per cent success in fraud attempts. It also noted that automated teller machines (ATMs) had most fraudulent transactions while Internet banking fraud loss was put at N3.2 billion within the last one year. \nInternational director, Easy Solutions, Mr Jeremy Boorer, said: \"We looked at 17 Nigerian banks 10 days ago for signs of fake mobile apps. In 15 of them, we found the following: The first to 10th banks checked were found with 13, 10, 17, eight, 11, eight, nine, 13, seven and 20 fake mo-bile apps respectively. The 11th to 15th banks were also found with 11, 14, 13, 16 and 15 fake mobile apps.' \nHe warned bank customers that app stores were full of fake apps claiming to come from banks, saying once a customer downloads and enters finan-cial information, including credit/debit cards details and personal identity numbers (PIN), his/her money is gone as the fraudster will clone the cards or transfer the money through online banking immediately. \n\"In the last four weeks, we discovered that hundreds of defacement at-tacks are going on Nigerian banks by hackers. It highlights the fact that the websites are not totally secure. Email is still the primary attack chan-nel. They pretend to be customers of the banks to contact the bank. E-fraud is initiated through account takeover, new account and true per-son/mule.\" \nBoorer said all channel fraud happens in one of the above fraud types through malware, phishing, social engineering, account opening process gaps (KYC/CIP). \nAccording to him, \"Social media seems to be a concern as banks create social media accounts and ask prospective customers to open bank ac-counts on social media. \n\"Fake banks are springing up on the social media and the data that are used to open such accounts, you don't know where it ends. There are fi-nancial motivations to trick people to create social media accounts to steal financial/credit information which are sold in the dark internet mar-ket for as low as $10 by competing dark internet hacker sites.\" \nWe've Put Measures In Place To Tackle The Menace - CBN \nFatokun, who was represented by Mrs Margaret Ogundana, head, Bank-ing and Payment System, CBN, said the apex bank was not just advocat-ing e-payments but doing all it could to ensure that users' funds are well protected as they embrace e-payment. \n\"CBN has, therefore, been a champion for the fight against e-fraud in Ni-geria. Several initiatives, directives and fora of this nature had been at the forefront of our activities at CBN,\" he said, noting that the apex bank in 2010 introduced EMV cards policy which reduced the card fraud to the barest minimum. \n\"Then, upward increase in fraud incidences became alarming in 2014. Reports from Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System Plc (NIBSS) indicat-ed that 1,461 cases of electronic fraud were recorded in that year, which was a significant increase from the previous year's figure. \n\"In response, CBN mandated all DMBs to comply with the provisions of section 3.2 and 3.4 of the Standards and Guidelines of ATM Operations in Nigeria, by installing anti-skimming devices on their ATMs. We have a policy that restricts banks from approving international card transac-tions unless the customer has informed his/her bank. As at today, almost all the banks have installed hard and soft anti-skimming measures on ATMs in the country.\" \nAccording to Fakokun, CBN has issued a number of directives to banks towards strengthening the controls and processes for managing fraud. These include the two-factor authentication implementation for internal banking processes, PCIDSS certification and the review of operations of instant payments system within the country. \n\"We are not unaware that the fraudsters have become well organised and seem to always be ahead of the curve in compromising implemented con-trols, hence we are committed to continuously improving the payments landscape to respond effectively to new threats\", he said, adding that CBN had partnered with NIBSS to procure and install an industry anti-fraud solution. \n\"The solution is an industry fraud monitoring tool that ensures behav-ioural monitoring, patterns and hold/block controls on transaction sus-pected to be fraudulent. In the same vein, CBN also directed all stake-holders to establish and maintain dedicated Fraud Desks in their respec-tive organisations. This was aimed at providing an avenue for exchange of information and coordination of industry response to fraud attempts and incidents,\" he stated. \nMeanwhile, former deputy governor, CBN, Mr Tunde Lemo, in his re-marks at the forum, called on the apex bank and commercial banks to cre-ate a secured environment, deploy brand and fraud intelligence as well as safe browsing and device analytics, as well as have a forum to equip themselves with information and technologies to be a step ahead of cy-bercriminals. \nHe said: \"Today's gathering to me is very important. We cannot allow the fraudsters to have their way. Total fraud protection is very important. I recall that fraud incidence on magnetic stripe was as much as 90 per cent until we introduced chip and pin. We can only fight fraud if we work to-gether. Unless we have a forum for cross-fertilisation of ideas, we may not know what the other guys are doing. \n\"We will not roll back e-payment because of fears and frauds. We have got to proffer solutions. My take is that CBN should immediately galva-nise banks to get better solutions to deter e-frauds. Secondly, banks should invest in technology. They are making a lot of money, so they should protect the source of the money. Thirdly, we must also get the banks to take up consumer protection. \n\"It is bad for a customer e-fraud case to take up to six months to be re-solved and get his money back. If the situation is not arrested, it will lead the de-marketing of e-payment and the particular bank\", said Lemo. \nOn his part, Mr. Tim Akano, vice chairman, Winigroup, convener of the anti-fraud forum, warned that fraudsters were using Bank Verification Number (BVN) policy and other means to dupe bank customers. He wel-comed CBN's collaboration with experts within and outside the banking industry as well as law enforcement agencies under the Nigeria Electronic Fraud Forum (NeFF) to take advantage of new ideas, including the ones expressed at the forum. \nGlobally, email fraud has led to 100 billion spams per day, $2 billion in phishing losses/year while good attacks are 45 per cent effective. The losses to the financial system include brand erosion, untrusted email channel and lack of email visibility. The key to email trust is finding out who is sending illegitimate email in your name and removing them. \nThe Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) describes phishing as a criminal mechanism employing both social engineering and technical subterfuge to steal consumers' personal identity data and financial ac-count credentials. \nAPWG e-Crime Report 2014 found that unique phishing attacks in fourth quarter 2014 was 197,252, up 18 per cent year-on-year with 45.9 per cent targeting financial systems and payment, while 6.43 per cent were on social media. \nAPWG discovered 27,253 maliciously registered domains in second half 2014, that is, 20 per cent increase over first half while half of all phishing attacks stay active for more than 10 hours. It said 255,000 unique mal-ware variants are found every day, 3,072 attacks in second half of 2014 used short URLs account (doubling first half). Tiny URLs accounted for about 50 per cent attacks.
