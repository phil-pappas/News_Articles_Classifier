All five restaurants, listed in notices by the corporate watchdog the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) remain open. Hooters Australia and the four other companies responsible for its restaurants are registered to the same suburb in western Sydney. The US \"breastraunt\" chain well known for its deep fried sports bar offerings and waitresses of certain physical proportions opened its first Australian restaurant in 2006. Hooters expanded from three restaurants in western Sydney to two more in Queensland with a Townsville location opening May 2015. Job advertisements for the Gold Coast location which opened last July stipulated Hooters Girls must be 18 years old while offering \"great tips... contests, promotional modelling opportunities\". The stores until recently, continued running promotions with the Parramatta store encouraging customers to \"get mum out of the kitchen and down to mothers day\", offering mothers free meals. Hooter's locations in Australia have faced several setbacks including a fire which destroyed the Mermaid Beach restaurant, a lawsuit over slushie machines and most recently accusations from former employees that the franchises failed to pay superannuation.
