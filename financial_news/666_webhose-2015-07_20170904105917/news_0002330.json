Edwina Pickles Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Ky Chow One of the perils of being a gadget reviewer is that you can become a little bit too obsessed with fancy hardware when an app can do the job. It's easy to drool over ever improving models of wearable fitness trackers Fitbits and Jawbones — which now boast heart rate monitors, sleep tracking and galvanic skin sensors, but it's what else we drool over that we often forget — namely food. While fitness bands and pods encourage us to get off our office chairs and out on a run, none of them made me drop eight kilos as the MyFitnessPal app did after just a few months.\nMany of us already have a general but slightly suppressed understanding that our toil at the gym burns a depressingly low amount of calories, but without those facts constantly in our face, we still hope weekly boot camps and spin sessions will shrink our waistlines while our decadent Western eating habits stay unchanged.\nMyFitnessPal (iOS, Android, Windows and a very slow version in Blackberry's Amazon store) is a well thought out, enormously popular calorie counter app that blows this fantasy away with brutally specific numbers throughout your day.\nIt's simple to set up: enter your current and target weights, and how quickly you want to get there. The app then gives you a daily calorie (or kilojoule) limit so you can hit the target. The accountability of hard numbers on a device that I always had on me changed my habits almost overnight. To stay below my 6,700kJ daily limit required to drop four kilograms I found myself bypassing my once automatic mid afternoon \"Time Out (Cadbury), 32g, 732kJ\". If I enjoyed \"Eggs Benedict with Ham - Coffee Club, 3,908 kJ\" on a Saturday morning, I'd get a light lunch and pass on entrees at dinner that night. I had a specific numerical target, and I wanted to hit it.\nMyFitnessPal celebrates your accomplishments, but it also politely reprimands you when you trip up. Adding meal or snack entries was a cinch, with over 5 million listed food items from the crowd sourced global database (my first contribution was Coles' DIY kit for 12 mini burgers. Don't judge me). While there are some uncommon dishes that aren't on there, you can almost always punch something in, though I'm sure Anna Polyviou would weep knowing during a special birthday dinner that I'd reduced a slice of her award winning, 35-step, MasterChef featured carrot cake masterpiece to \"Carrot cake - Walmart Bakery\".\nMyFitnessPal celebrates your accomplishments as do activity tracker apps, but it also politely reprimands you when you trip up. Each night, MyFitnessPal informs you \"if every day was like today...you'd weigh xx kg in five weeks\". No judgment, but hard to ignore. For individual food entries, you may be applauded by a little coloured bubble comment if it's high in nutrients. Punch in \"Double whopper, no cheese, 3,766 kJ\" and a cheerful bubble mentions \"Your fat goal for today is 72 grams, and this has 56 grams\". The app doesn't do this for every item, realising that over nagging can be counterproductive. The developers must be either great managers or parents.\nExercise obviously makes a difference and punching in workouts gives you more calories to \"spend\". You can sync MyFitnessPal with other fitness apps and trackers, although not all sync as hoped. Steps measured on my Fitbit Charge HR showed up, as did bike rides with Endomondo (owned by athletic clothing giant Under Armour, as is MyFitnesspal). Strava and Apple Health, however, didn't send anything to the MyFitnessPal diary despite being connected.\nSuch quibbles are forgivable as long as you focus on the most compelling data: your weight progress chart. While weight can fluctuate daily, punching it in every morning produces both a numerical and graphical running total of kilos lost. Surprised after I actually hit my first 4kg weight loss target, I then started another five-week session and hit that too. Of course, as they say in the ads, your results may vary. With results like this, however, while I still love fitness trackers for encouraging more activity, the free MyFitnessPal app seems a must for anyone serious about shedding the excesses of the foodie lifestyle.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/kybusiness", "https://www.myfitnesspal.com/", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/106721669287068280637"], "published": "2015-07-10T13:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:06:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
