Ryan Osland Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Tim Dodd The news gets worse for graduates wanting to get a good job after finishing their university degree.\nContinuing the trend of recent years, in 2014 graduate starting salaries reached the lowest point, relative to male average weekly earnings, since the early 1980s.\nAnd at the same time the graduate unemployment rate – measured four months after graduation – reached the highest level in that period.\nAs the accompanying graph shows, these figures are part of a long-term trend. Although graduate salaries and the graduate unemployment rate do move around as economic conditions wax and wane, there is a solid trend in both measures that is bad news for graduates.\nAFR graphic The figures were released last week by Graduate Careers Australia, which compiles them from a survey of 113,000 graduates who are contacted through their education institution.\nWhat makes the figures particularly worrying is that the poor outlook for graduates goes across all the major disciplines .\nOne reason graduates are not enjoying as much of an advantage in the job market as before is that today there are many more graduates than there used to be.\nIt's unrealistic to expect that with nearly 40 per cent of young people getting a bachelor degree now they will all enjoy the same career advantages that a much smaller proportion of graduates enjoyed 30 years ago. One of the problems for today's graduates is that the pool of people enjoying high salaries has not expanded fast enough to accommodate the larger number of people with degrees.\n Not as clear cut One inescapable conclusion is that the decision for young people about whether to go to university is not as clear cut as it used be. Once it gave clear advantages in future jobs and earnings. Now, with a much higher proportion of graduates in the workforce, the advantage is less clear.\nThat's not to say that university confers no advantage. Analysis by Andrew Norton , of the Grattan Institute, in 2012 showed that graduates from most courses still gained significant financial benefits over their lifetime from their study – much more than it cost them in HECS loan payments.\nBut the level of advantage depends on the courses students study. Obviously degrees such as teaching and nursing, and those that lead to careers in the arts or community work, are much less lucrative than others.\nAnother thing for future students to think about is that the cost of a university degree is likely to rise, which will cut away even more of the financial benefit of a degree. The original higher education funding changes that federal Education Minister Christopher Pyne tried and failed to pass through the Senate would have increased the proportion of the cost of a degree paid by the student from about 40 per cent to more than 50 per cent.\nAlthough Pyne's legislation didn't pass the pressure for students to pay more will not go away, given that no side of politics is likely to tip more money into universities.\nSo what is a student finishing school and considering going to university to do? One piece of advice is to choose your course carefully.\nThis decision may be more important that which university you go to. Other research by Mr Norton shows that graduates of the technology universities – QUT, UTS, RMIT, University of SA and Curtin University – earn as much as graduates of the prestigious Group of Eight, which comprises the universities of Queensland, Sydney, NSW, Melbourne, Adelaide and Western Australia, along with Monash and the ANU.\nAnd recent work from the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research shows that Group of Eight graduates' earnings are well behind many other universities, although this is disputed by the Group of Eight.\nFinally, look at all the options available to train for the career you have in mind. It might be that a university degree is not the best thing for you.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TimDoddAFR", "http://grattan.edu.au/report/graduate-winners-assessing-the-public-and-private-benefits-of-higher-education/", "https://plus.google.com/+TimDoddSydney"], "published": "2015-07-26T11:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:05:02.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
