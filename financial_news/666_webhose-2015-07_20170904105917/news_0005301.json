(the \"Company\") will provide supplemental information regarding the previously announced proposed transaction with The Procter & Gamble Company (\"P&G\") in connection with presentations to analysts and investors. A copy of the investor presentation is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. \nForward-Looking Statements \nCertain statements in this communication are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the Company's current views with respect to the completion of the transaction with P&G. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by words or phrases, such as \"anticipate,\"\"expect,\"\"should,\"\"would,\"\"could,\"\"intend,\"\"plan,\"\"project,\"\"seek,\"\"believe,\"\"will,\"\"opportunity,\"\"potential,\" and similar words or phrases. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted due to risks and uncertainties including inaccuracies in our assumptions in evaluating the transaction, difficulties in integrating the P&G beauty business into the Company and other difficulties in achieving the expected benefits of the transaction. All statements in this communication, other than those relating to historical information or current conditions, are forward-looking statements. We intend these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. \nRisks and uncertainties relating to the proposed transaction with P&G include, but are not limited to: uncertainties as to the timing of the transaction; the risk that regulatory or other approvals required for the transaction are not obtained or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated, including certain licensor consents; competitive responses to the transaction; litigation relating to the transaction; uncertainty of the expected financial performance of the combined company following completion of the proposed transaction; the ability of the Company to achieve the cost-savings and synergies contemplated by the proposed transaction within the expected time frame; the ability of the Company to promptly and effectively integrate the P&G beauty business and the Company; the effects of the business combination of the Company and the P&G beauty business, including the combined company's future financial condition, operating results, strategy and plans; and disruption from the proposed transaction making it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers. \nThe foregoing review of important factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included elsewhere. More information about potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's business and financial results is included under \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, and other periodic reports the Company has filed and may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. Any forward-looking statements made in this communication are qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by us will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on, us or our business or operations. Except to the extent required by applicable law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. \nImportant Additional Information \nIn connection with the proposed transaction, the Company and the P&G beauty business will file registration statements with the SEC registering shares of the Company common stock and common stock of the P&G beauty business.
