The company sees Energy Developments Ltd as 'strong strategic fit'. Michele Mossop by Angela Macdonald-Smith Sarah Thompson Jake Mitchell DUET Group has clinched a deal to acquire power project developer Energy Developments Ltd. in a $1.4 billion takeover as revealed earlier Monday by Street Talk on afr.com , to be funded by a $1.67 billion equity raising.\nEnergy Developments' board has recommended the $8 per share cash offer from DUET, with chairman Rob Koczkar describing it as \"an attractive value proposition\" relative to analyst valuations and recent trading prices for the company's stock.\nShares in Energy Developments, which owns power stations in Australia, the US, UK and Greece fuelled by landfill gas and natural gas, closed on Friday at $7.72.\nThe offer values Energy Developments' equity at $1.407 billion, and implies an enterprise value, including debt, of $1.92 billion, according to a statement released jointly by Energy Developments and DUET on Monday morning.\n\"The proposal from DUET recognises the attractive growth outlook for the business, the strong operational performance and is a robust endorsement of management's ability to deliver against the strategic plan,\" Energy Developments managing director Greg Pritchard said.\nDUET chief executive David Bartholomew said Energy Developments was \"a strong strategic fit\" with DUET and that the takeover would diversify cash flows and \"provide an attractive source of growth\".\nAll the directors intend to vote their shares in favour of the deal, to be completed through a scheme of arrangement.\nAs reported by Street Talk, DUET will fund the takeover through a large equity raising, via a cornerstone placement and a fully underwritten entitlement offer.\n Securities will be placed to cornerstone investors, including UniSuper, at $2.02 per security to raise $550 million, while a further $1.12 billion will be raised in a 1-for-2.69 pro rata entitlement offer, also priced at $2.02.\nDUET placed its shares in a trading halt pending the raising.\nMajor shareholders in Energy Developments representing 85.7 per cent of the shares on issue have resolved to vote in favour of the scheme. They include 67.1 per cent shareholder Greenspark Power Holdings, Investors Mutual and Coopers Investors.\nEnergy Developments, which is being advised by Citigroup and Gilbert + Tobin, said it had appointed Deloitte Corporate Finance to independently examine the proposal to assess whether it is in the best interests of shareholders. A meeting is to be held in early October for the shareholder vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T04:11:45.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
