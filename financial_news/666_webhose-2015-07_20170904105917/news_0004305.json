He fired off that tweet after coming across a smokin’ deal on 55 gallons of a “natural water-based lubricant” for only $1,138.20.\nHalf off! Almost can’t afford NOT to buy at least one barrel. For what it’s worth, that’s a way better deal than the extra long shoehorn for a 20% discount that everybody’s talking about.\nThose are just a couple examples of the bargains trotted out on Wednesday by Internet price-slasher Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.72% in a promotion available only to select Prime customers.\nOther reactions to the sales spree were more straightforward than Gara’s. One shopper says that Prime Day is “some sort of postmodern experiment to see if disappointment can be quantified.” Another writes “everyone is disappointed, just like Christmas morning.”\nPrime Day was billed to be bigger than Black Friday. It also was aimed at luring customers into the world of Prime, a $99 annual club with perks like free two-day shipping, unlimited streaming and access to millions of songs.\nRead: Is Amazon Prime worth $99 a year?\nIt’s still early, of course, but if the reaction across social media is any indication, there’s a way to go before Prime Day hits either of those marks. The trending #PrimeDay hashtag probably didn’t go quite as planned. Then again, there’s no shortage of comments. In fact, it’s trending ahead of #JustinBieberComeBackTo1D .
