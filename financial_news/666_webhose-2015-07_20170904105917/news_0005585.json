Arsineh Houspian Share on twitter by Amanda Saunders BHP Billiton has beaten its iron ore guidance, shipping 254 million tonnes for the year to June, but has flagged a pullback across its other three key \"pillar\" commodities in the coming year.\nBHP also took an impairment on Wednesday of $US350 million to $US650 million, mainly on its copper business.\nThe miner is on track with its rapid iron ore expansion to 270 million tonnes of iron ore in the current year, and up to 290 million in financial 2017.\nBut it expects a big drop of 12 per cent in copper production in the coming year, while metallurgical coal output will fall 6 per cent, and petroleum 7 per cent. That positions iron ore as the only one of the miner's four key pillars to grow.\nThe key focus for the investment community has been the miner's petroleum division, given it has been the area of most uncertainty for BHP investors.\nThe resources giant also pipped its petroleum guidance this year, despite a huge pullback on drilling at its US onshore gas division. BHP last week took a $US2.8 billion writedown on its US shale gas business .\nEven though the miner is pushing hard to make up volumes lost to the pullback in shale, it won't be enough to see the division grow next year.\nAnalysts were expecting a beat on iron ore guidance of 250 million tonnes, but BHP's 254 million tonne result has still exceeded consensus expectations. BHP will also hammer its production costs down even further over the next 12 months to $US16 a tonne.\n BHP's full-year result this year will carry a non-cash hit at least $US5.8 billion. The copper writedowns unveiled on Wednesday will have surprised some in the market.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mandaksaunders"], "published": "2015-07-22T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:08:16.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
