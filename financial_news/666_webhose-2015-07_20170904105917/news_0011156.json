On Tuesday, June 30, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner issued a statement confirming rumors about the end of their 10-year marriage. Speculation on the status of their relationship started when Affleck referred to their marriage as “work” in his 2013 Oscar acceptance speech. \n“After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce,” said the couple in a joint statement made by their publicists. “We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time.” \nA lot is at stake in the Jennifer Garner-Ben Affleck divorce. Although they have decided to share joint custody of their three children — nine-year-old Violet, six-year-old Seraphina and three-year-old Samuel — they have a vast fortune and real estate to divide. \nRelate: Best and Worst Money Lessons From Hollywood Dads Ben Affleck Net Worth: $75 Million \nAffleck is worth an estimated $75 million, according CelebrityNetWorth. The two-time Academy Award winner earned $35 million between June 2013 and June 2014, according to Forbes. \nThe 42-year-old amassed his fortune by writing, acting and directing a slew of box office hits. Some of his most noteworthy projects include “Good Will Hunting,” “Pearl Harbor,” “The Town,” “Argo,” “Gone Baby Gone” and “Gone Girl.” Affleck is also slated to take on the role of Batman in the four upcoming films, “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,” “Suicide Squad,” “The Justice League Part One” and “The Justice League Part Two.” Jennifer Garner Net Worth: $60 Million \nGarner’s net worth is $60 million. Her acting career dates back 20 years to the 1995 television movie “Zoya.” She starred in the hit series “Alias” for five seasons and has gone on to play a lead role in a number of big films, such as “13 Going on 30,” “Juno” and “Dallas Buyers Club.” The 43-year-old actress has recently taken more time off to raise the couple’s three children. How the Jennifer Garner-Ben Affleck Divorce Will Impact Their Finances \nThe couple reportedly had no prenuptial agreement. The duration of their union could be significant, as California Family Code Section 4336 cites a 10-year marriage as “long duration,” meaning in the absence of a prenuptial agreement, the court could set the terms for Affleck’s spousal support payments to Garner, as he is the highest earner. \nIn marriages lasting less than 10 years, alimony is typically paid for half the duration of the union. Standards are different for marriages lasting 10 or more years, as judges could order higher-earning spouses to pay alimony indefinitely. \nMediators are dividing assets in the divorce , including an 8,800 square-foot Los Angeles home purchased for $17.55 million in 2009. Affleck also owns a 50-acre estate in Savannah, Ga., that he purchased for $7 million in 2003. Since the home was acquired before his marriage to Garner, it might not be considered community property.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T03:12:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
