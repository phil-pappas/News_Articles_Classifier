The once powerful executive is in detention. \nThe latest sign of macro-economic problems appeared on Wednesday when the government announced a radical cut to its fiscal savings goal and said it would increase austerity measures. \nFinance Minister Joaquim Levy said the lowering of the surplus goal from 1.1 percent of GDP to just 0.15 percent reflected the worsening performance in the world's seventh largest economy. \nWith Brazil on the brink of recession, \"there has been an effect on tax receipts,\" he said. \nHowever, the government's commitment to austerity measures was unshaken. \nCuts of 8.6 billion reais ($2.66 billion) were announced, raising this year's cuts to $24 billion, the ministry of planning and budget said. \n\"The revision is largely to do with the slowdown of the economy, which turns out to be deeper than thought,\" said Ignacio Crespo, an analyst at Guide Investimentos in the financial capital Sao Paulo. \n\"It's hard to know how far the recession will go, but for sure it will be tougher. Contrary to what we hoped for a few months ago, the economy will be going down in 2016,\" he said. \nAnother analyst, Andre Ferreira, from Futura, said he didn't expect growth to return before 2018. \nIf so, that would add up to a seven-year stretch of zero or negative growth in a country that not so long ago had been hoping to ride the commodities boom to top rank economic status. \nIn 2014, GDP grew just 0.1 percent and this year the government forecasts a 1.49 percent contraction, while the market expects even worse. \n- Corruption and politicking - \nThe economic hangover dovetails with a worsening political situation, especially for Rousseff who only began her second term, following a divisive re-election, in January. \n\"There is a drastic deterioration in expectations and this is deepening the political crisis,\" Andre Cesar, a political analyst in the capital Brasilia, said. \"The tendency is for worse.\" \nThe Petrobras scandal, he said, has presented the Rousseff government with a \"moral crisis\" as well as direct economic fallout, given the importance of the oil giant in the nation's political and economic landscape. \nSpreading from within Petrobras' ranks, the probe has reached Rousseff's Workers' Party and also opposition figures. \nRousseff, chairwoman of Petrobras for seven years before she became president, has not been directly implicated in the scandal but there are mounting calls for her resignation or impeachment. \nSmelling blood, Workers' Party opponents in Congress are blocking Rousseff's legislative agenda, while the speaker of the lower house and her nominal ally, Eduardo Cunha, has demonstratively broken ranks and gone into opposition. \nAs a result, Rousseff is hardly in a position to reform Brazil's public spending. \n\"Political conditions for such an adjustment, however, simply don't exist,\" Eurasia Group consultants said. \n\"With popular discontent and unemployment expected to rise in the coming months, the government?s (already low) capacity to meaningfully cut expenditures is expected to decline even more.\" @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Brazil's economy hits the skids AFP \nBad news piled up Friday for Brazil's economy, with the real plunging to its lowest level against the dollar in â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T03:58:58.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
