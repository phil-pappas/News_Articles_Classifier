We all know what happened next: women embraced it with a vengeance. Now the famed brand, no doubt learning from that experience, has launched a range with a new shape and name, one that leaves no doubt about its positioning; it’s called the Boy.Friend watch.\nDue to hit stores here soon, the watch looks vaguely familiar, while at the same time looking like no other. Clever. The overall style is rectangular but with the angled edges of the brand’s Premiere range, fresh curved accents making for a feminine piece that’s unusually strong.\nThat comes as no surprise given the creative inspiration, and history again kicks in here: the name derives from Gabrielle (Coco) Chanel’s masculine alter ego, “Boy” Capel, who has been described as her mentor and only true love.\nCapel was, to give him his full nomenclature, Captain Arthur Edward Capel, CBE, a British polo player who became better known as Coco’s lover and muse, and was said to have financed her first boutiques. There was nothing surreptitious about this. His own daughter’s obituary described him as “an intellectual, politician, tycoon, polo-player and the dashing lover and sponsor of the fashion designer Coco Chanel”. The liaison even survived Capel’s later marriage.\nGabrielle (Coco) Chanel and Captain Arthur Edward Capel, CBE, a British polo player who became better known as Coco’s lover and muse, and was said to have financed her first boutiques. supplied It’s been said that Coco Chanel would never have become who she was without the boy.friends in her life, and they were hardly unknowns. While Boy Capel was on the scene around 1909, the Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich introduced her to Russian influences circa 1920. Then, about 1924, Hugh Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster, brought a familiarity with ultimate luxury – simplicity and elegance with no ostentation.\nStrong men, a strong woman; one who reinvented femininity by twisting masculine style – from short haircuts to severe suiting – into feminine allure. She famously said: “A woman needs the look of a man who loves her, and not a beauty institute. Without this look, a woman dies.”\nBack to the watch. Chanel sees it as a “touch of masculinity” that by contrast makes it even more beguiling, a potential “partner for the audacious woman”. That would be the woman whose budget is equally audacious; it will be priced from about $20,000 to $40,000.\nThe Boy.Friend comes in two sizes, 34.6mm by 26.7mm with a quartz movement and date indication, and 37mm by 28.6mm with a manual winding movement and small seconds sub-dial. The cases are gold; there’s an option of diamonds with the beige gold variant, but no option with white gold – here the diamonds come as standard. And if your taste tends to eschewing bracelets as too feminine, the Boy.Friend comes on a black leather alligator strap, with diamond-set buckle for the jewelled versions.\n l", "external_links": ["http://www.chanel.com/en_US/Watches/j12-black"], "published": "2015-07-20T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T04:04:22.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
