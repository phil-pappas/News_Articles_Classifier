Louise Kennerley by Duncan Hughes and Clancy Yeates Banks' attempts to cool the over-heating property market has created a potential funding time-bomb for thousands of investors who have committed to buy off-the-plan apartments but have yet to secure finance to fulfil their contracts.\nMortgage brokers estimate there are 90,000 apartments being constructed in Australia that have been sold off-the-plan but not yet settled. The purchasers of about 20 per cent of these, or 18,000, have paid a deposit of just 10 per cent of the full purchase price, according to analysis of statistics from CoreLogic RP Data.\nMortgage brokers and some property developers are concerned these investors could struggle to find finance for the remaining 90 per cent purchase price as banks are suddenly toughening up lending criteria for investors.\n\"This is causing alarm across the industry,\" said Tim Brown, chief executive of the Mortgage and Financing Association.\n\"Many of these are first-time buyers who will not be able to fulfil their finance obligation under the contract and will lose their deposit as many of the banks will not finance any investment loan over 80 per cent and in some cases will not lend on investment at all,\" Mr Brown said.\nBank are under pressure from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Reserve Bank of Australia to cool the amount of investment activity that has heated up the property market. On Friday Commonwealth Bank of Australia followed ANZ Banking Group by lifting its standard variable interest rate for investor loans by 0.27 of a percentage point to 5.72 per cent.\nOther banks yet to follow Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Andrew Hill said National Australia Bank and Westpac Banking Corp are both likely to follow ANZ and CBA. Should this happen the big four combined would enjoy an extra $850 million in annual profits, Mr Hill estimated.\n Buying off-the-plan apartments has been a successful investment strategy for many investors in a rising property market. In Melbourne it has been actively encouraged through the waiver of stamp duty, equal to 5.5 per cent of the purchase price.\nAs little as 10 per cent of the purchase price is required to secure an apartment and buyers typically arrange finance for the rest as the apartment nears completion – often years later. While people can arrange finance ahead of settlement, banks typically reserve the right to change terms. Many investors are set to discover that finance has suddenly become both more expensive and harder to get.\nIn the last fortnight Westpac and its subsidiary banks including Bank of Melbourne and Bank SA said it now requires minimum deposits of 20 per cent, up from 10 per cent. NAB and ANZ have lifted their minimum deposit amounts from about 5 per cent to 10 per cent. CBA has said it will not take the tax breaks borrowers receive from negative gearing into account when a borrower needs to borrow more than 90 per cent of the property's purchase price.\nOther changes across the sector include tougher reviews of a borrower's income – some banks are no longer counting expected bonuses. In addition to lifting actual interest rates, banks are also increasing the rates that they use to stress-test a loan applicant's ability to service the loan. AMP is reviewing its investment lending and is expected to make an announcement about possible changes next week.\n\"The decision to raise interest rates for residential investment lending has been difficult but necessary in the current environment,\" an ANZ bank spokesman said.\nMuch harder haggling Property developers claim the banks are also haggling much harder over the final valuation when the properties are completed and ready for settlement.\nJohn Meagher, managing director of 360 Property Group, said the risk of default comes from local rather than overseas buyers, who were routinely making deposits of up to 30 per cent.\n\"We are already hearing of cases where purchases are scrambling to find funds because of the change in the lending landscape,\" Chris Foster-Ramsay, managing director of Capital Home Loans, said.\nBorrowers are also facing increased delays in the processing of loan applications because banks that have not dropped their loan-to-value ratios are being inundated with new investment applications.\n\"Many are from brokers not familiar with other banks' systems and policies, which means credit assessment teams are having to re-work the applications a number of times and request outstanding documentation,\" Mr Foster-Ramsay said.\nA spokesman for APRA said its aim is to \"reinforce sound lending practices by setting a threshold of 10 per cent growth in authorised deposit-taking institutions' lending portfolios over a 12-month period\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T05:13:30.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
