That’s small fry when some analysts had predicted the threat of a Greek exit from the euro area would spark a blow-out in yields on periphery bonds and a rally in German bunds, the region’s benchmark sovereign securities.\nThe bond market reaction was tempered by Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis quitting his post, saying his presence would hamper aid talks. While strategists said European Central Bank support was probable in the event of a debt-market selloff, it didn’t do anything beyond its normal bond-buying activity on Monday morning, according to four people with knowledge of the situation.\n“The muted reaction implies the market is not too worried about a Grexit,” said Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea Bank AB in Helsinki. “It is still early, and bigger moves may well surface in the near future, but I do not expect to see the start of another financial crisis.”\nThe yield on German 10-year bunds fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 0.73 percent at 9:46 a.m. London time, about the same magnitude of move as was seen on July 3. The 0.5 percent security due in February 2025 rose 0.525, or 5.25 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,107) face amount, to 97.845.\nVaroufakis’s Exit Bunds gained as investors sought safer assets after 61 percent of voters backed Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s rejection of Greece’s bailout plan.\nVaroufakis announced his decision to quit in a blog post early Monday, saying there was “a certain preference” among European creditors that he no longer be involved in negotiations. With euro-area governments signaling it’s up to Greece to offer proposals on the way forward, Varoufakis’s absence from any future aid talks may help its efforts to secure a new bailout from European partners.\n“After Varoufakis has resigned there is still hope that, with a new finance minister, talks could head in the right direction,” said Daniel Lenz, lead market strategist at DZ Bank AG in Frankfurt.\nMarket Resilience Italian 10-year bond yields added 11 basis points to 2.36 percent, compared with a 24 basis-point increase on June 29. The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds climbed 12 basis points to 2.33 percent, after also adding 24 basis points on June 29.\nThe moves, so far, are relatively modest when some analysts, such as Teneo Intelligence Managing Director Wolfango Piccoli, see yield spreads between the periphery bonds and German bunds widening as much as 300 basis points, pushing the ECB to “recalibrate” its bond purchases.\n“The market was on alert for a negative surprise this weekend, and we already had a test run of ‘Greek disaster-news’ seven days ago,” Jens Nordvig, managing director of currency research at Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York, wrote in an e-mailed note. “That ‘training’ will soften the blow in coming days. In any case, the next 24 hours will signal how resilient euro-zone markets have become.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T12:09:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
