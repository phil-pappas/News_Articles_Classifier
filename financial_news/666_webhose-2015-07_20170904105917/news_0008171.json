(TSXV:SUP) (\"Northern Superior\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the initiation of the Company's next generation of exploration programs with the staking of the 100% owned Wapistan mineral property in Québec (Figure 1; www.nsuperior.com). The Wapistan mineral property is just one (1) of twenty two (22) Québec- based mineral properties, identified by the Company from a review of the Company's vast data base during the first quarter of 2015. The Company intends to introduce at least two (2) additional properties during the fourth quarter of 2015. Dr. T.F. Morris, President and CEO of Northern Superior comments: \"The acquisition of the Wapistan mineral property is a key component in setting the future for Northern Superior. As the Company has optioned out much of its current portfolio of properties (see press releases for Lac Surprise, April 10, 2014; Croteau Est April 21, 2015), it is imperative that the next generation of mineral properties be identified and acquired. The Wapistan mineral property ideally falls within the Company's exploration criteria of being a large, highly prospective, underexplored, low exploration cost property, located within a well- established exploration and mining camp that is situated in a favorable political jurisdiction, such as Québec. The Wapistan mineral property is the first of a series of mineral property acquisitions, and Northern Superior looks forward to this next phase of highly prospective, exploration opportunities.\" The Wapistan mineral property is district in scale, consisting of 207 claims or approximately 10,408 hectares, covering over a 32 km strike length of a major structure developed in an Archean- aged volcanic-sedimentary package (Figure 1). This package enclosed within the Wapistan property hosts multiple gold and other precious metal occurrences (Table 1, Figure 1): in rocks similar to those associated with the Roberto Deposit (Goldcorp Inc.) and the Eau Claire Gold deposit (Eastmain Resources Inc.). This high potential corridor is characterized by intermediate to mafic volcanics, metasediments and iron formation, providing a wide range of rheological and geochemically contrasting rock types in a strongly deformed setting. These units and associated major structures are typical throughout each of the major gold mining camps in the Canadian Shield. Geological interpretation from previous (but limited) exploration indicate that the Wapistan property is favorable for hosting Orogenic and Porphyry style mineralization within this emerging gold district. In addition, the Wapistan mineral property is strategically located to take advantage of established infrastructure, significantly reducing exploration and development costs. The cross roads of two major access routes in the region (Route de la Baie-James and Trans-taiga) occur within this property, while a key secondary road (Chemin de Wemindji; Figure 1), running directly adjacent to the property, provides access to the James Bay coast line. Proximal to the project are commercial airports and fixed wing water bases. Two high voltage power lines cross the property. Several communities occur within close proximity to the Wapistan property capable of providing support services.
