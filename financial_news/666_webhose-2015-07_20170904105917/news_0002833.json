When it comes to managing healthcare dollars in healthcare spending accounts, the spenders just cycle money through the tax-favored accounts quickly. That means they’re missing out on one of the triple-play tax benefits HSAs offer: tax-free growth in an investment account. The investors move their money into an associated investment account—you can invest in low-cost Vanguard Vanguard index funds, for example.\nYet only 6% of health savings account owners are investing their HSA dollars, according to a new report by the Employee Benefits Research Institute, parsing data on 2.9 million HSAs. A few of these folks know something about tax-advantaged savings and the long-term savings component of HSAs: about 120 accounts had over $100,000, and 10 of those were above $150,000, says Paul Fronstin, director of the health research program at EBRI and author of the report. Is that too much? Fidelity Benefits Consulting estimates that a 65-year-old couple retiring last year would need an average of $220,000 in today’s dollars to cover out-of pocket medical expenses through retirement, not including nursing home care, which could be funded with HSA dollars.\nHere’s the triple tax play: The money you contribute to an HSA is tax-deductible (for someone in the 33% tax bracket, that’s like getting a third off on your healthcare expenditures right off). But it gets better: the money grows tax-free; and you can withdraw it tax-free for out-of-pocket medical expenses. To the extent your invested HSA dollars grow, that means even more tax savings. There are an estimated 17 million HSAs in existence; they’re tied to high-deductible health insurance plans. As the number of those consumer-driven plans is growing, the number of HSAs is growing too.\nOpening an investment account for your health care savings account dollars may help pave the way to a more secure retirement.

Four out of 10 HSAs with investment assets ended 2014 with a balance of $10,000 or more, while only 4 out of 100 HSAs without investment assets had that much. The longer the accounts had been open, the higher the balances. Among HSAs with investment assets, accounts opened in 2014 ended the year with an average balance of $6,544. Those opened in 2005 had an average balance of $19,269 at the end of 2014. (The average HSA balance for all HSAs in the EBRI database was $1,933 at year-end 2014.)\nWhy aren’t taxpayers shoveling more into these accounts? You have to understand the tax benefits, and have the capacity to save. “Only 30% of consumers can pass an HSA proficiency test,” says Steve Auerbach, ceo of Alegeus Technologies, which provides the technology platform behind 27 million consumer-directed health accounts. “People sign up for a high deductible health plan, they’ll start to fund an HSA but pause when it comes to: ‘How much money should I put in?’”\nIf you’re hesitating, worried that you’re putting in too much, consider that it’s your dollars; you don’t lose the money if you change employers. One point of confusion is thinking it works like a healthcare flexible spending account where you contribute a set amount (up to $2,550 for 2015) per year and if you don’t use it that year, you lose it (unless your employer has adopted a new rule that lets you carryover a balance of up to $500 into the next plan year). More employers are adding the $500 carryover .\nIf you have the savings capacity and want to max out the tax savings, you want to fund the HSA to the max. The IRS announced the 2016 HSA contributions limits in May. For 2016, the annual limit for individual coverage is $3,350; for family coverage, it’s $6,750 (up from $6,650 in 2015). Catch-up contributions of $1,000 a year can be made starting anytime the year the individual covered turns 55.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["http://www.ebri.org/pdf/briefspdf/EBRI_IB_416.July15.HSAs.pdf", "http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-15-30.pdf"], "published": "2015-07-20T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T23:02:51.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
