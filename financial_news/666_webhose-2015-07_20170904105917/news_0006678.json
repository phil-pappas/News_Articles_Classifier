Europe's biggest bank, HSBC, has said the levy will be a factor in whether it decides to keep its headquarters in Britain. \n\"I will, over the next six years, gradually reduce the bank levy rate, and after that make sure it no longer applies to worldwide balance sheets,\" British Finance Minister George Osborne told parliament in his post-election budget. \nApplying the levy only to banking assets in Britain will benefit HSBC and Standard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) in particular as they have a high proportion of their assets overseas. \nIt also reduces the competitive disadvantage for UK banks against foreign rivals operating in Britain. \n\"But to maintain a fair contribution from the banks, I will introduce a new eight percent surcharge on bank profits from the first of January next year,\" Osborne said. \nThe surcharge would be mitigated by a cut in corporation tax to 18 percent by 2019-20. \n\"By getting this balance right, it means we'll actually raise more from the banks this parliament, but at the same time make our country a more competitive place to do business.\" \nBank shares initially rose after Osborne's announcement but later fell back. \n\"The bank levy is simply a bad tax. It pushes business away from the UK, and it penalises banks for engaging in low risk business,\" said Dan Neidle, a tax partner at Clifford Chance lawfirm.
