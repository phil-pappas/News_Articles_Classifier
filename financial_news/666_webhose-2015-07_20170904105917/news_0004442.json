That was a slight delay from earlier projections of the first half of the year due to tax considerations. \nFiat hopes the move will help it raise cash to support its plan to invest €48bn ($61bn) over five years. \nFerrari, based in Maranello, northern Italy, is a relatively small player in the global automobile industry. The luxury sports car manufacturer, founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1929, shipped 7,255 cars last year. \nThe \"prancing horse\" brand is also famous for its Formula One racing team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T00:13:54.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
