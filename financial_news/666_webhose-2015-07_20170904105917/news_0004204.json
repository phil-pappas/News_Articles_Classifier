It shows financial discipline,\" news agencies quoted Shevalev as saying. \n\"But after paying the body of the bond, it will be very hard to talk to the other creditors -- why we decide to pay someone in September and not someone else later on.\" \nUkraine's biggest worry is a $3-billion Eurobond that Russia purchased from the deposed government in the wake of its 2013 decision to bow to Kremlin pressure and reject an EU association pact. \nMoscow authorities have refused to join the debt negotiations and demand the money be repaid by the December 20 deadline. \n- Creditors under pressure - \nUkraine last week made a new debt restructuring offer that IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde on Wednesday urged the Western creditors to accept. \nThe IMF chief said she hoped \"bondholders are sensible about what can be achieved\" and expressed optimism about recent \"progress\". \nThe two sides have agreed to keep their talks private in order to avoid either Kiev or the investment houses putting pressure on each other through the press. \nIt remains unclear whether the new Kiev proposal includes the 40-percent write-off that the lenders have so furiously fought. \nUkrainian Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko had said Monday she expected direct talks to resume this week. \nAnd her deputy Shevalev confirmed that discussions at various levels were becoming more frequent and involved. \n\"I cannot disclose the details, but at the very least, our dialogue has reached a new stage of development,\" \nLagarde has signalled repeatedly that the Fund's payments to Kiev's pro-Western government would continue even if no immediate debt agreement is struck.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T18:45:18.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
