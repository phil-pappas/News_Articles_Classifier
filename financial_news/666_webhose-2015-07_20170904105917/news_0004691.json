The problems were only addressed by bailouts from the European institutions and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). \nCritics say the problem stems from a lack of centralised control over national fiscal policies, which today are jealously guarded areas of sovereignty. \nIn 2011, Delors said the crisis facing the euro required member states either to accept greater economic cooperation or a transfer of more national powers to the European Union's centre. \nHollande did not spell out his proposals in the interview but said it was time to overhaul the euro's governance. \n\"Sharing a currency is far more than wanting (economic) convergence,\" he said. \n\"It's a choice that 19 countries have made because it was in their interest. No government, by the way, has taken the responsibility of leaving\" the euro since its creation, he said. \n\"This choice calls for strengthened organisation and, among the countries which will decide it, a vanguard,\" said Hollande. \n\"France is willing to take part because, as Jacques Delors showed, the country becomes greater when it takes the initiative in Europe.\" \nThe idea of a eurozone parliament, to run alongside the current European parliament, has already been mooted by economists such as Thomas Piketty. \nSuch a \"second chamber\", according to renowned French economist Piketty, could include both members of the European parliament and members of national parliaments. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Market focus on Greek crisis eases AAP \nAustralia's share market is tipped to shift its focus from the Greek crisis to domestic inflation figures and how …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T22:58:04.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
