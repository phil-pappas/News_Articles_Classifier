It will have 3 billion rubles ($51.4 million) in capital and will be funded by banks, insurance companies and asset managers, the central bank said Friday on its website . Shares will be distributed on a pro-rata basis and no investor will hold a stake exceeding 5 percent.\n“Rating agencies are one of the most important elements of financial-market infrastructure and their activity should be resilient to geopolitical risks,” it said. Participants in a meeting held by the central bank agreed that the country needs a “strong” credit evaluator “with a high level of corporate governance,” authoritative enough for Russian and foreign investors, according to the statement.\nThe announcement caps years of criticism by officials over the rankings given to Russia, which President Vladimir Putin in 2011 called “an outrage” that increased borrowing costs for both domestic companies and the government. Tensions came to a head this year, when S&P and Moody’s Investors Service cut Russia below investment grade following a slump in oil prices and sanctions imposed over Ukraine.\nFinance Minister Anton Siluanov blamed “political factors” for the downgrades. Fitch Ratings, the last major assessor that ranks Russia above junk, left the sovereign at BBB- this month.", "external_links": ["http://www.cbr.ru/press/pr.aspx?file=24072015_122628if2015-07-24T12_23_34.htm\\"], "published": "2015-07-24T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T15:53:11.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
