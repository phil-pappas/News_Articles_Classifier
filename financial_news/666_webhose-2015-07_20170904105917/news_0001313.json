The ministers are responsible for economic policy implementation and need to be familiar with ongoing initiatives. \nCognisant of China's own experience and challenges faced during its domestic policy driven transformation to become a leading global player in the realm of economics, it is gratifying to note that the trip also focuses on finding ways for the accelerated implementation of Zim-Asset. \nThe two countries' commitment to growing cordial relations manifested in the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding for accelerated implementation of the premier economic blueprint, Zim-Asset. \nThe framework of understanding will cover specific sectors of the economy that include tested and effective policy for mining, tourism, infrastructure development and Special Economic Zones. \nThe accelerated implementation of Zim-Asset will see transformative economic development through focused interventions and judicious exploitation of the country's abundant natural resources. \nThe success of Zim-Asset means sustainable development and growth of the economy for empowered society, including the mainstreaming of the grassroots in the domestic economy. \nAs such, having secured the support of China, Zimbabwe can only blame itself if it fails to transform, grow and develop the economy, learning from a willing partner it shares a similar past with.
