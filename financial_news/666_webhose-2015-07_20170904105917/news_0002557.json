Photo: Bloomberg\nThursday marked the first wave of quarterly production reports allowing us a glimpse into the performance of our major oil and gas producer, Woodside, and iron ore behemoth Rio Tinto.\nThe pair are exposed to falling prices among their respective major commodities thus the production reports provide some sense of their responses to the \"new normal\" of lower returns.\nRio will receive the most scrutiny from investors given its size and the importance of iron ore to the Australian economy.\nIllustration Kerrie Leishman\nBut its announcement that it would cut 2015 production guidance by 10 million tonnes to 340 million tonnes was in no way a supply-led response to lower prices. It was merely the result of a weather-related issue.\nDespite howls of protest from other producers with higher costs than Rio – in particular Andrew Forrest – and some on the sidelines – most notably Glencore's Ivan Glasenberg – Rio continued to dig and ship at record levels with total shipments in the June quarter up 12 per cent on the previous quarter.\nThe critics claim that large producers pushing fresh supply into the market is responsible for retarding the price of iron ore thus blowing up the profitability of the entire industry. But the majors have scoffed at such suggestions.\nRegardless of whether or not the wounds are self-inflicted the falling commodity prices are the major culprit in what is expected to be a fall in Rio's 2015 profit from US$9.3 billion in 2014 to US$4.8 billion in 2015 based on Citi estimates.\nSmall producers will gain no comfort from Rio's production report. Most are already under pressure and struggling to survive. For Altas Iron, which is currently attempting to raise $180 million from the equity market, the affirmation that Rio will plough on to reach its larger production targets will only add to its woes.\nRio's first half production of 146.3 million tonnes was 10 per cent higher than the same period of 2014 following the successful ramp up to 290 million tonnes per annum in May 2014. Second quarter production of 75.2 million tonnes was 9 per cent higher than the second quarter of 2014 and was 6 per cent above the first quarter of 2015.\nAnd far from shying away from its target of 360 million tonnes per year, its chief executive Sam Walsh has made it abundantly clear his intentions to continue the wave of increased production.\nHe is clearly undeterred by the volatile iron ore price that fell below US$45 earlier this month and is currently sitting at around US$50. It is on track to increase production by about 45 million tonnes, or 15 per cent, this year.\nLike all producers including BHP, Vale, Fortescue and a myriad of smaller players, Rio is set on chasing down costs in order to minimise the damage to margins from lower prices.\nTheir success in this endeavour will become clearer when these companies report full year 2015 earnings next month.\nRio's strategy around thermal coal is markedly different to that of iron ore. In the face of much weaker prices in thermal coal Rio has moved to cut supply\nRio expects to produce about 18 million to 19 million tonnes of thermal coal in 2015 year and 3 million to 3.4 million tonnes of soft coking coal. This represents a significantly lower volume than the 25 million tonnes produced in 2014, which was itself 6 per cent lower than the 2013 production.\nMeanwhile new supply sources in the oil and gas industry have also been largely responsible for last year's near 50 per cent fall in price of oil and gas that decimated Woodside Petroleum in the June quarter.\nWoodside, which reports sales along with production, posted second-quarter revenues down 46.5 per cent. June quarter sales were $US898 million, down from $US1.68 billion in the same period a year earlier. Woodside's production has fallen 14.5 per cent in large part due to the planned maintenance work and an unplanned shut down.\nGiven the production issues had been well telegraphed Woodside's numbers came within market expectations, but pressure on the company's share price remains given a further drop in the oil price on Wednesday night.\nWoodside has stuck to its full year production target of 86 million and 94 million barrels of oil equivalent.\nThe quarterly reports from Rio and Woodside will act as something of a curtain-raiser for a cascade of other companies that the market will be watching over the next week.\nSantos will deliver its quarterly report on Friday while BHP Billiton will present its fourth quarter operational review next week, and Fortescue will also update the market on production next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:46:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
