But he had his chances.\nIn a rollercoaster rematch of last year’s final, he was 4-2 up in the first set and had two set points.\nFederer then had to save seven set points in the second set before bravely levelling the contest. However, Djokovic, five years Federer’s junior, stepped on the gas and raced away to the title.\nSunday’s final was the pair’s 40th career meeting and 12th in the Grand Slams. Djokovic was playing in his 17th major final compared to Federer’s 26th.\nBut despite Federer’s majestic triumph over Andy Murray in the semi-finals, which suggested he was not ready for the retirement home just yet, Sunday’s reality check looks certain to leave the Swiss thwarted in his quest to add to his record 17 Grand Slam title collection.\nIn front of a Royal Box crammed with tennis and Hollywood A-listers, including Bjorn Borg, Rod Laver, Benedict Cumberbatch, Hugh Grant and Bradley Cooper, Federer was in the early ascendancy.\nHe broke for a 4-2 lead but Djokovic hit straight back condemning the Swiss to just his second lost service game in 94 served up at the tournament.\nFederer then saw two set points disappear in the 12th game, both saved courtesy of back-to-back 120mph serves.\nDjokovic capitalised on his escape, racing through the tiebreaker with six consecutive points to claim the opener when Federer served up a double fault.\nThe Serb committed just three unforced errors in the first set, a key statistic in what would always be a tight encounter.\nBy contrast, Federer hit 11, the same as he suffered throughout his semi-final win over Murray.\nFederer wasted two break points in the fifth and 11th games of the second set having saved a first set point in the 10th.\nThat paved the way for a titanic tiebreak where the 33- year-old saved six more set points before levelling the final on his second set point.\nAt 12/10, it was the longest tiebreak in a Wimbledon final since 2000 when Pat Rafter faced Pete Sampras with the set taking 65 gripping minutes to complete.\nTo his credit, Djokovic swiftly recovered, breaking for a 2-1 lead in the third set which became 3-2 when rain forced them off for 20 minutes.\nThe world number one confidently wrapped up the set 6-4 with just two unforced errors even if the brief stoppage had dampened the fireworks of the second set.\nDjokovic was strangling the life out of Federer’s game and another break gave him a 3-2 lead in the fourth set.\nThe title was his on the stroke of the third hour with a sweeping forehand into an open court.\nAs has become the Serb’s tradition, he celebrated by pulling out a piece of Centre Court grass and eating it.\nFirst Published on July 12, 2015 10:41 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T23:42:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
