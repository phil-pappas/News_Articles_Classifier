NEW DELHI: The finance ministry plans to pump an extra Rs 12,000 crore into state-owned banks laden with bad debt as the first round of a strategy to get them to resume lending and provide support that's crucial to the Narendra Modi government's economic revival programme. This money is in addition to the Rs 7,940 crore allocated in the budget toward capitalisation and the funds will go mostly to banks that are in urgent need of capital, even if they don't meet the efficiency criteria laid out in the last financial year for those deserving of the government's capital support. \"The idea is to strengthen the banks that are struggling due to rising bad loans, restructuring of accounts and also to help them grow their balance sheet,\" said a finance ministry official with knowledge of the matter. The ministry has sought details from all public sector banks on capital infused in the last decade and the dividends they have given to the government. \"We are not doing away with efficiency-based capital allocation. But it is also important that struggling banks should be given support at this juncture when stress in some sectors, mostly infrastructure, is on account of legacy issues,\" said the official.The government may infuse the money in two parts. A portion of the total Rs 20,000 crore may be given to banks that have urgent requirements, while the rest will only be allocated by March 2016. \"We will seek the additional amount through supplementary demand of grants,\" the official added. Beneficiaries in the first infusion may include Syndicate Bank, Central Bank of India and Allahabad Bank . Last month, Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan had said banks should have enough capital so that they can use a part of it for cleaning up their balance sheets. \"The way to get out of financial stress is to address the problem early... and some of the banks may need some capital to do that. Hopefully this capital infusion will help,\" he had said. In the quarter ended March, bad loans at state-run banks narrowed to 5.2 per cent from 5.64 per cent of total advances. According to finance ministry estimates, the public sector banks will need Rs 2.40 lakh crore as equity by 2018 to conform to Basel III norms. In FY15, the government infused Rs 6,990 crore in nine of 27 staterun banks on the basis of their performance— return on equity (RoE) and return on assets (RoA)—in a bid to make the best use of the limited capital available. The government had infused Rs 14,000 crore in 20 banks in the previous year. Another government official said the performance criteria will be expanded to take into account the concerns of smaller banks. \"In the longer term, capital will be infused on the basis of performance. Banks have already been told to raise resources internally, or focus on niche areas to bring down their bad loans,\" he said, adding that the government is also working on a long-term capital infusion plan for state-owned lenders. Earlier, junior finance minister Jayant Sinha had said the government was assessing the fund requirements of state-run banks over the next three years and will provide the required capital as part of a comprehensive package to strengthen them. Last month, after the annual performance review of public sector banks, finance minister Arun Jaitely had said that there was \"merit\" in the case presented by the lenders for additional capital infusion and that the government would examine this. \"The final decision on the issue would be taken by the cabinet,\" he had said.
