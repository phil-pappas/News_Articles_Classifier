In the 10 weeks to July 11, sales were up 2.6pc in France, where Kingfisher own Castorama and Brico Depot. \nIn the UK, Screwfix, which supplies building professionals, performed better than B&Q, with like-for-like sales growth of 16.7pc. B&Q saw smaller growth of 3.4pc. \nThis suggests that the trend of hiring builders rather than resorting to DIY, from which Screwfix, is still prevalent in the UK \nScrewfix now has 412 stores in the UK and Ireland, with 11 new outlets opened in the second quarter of the this year. \nKingfisher’s overall sales were up 3.5pc, helped by growth in Kingfisher’s other international markets, Poland and Russia, where sales were up 4.3pc. \nVeronique Laury, Kingfisher CEO \nVeronique Laury, who was appointed successor to Sir Ian Cheshire in 2014 , said: \"We have delivered a solid [second quarter] sales performance to date across all our major businesses, albeit against softer comparatives than in [the first quarter].\" \nIn March, Ms Laury announced the planned closure of 60 B&Q stores - one in six of the UK total. \nAnalyst for Davy Michael Mitchell said: “Our cautious view on Kingfisher is framed on concerns about the medium-term prospects for the business. \n“In particular, we are concerned about the structural headwinds facing the traditional DIY sector, challenges which are amplified for Kingfisher as it attempts an aggressive reboot via the One Kingfisher strategy. \n“Nonetheless, its fiscal [second quarter] update reads well with organic revenues up 3.5pc ([first quarter]: 0.8pc), albeit helped by softer comparatives.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T12:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T13:46:02.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
