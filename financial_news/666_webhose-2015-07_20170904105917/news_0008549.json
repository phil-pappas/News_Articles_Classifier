Ben Rushton Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Prime Minister Tony Abbott has seized on the divisions within the most senior levels of the Opposition to argue a Labor government would fall apart on border security.\n\"Listening to snippets of the Labor Party conference, reading about it over the weekend, it seems to me that if there was to be another Labor government, it would essentially be a rerun of Kevin Rudd who, as you know, promised to turn back boats,\" Mr Abbott said.\n\"But in fact more than 800 illegal boats arrived on Labor's watch. We had 50,000 illegal arrivals by boat on Labor's watch.\n\"Tragically we had more than 1,000 deaths at sea on Labor's watch. You just can't trust the Labor Party when it comes to border security.\nOn Saturday, Labor leader Bill Shorten secured a hard-fought victory at the ALP National Conference, the party's policy making body, to give him the discretion, if elected, to turn back boats.\nAs a trade-off, a Labor government would double to 27,000 over 10 years the annual refugee intake, give the UNHCR an extra $450 million, abolish temporary protection visas and implement other humanitarian safeguards.\nBut Mr Shorten was opposed by the Left faction and its most senior figures - his deputy Tanya Plibersek, his Senate Leader Penny Wong, and the man who he beat for the leadership, Anthony Albanese.\nWhile this is not abnormal for an ALP conference, the external optics are awkward for the Opposition.\n \"You've got the leader voting one way and you've got the Deputy Leader, the leader in the Senate, the person who was the people's choice for Labor Leader voting a different way,\" Mr Abbott noted.\n\"The Labor Party...is dangerously divided when it comes to border security.\"\nConversely, sources on both sides of politics said Mr Shorten has emerged from the conference with hs leadership enhanced. He won or won compromises on key policy issues ranging from boats, climate change to gay marriage and has had his confidence boosted.\nBut Mr Albanese and Ms Plibersek are believed to have done their longer term aspirations harm. Both hold electorates under threat from the Greens but their opposition to the asylum seeker policy had many questioning whether they would be acceptable to the broader electorate.\n\"You can forget about them,\" said one senior Liberal strategist who agreed Mr Shorten had consolidated his position.\nHe noted Mr Albanese's comments that he could not order anyone to turn back a boat because it was something he was not prepared to do himself.\n\"Any bloke who says he can't turn back a boat - sometimes you have to do things you personally aren't happy about but they've got to be done.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-27T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T11:05:18.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
