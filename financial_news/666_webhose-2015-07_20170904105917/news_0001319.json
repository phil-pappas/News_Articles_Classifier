Naftemporiki said the entire package would be worth 10 billion to 12 billion euros. \nSuch measures may face resistance from the hard-left wing of Tsipras' Syriza party and from his junior coalition partner, the Independent Greeks, after the government campaigned for a resounding 'No' to more austerity in a referendum on July 5. \n(Reporting by George Georgiopoulos and Michelle Kambas; Writing by Matt Robinson; Editing by Larry King)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T12:23:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
