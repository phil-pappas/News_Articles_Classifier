Photo: AP\nChina's government has been attempting a delicate balancing act since the middle of last year. This month, it fell off the wire.\nA year ago it wanted to slow a housing construction boom that was becoming a bubble but wanted to also keep China's economy growing at a 7 per cent-plus annual rate, even as housing investment and construction slowed.\nIt also wanted to accelerate the privatisation of state-owned enterprises, and wanted to encourage the accumulation of middle-class wealth to assist China's transition from an economy driven by investment and construction to a more \"capital light\" model where household consumption is the dominant source of growth.\nIt decided to artificially induce a domestic sharemarket boom to get those jobs done. Liquidity was created, borrowing rates were cut, controls on lending for share investment in the domestic \"A Share\" market that is restricted to domestic investors were relaxed, and government media outlets began promoting share ownership.\nThe domestic market soared until the middle of June this year as retail investors poured in – but then it cracked.\nIt was down almost 30 per cent a week ago when Beijing began rolling out an unprecedented defence. Short selling was banned. Brokers and investment funds pledged to not sell until share prices recovered, and to form buying consortiums. The government tipped more liquidity into the market, and suspended trading in more than half of China's domestically traded shares.\nThe market bounced on Thursday and Friday this week but for the West, it was confronting stuff. There had to be some deeper fear of dislocation in Beijing, many Western observers argued.\nThey were, however, viewing the meltdown through a Western prism. Beijing is still running a command-control economy, and it sees China's domestic sharemarket as a policy conduit. It is also experiencing its first market slump, and learning on the job. The lesson it will take away is not that it shouldn't intervene, but that it needs to intervene more effectively.\nHow much would an economic slump in China affect the world, and how likely is China's sharemarket plunge to cause such a slump?\nThe first part of that question is easy to answer. China is either the world's largest or second-largest economy after the United States depending on the way it is measured. It is also Australia's biggest trading partner, and the biggest influence on the price of the commodities Australian sells.\nIts growth has already slowed from 11 per cent-plus a few years ago to about 7 percent as it shifts from its industrial construction phase towards Western-style consumer-driven growth. A shock that knocked growth well below 7 per cent would be a serious setback for the world, and for Australia in particular.\nThere are no compelling reasons yet to believe that China's market slump will become a big economic slump, however.\nThere are two main ways the market downturn would feed into the economy. The first is through lower household consumption, if households perceive that the downturn has cut into their wealth and spending power. The second is through the Chinese credit system, if margin loans made to Chinese share investors go bad.\nThe paper wealth that the sharemarket boom created has been trimmed, not eradicated, however. China's Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 share index rose 147 per cent between June 30 last year and June 8 this year when it peaked. The rise from November 20 when the boom went into top gear was 111 per cent.\nOn Friday, after a second day of substantial gains, the market was still 27 per cent below its June high – but it was also 80 per cent above its level on June 30 last year, 54 per cent above its level on November 20, up 10 per cent for all of 2015, and only back where it was in March this year.\nWhat we are actually seeing so far is the deflation of a bubble. Citigroup China market strategist Jason Sun says at its peak, the CSI 300 was valued at 18 times forecast earnings in the next year. It is now trading at a much more sustainable 14.5 times future earnings.\nWill households cut their spending even though the paper gains they have lost were only months old? Well, they didn't appear to go on a spending spree when the market was soaring – and if they do, the effect will be less powerful in China where consumption is still only 50 per cent of economic activity than it is in the West, where consumption accounts for about 75 per cent of growth.\nWhat about those warnings that the market slump will trigger a Chinese debt crisis that in turn pummels the economy?\nThey don't take into account the size of China's economy, the relative insignificance of margin lending for shares in it, and automatic stabilisers that are built into all margin loans, including ones that were created in China.\nThe mix of government, corporate and household debt varies but all the big economies, including Australia's, are heavily geared when all debts are taken into account.\nAustralia's state and federal government debt is about 30 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP can be thought of as annual income). Its total debt including household debt and corporate debt is about 245 per cent of GDP.\nChina's national government debt is about 65 per cent of GDP but its total debt including corporate and local government debt is about 250 per cent of GDP. The total debt load in the United States is similar to Australia and China's and, like Australia's, heaviest in the private sector.\nMargin lending for shares is a small part of China's total debt portfolio, however. In May before the market downturn happened, it equalled about 3.2 per cent of China's gross domestic product and about 1.7 per cent of China's debt load. On June 7, after the liquidation of 21 per cent of the margin loan pool, it equalled 2.5 per cent of GDP and about 1.3 per cent of the debt load.\nIt's difficult to see margin lending losses triggering a debt tsunami on those numbers: and while Chinese listed companies are also pressured by falling share prices, the market is only back to where it was in March. Any company that geared itself on the basis of its peak market value in June would surely be an outlier.\nThere's a wrinkle that makes the Chinese margin-loan market more vulnerable than those in the West. Because it wanted to use the sharemarket to develop a middle-class cadre, the government last year allowed investors to open up to 20 separate margin lending accounts.\nThat means the spread of investing in China through margin lending during the boom has been overstated, and the concentration of margin lending has been understated. There are fewer investors in the market than most think, but the ones who are in are carrying relatively big debt loads.\nAs in the Western markets, however, Chinese margin loans have been made as a percentage of the market value of the shares being acquired. Just as they would have to in Australia, Chinese investors must inject top-up equity into loans if share values fall below loan valuation ratios. If they sell shares to do so, they add to selling pressure in the market.\nThe big Chinese brokers lent money on a loan-to-valuation ratio of 50 per cent. Shares bought using those credit lines needed to fall 50 per cent before a call for more equity was issued. The market as a whole fell 30 per cent, although individual falls varied.\nSmaller Chinese brokers lent money on a more aggressive loan-valuation ratio of 75 per cent. Share investments funded in that way needed to fall only 25 per cent to generate a call for extra capital. Many of these more aggressively geared positions would have been hit by margin calls and share sales to fund them that strengthened the market downdraft. China's margin debt load fell from $US334 billion at the end of May to $US261 billion on July 7 as positions were liquidated.\nWhere to from here? If the market doesn't recover, there will be more margin calls when shares that have been suspended resume trading again. If another plunge is avoided, however, margin losses created by the first downturn will eventually be cleared: one guess is that about half the margin losses have been taken so far.\nSystemic risk from the market slump \"is not the big issue\", says Lim Say Boon, chief investment officer of of Singapore-based DBS bank.\nThe government's decision to try to \"stabilise the market by restricting market forces\" will, however, damage confidence in China's new middle class in particular if it fails, he says.\nIt was the artificially induced market boom rather than the slump that followed that signalled Beijing was short of growth options, he adds. Now the markets are sidelined, and China's government risks losing political capital, \"which in China is every bit as important as financial capital\". What will it do next to lock in the 7 per cent-plus growth rate that it wants?", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/shanghai_short_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-07-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T07:33:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
