A spokesman for the airport added that it did not “currently envision the need for a congestion charge, but there may be a case for one after 2030”. \nLord Adonis, the former transport secretary, said on Monday that the noise envelope, which the commission said might stipulate that there should be “no overall increase above current levels”, was one of the “weaknesses” of Sir Howard’s report. \nReady for take-off \n“There’s a huge debate about what 'overall increase' means,” Lord Adonis said, adding that it could mean “total incidence of noise, high levels of noise, noise in particular communities”. He warned that it was the type of issue the Government could spend years investigating before giving the Heathrow runway the greenlight. \nIt came as Mr Holland-Kaye announce plans for a new “Heathrow Garden City” that would see about 9,000 homes built in Hounslow. It is understood that the development would be funded by Hounslow Council, although the masterplan has been developed in partnership with Heathrow. \nThe council said the plan was not dependent on a third runway and that it is “is extremely conceptual”. \n= Noise has driven distrust of airports, says CAA boss = \nA perception of “broken promises” over aircraft noise has driven the break-down of relations between Heathrow and local residents, according to Andrew Haines, the chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority. \nSpeaking at the Runways UK conference, Mr Haines said that Britain was behind other countries in tackling the issue. \n“It could be argued that the UK historically has been far less innovative than international counterparts in developing ways to reduce aviation noise,” he said. \n“We haven’t pushed the boundaries of what is possible for a whole variety of reasons, and not all of those rest with the airport or indeed the airline industry. As a consequence relations with some communities have broken down.” \nHe added: “There is a perception the industry has broken promises in the past.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T21:03:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
