Lawmakers on Wednesday were debating the second such package after approving the first last week. \nOnly after Greece approves the required legislation will the 18 other eurozone leaders start negotiations over a three-year bailout worth up to 86 billion euros, Greece's third rescue programme in five years. \nUntil the package can take effect, the ELA is the only available source of financing for Greek banks and, by extension, the sole financial lifeline preventing the Greek economy from imploding.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T18:56:46.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
