Photo: Reuters\nChina's Shanghai Composite Index tumbled to its lowest level since March as rallies by state-owned giants failed to outweigh a record drop in margin bets.\nThe benchmark gauge sank 4.2 per cent to 3618.83 at 1.02pm, with more than 30 stocks falling for every one that rose. Technology, health-care and material shares led losses, while PetroChina Co surged 6.5 per cent on speculation of state fund buying. Hong Kong's Hang Seng China Enterprises Index headed for a bear market with a 20 per cent drop since May.\nA flurry of measures to stabilise the market, including a pledge by state-run financial firms to buy 120 billion yuan worth of shares and a halt to initial public offerings, is failing to stop the rout that erased more than $US3.2 trillion of value in less than a month. Traders cut 93.6 billion yuan ($US15 billion) worth of shareholdings purchased with borrowed money on the Shanghai exchange on Monday, the most since at least 2010.\n\"The sell-off is continuing as the amount of the government's stabilisation fund isn't enough to stem the decline,\" said Wei Wei, an analyst at Huaxi Securities Co. in Shanghai. \"It's important for the government to stabilise the overall market and recover confidence. If not, small caps will drop further and even big caps might not hold on going forward.\"\nAdvertisement The CSI 300 Index fell 5.3 per cent, while the ChiNext measure of smaller companies sank 5.7 per cent. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slid 3.5 per cent. The Hang Seng Index, which entered a correction Monday with an 11 per cent loss from April highs, retreated 1.5 per cent.\nDaily limit More than 500 stocks on the 1,106-member Shanghai Composite dropped by the 10 per cent daily limit. Gauges of technology, telecom, drug and material stocks in the CSI 300 slid at least 7 per cent for the steepest losses among industry groups.\nLeshi Internet Information & Technology (Beijing) Co., the most heavily weighted stock in the ChiNext, fell 10 per cent for a second day, while East Money Information Co., the second biggest, plunged 10 per cent. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. also tumbled by the daily limit, extending losses to 39 per cent during a five-day retreat. Brokerages led declines in the H- shares gauge, with Citic Securities Co. and Haitong Securities Co. slumping more than 9 per cent.\nChina Railway Construction Corp. paced gains for big caps in the mainland, surging 9.5 per cent. China Communications Construction Co. gained 7.8 per cent.\nMore measures PetroChina has surged 31 per cent since June 26 as state- directed funds piled into shares of China's biggest companies to prop up the market. The rally has propelled PetroChina's market capitalisation to $US382 billion, surpassing Google to become the world's second-largest company behind Apple.\nPresident Xi Jinping's government has rushed out an unprecedented series of measures to halt the selloff. In the latest attempt, the China Financial Futures Exchange announced it will limit the daily trading volumes of index futures linked to the CSI 500 Index, while 57 mutual funds pledged to invest more in their funds. These steps have so far failed to convince investors that valuations are cheap enough after a 28 per cent drop in the Shanghai gauge from this year's high on June 12.\nThe stocks gauge is valued at 14.7 times 12-month projected earnings, compared with the five-year average multiple of 10.3, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nAt stake is the fate of a stock-market that's lured record amounts of amateur investors and grown to become the world's second-largest outside the US, with a market capitalisation of $US6.9 trillion. Further losses threaten Chinese companies' efforts to curb leverage with new share sales, and may erode consumer confidence amid the weakest economic growth since 1990.\nPremier Li Keqiang said China is confident and capable of dealing with all kinds of challenges and risks and will promote a sustainable and healthy development of the economy, according to a statement on the central government's website.\n\"This is a real testing moment for the leadership,\" said Zhao Xijun, deputy dean of Renmin University's School of Finance. \"They must rescue the market with all their means. The 'what if' scenario cannot be allowed. The evaporation of fortunes of more than 80 million individual investors would pose unthinkable social problems for the country.\"\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T21:48:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
