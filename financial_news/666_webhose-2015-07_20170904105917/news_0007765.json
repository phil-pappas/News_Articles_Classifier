Now glue 2 floral rings (smaller one over the bigger one) and secure it with four wooden shims. Once your centre has been secured well, start laying all the wooden shims around the floral rings. \nStep 2 \nOnce you are happy with its placement, stick the wooden shims to the floral ring using some hot glue. Ensure you apply some pressure on the sticks after you have pasted them onto the ring. After you have stuck all the shims, set them aside to dry. After they have dried, spray paint them. You could also cover the shims with some dark varnish and you will have a burnt effect. \nStep 3 \nYou could stop right there or go a step further and create a more dramatic effect by add another layer of wooden shims in between every (earlier placed) wooden shims. But remember, the second layered shims have to be shorter than the first layer and they need to be placed between two shims. \nTo give the piece some depth, paint these shims a bit lighter and finish the mirror off by adding a coat of clear varnish. \nStep 4 \nNow place a round mirror right in the center and secure it by using some hot strong glue or silicon glue. Now your custom made sun burst mirror centerpiece is ready to adorn your wall. If you have white walls, you will love the contrast! \nNidhi C Thacker for IndiaProperty.com \nImage: http://www.9thandmayne.com/2012/12/52-projects52-weeks-week-2-diy-sunburst-mirror-26/", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T02:14:55.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
