Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jill Margo Just as amphetamines such as ecstasy can augment a man's mood, so can they diminish his sexual performance.\nPreliminary research from Taiwan suggests men who abuse amphetamines are more likely to experience erectile dysfunction.\nResearchers questioned more than 1000 men from a drug treatment program who used amphetamines for recreational purposes. These men didn't use other drugs.\nFor a comparison, they also questioned more than 200 men of similar ages who did not abuse drugs at all.\nAmong the users, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 29 per cent. Among non-users it was 12 per cent, according to results published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine .\nDysfunction rates were twice as high if the drug users also smoked.\nThe investigators suggest amphetamines possibly interfere with the central nervous system, act as neurotoxins, and/or impair penile smooth muscle and endothelial function.\nIllicit drug use also has a psychosocial impact that may influence a man's sexual health.\n While some took amphetamines for the aphrodisiac effect, the number of men reporting enhanced sexual desire was equal to the number reporting a reduced desire.\nDose seems to play a role. The higher the dose, the more negative the impact on performance.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110990585086401178539/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/jillmargo1"], "published": "2015-07-21T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:04:56.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
