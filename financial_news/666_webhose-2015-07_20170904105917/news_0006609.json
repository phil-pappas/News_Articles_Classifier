Revolving credit such as credit cards increased at an annual rate of 2%, while non-revolving credit, such as an auto loans or student loans, increased at an annual rate of 7%. The amount of credit being used has risen since February.Of course, retail sales dipped 0.3% in June, according to the Commerce Department, following May's 1.0% increase (revised from the 1.2%, the Department originally reported). Still with retail sales projected to grow 5% for the year , compared to 4.7% last year, and wages set to reach 2.5% growth by the end of the year, consumers' pockets are more flush with cash, their psychology more confident to spend. \nAs the economy has improved, credit card issuers have been more willing to extend credit, especially to consumers with less than pristine credit profiles such as individuals with a credit score of 650 or below, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for by Bankrate, the North Palm Beach, Fla.-based financial content company.
