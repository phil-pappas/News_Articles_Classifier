She's doesn't know how long that will take.\nMore importantly, Sandy -- a single mom -- wants to help her two adult children buy homes.\nShe's already given one child $20,000 for a down payment, and the other will soon receive the same amount.\n\"I feel like I have to do for one what I have done for the other,\" she says.\nSandy wonders what effect this will have on her retirement, especially because she is borrowing the money and still owes $200,000 on her mortgage.\n\"Realistically, I want to just be able to retire without owing the $40,000 from helping my kids,\" she says.\nAdding to her anxiety is she may not be eligible for old age security.\n\"I don't think I qualify for (it) because I'm a permanent resident,\" says Sandy, who has lived in Canada for more than three decades.\nEarning about $80,000 annually, she plans to set aside as much as possible toward savings and debt. She hopes to retire at 60.\nBut with so many obstacles in her way, she's not sure she can.\n\"Hopefully, I can get some advice to help.\"\nShane Verity, a certified financial planner with the Blando Group at ScotiaMcLeod in Winnipeg, has come up with two options for Sandy.\n\"One involves her retiring at 60, and the other has her waiting a little bit longer,\" he says.\nBut first, he wants to address Sandy's old age security concerns. Even though she isn't a Canadian citizen, she likely qualifies for it. The question is, how much?\n\"If Sandy arrived in Canada and became a permanent resident at age 21, she would be eligible for the maximum OAS benefit,\" he says. \"If, however, she doesn't meet the full OAS requirements, she would still be eligible for partial pension.\"\nTo find out, Sandy needs to contact Service Canada. While she's at it, she should also get an estimate for her Canada Pension Plan, which will be another important income stream during retirement.\nThe question of when Sandy can retire will largely be determined by the growth of her defined-contribution pension plan and her ability to pay off her line of credit quickly.\nBased on her pension contributions, along with her employer's matching amount, Sandy should meet her target of $400,000 by the end of 2018. This is based on her investments providing a five per cent return annually, the benchmark for a balanced portfolio, which is the typical investment allocation for pension plans.\nIf Sandy wants to pay off the first $20,000 owing from helping out child No. 1 by that date, she will need to pay $225 a month more than the $430 she is paying on her debt. To pay off the additional $20,000 from helping child No. 2, Sandy will have to pay an additional $900 a month.\nShe'd still have a mortgage by then, too, owing about $176,000. As for her retirement assets, her pension would be worth about $410,000, while her RRSP and TFSA would be worth about $38,000 and $10,000, respectively.\n\"If she retired at this point, she may consider taking CPP at 60, but she would need to factor in the impact of the reduced benefit,\" Verity says.\nFor every month Sandy draws CPP prior to age 65, she would see a 0.6 per cent reduction in benefit.\n\"If she took CPP at age 60, she would see a 36 per cent reduction overall.\"\nThat's one reason it's important Sandy gets in touch with Service Canada to get a CPP estimate.\nShe has to consider whether she can afford to make the higher debt payments on this accelerated repayment schedule.\nSandy earns about $4,170 every month, plus a small pension of $450 a month. Her expenses, including debt payments, are $3,631.\nIf she added another $1,100 a month in debt payments, she'd likely have a small deficit every month -- though she probably can adjust spending to balance her budget.\nThe retirement picture for Sandy is much improved, however, if she delays retirement by three years.\nIf she retires at the start of 2022, her pension will grow to more than $500,000.\nMoreover, she would not need to accelerate payments to pay off the first debt incurred from helping child No. 1. And she would only need to make $400 monthly payments to pay off the debt from child No. 2.\nBy then, she will owe about $153,000 on the mortgage and her RRSP will be worth about $64,000, while her TFSA will be worth about $17,000.\nSandy would also draw on CPP later, reducing the impact of the penalty for early withdrawal.\n\"She could likely also postpone receipt of CPP to age 63,\" Verity says.\nInstead of a 36 per cent decrease, CPP would be reduced by about 14 per cent from what she is entitled to at age 65. Yet these numbers are somewhat meaningless unless Sandy knows whether her savings and pension income will be enough to cover expenses once retired.\n\"Based on Sandy's monthly budget, it appears she is living off $31,900 a year, including her regular mortgage payments,\" Verity says.\nKey pieces to the equation will be CPP and OAS -- thus the importance of her finding out the official estimates for both.\nBased on savings alone, Verity says Sandy could draw an annual income of about $19,000 after taxes -- inflation adjusted -- at age 60, which would last until age 100 if her portfolio earns about five per cent a year.\nBy delaying retirement by three years, she could draw about $24,000 net annually based on the same rates of return and inflation. The government pensions would fill in the rest.\nWhile Sandy can achieve her goal, she will have to stick to a pretty tight budget. And she cannot understand the full retirement picture without doing the legwork regarding government pensions.\n\"It is very important Sandy collects accurate information in this respect, because without it, she will not truly know what her retirement income will look like,\" Verity says.\n\njoelschles@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T14:28:16.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
