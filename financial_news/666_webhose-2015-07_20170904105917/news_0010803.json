The FTSE 100 dropped 50.1 points, or 0.8pc, to close at 6,535.68, near five-month lows. The German Dax dropped 1.5pc, while the Cac in France lost 2pc. \nThe sell-off also took its lead from a slump in Asian stocks, where the effects of the Chinese government’s audacious attempts to prop up its stock markets proved short-lived. \nThe Greek electorate delivered an emphatic vote against the terms offered on Sunday’s bailout ballot , although European authorities have already embarked upon a further round of talks to prop up Athens within the currency union this time without Greece’s firebrand finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, who resigned on Monday. \nA pound could buy €1.41 on Monday, a rise of 0.64pc. \n“For the first time, we now believe that the more likely scenario (60pc probability) is that Greece fails to secure sustainable bailout funding,” said Eric Lascelles at RBC Capital Markets. “Greece’s future trajectory should become much clearer over the next week - when Europe will signal its willingness to negotiate once again with Greece with its fate likely sealed one way or the other over the next few weeks as those negotiations occur in the lead-up to a major ECB debt repayment due on July 20.” \nJP Morgan and Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) also said the outcome of the vote made a Greek exit from the currency union the most likely option, while other analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) and elsewhere said opportunities for a deal are still available. * Follow the latest news on the Greek crisis * Ambrose Evans-Pritchard on the departure of Varoufakis Back in London, the engine-maker Rolls-Royce became the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, losing 6.3p to 802.5p after its third profit warning in nine months . Warren East, the group’s new chief executive, said he was “clearly disappointed” by the downgrade in expected earnings from at least £1.4bn to at least £1.33bn for the year. \nRival engineer BAE Systems (LSE: BA.L - news ) was unaffected by its peer’s travails, with its shares up 2p to 454.3p thanks to an upgrade from analysts at Morgan Stanley. \nRoyal Mail (Other OTC: ROYMF - news ) was also on the receiving end of an encouraging research note, rising 1.1pc to 510.5p after house broker Goldman Sachs lifted its target price from 585p to 610p in the hope that improving cost control could drive better profits. \nTurning back to the fallers, shares in the tour operator Tui , which have now fallen more than a tenth since the tragedy in Tunisia two weeks ago, dropped by 33p, or 3.1pc, to £10.17. The group is suffering from vanishing demand for North African and Greek getaways, which each represent about 10pc of all sales volumes, according to analysts at Jefferies. \nMid-cap contemporary Thomas Cook (Xetra: A0MR3W - news ) fell 4.8pc to 125.6p. \nMany resource companies were also in the red, under pressure as the price of oil hit a three-month low and other commodities including copper sank. \nPump-maker Weir Group was the chief casualty, slipping more than 3pc to £16.66. \nLondon shares in South32 (Berlin: 32Z.BE - news ) , the £5.8bn mining spin-out from BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) , fell 1.5p to 84.25p despite a new “buy” rating from UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) , whose investment bankers helped float the firm on three stock markets in May. The analysts see cost savings of $500m following the demerger, along with the potential to increase output. \nM&S has made an online land grab \nAmong the risers, Marks & Spencer (Other OTC: MAKSF - news ) led the pack with an 8.5p rise to 547p, following news that it plans to expand its free “click and collect” service across more than 100 food outlets. The retailer, which is due to report interim results on Wednesday, has made a grab for the online market just days after John Lewis said it would introduce a £2 charge for click and collect orders. \nHousebuilders made some of the biggest gains on Monday, after Barclays raised its view on the sector. Jon Bell, an analyst at the bank, said that the clamour for new homes is far from being satisfied, underpinned by the Help to Buy mortgage scheme and the improving economy. \n“With material shortages having abated, the only ‘fly in the ointment’ on the production side is the availability of skilled labour, which unless addressed could hold back medium-term volume growth,” he wrote. \nRedrow , named as a top pick by Barclays, rose 1pc to 465.5p, while Barratt Developments increased by the same magnitude to 646p and Grainger (LSE: GRI.L - news ) increased 3pc to 232.2p. \nSticking with bricks and mortar, Marshalls , a small-cap supplier of concrete and paving stones, was up 0.7pc at 321.75p after a trading update revealed its half-year revenues were up 11pc. However, most of the growth came from public sector work and large commercial projects, rather than its smaller housing business. \nThe Aim-listed construction safety group Billington added to the buoyant building sector, with its shares up nearly 19pc to 262.5p on the back of news that its results will be “significantly ahead” of expectations. \nAim-listed gas-to-liquids producer Velocys , meanwhile, dropped 19.35pc to 92.75p, its lowest closing price since 2012, after it suspended its chief executive pending an investigation into claims of serious misconduct.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T22:31:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
