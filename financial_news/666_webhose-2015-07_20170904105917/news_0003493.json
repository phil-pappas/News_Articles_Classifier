How, or even why, should bonds be held following a multi-year period of strong performance, anticipating a more difficult period ahead?\nFor a variety of reasons the environment for bonds could become more challenging, but several oft-cited myths may be leading investors to ignore this important asset class.\nMyth 1: Interest rates are headed higher and prices on bonds are headed lower\nThis is probably only partially true. Yes, most signs point to the US Federal Reserve lifting its target rate as early as September on the back of an economy that is finally, post-GFC, strong enough to withstand the removal of aggressive monetary stimulus. However, the Fed may not raise rates as quickly or to as high a level as in previous cycles.\nIt is also important to keep in mind that the Fed only controls short-term interest rates; higher long-term interest rates tend to be a result of strong growth and/or rising inflation expectations – neither of which we are seeing at present.\nBut the US may be nearly alone in its move upward. Here in Australia the last two interest rate moves made by the RBA have been cuts, with a bias towards more of the same as the economy continues to require stimulus to cure the hangover of the mining boom.\nIn Europe and Japan, policymakers are combating environments generally characterised by low growth, high unemployment, high debt and on-again-off-again deflationary pressures, meaning they may be hard pressed to raise interest rates this decade. The bottom line is that: 1) there is a divergent global picture with rates headed higher in certain regions, stable in some, and lower in others, and; 2) short-term and long-term rates may react in different ways.\n Myth 2: Higher interest rates are a bad thing for bond investors\nAs noted, higher rates may not occur as quickly or dramatically as some expect, but for argument's sake let's assume for a moment that rates do head higher (and after more than 20 years of falling interest rates this is bound to occur eventually).\nBut higher interest rates mean that future interest income and proceeds from maturing bonds are reinvested at higher yields. And higher yields attract buyers seeking higher income to the market, thus providing some support to bond prices.\nOf course, there can be some short-term pain as bond prices fall in response to higher yields, but the picture is not necessarily as dark as some would have us believe. A good rule of thumb is that a bond fund's duration can be used to approximate its interest rate sensitivity. The Bloomberg AusBond Composite, for example, has a duration of 4.6 years, meaning that a 1 per cent rise in yields across the yield curve would likely lead to a price decline of about 4.6 per cent. International treasuries and global corporate bonds (duration of 7.1 and 6 years, respectively) have somewhat higher interest rate sensitivity, but are also highly diversified and, as noted earlier, divergent interest rate environments.\nThe duration can also be used to approximate the amount of time it takes for the higher income generated from higher yields to offset the initial price decline. For patient investors in accumulation and for investors with a multi-year need for income in retirement, higher interest rates can be a good thing.\nMyth 3: A low interest rate environment diminishes bonds' role in a portfolio\nInterest rates are low by historical standards, but so is inflation.\nOver the next 10 years a reasonable return expectation for a globally diversified bond portfolio is around 3 to 3.5 per cent, but with inflation anticipated to be around 2 per cent, bonds are expected to fulfil their role as a generator of real returns.\nRegardless of the outlook for returns, bonds provide diversification benefits to riskier asset classes such as equities: while they can experience periods of volatility, it generally pales in comparison to volatility experienced by equities, and high-quality bonds tend to provide considerable downside protection during equity market corrections and bear markets.\nTo be clear, an equity market correction or bear market is not Vanguard's central forecast at this point, but with valuations on equities globally generally on the high side, lower returns than those experienced over the last several years can be expected.\nInvestors should not rule out an increase in volatility – as we have seen recently – following an extended period of very low volatility.\nAre bonds without risk? Of course not. Many segments of the bond market today – particularly higher-risk and lower-rated corporate bonds or \"high-yield\" bonds – offer very little compensation in the form of additional yield for their greater risk, making it an especially dangerous time for investors to \"reach for yield\".\nBond markets are unlikely to repeat the 7-plus per cent annualised returns of the past 15 years. And the risk exists that policymakers, with no historical playbook, will struggle to exit from exceptionally aggressive and accommodative policy measures.\nThe key for investors is to maintain reasonable return expectations, remain disciplined in the face of uncertainty and noise regarding the interest rate outlook, and to remember that, when it unfolds, a rising interest rate environment is ultimately a good thing for investors focused on income and defence despite the potential price declines that could be experienced in the short-to-intermediate term.\nA globally diversified fund mitigates the risks and preserves the benefits of the asset class, which continues to serve a key role for investors in an uncertain, challenging, and potentially more volatile investment environment.\nJeffrey Johnson is the head of the investment strategy group for Vanguard Asia-Pacific, based in Melbourne.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T11:07:58.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
