Rubicon founder Gordon Fell is finally doing something to fix the ratty pool out the back of the Sydney trophy home, Routala, that he bought for a smidge under $29 million in 2007.\nA few months after Ardent Leisure chief executive officer Deb Thomas 's Woollahra council approved the development application, construction has begun at the Point Piper palace.\nIt seems our threats to stop coming to the controversial businessman 's summer Gatsby parties have finally hit the mark.\nAll this as the case against him by the receivers for Allco Finance Group, the business Fell co-founder with the late David Coe , rises again in the Supreme Court. An estimated 20 hearing days are scheduled to start next month.\nIt makes the house a worthy addition to our wildly popular segment, The Rich List's Grand Designs .\nSo what is landscaper Myles Baldwin Design doing for Gordon and his wife Pip?\n\"The proposal comprises a minor extension of the existing pool, a recessed sitting area with a pergola above, a new stair from the dwelling to the pool level and associated landscaping,\" says the modest development application.\nIt will cost only $245,000.\n Back in 2013 the property was reportedly shopped around at the same time that receivers Ferrier Hodgson brought legal action against Fell in the Supreme Court for damages and breaches of his duties as a director. The place was never officially listed.\nSo what to make of the renovation work?\nTo our eyes, the new pool and garden don't look to be aimed at Chinese premium buyers – which might suggest the couple are holding tight for now.\nNot that we would be in a hurry to flick the place which sits five houses down the road from Altona, the house publisher Deke Miskin​ sold to a Chinese buyer for $52 million in 2013.\nFell's five-bedroom place has full frontal Harbour Bridge views, two home offices, its own jetty onto the Harbour, a cellar that can store 5000 bottles of Grange (and lesser drops), fortress-like walls to keep the riff-raff out and ( don't tell Pacific Equity Partners founder Paul McCullagh​ ) a seven-car garage.\nOne for each day of the week.\nAnd all in easy walking distance to Malcolm and Lucy Turnbull 's place, and Amber Keating and John Symond 's, which would be particularly useful during the Christmas party season.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow", "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/property/rubicon-founder-gordon-fells-30m-home-up-for-sale/story-fn9656lz-1226658069461"], "published": "2015-07-13T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:04:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
