The signing of this MoU will further cement the relationship between CFFEX and MOEX, generating new opportunities for the two exchanges to step up cooperation in the common pursuit for development,” he noted. \n“In recent years China has become Russia’s biggest trading partner, and that cross-border commerce is increasingly settled in our national currencies. Likewise, Yuan-Ruble trading on Moscow Exchange has grown rapidly, increasing sevenfold last year alone. In response to client demand, we also launched Yuan-Ruble futures trading earlier this year, and in just a few months the instrument has become a core offering on our FX derivatives platform. Today’s MoU with CFFEX is the first step in exploring new opportunities for cooperation on various fronts,” added Mr. Afanasiev in an accompanying statement. \nThis is the first business development for MOEX since last month when the exchange launched a number of instruments and upgrades across a number of asset classes on its platform. As a result of the changes, MOEX clients gained a variety of upgrades and product offerings across its equity, bond and repo markets. This included all anonymous trading conducted in OFZs on MOEX that now settle on the T+1 cycle, thereby replacing the existing T0 and T+2 settlement schedule. Got a news tip?
