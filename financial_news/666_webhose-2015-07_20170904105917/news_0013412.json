Reports, later confirmed, surfaced shortly after midday that Greece was reconsidering a proposal made late on Monday by European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker. \nThe key aspect of that \"proposal\" was the inclusion of a commitment to evaluate a softening of the terms on the Mediterranean countryÂ´s debt pile in October. \nLater in the afternoon however, reports indicated that German chancellor Angela Merkel had said that no new agreement was possible until after the Greek referendum on 5 July, although another Eurogroup meeting had been scheduled for 18:00 on Tuesday. \nCredit-default swap contracts on Greek debt were putting the probability of a default by the country within five years at 88%, versus 71% as of Friday. \nThat came as 10-year Greek government bond yields edged higher by another 35 basis points to 15.42%, while euro/dollar was 0.76% lower to reach 1.1149. \nTo take note of, some analysts had begun to highlight how a \"reversible\" euro, where countries could indeed be forced out, was indeed a 'negative' for the currency, albeit perhaps more on a medium-term basis. \nIronically, the euro was on track for its first quarterly advance since the start of 2014, after having risen by approximately 4%. \nYields on 10-year Gilts and benchmark US Treasury notes slipped slightly lower following the sharp drops seen on the previous day. \nBoth were lower by one basis point to 2.02% and 2.31%, respectively. \nFed funds futures were pricing in a 28% probability of a first rate hike by the US Federal Reserve by September, down from 38% on 26 June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T21:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T01:44:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
