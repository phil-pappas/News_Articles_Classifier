Before Gustave Flaubert published his masterpiece in 1857, readers had become accustomed to characters that were either good or bad, with well-defined roles in a story. But unless you're Tony Abbott, life is not like that.\n\"No monsters, and no heroes!\" Flaubert proclaimed in a letter to Georges Sand. Instead of a hero, Flaubert gave us a novel full of anti-heroes: flawed, selfish characters blind to their own faults, weaknesses and delusions.\nHe was the first author to anatomise the experience of mediocrity – a depressingly common aspect of the human condition. He would describe this state in language of such brilliance and precision that his story took on an epic quality.\nTerminator Genisys, the latest instalment of the Terminator franchise, stars Emilia Clarke, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Australian actor Jai Courtney. The only precedent for this achievement is probably Don Quixote , a book Flaubert revered. For the past 150 years, Flaubert's critics have tried to claim him for one camp or another. To some he was the master realist who killed off the romantic novel; to others he was the precursor of the nouveau roman, with its near-photographic descriptions.\nFlaubert, who hated labels, defies categorisation. Madame Bovary retains many elements of the romantic novel, and is filled with stylistic flourishes unthinkable to the French formalists of the 1960s. It is a novel of contradictions by an author who was never afraid of contradicting himself in letters to friends.\nAll of this makes Madame Bovary a supremely difficult book to adapt for the cinema, for when we lose touch with Flaubert's language we are left with a production that cannot fail to disappoint the novel's admirers.\nIt was therefore brave of French-American director, Sophie Barthes, to venture into a field where Jean Renoir, Vincente Minnelli and Claude Chabrol failed to impress. It would be wonderful to say she has triumphed where her distinguished forebears flopped, but in fact she fails pretty comprehensively.\n Barthes' Madame Bovary presents a dry, clipped version of the story, shorn of many key elements, including the crucial ball scene where Emma Bovary gets her first glimpse of a more glamorous life. Among other questionable excisions, she has left out the the Bovarys' daughter, which diminishes our understanding of a woman who loves the idea of herself as a mother, but is indifferent to the reality.\nSatire loses its sting The story of Madame Bovary is so well known I won't attempt an extended outline. Barthes seems to assume that her audience already knows the plot because she gives away the ending in the the opening scenes before switching to flashback mode.\nIn brief, it is a tale of thwarted desires and adultery set in a claustrophobic hamlet in Normandy. Emma is the ultimate bored housewife, her husband Charles a provincial doctor with no special talents or ambitions. Her fall from grace occurs through her pursuit of two love affairs and a grand passion for luxury goods which sends the household to the brink of ruin.\nThe power of the story resides in the personalities of Yonville's leading citizens: Hommais, the pedantic pharmacist, who styles himself as an intellectual powerhouse; l'Abbe Bournisien, the complacent priest; and Lheureux, the wily merchant who seeks to entrap his customers with a generous line of credit. These characters build up a composite portrait of bourgeois duplicity and small-mindedness. They are also the best asset for any filmmaker, as they offer fantastic opportunities for an actor.\nThe acting may well be the highlight of Barthes' adaptation, with the reliable Paul Giamatti playing the pharmacist, and Rhys Ifans giving us a memorable, reptilian Lheureux. The disappointment is that Hommais, who looms monstrously in the novel, is reduced to a bit player in this film. This tends to transform a coruscating satire on the bourgeoisie into a quaint period drama.\nThe character of Emma Bovary is the key to any adaptation, and Mia Wasikowska is not right for the part. While she was perfect as Jane Eyre, and even as Robyn Davidson in Tracks (2013), Wasikowska is far too level-headed to play Emma. Jennifer Jones was more vivacious in the Minnelli version, while Chabrol's favourite actress, Isabelle Huppert, did an excellent job of capturing Emma's ineffable blend of sensuality and indifference.\nLike Carey Mulligan in the new adaptation of Far From the Madding Crowd , Wasikowska seems like a girl playing the role of a woman. Mulligan could just about pull it off, but Wasikowska is never convincing. This is no reflection on the quality of her performance, but it's a hopeless task.\nThe same might be said for Ezra Miller in the role of Emma's second lover, Leon Dupuis. Leon thinks of himself as a man of passion, but Flaubert reveals him as a bourgeois-in-the-making. Miller's youthfulness makes him seem more like an impulsive teenager.\nThe viewer who has never read Madame Bovary will most probably see only a well-made costume drama. This may be sufficient for a night at the movies, but there is no special art in turning a literary icon into a superior soap opera. Flaubert may have fashioned greatness from mediocrity, but Barthes has reversed the process.\nAll fat and sugar If Sophie Barthes expects viewers to be already familiar with the story of Madame Bovary , the producers of Terminator Genisys seem to expect audiences to be intimately acquainted with every aspect of a franchise that began as far back as 1984.\nI'm reliably informed that this new film skips the third and fourth sequels, and relates directly to the first two Terminator movies directed by James Cameron. These are the only two I've seen, but I was still bamboozled by this latest instalment.\nIt's awful to speak of films in terms of \"franchises\", a word that conjures up thoughts of fast food joints, but this is an apt metaphor for the kind of big-budget movies Hollywood is churning out – all fat and sugar, with no nutrition for the mind or the soul.\nTerminator Genisys is typical of the breed: a monumental CGI fest with an appalling script, an incomprehensible plot, and action scenes so implausible that one feels like laughing out loud. The director anointed to helm this enterprise is one Alan Taylor, known for that immortal classic of the silver screen, Thor: The Dark World (2013).\nYou may recall that the Terminator films posit a future in which the machines have taken over from mankind, with humanity's only hope lying with the leader of the resistance movement, John Connor. The machines respond by sending a cyborg assassin back in time to eliminate John's mother, Sarah Connor, ensuring their nemesis will never be born. In the first Terminator that nameless assassin was Arnold Schwarzenegger, in a career-defining role. By the time of the sequel he had changed sides, becoming Sarah's protector.\nTerminator Genisys finds Arnie as \"Pops\", an \"old but not obsolete\" T-800 cyborg still protecting Sarah against the machines. The new Sarah is Emilia Clarke, better known for her role as a scantily clad dragon whisperer in Game of Thrones . Her other protector is Kyle Reese, sent back from the future by John Connor himself. The new Kyle is Australian actor Jai Courtney, while the new John is Queensland's own Jason Clarke, no relation to Emilia.\nTemporal gymnastics The wrinkle in the plot is that Kyle, whom John rescued as a child, is also supposed to be John's father – if you can figure that out. When John himself turns up in an evil altered state, the nuclear family is complete – mum and dad, a son who is much older than they are, and a cyborg grandpa. CGI mayhem ensues as the action leaps from 1984 to 2017, with Kyle, Sarah and Pops attempting to prevent the launch of a world-dominating computer network called Genisys, while John goes in to bat for the other side.\nThe concept of time travel has given rise to some subtle science fiction scenarios and a vast collection of idiocies. The new Terminator gets so entangled in temporal paradoxes it could blow a cyborg's circuits trying to figure it out. Arnie is appointed our guide, gabbing on about \"quantum fields\" and other bits of pseudoscientific bunk.\nBy this stage, I was so thoroughly confused I wouldn't have been surprised to learn that Arnie was really Kyle's fairy godmother. The trick, presumably, was to discard any remaining threads of logic and simply enjoy the spectacle of buildings exploding; cars, motorbikes, buses and helicopters crashing; cyborgs zapping each other full of holes; and so on.\nWhen Arnie said \"I'll be back,\" before plunging out of a helicopter without a parachute, I can't have been the only viewer who emitted an involuntary groan.\nIn the first two Terminator movies the gags actually seemed funny. The theme of \"What is a human being? What is a robot?\" still had currency, as did the spectre of a world controlled by a centralised computer. Nowadays, as Edward Snowden has shown us, the entire planet may be monitored at the whim of an intelligence agency.\nMedia organisations have already begun to use software programs to write stories, but nowhere is the victory of the machines more complete than in Hollywood where scriptwriting duties for blockbuster films seem to have been handed over to robots.\nLacking human imagination and sensitivity, they stitch together cliches from old B-grade movies as they seek to reduce viewers to mindless, popcorn-munching zombies who need to absorb the same formulas again and again. Judging by the box office receipts, the machines are already in control.\nJohn McDonald also writes about visual art for The Sydney Morning Herald.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:06:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
