Where do you go and what do you bring? How do you keep the little ones entertained? Many resorts in the U.S. are making travel-planning for families just a little easier by providing what children need, from play areas to kids' meals. Even better, these places provide numerous activities and supervised kids' clubs, allowing mom and dad to really take a break. Here are 10 properties in the U.S. with kid-friendly attractions such as water parks and arcades, and lots of perks for parents such as golf and spa treatments. Kalahari Resorts Pocono Manor, Pennsylvania At the African-themed Kalahari in Pocono Manor, Pa., the goal is to not only provide what kids need but give them what they really want all in one place: thrilling rides in a 100,000-square-foot indoor water park, arcade games where tickets won can be exchanged for prizes, and a kid's camp with daily activities from storytelling to cookie-decorating. For the big kids, Kalahari's indoor water park offers stand-up surfing or body boarding on the FlowRider and wild waterslides such as the Anaconda and Swahili Swirl. Supervised toddlers and infants can splash around in play areas like Tiko's Watering Hole, while adults get drinks at the Thirsty Turtle Swim-Up bar. Kids can spend hours in the entertainment center playing arcade games, mini-bowling or backlight mini golf, while mom and dad get spa treatments. At Camp Kalahari, the resort's activities team will keep kids busy with contests, interactive games and crafts, so mom and dad can go shopping for souvenirs. Named after the desert in southern Africa, Kalahari was inspired by the most recent Africa trip Todd Nelson, owner of Kalahari Resorts and Conventions, took with his family. Many pieces of furniture and artwork have been sourced from six different African countries that the family has visited. Some items sold at Kalahari's retail shops like home decors and jewelry were imported from Africa; Java Manjaro in the lobby serves coffee made from handpicked Rwandan coffee beans. \"Our all-under-one-roof getaway offers something fun for kids of every age group,\" says Nelson. \"We also offer a unique experience, not typical of other water parks or resorts. You'll find the spirit of Africa in every corner of Kalahari.\" Families can spend just a day in the water park, but for those who want to stay longer, guest rooms and suites with up to three bathrooms are available. What about mealtimes? Unlike some family-friendly resorts where jackets are required during dinner, Kalahari's restaurants do not have a dress code. That's one less thing to worry about when packing for your getaway with the kids. Great Karoo Marketplace Buffet has more than enough food stations, and one is dedicated for kids' meals (think macaroni and cheese).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T13:45:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
