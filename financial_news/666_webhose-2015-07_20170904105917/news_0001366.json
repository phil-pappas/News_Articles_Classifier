Justin S. Lunde \nMaslow’s hierarchy theorizes that one must satisfy lower level basic needs before one can meet higher-level needs, like self-actualization. Likewise, during the recession, which started in 2009, Phoenix businesspeople had to focus on surviving, rather than thriving. Now that the recovery has been underway for a couple of years, many entrepreneurs can take a breath and focus on growing their businesses. A recent partnership between a large corporation and a start-up may help Phoenix businesses finally reach their potential via a program called The Effective Leader. \nAfter 25 years of running businesses, Steve Meisenheimer was tired of seeing the disparity between what small businesses needed and what small business owners could afford. In 2004, he started to envision an effective and affordable consultation methodology. By 2007, he had developed a unique control panel tool and series of business training sessions . \nMeanwhile Brett Andrews , CEO of Fortress Business Advisory , was seeking ways to help business owners increase cash flow and make sound investments, so that all their equity would not be tied up in their business. Together, Andrews and Meisenheimer developed The Effective Leader program to provide entrepreneurs a proven path to growth. \nSRP, an Arizona utility company, which had already been training entrepreneurs with Arizona State University, was impressed by The Effective Leader ’s capability and potential. SRP became a third collaborator on a pilot project. \n“SRP has entered into a partnership with The Effective Leader due to our shared vision for supporting and educating small businesses,” says Patti Pyle, Manager of Suppler Development. “Their growth and success is vital because they drive our economy and provide most of America’s jobs. We recognized that the work and mission of The Effective Leader made it a great partner.” \nStarting this summer, select small business owners, can receive $5000 worth of customized training on sales, marketing, finance and operations. With use of the control panel, knowledge gained through a seven-part course, with the guidance of a trainer, and the assistance of subject matter experts, selectees will be able to clarify their vision and develop/implement marketing and operational plans. \n“We encourage SRP business customers with five or more employees, at least two years in business, and ambition, to apply ,” says Andrews. \nMeisenheimer adds, “When the leader grows, the company grows.” \nThe more leaders and businesses, which can be developed, the quicker Phoenix will finally achieve the economic self-actualization to which it aspired before the recession.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T10:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T13:24:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
