Written by: Jason Notte 07/30/15 - 10:37 AM EDT \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) -– Making charitable donations can be philanthropically rewarding, but only if your money actually reaches those who need it. \nEarlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission noted that about $187 million in donations went to a group of four cancer charities that were nothing but a slush fund for one family. The FTC says that 97% of donations were used by family members to pay for cars, gym memberships, luxury cruises, college tuition and high-salary jobs for other family members. The Cancer Fund of America and Cancer Support Services in Knoxville, Tenn.; The Breast Cancer Society in Mesa, Ariz.; and the Children’s Cancer Fund of America in Powell, Tenn., not only bilked donors out of millions, but binged on money that other charitable organizations could have put to good use. \nEqually unfortunate was that, according to Friedman LLP partner Amish Mehta, a quick look at the IRS database of charitable organizations , the charities' Form 990 submissions or charity clearinghouse websites would have told donors just how suspicious those charities were. Mehta points out that the New York State Attorney General's office considers administrative costs equalling 35% of total donations or less ideal for a charitable organization, though Mehta says that cost for operating expenses should more ideally be capped at 30% to 20%.
