Against the yen, it held steady at 123.82 yen.\nEven before inflation numbers came in weaker than expected, the New Zealand dollar had been under pressure from a closely watched auction that showed global dairy prices tumbled to a 12-1/2 year low. The kiwi slid to $0.6498, its lowest level since July 2009 and down 1 percent on the day.
