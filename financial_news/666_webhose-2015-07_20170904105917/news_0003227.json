Josh Robenstone by Geoffrey Lehmann\nTalk of tax reform is once again in the air. Will politicians act on this talk, or claim they are trapped by the 24-hour news cycle, a recalcitrant Senate and unco-operative state governments?\nNew Zealand has shown the way by sharply reducing income tax rates and increasing their GST rate. Our federal system makes this type of reform trickier.\nBut it can be done, as Paul Keating and John Howard have proved. Tax reform can succeed by a big bang approach, where everyone is simultaneously a winner and loser.\nPrime Minister John Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello presided over the tail end of Australia's great tax reform period, 1986 to 2002 Chris Lane The Abbott government risks becoming a single-term government if it does not stare down the state governments and minor parties, and embrace reform. In so doing, it needs to get the right policy mix. Not all reforms are equal.\nAustralia experienced a \"golden age\" of tax reform from 1986 to 2002. The tax base was broadened by introducing capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax and the GST. Treasury borrowed ideas from overseas, added features, workshopped them with practitioners and purified the underlying concepts.\nBase broadening allowed a reduction of income tax rates and underpinned the phenomenal success of Australia's economy. We have recorded no annual recession during the past 23 years. From 1992 to 2014, our average real GDP growth at 3.3 per cent exceeded that of any other advanced economy.\nThe brilliant success of tax reform from 1986 to 2002 has come at a cost: greater complexity and reform fatigue, leaving fewer low-hanging fruit for further reform. The Henry tax review of 2010 produced only one significant proposal that was enacted – the Minerals Resource Rent Tax – and this was later repealed.\n Bob Hawke and Paul Keating at opening of the 1985 tax summit. Fairfax An ingenious mechanism On March 30, Treasurer Joe Hockey released a cutely named 196-page Re:think tax discussion paper and asked for submissions. Re:think suggests: \"Dividend imputation … makes little contribution to attracting foreign investment to Australia … It also involves a significant cost to revenue.\"\nA proposal that has gained traction is to abolish dividend imputation, which costs revenue about $19 billion, and to use this saving to reduce the company tax rate from 30 per cent to, say, 20 per cent. In crude terms, Treasury and some backers in the corporate world are suggesting that increasing the tax paid by Australian shareholders and reducing tax paid by foreign shareholders will make us better off. Is this proposition true?\nAustralia's dividend imputation employs an ingenious mechanism. Suppose a company pays tax of $30 on profits of $100. It then pays to an Australian resident shareholder all the after-tax profits as a $70 cash dividend. If the company declares the dividend is \"fully franked\", the dividend carries franking credits of $30.\nThe cash dividend ($70) and the franking credits ($30) are both included in the shareholder's assessable income. If the shareholder is taxable at 47 per cent (the top marginal rate plus the medicare levy), the actual tax on the grossed-up dividend is $47 less the franking credit of $30, or $17.\nThe effective tax rate for the $70 dividend is just below 24.3 per cent – an attractive outcome. If the shareholder is a superannuation fund taxed at 15 per cent, the franking credit of $30 will exceed the tax of $15 on the dividend, and the excess will reduce tax on other income of the fund.\nAustralian resident shareholders and superannuation funds love dividend imputation. Foreign shareholders get less benefit from imputation and would prefer a lower company tax rate. Writing in this newspaper (\"Why cutting dividend imputation will hit share investors and damage the sharemarket\", April 2, 2015), Philip Baker pointed out that since imputation started in 1987, the size of the Australian sharemarket has grown from around $140 billion to $1.65 trillion, with much of this growth being driven by superannuation funds.\nAn ASX study found that in late 2012, 34 per cent of the adult Australian population, or 5.98 million people, participated in the Australian sharemarket directly via shares or other listed investments. That is a lot of voters who would oppose the repeal of dividend imputation.\nBold move that paid off Imputation is parsimonious in distributing franking credits. In the example above, if the company pays a dividend of only $35 (half of its after tax profits), the dividend can carry franking credits of only $15. Shareholders are likely to pressure the company's directors to pay out more profits, so they get the otherwise unused franking credits. This sets up a creative tension. Management must justify to shareholders why it is not distributing profits.\nInterest paid by companies on their debt is tax deductible, but dividends are not. Another effect of dividend imputation is to reduce the tax bias in favour of debt over equity and encourage greater use of equity funding. Treasury's Re:think agrees, saying \"the imputation system may also improve the stability of the economy. This may have contributed to the strength of the Australian corporate sector through the recent financial crisis.\"\nTreasury's Re:think also acknowledges that imputation \"reduces incentives for Australian companies with Australian shareholders to avoid Australian tax\". Most corporate tax advisers can confirm this observation from personal experience. I certainly can.\nOpponents of dividend imputation argue that few countries have it, and some that did have abandoned it. How valid is this argument? Many countries mitigate double tax on dividend income. Dividend imputation is just the purest mechanism for achieving this.\nBritain had a variant of dividend imputation, which accelerated the payment of company tax. When this was repealed, a 10 per cent relief for tax on dividends was allowed. Some countries give dividends an exemption or partial exemption from tax, or allow companies a tax deduction for dividends they pay. The United States allows small businesses to incorporate S-corporations that are taxed as partnerships.\nThe 1975 Asprey report on taxation recommended Australia introduce \"a full imputation system as the appropriate long-term target, with a partial imputation as an intermediate step\" based on the Canadian system then in force. This seems to have allowed a tax credit equal to one-third of the company tax on the profits from which the dividend was paid.\nRather than the cautious intermediate step of partial imputation, suggested by Kenneth Asprey, Paul Keating as treasurer opted for full imputation in 1987. A small increase in the company tax rate partly funded this bold beginning. Dividend imputation was the jewel in the crown of Keating's tax reforms.\nGood sense and sophistication Before 1987, partnerships and trusts were given more favourable tax treatment than companies in many situations. Dividend imputation eliminated much of the tax discrimination against companies. In economic-speak, it enhanced horizontal equity between different types of entities.\nIt also allowed the repeal of rules that taxed undistributed profits of private companies. (Before 1987, undistributed profits tax could be deferred by paying dividends through chains of private companies, and companies that were effectively \"private\" entered into complex arrangements to give them \"public\" status. There were rules to attack these strategies.)\nAll of these complexities, including loss of horizontal equity, would revive if dividend imputation were abolished – something not discussed in Treasury's Re:think .\nBecause franking credits accrue only for Australian tax paid, it is claimed imputation discourages Australian companies investing overseas. This may be one of those urban myths about imputation.\nMany large Australian companies retain about half of their profits for reinvestment. So only half of such a company's profits must come from Australia to pay a fully franked dividend. Dividend imputation did not stop Australian investment abroad reaching $1,918.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $233 billion (14 per cent) on the previous year.\nPhilip Baker makes the commonsense observation that imputation \"has kept companies honest about embarking on offshore empire building, making them think twice before looking to grow their businesses in global markets …\" In his view, it has led to \"a more sophisticated local investor and corporate manager in Australia\".\nInvestors want their companies to grow. If they perceive a local company is making rapid progress in overseas markets, they may be relaxed about not getting a stream of franked dividends. After all, they can get the capital gains tax discount when they sell their shares.\nShould company tax be lower? Another accusation levelled at dividend imputation is that it does not reduce the cost of capital for companies. Critics claim franking credits have no value or are difficult for investment bankers to value.\nIn a paper \"Dividend Imputation Credits and Valuation\" (in the 2007 volume Business Tax Reform – Meet the Critics, which I edited) the economist Graham Partington shows these credits do have value, but this cannot be determined separately from the dividends with which they are packaged, as Australian rules do not permit trading in franking credits.\nGeoffrey Kingston in his May 2015 paper \"Dividend Imputation or Low Company Tax?\" stated that by \"fleshing out a simple version\" of Treasury's recent modelling, he estimated there would be a 4.9 per cent increase in national income if funds released from abolishing imputation financed a lowering of our 30 per cent company tax rate to 20 per cent. He comments sceptically that Treasury's models \"envisage a fiscal free lunch whereby a tax measure imposes losses on Australian investors without affecting their behaviour\".\nBritish experience indicates Treasury's free lunch may be a mirage. In 1997, Gordon Brown's budget abolished imputation in Britain. Individuals, pension funds and tax-exempt charities lost the ability to claim imputation credits. In 1998, British individuals held by value 16.7 per cent of Quote: d shares. By 2012, they held 10.7 per cent. The percentage of the British sharemarket held by pension funds reduced over this period from 21.7 to 4.7 per cent, and by charities from 1.4 to 0.6 per cent.\nThe decline in the value of individual ownership of British Quote: d shares was absolute, from £250.8 billion in 1998 to £187.2 billion in 2012. There were matching declines for pension funds and charities. \"The rest of the world\" took up most of the slack caused by British individuals and pension funds exiting the British sharemarket. It is likely there would be a similar exit by Australian shareholders if our dividend imputation were abolished.\nTreasury is concerned about the disincentive effect of our relatively high company tax rate and dividend imputation on foreign investors. But the level of foreign investment in Australia increased $261.2 billion (10 per cent) to reach $2784.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. It makes sense to tax foreign shareholders who benefit from the extraction of our minerals and Australia's stable system. Why give them a tax concession they do not expect, which their governments can tax?\nIreland and Singapore have bargain basement company tax rates, but we are not Ireland or Singapore. We have not had much luck with tax concessions. One of our few attempts at emulating Singapore is our offshore banking units (OBUs). They have been nicknamed \"Only Barely Usable\".\nCrucial reforms for getting back to black Company tax is a big contributor to the federal budget and raised $68 billion in 2014-15. A modest reduction in the company tax rate may not only do little to stimulate investment, it would also put getting a federal surplus further out of reach.\nAchieving federal surpluses is a top economic priority. Australia is a net importer of capital. Continuing deficits could cause the loss of our federal government's AAA credit rating, forcing Australian banks to pay higher interest rates on overseas funding, which would be passed on to borrowers and businesses. As well as expenditure cuts, what tax reforms might contribute to budget surpluses?\nA prime candidate is negative gearing. In 2012-13, net rental losses were almost $5.4 billion. Typically these losses, which are 100 per cent deductible, are recouped only when the asset is sold and the gain attracts the 50 per cent capital gains discount for individuals.\nSome overseas tax regimes quarantine \"passive\" losses of individuals (typically from negatively geared real estate and share purchases) and do not allow these losses to be deducted from \"active\" income from employment or a business. These regimes allow passive losses to be carried forward and deducted against future passive income or capital gains. Australia should introduce passive loss quarantining, with existing investments grandfathered.\nAs well as quietening real estate speculation, this would eliminate much of the tax benefit from margin lending exploited by spruikers such as Storm Financial. Passive loss rules would not apply to companies, or individuals borrowing to carry on a business, for example margin loans of a professional share trader.\nRepealing the capital gains discount is more problematical, as its repeal would have a lock-in effect.\nWhen the Howard government repealed superannuation reasonable benefit limits in 2007 and made most withdrawals from superannuation funds tax free for individuals over age 60, it may not have anticipated individuals getting annual tax-free incomes from superannuation of $1 million or more. Income from superannuation above certain limits should be taxed as ordinary income, and rules should restrict the misuse of superannuation funds as tax shelters that go beyond providing a reasonable retirement income.\nIt is surprising that our GST raises much less than company tax – $54 billion net. The GST treatment of food is discriminatory. It does not tax \"fresh\" food preferred by educated consumers and taxes many junk food items popular with the less educated. Taxing all food at the current GST rate of 10 per cent would raise an extra $6 billion annually and simplify compliance.\nThe GST rate could be raised to 15 per cent, matching New Zealand. The GST should be distributed to state governments on a per capita basis, eliminating the role of the Commonwealth Grants Commission in distributing the GST and a layer of bureaucracy. Mendicant states such as Tasmania should be compensated, if necessary, out of other federal revenues.\nGeoffrey Lehmann is former chairman of the Australian Tax Research Foundation and a former corporate tax partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers.
