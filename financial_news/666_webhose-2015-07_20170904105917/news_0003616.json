His $38 stock price target is 29% below current levels.\n“...the difference between what we see as fair value and current market price represents an extreme disconnect.” Morgan Stanley analyst John Glass The selloff put the stock SHAK, -7.22% on track to close at the lowest level since April 9, and 42% below its May 22 record close of $92.86. Shake Shack went public on Jan. 30 at an initial public offering price of $21.\nDon’t miss: Shake Shack introduces its first chicken sandwich .\nGlass said he believes the company’s fundamental story remains “strong and intact,” but that is more than compensated for in current valuations. Basically, Glass said the stock is “expensive any way you shake it.”\nThe stock’s price-to-earnings ratio of about 407, according to FactSet, is more than six times what Glass said was the high-growth peer average of 65.\nGlass also expressed some concern that the supply of shares will increase soon, as the standard six-month post-IPO lockup expires later this month.\n“While post IPO euphoria and elevated valuations are not new or unique to [Shake Shack], the difference between what we see as fair value and current market price represents an extreme disconnect,” he wrote in a note to clients.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T23:26:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
