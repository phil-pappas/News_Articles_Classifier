For example, on Nov. 18th, Amy Poehler’s new book “Yes Please” was priced at just over $17 on Amazon.com, while it was more than $20 at Target.com; on that day, Walmart had the same price as Amazon.com on the hard copy, but on Amazon you could order the Kindle version of the book, which was only $12.99. Meanwhile, Taylor Swift’s 1989 album was priced at $13.88 on Walmart.com vs. $9.99 on Target (a temporary price cut, the site noted) and $9.99 on Amazon.com.

She adds that you can often find better quality at reasonable prices at Macy’s M, +0.01% during sales and with coupons or at Homegoods and TJMaxx TJX, -0.15% Shutterstock Slide 5 of 7 \nFurniture \nFurniture is often one of the priciest things we buy for our homes, with many sofas and beds easily costing more than $1,000. But don’t assume you should buy these items from Walmart or Target to save money. Instead, Konrad says that IKEA is often the way to go for discount furniture (just come prepared with your patience as assembly is, well, challenging).

But Heffernan says that may be a mistake. “Shop Trader Joe’s for the best prices, especially in fruits and veggies,” she says. She says that doing so can sometimes save you 5 - 10%. However, Woroch notes that Target’s Archer Farms brand (some of its foods are organic) of food like milk, eggs, snacks and cereal is typically 10% cheaper than at grocery stores.
