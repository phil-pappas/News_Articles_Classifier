US-targeted M&A reached a half-year record high of $1 trillion, the first time anywhere has broken the $1 trillion mark over a six-month period. \nGlobally, average deal size shot up 39pc year on year to $260m in the first half of 2015, up from $181m in 2014 and the highest half-year average on record. \nThe UK hasn’t been as busy as America but it has still managed to register 40pc of inbound M&A, proving our open economy and business-friendly environment is easily the most attractive European country for acquisition-hungry chief executives. Tuesday’s smooth sale of TSB to Spain’s Sabadell was further evidence of the UK’s draw to overseas acquirers. It was also responsible for the year’s biggest deal so far, with Shell’s £47bn bid for BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) topping the tables globally. \nM&A levels are studied closely, and not just by the bankers whose bonuses depend on a busy year. As one of the great blood sports of corporate life, activity is an excellent sign of how confident CEOs are feeling and therefore what shape their companies are generally in. \nLevels plummeted in the aftermath of the financial crisis as companies attempted to ride out the recession by halting expansion, reining in costs, and cutting back debt levels. \nIn some quarters then, the deal binge will be taken as a sign that the animal spirits of the global economy have returned and therefore the world economy is in fine fettle. \nCertainly, for the bankers orchestrating the takeovers, this upsurge is a huge relief. The financial crisis ushered in a prolonged barren spell for corporate financiers, the deal slowdown meaning fewer fees and smaller bonuses. \nThis year, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) once again leads the pack in the advisory league tables, having worked on nearly $700bn of deals, equivalent to almost a third of all those unveiled, netting more than $1.2bn of fees. \nWall Street’s dominance of global finance is further underlined by the presence of Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) , JP Morgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch in 2nd, 3rd and 4th spots respectively measured by total value of M&A advised on. In 5th place is Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) , an impressive result for a UK bank that, until its takeover of Lehman Brothers’ US business, had no investment bank to speak of. \nAnd just as the post-crisis M&A slowdown helped to contribute to an investment banking job cull in London, New York and the other prominent financial centres, a resurgence helps to fuel hiring in the banking sector and other financial services industry, a hugely important part of the UK economy. \nYet, amid all the excitement, there are reasons to be cautious, possibly even for concern. The previous M&A peaks in 2000 and 2007 both preceded the two biggest economic catastrophes of modern times the dotcom crash and the financial crisis. \nThat doesn’t mean we are heading for another disaster. On the contrary, the current wave of deals is being driven by some proper fundamentals: abundant cash, strong stock prices, and is spread across a wide variety of industries from healthcare, to oil and gas, technology, and telecoms, suggesting it can be sustained. \nYet, there is another more worrying ingredient in the cocktail: cheap debt in seemingly endless quantities, which is helping to create another record valuations reaching the highest ever seen. Don’t be surprised if the latest boom proves short-lived. \n= Change for the good at Ocado = \nIt’s hard to think of a UK company that divides the City as much as Ocado. Ever since the online grocer joined the stock market five years ago, analysts have been split over whether the company is the next Amazon a technological marvel with the potential to license its cutting-edge know-how around the world or just the latest over-hyped web retailer. \nOn Tuesday’s results , it is slowly proving its doubters wrong. Retail sales rose 15.7pc to £511.9m, an improvement on the first quarter’s 15.2pc rise, and pre-tax earnings of £36m beat expectations. Having posted its first annual profit in February, it looks to be on a roll. \nYet, the prospect of signing another technology tie-up with a grocer seems to have got the market most excited. In 2013, Ocado signed a 25-year deal worth £220m to deliver groceries for Morrisons, a move that seemed to win over the City. \nAs the company comes close to another tie-up, this time overseas, Ocado appears to be morphing into a logistics company that owns great technology, rather than an online supermarket. Shareholders seem to approve the stock has been steadily climbing in recent months as rumours have swirled about its next tie-up but management seems reluctant to acknowledge the shift. They should embrace it. There’s no shame in changing direction if it means playing to your strengths.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T01:10:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
