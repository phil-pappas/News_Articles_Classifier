(He won Swan in 1996 but lost it in 1998).Over the years, Mr Randall built Canning into a safe seat.\nApart from a scare in 2010 when challenged by Labor's Alannah MacTiernan, he increased his margin to more than 11 per cent at the last election in September 2013.\n\"What needs to be recognised is his seat of Canning was a true marginal swinging seat and Don, through very hard work in his electorate and very strong support by the people of Canning, has made it his seat for the last 15 years,\" said WA Premier Colin Barnett on Wednesday.\nSignificant consequences Out of respect, no one is talking publicly yet about a byelection but the parties are giving it thought because of the consequences for each man's hold on the leadership.\nLabor has not yet decided whether it will run. A swing against the government would be good for Mr Shorten and Labor's morale, and vice versa.\nA senior Labor strategist said byelections following the death of members tended not to swing very much. He cited Aston as an example.\n\"There rarely is very much movement above 3 per cent to 4 per cent,\" he said.\nThe year before Aston, there was a byelection in the safe Labor seat Isaacs after member Greg Wilton took his own life.\nBut the Liberals did not contest the election, the first to be held after the introduction of the GST on July 1, 2000.\nMr Abbott is still on notice concerning the leadership.\nDespite the consolidation among colleagues, the government still lags Labor by 6 percentage points in the polls and the September/October deadline he was issued in February to turn that around is now likely to coincide with the Canning byelection.\nWestern Australia has been the Coalition's stronghold for more than a decade but that support has begun to wane along with the mining boom.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-22T10:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:55:56.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
