Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Durkin Former Macquarie Group chief Allan Moss has joined other high-profile investors backing two young women who are disrupting major consulting firms McKinsey, Bain and Boston with their start-up, Expert360.\nThe start-up, which matches consultants with clients that have included Woolworths, AMP, Virgin and Australia Post, has just completed a $4.1 million capital raising backed by local high-wealth individuals, Russian investment fund Frontier Ventures and Australian technology fund Rampersand.\nOther high-net-worth individuals to join Mr Moss in committing a six-figure investment include former Commonwealth Bank and Westpac chief information officer Bob McKinnon, investment banker David Tozer​ and former Goldman Sachs executive Sean Hogan, who has joined forces with the former female consultants as their chairman.\n\"I think the guys who have been part of the old world in investment banking and management consulting for so long get it – they know that professional services is ripe for disruption,\" co-founder and chief executive Bridget Loudon, 27, told The Australian Financial Review .\nThe site has already vetted and signed over 4500 independent consultants, who bid on jobs ranging from $1000 to $80,000 from government and small and large business projects, involving strategy, customer supply chains, data and analytics.\nThe site is targeted at high-end professional services, with an average charge rate of $100 an hour, compared to a generalist job-posting site such as freelancer.com, where the average charge rate is $8 an hour.\nFlexibility a win-win \"The consulting industry hasn't really changed for 30 or 40 years,\" Ms Loudon said.\n \"We have seen freelancer.com do it with coding and design, Uber do it with transport and logistics, but professional services and consulting in particular has not been disrupted in the same way.\"\nExpert360 co-founder and chief operating officer, Emily Yue, said the pair worked at consultant Bain when they formulated the idea and launched the business in 2013.\n\"Bridget and I worked together at Bain for a number of years, so we worked in this world advising companies,\" said Ms Yue, 30.\nThe pair pitched the idea to a group of angel investors at an Innovation Bay event in Sydney in December 2013 and, despite a terrible pitch , Goldman's Mr Hogan approached them after the event and doors began to open to a network of high-wealth investors.\nMs Loudon said the demand for the site is also being driven by burnt-out consultants seeking greater flexibility in the work they choose.\n\"As well as clients wanting flexibility, consultants want flexibility,\" she said. \"We are seeing some of the best consultants join the site because, throughout their career, there are a number of times where they want more flexibility. With a traditional firm, you're either not working at all or doing a 70 hours a week, and for a lot of people they are at a point in their life where that doesn't really work for them.\n\"We are seeing consultants from top investment, management and digital firms who want choice about who they work with, when they work and the type of project they are doing.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108544913517269724355/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/patrickdurkin"], "published": "2015-07-19T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T19:06:12.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
