Photo: Bloomberg\nPayPal has returned to the public stock markets for the first time in more than a decade in a rousing start.\nShares in the payments giant closed up more than 5 per cent, to $US40.48, giving the company a market value of nearly $US50 billion.\nThe move, prompted in part by investor pressure, separates PayPal from eBay.\nPayPal is now free to pursue its own corporate strategy, unencumbered by potential conflicts with its one-time parent. Its stock value is now more than eBay and several other technology firms.\nAnalysts have speculated that the company may link up with any number of potential partners, including the Alibaba Group in China as well as merchants in the United States that compete with eBay.\nThe mission, according to the company's chief executive, Dan Schulman, is to expand PayPal beyond simply processing payments online into providing a range of services for both retailers and consumers.\n\"We're moving beyond being a proprietary button on a website to being a full-service partner to merchants across the world,\" he told DealBook in a telephone interview.\nPart of that strategy will inevitably encompass buying new technologies. This month, PayPal bought Xoom, a player in the business of sending money abroad, for about $US890 million in an effort to move into the growing market for international remittances.\nSchulman said that his company had no debt and had roughly $US6.6 billion in cash on its balance sheet. And having its own stock means that the payments services provider has an additional form of currency that it can use in future deal-making.\n\"That allows us the ability to look across a very dynamic payments industry and look for companies with unique capabilities,\" he said.\nAlthough PayPal's independence was rooted in part by agitation from shareholders like Carl Icahn, Schulman said that he was not concerned about the pressure that activist investors might bring to bear on the company. He said that in a road show to hundreds of soon-to-be shareholders over the last week, he explained the company's mission and vision and received strong support.\n\"This is about all of our shareholders,\" he said. \"Having that dialogue with our investors has been incredibly helpful.\"\nNew York Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T22:15:00.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
