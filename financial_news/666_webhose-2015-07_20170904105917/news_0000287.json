While there are various ways to reach this lofty achievement, there are a number of common best practices among those that have.\nThe majority of accountants do not break the million-dollar mark when it comes to annual net revenues. A smaller percentage can produce between $1 million and $2 million each year. Then the number of accountants able to bring in more than $2 million in net revenues drops precipitously. Only relatively few individual accountants are able to consistently drive more than $5 million net revenues annually to their firms.\nWhile the size of the accounting firm (as measured by number of accountants or overall revenues) can have an impact, it is rarely the deciding factor. That is, accountants in small firms have the potential to build individual practices that produce $5 million or more in annual revenues. Based on ethnological analyses, these extremely successful accountants share many similar characteristics. A few examples of these characteristics follow:\nThey have the infrastructure in place resulting in other professionals being instrumental in servicing clients. If the accountant is not able to leverage others, then it is improbable that he or she has the bandwidth required to build a $5 million annual practice. The practice area(s) the accountant is working in potentially has significant margins. Certain practice areas have margins that can conceivably result in superior revenues. The clientele can often provide substantial new business opportunities. Certain types of clients can prove to be great sources of new business because of cross-sell opportunities and referrals. The key is to structure the accounting practice to maximize revenues (and profits), and this needs to be done with respect to select clienteles. One example of this is the accounting-based family office practice . The margins, for example, can range from 40 percent to as high as 75 percent depending on the sleeve of expertise provided. What is quite common in accounting-based family office practices is that the high-net-worth clientele are often exceptional sources of additional new personal and corporate business.\nAccording to Rick Flynn, managing partner Flynn Family Office (FFO) , “Although family office practices with a foundation in accounting services can result in individual accountants building practices earning $5 million or more, it’s important to realize it takes a lot of hard work. It also takes having excellent processes that can be scaled. For example, we use the Whole Client Model to profile and strategize each of our ultra-wealthy clients. This enables us to better serve them including being able to regularly anticipate their needs and wants. This deep understanding consistently results in us being able to provide them more services.”\nWithout question, even in an increasingly hyper-competitive accounting industry, there are those organizational structures and client niches that can enable accountants to become exceptionally successful.", "external_links": ["http://www.fa-mag.com/book---the-whole-client-model"], "published": "2015-07-06T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T20:43:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
