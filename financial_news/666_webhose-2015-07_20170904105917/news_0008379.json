Pensions were generous. Whether you invested in stocks or bonds, the proverbial wind was at your back. Both provided handsome annual returns.\nMany retirees found themselves with more money and a higher standard of living than they had enjoyed while working. And no one had a clue how good things were.\nToday things are different. Better computer tools are available, for one thing. Databases that once cost thousands to access are now virtually free. Using them, researchers are making a dark discovery about the future. Retirement will be more difficult in the next 30 years than it was the last 30 years.\nHow can this be? Simple. The returns on stocks and bonds are expected to be lower in the future than they have been in the past. This expectation of lower returns doesn’t come from a worry-wart oracle. It comes from simple arithmetic.\nIn the past, stocks provided a good deal of their return as dividends. Many provided a yield of 4 percent. And the long-term average yield has been about 3 percent. Today stock yields are lower than 2 percent.\nThe same happened to bonds. While you could typically rely on U.S. Treasuries to yield about 5 percent in the past, the current yield on a 10-year Treasury is a bit over 2 percent.\nThose two factors suggest that a typical balanced portfolio — 60 percent stocks, 40 percent bonds — that provided an 8 percent annualized return in the past might now be expected to provide a return of 6 percent.\nThe reduction in return guts the long-term survival odds of the portfolio. It increases the chance that many retirees will die broke. The loss of return reduces the 30-year portfolio survival rate from 94 percent to only 77 percent.\nNumber crunching\nUnfortunately, even this projection may be on the sunny side. Beyond accounting for reduced starting yields, some analysts are suggesting that both stocks and bonds are priced very high today. Reader mail indicates that many agree. Reversion to the mean says that future valuation levels will be lower. Another dour suggestion: Long-term corporate growth will be lower in the future.\nKeep on this way, and it isn’t surprising that some analysts expect really dismal future returns. Each reduction in assumed return reduces the odds that your portfolio will last longer than you do.\nIf you’d like to see this for yourself, I have a website for you to visit. It’s called Portfolio Visualizer ( portfoliovisualizer.com ). The product of Finnish computer scientist Tuomo Lampinen, this free online calculator does “what-if” portfolio calculations at eye-blink speeds.\nWith it, you can back-test portfolios, do simulations, do factor analysis, find asset correlations and develop efficient frontiers, not to mention test market timing models.\nWhen I met with Tuomo at Jack Allen’s in Austin, he was direct but a little sheepish. He said he doesn’t know how to make the site a profitable enterprise, but he is having fun doing the development work. He likes the “build it and they will come” model. So for the moment, these tools are free. Curious financial planners will love them.\nI can’t tell you how he will be rewarded for his effort, but I think he will be. And I can confidently say that a lot of expensive on-your-desktop investment software is doomed.\nBut enough of the nerd stuff.\nDiminishing returns\nYou can see what lower future returns will do to retirement by using the Monte Carlo analysis tools on his site — just use “parameterized returns” and see what happens to portfolio survival as you lower assumed returns. Watch the graphic display of asset levels arc down and crash before year 30.\nTake annualized returns down to 4 percent (still a 2 percent real return in a period of 2 percent inflation), and the odds of portfolio survival for 30 years drop to 50 percent. Take the annualized return down to 2 percent — meaning a zero percent real return — and survival odds drop to 21 percent.\nIt’s not a pretty picture. Keep your day job.\nNext week: Using portfolio visualizer to do more now, less later.\nScott Burns is a syndicated columnist and a principal of the Plano-based investment firm AssetBuilder Inc.
