But after weeks and months of uncertainty about global themes, including the outcome of Greek debt talks and the state of China’s stock market, investors are latching on to more palpable indications of strength among corporate issuers.\n“We’re looking for things that will provide a better return and are looking more towards covered mortgage bonds, real estate assets and corporate bonds,” Henriksen said.\nPFA is also betting bond purchases by the European Central Bank will support debt prices in the region even if the U.S. Federal Reserve starts raising rates. Despite all the sound and fury of Greece’s near-death experience, Henriksen says the ECB’s quantitative-easing program ultimately means the underlying factors driving markets have remained the same since the beginning of 2014.\nCausing Mayhem “It’s much the same set-up as we’ve had for the past year or 18 months,” he said. “The carry remains low and rates are low.”\nThough PFA expects the crisis in Greece to be a recurring theme that investors will have to learn to live with, Henriksen says the country’s ability to disrupt European bond markets will recede.\n“It turned out that the Greek death wish was only for show,” Henriksen said. “Greece lost its strongest ally when it turned out they could no longer cause mayhem in financial markets.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T20:04:31.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
