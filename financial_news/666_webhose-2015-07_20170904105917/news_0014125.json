Pay tax An under construction property and a ready to move in house after possession are two different assets for the purpose of tax. Depending on the time frame, you have to commute income tax. Bombay Oxygen \nBalwant Jain \nAfter my article on taxation of inherited properties a few of the readers have asked me to write on taxation aspect of an under construction property. Let us discuss the subject under various scenarios. \nSale of under construction property before taking possession: \nIn case you sale a property booked by you before you take the possession, the taxability of profits made on such sale will depend on the time interval between your date of booking the property and the date of agreement to transfer your right in the under construction property. In case the interval is 36 months or less, the profits so made shall be treated as short term capital gains and will be added to your regular income and taxed at the slab rate applicable. \nHowever, in case the time interval is more than 36 months, the difference shall be treated as long term capital gains. The cost for the purpose of capital gains shall include the amounts paid by you to the builder over the period as well as the stamp duty and registration charges. Since you are selling a long term capital asset, you will be entitled to take the benefit of indexation on the amounts paid to the builder as well as registration charges and stamp duty. The benefit of indexation shall be available in respect of each payment made. \nIt may be also interesting to note that since the capital gains are long term in nature, you can avail the benefits of exemptions by investing in another house under Section 54 F. You can also avail the exemption by investing your capital gains in bonds under Section 54EC. Please note that for claiming the benefit of exemption under Section 54F you will have to invest the net consideration for purchase or construction of another house and not the capital gains as is required under Section 54. This is so because what you are selling is a right to acquire a residential house and not the residential house itself so you cannot claim exemption under Section 54. People treat the sale of an under construction flat at par with a residential house for the purpose of claiming long term capital gains exemption which is incorrect and may result in litigation and substantial tax demand, interest and penalty. \nSale of the under construction after taking possession \nThe present income tax law does not have any clear cut provision to deal with such situation, however the tax treatment in such case will depend on the facts of the case. In case the property is sold after taking possession, for computation of capital gains, the period of holding shall be reckoned from the date of possession and not from the date of booking of the property. Please note these are two separate capital assets involved. What you hold till you take the possession is the right to acquire a residential house property and after possession the above capital asset gets converted into a full-fledged residential house. So in case you sell the residential property within a period of 36 months after taking possession of the same, any profit made on such transfer shall be treated as short term capital gains and shall be taxed accordingly. Moreover you will not be entitled to avail any exemption whether be it under Section 54 or be it under section 54EC as the capital gains made by you are treated as short term in nature. \nThe present law provides for combining the holding period under certain circumstances like assets received under gift or inheritance for determining whether an asset is short term or long term. Moreover, there is no clear cut provision for combining the holding period of both these assets, i.e. your right to acquire a house and a residential house, under the present income tax laws . So both the holding periods shall be treated separately and even if the time interval between the date of booking of the property and its sale after taking possession is more than 36 months , the profit shall still be treated as short term in case the house is sold within 36 months or less after taking possession. \nMoreover since the law does not provide that the taking over of possession shall not be treated as transfer, both the assets shall be treated as separate assets and thus the question of treating the right of acquiring an under construction and ownership of a ready residential property as one and the same does not arise. \nHope the above discussion will help readers better understand the fine point invoiced for sale of an under construction property under different situation. \nAuthor is a CA, CS and CFP.
