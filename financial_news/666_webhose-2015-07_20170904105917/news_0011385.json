This is a unique opportunity to make space research popular again, like during the moon missions! A unique human odyssey with you virtually onboard. \nThe documentary is about how to become an astronaut. What is the process to go there? What is the purpose to go there? How can it benefit to mankind? Showing all the training, and answering every question, even basic ones, with simple words. Plus, prior to that, showing Earth from different perspectives. From a Zero-G flight (ongoing negociations), to a Lockheed U-2 able to fly up to 60.000ft/20.000m). \nNext comes the training. How does it affect someone, mentally, physically? How long is it? What are the requirements one must accept in order to go up there? What are the different steps of the training? For example, did you know that astronauts learn how to remove a tooth? \nThen there will be the launch. Working with People4Space's future partners, to give the best shots from inside the rocket, inside the helmet, as well as from outside if possible. Finally, the International Space Station. How does it feel to be there? What is it like to look at Earth for the first time? \nOf course there will be interviews with the crew, asking them about their motivations, how do they feel to be up there, watching the Earth every single day, how their experiments are vital for us down here. \nFinally, we will also use that time up there to make on-planet people, active participants in the documentary, via different projects requested to do, or by joining live events that may involve some space enthusiasts celebrities (ongoing discussions). \nThe plan is to open the ISS to everyone on Earth by Street-Viewing the inside with Google's help, and by shooting VR videos for owners of headsets such as the Google Cardboard or the Oculus Rift. \nSupport this project, it's impact is out of the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T01:21:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
