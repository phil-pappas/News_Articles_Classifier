Jessica Shapiro Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan The construction union and 21 of its representatives allegedly broke the law 822 times during an industrial campaign that shut down two Queensland building sites for a combined 97 days.\nThe national building watchdog wants penalties imposed on the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union and a host of officials over action taken on the $60 million Queensland University of Technology project and the Enoggera army barracks site in 2013.\nIn documents filed in the Federal Court, the Fair Work Building and Construction inspectorate claimed the union and its officers shut down the sites in a bid to force the projects' head contractors to sign an enterprise agreement.\nThe inspectorate claims that after CFMEU official Anthony Kong asked an operations manager: \"Is it going to be fixed soon or am I going to be here for another one or two weeks?\", the operations manager replied: \"It's hard to fix it with a gun pointed to your head\".\nFWBC alleges that work first stopped at the QUT project in March 2013, with CFMEU assistant state secretary Jade Ingham telling a manager: \"this is just the start of it, the sooner you sign the agreement, the sooner it will stop\".\nIt claims that CFMEU state secretary Michael Ravbar subsequently warned the following day would be \"D-day\" if the head contractors did not sign the enterprise agreement.\nFWBC alleges strikes continued at both sites and stopped only when the head contractors signed the agreement.\nOrder ignored CFMEU representatives allegedly led workers to down tools at various times, despite a Fair Work Commission order in October 2013, preventing the CFMEU from organising industrial action at the sites.\nAfter the commission orders were imposed, an operations manager for one of the head contractors asked a group of workers if the consequences of breaching the order had been explained to them.\nOne worker allegedly replied: \"We don't want to go. We voted to stay, but when you join the union, you're in the union\".\nAnother worker apologised to a foreman while leaving the site, saying \"sorry, we've got no choice,\" after he asked him what was going on and why he was leaving.\nA group of men, including officers and agents of the CFMEU, also allegedly stood in front of a vehicle, screaming at them to \"f**k off,\" when they tried to enter the QUT project.\nIn November, at the Enoggera project, Mr Ingham was allegedly addressing a crowd of workers asking them who was going to strike. When workers expressed an interest in returning to work and voted to that effect, Mr Ingham said \"Look, I'm running this meeting, keep quiet\".\nIn principle, agreements were eventually reached between the union and head contractors and approved by the commission in February last year.\nIt is alleged industrial action affected the Queensland University of Technology site on 48 days and the Enoggera site on 49 days.\nFWBC director Nigel Hadgkiss said that it was in the public interest to take legal action.\n\"All building and construction industry participants should have the right to work,\" he said. ``Reports of workers being told to be quiet when they express an interest in going to work are extremely concerning\".\nFWBC is alleging the CFMEU and the 21 CFMEU officers and agents broke the law a combined 822 times. The maximum penalties available to the court in this case are $10,200 for an individual, and $51,000 for a union per breach.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-07-07T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:06:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
