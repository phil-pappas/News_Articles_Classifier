What and when you collect will make a huge difference to your lifetime benefits.\nToday’s Social Security question is about filing for Social Security after being on adult child disability.\nQuestion : My question is a little complex. In 2004 I was diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. Because of this I applied for Social Security some time after that. Social Security said that I was disabled before my 21st birthday. So I became eligible to receive up to 50 percent of my stepmother’s Social Security. Her income is higher than my father’s income.\nBecause of my disability I have to have a guardian for my Social Security. I am able to function enough that I can work, but my income usually is limited to $1,000 per month. I was told that it may be difficult for me to sustain full-time work and jobs in high stress situations. I have not looked for another job because I am able to receive Medicare. This allows me access to doctors and medications that help manage my condition.\nIs it possible to determine, based on current law, what would happen when I file for regular Social Security? I am assuming that I will stay below $1,000 per month. I am concerned that I may not receive any money from the retirement portion of Social Security because I was on the disability portion of Social Security. I am also concerned that I would be required to have a guardian for my Social Security retirement?\nAnswer : Without knowing exactly what you are receiving, I can’t say if your own retirement benefit based on earning $12,000 per year will be above or below your child disability benefit. Furthermore, when your father passes, you’ll be able to collect 75 percent of his full retirement benefit as a survivor benefit. The same is true of your stepmother. You can’t collect more than one benefit at one time. Unless you are absolutely sure you’ll be able to earn a lot of money on a consistent basis you should be extremely careful about going off of disability. Doing so could cost you benefits for the rest of your life. Your full retirement benefit from earning $1,000 per month through age 65 will be just over $1,000 per month.\nMy weekly Social Security column appears on PBS NEWSHOUR’s website .", "external_links": ["http://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/lkotlikoff/"], "published": "2015-07-07T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T16:35:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
