The firm’s books parted with £742,668 ($1.14 million) which went missing from the Coutts bank account. \nThere was no recordings of any bank employee calling the office of Fortelus Capital Management on that Friday. \nThe hedge fund terminated the CFO immediately and is currently in the process of taking legal action against Mr Meston. According to the court documentation which is publicly available the defendant is pleading not guilty and argues that there was no negligence conducted on his part. \nthe former CFO of the hedge fund has given up his bonus checks and salary totaling to £136,600 \nThe lawyers of Fortelus have stressed that client funds remained unscathed by the major security breach. the firm has aimed to reassure its investors that the occurrence was due to human error and steps have been taken by Fortelus to ensure the safety of the firm’s capital. \nThe innocence of Mr Meston is yet to be proven in court, but according to his defense he has acted in good faith and did not realize that he was giving out sensitive information over the phone. \nThe case made by the lawyer of Meston is that the CFO is not personally liable with his own assets to cover for the funds stolen from Foretells Capital Management. \nAccording to the court documents as a consequence of his actions, the former CFO of the hedge fund has given up his bonus checks and salary totaling to £136,600 ($210,000).
