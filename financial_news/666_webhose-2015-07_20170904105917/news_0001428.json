Photo: Fred Prouser\nThe management deck chairs at Westpac Banking Corp continue to be rearranged, with the bank announcing the creation of a chief customer officer role and the appointment of a senior executive from Disney.\nTom Boyles, 61, will join Westpac from Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, where he ran Disney's \"customer first\" strategy, which saw innovative technology including customer wrist-bands create personalised experiences for visitors, helping the entertainment giant cross-sell various products. Before that, Mr Boyles was head of strategy and marketing at National City Corporation, one of the ten largest banks in the United States.\n[Disney is] one of the world's most loved brands and their Next Generation Experience program has set a new benchmark for how great service can be delivered.\nBrian Hartzer, Westpac chief executive Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer said in a memo sent to the bank's staff on Friday that Disney is \"one of the world's most loved brands and their Next Generation Experience program has set a new benchmark for how great service can be delivered in a digitally-enabled world\".\nMr Hartzer reiterated he wants Westpac's to become \"one of the world's great services companies\" and said as chief customer officer Mr Boyles will work on \"improving service and building customer loyalty in both the physical and digital worlds\".\nAdvertisement Westpac also promoted Rams Financial Group chief Martine Jager to the additional role of chief marketing officer, reporting to George Frazis, the new chief executive of the consumer bank. A general manager of retail banking, Gai McGrath, is leaving and will be replaced by Bernadette Inglis, who will become group general manager of retail and premium, also reporting to Mr Frazis.\nAs previously reported, Westpac's head of premium banking, Damien MacRae, is leaving Westpac at the end of next week, hot on the heels of his boss Jason Yetton, the former head of retail and business banking, who exited after a Westpac restructure last month. That gave Mr Frazis, formerly chief of St.George, the key job of running a new consumer banking division comprising all of Westpac's retail banking brands, including St.George, Bank of Melbourne, BankSA and RAMS.\nThe new operating model also saw David Lindberg, previously chief product officer, promoted to lead a new division focused on commercial and business banking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:06:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
