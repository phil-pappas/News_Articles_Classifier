That is one of the steps to liberalise the economy required by its euro zone peers as a condition to open aid talks.\nPharmacists are also worried about the fact that the EU statement foresees talks on opening up the sale of over-the-counter drugs.\nFor the time being they can only be purchased in pharmacies and make up around 25 percent of the pharmacists' income, the Health Ministry said.\nThe Health Ministry said on Tuesday it had decided to ban the export of 25 drugs, following warnings of possible shortages as pharmacists said they had difficulties getting access to some medicines.
