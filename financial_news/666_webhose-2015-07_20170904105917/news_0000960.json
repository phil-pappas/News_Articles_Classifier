Michele Mossop Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jason Clout Home owners in Parramatta and Harris Park in Sydney's west have seen their prices rise by more than 50 per cent recently â€“ and it may be the local primary school which has something to do with it.\nDomain looked at the catchment of government schools and compared that with growth in the relevant postcode,\nIn the case of Parramatta Public School, there was a rise of 56.5 per cent in the median price of property prices in the corresponding 2150 postcode for the year to April.\nNationally the top rising areas in primary schools were concentrated in NSW. All the top 10 were in NSW such as Ashbury Public School and Oatley Public School, except for Bicton Primary School in Western Australia, where the postcode of 6157 recorded a 34 per cent increase.\nThere are some almost equally strong results with government high school catchments. The 2135 postcode rose 38.6 per cent, which is in the catchment area of Strathfield Girls High School.\nAgain, NSW dominates the top 10 high school lists, with only McKinnon Secondary College in Victoria and its postcode of 3204 preventing a clean sweep.\nThe strength of the NSW property market has no doubt contributed to the rise in postcodes and their catchment areas. But Domain senior economist Dr Andrew Wilson said schools could be an important factor.\n\"Agents tell us sometimes houses on one side of the street can be sold for 10 per cent higher or more than their counterparts across the road, simply because they fall within the catchment zone of a sought-after government school.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/100363146290555851954", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JasonCloutAFR"], "published": "2015-07-15T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T00:13:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
