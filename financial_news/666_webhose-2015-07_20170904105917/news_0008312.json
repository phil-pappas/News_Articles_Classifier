We are heading into the dog days of summer. And even in uncertain times, we can be sure of one thing: nothing of any real importance is going to happen over the next four weeks. \nAll the people that really matter the ones running the big corporations, the banks or the Government will be off sunning themselves by a pool somewhere. The interns left behind at their desks won’t be able to make much of a difference. \nTraditionally, no one expects much business to get done in August. The people who matter are too busy wondering if they should snap up that villa in Tuscany advertised in the local estate agent now the euro is so cheap, and how they can keep the kids amused until they can pack them back off to school. The office is about as busy as the “Invest in Greece” team. The only people left are the post boy, the trainee and interns busy updating their Instagram pages. It is impossible to imagine anything of significance happening. Indeed, we’ve developed clichés for the unimportance of August. In journalism, it’s known as the “silly season”. In France, it is known as the grandes vacances. \nBoth suggest total confidence that we can coast through the next few weeks. Nobody will disturb us if we take some time off. Even financial columnists can safely dust off whimsical pieces about holiday oneupmanship, or earnest but dull think-fests about the challenges posed by inequality or globalisation over the course of the century, secure in the knowledge that the readers, in the unlikely event there are any, will be thankful not to have to interrupt the sunshine with much in the way of hard thought. \nBut hold on. It turns out that is not really true. In fact, August is often the biggest month for the financial markets. Going back over time, the biggest moves in stocks and the global economy have come at the peak of summer. With the Shanghai market crashing more than 8pc in one day, as it did on Monday, and with a whole series of different fissures in the global financial system poised to break open, this August might be very rocky. \nSo hang on to your smartphone as you sit by the pool this could be an exciting few weeks. \nLook back to 2007 and you will remember that the credit crunch that triggered the global financial collapse started that August when BNP (Paris: FR0000131104 - news ) Paribas quietly shuttered a couple of hedge funds and the European Central Bank (ECB) suddenly needed to start injecting liquidity into the markets. \nThe Russian financial crisis, which precipitated the last big meltdown in the financial markets before that, also erupted in an August of 1998 and very quickly spread to Asia as well. In 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its peak on August 25, and then started the decline that culminated in the huge crash of October that year. \nEven further back, the final demise of the gold standard came in August 1971, with the “Nixon Shock” the decision by the then President, Richard Nixon, to sever the link between the dollar and the precious metal. More recently, August 2011 saw the apex of the eurozone financial crisis , with bond yields soaring across the periphery and stock markets collapsing on fears of the currency falling apart the FTSE and the Dow both saw their largest one-day falls since the Lehman Brothers’ collapse that month as investors fled the carnage. \nAs it happens, it is not just the markets. It is a big month for global events as well. \nSuch as? The First World War started in August 1914. The Second World War ended in August 1945. Russia sent its tanks into Prague in August 1968. Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. And so on. Of course, that might just be a coincidence. You could make a case for some other months being pivotal as well. October has some form, for example the Great Crash of 1929 came in that month, as did the rather more minor one of 1987. Even so, if you had to pick just one month, then August would be the big one. \nThere is not exactly a shortage of potential candidates for a shock in the month ahead. \nThe Chinese market is looking about as stable as a toddler trying to ride a bicycle. It is see-sawing wildly as speculators in the market get burnt, the government desperately tries to keep the market afloat, and its massive economy slows down, with all that that implies for financial stability. That may be typical of a fast-growing emerging market. The difference is that China is so huge, and so crucial to the global economy, that the financial system is not likely to be able to shrug off a Chinese crash in the same way it could take a collapse in Egypt or Kenya or Vietnam or some other developing economy. \nThe eurozone remains held together with sticky back plastic, and some glue that the ECB president, Mario Draghi, found behind the sofa in his office. \nEveryone knows that there is more chance of Jeremy Corbyn quitting the Labour leadership race for a cushy directorship with JP Morgan than the latest rescue package actually working. \nThere are plenty of wild stories about plans for an alternative currency being quietly prepared. If you were going to try that, wouldn’t a quiet weekend in August be the best time? \nPerhaps most ominously of all, we are already deep into what is now one of the longest bull market runs of all time. The FTSE and the Dow touched their lows (of 3,503 and 6,547 respectively) back in March 2009. \nThat means we are now an epic 76 months into a bull market. That is not quite the longest in history. The big daddy of bull markets was the huge run-up in stock prices from 1990 to 2000, which culminated in the dotcom bubble. It lasted for 117 months. Then there was the run from 1921 to 1929, which lasted 97 months, before it all came messily unstuck. \nBut it is now the third longest since records were kept, having just overtaken the 1949-1956 rally of 70 months. Of course, maybe it’s different this time. Perhaps bear markets have been abolished. Then again, history suggests we are overdue a crash. \nAnd the same record books suggest that if it is going to happen, it will happen in August. \nNo one knows which of those fissures might trigger an earthquake. With luck, none of them will. But you wouldn’t want to bet on it. So make sure you pack your phone charger as you head off to the sun and be prepared to make some calls back to the office if the world does start to collapse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:09:49.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
