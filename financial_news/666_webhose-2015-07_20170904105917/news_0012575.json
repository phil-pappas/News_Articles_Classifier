Supplied by Helen Hawkes If you prefer organic food, chemical-free cosmetics, regular exercise and sleep sound enough to recharge your system, planes may seem like a carefully constructed form of hell.\nHowever, as more airlines recognise that today’s high-flyer is interested in arriving in at least as good a shape as they departed in, onboard amenities and services are leaning towards enhancing wellbeing.\nHere is what some of the airlines considered the best in the world are offering.\nThink well, stay well\nWhat’s in – or on – your mind while you’re contained in a capsule 10,000 metres above sea level can have a strong influence on the mental and physical shape you arrive in. Nervous flyers, and hypochondriacs, may see danger and exotic bacteria at every turn.\nThe solution, of course, is not only to fly with a top airline that takes safety and hygiene to heart, but also to practise meditation or relaxation techniques on board rather than imbibe a fortifying malt whisky.\nAlcohol not only dehydrates but can ramp up anxiety levels after the sedating effect wears off.\nOur favourite part of Virgin Australia’s flight offerings are its mindful meditation series, presented by life coach Erin Kyna, including Overcoming Anxiety and In Seat Mindful Movement.\n Listening to any, or all, of these is guaranteed to switch the nervous system from “fight or flight” to the healing parasympathetic mode.\nMost top airlines also include advice on wellbeing in the air in their in‑flight magazines and offer exercise videos.\nOrganic gourmet\nThere’s absolutely no problem getting premium alcohol, or gourmet food, such as lobster in black bean sauce or glazed duck breast served on Royal Doulton dinnerware, on the world’s top airlines.\nBut what sense does it make to eat organic muesli, activated almonds, or free-range chicken at home and splurge on rich food and alcohol in the anonymous surrounds of an aircraft?\nLighter meals, such as soups or salads, are widely available on most airlines. However, tight profit margins have made providing sustainable or organic food products a low priority.\nAstoundingly, a small airline called Kullaflyg provides economy‑class passengers with organic meals; but you’ll need to take a flight in Sweden to enjoy this service.\nCloser to home, Emirates offers 19 special meals, such as AVML (Asian Vegetarian Meal), LSML (Low Sodium Meal), Gluten Free Meal (GFML) or VOML (Vegetarian Oriental Meal), to meet religious and medical dietary needs – but remember to order a day ahead.\nAmong larger carriers, Cathay Pacific’s seafood is sustainable and it shuns the use of wild caviar or endangered species. It also sources welfare-friendly pork from Britain and the menu design team is looking at hydroponic vegetables grown on organic principles. The tea it serves in first and business class is also organic.\nLAN Airlines’ food features many natural ingredients from South America, including local fish such as salmon from the Chilean fiords. Another airline using sustainable, locally sourced food and beverages is KLM.\nOn British Airways, you can savour cookies from an organic bakery on the Scottish island of Mull, while the fish, tea and coffee served are sustainably sourced.\nOrdering the vegetarian meal is one easy way to increase wellbeing dividends. On Virgin Australia, travellers are treated to vegetarian food designed by international chef Luke Mangan; Qantas’s business class offers a Neil Perry creation of an asparagus, green pea and Ligurian olive salad, served with fresh South Australian Woodside goat curd.\nBigger really is better\nDeep vein thrombosis is a blood clot that forms in the legs and can lead to a pulmonary embolism. There’s a reason, however, that it’s also called “economy-class syndrome”. Long flights trapped in cramped seating can be a risk factor, which is one reason many airlines are increasing leg room in economy as well as at the pointy end.\nMedical issues aside, the pressing question for business and first-class travellers, is how seriously airlines take a good night’s sleep.\nEtihad Airways worked with sleep experts from the American Centre for Psychiatry and Neurology to enhance inflight rest and, in Diamond First class, offers sustainable, all-natural COCO-MAT bedding. The spaciousness of its luxury three-room Residence, on its new fleet of Airbus A380s, also banishes any fears of cramping or DVT, while pillow mist and pulse point oil help anxious first-class travellers drift off to sleep.\nQantas also sought out ergonomic experts to help redesign seats and beds in its new A330 suite.\nDesigner pyjamas, 100 per cent cotton sheets, pure wool blankets, electronic dimming windows and even a “deep sleep turn down” are features touted by top airlines.\nBut if you’re going to be on a plane for a substantial amount of time, it’s the vital seat-bed statistics that are probably of most interest.\nEveryone likes to claim to be the biggest and best: Cathay Pacific boasts it has some of the longest and widest beds on any commercial airline. A first class fully flat bed in its A330s measures 205.7 to 220.7 centimetres long and 91.4 centimetres wide, and on some of its business-class flights 208.2 by 70 centimetres.\nFully flat beds in Qantas’ A380 first-class suites are up to 212 centimetres long and 73.6 centimetres wide, while those in business are 203 by 61 centimetres. First class passengers on Singapore Airlines’ Next Generation aircraft can stretch out on 208 by 90-centimetre beds, while business class seats are 201cm long and 71cm wide.\nEmirates’ first-class seating in its Airbus A380, Airbus 340 and most Boeing 777s features fully flat beds 208 centimetres long and include a multi-mode massage system with adjustable speed and intensity. In business class, beds are up to 200.6 by 52.1 centimetres wide.\nIn Etihad’s Residence, you’ll sleep on a 208.2-centimetre long fully flat bed; in business, its A380 and B787 seats convert to a 204.4-centimetre bed.\nBy early 2016, Virgin Australia will be playing with the big boys, with the completion of a major redesign of the business-class and premium economy cabins on its Airbus A330 and Boeing 777 aircraft. This will include suite-style seating that converts to a 203-centimetre-long fully flat bed in business, and more spacious seating configurations in premium economy.\nOther premium-economy options strong on comfort and wellbeing include Qantas, Air New Zealand, Cathay Pacific and Lufthansa, with seats about 50 centimetres in width on selected aircraft, according to seatguru.com.\nOn the major airlines operating long-haul services out of Sydney and Melbourne, economy seat width ranges from 43 centimetres to the 48.25 centimetres on Singapore Airlines Boeing 777‑300ER, Airbus A380 and A330-300 flights.\nNatural pampering\nMost carriers offer luxury brands such as Bulgari, Ermenegildo Zegna and Salvatore Ferragamo to first and business-class passengers, but chemical-free alternatives are starting to make an impact.\nYou’ll find an organic, homegrown product, Antipodes skincare, in Air New Zealand’s business and premium economy classes; on Virgin Australia, business-class amenity kits contain REN cosmetics that use only 100 per cent plant- and mineral-derived ingredients.\nCathay Pacific offers first-class passengers products such as Resurrection Body Balm and Fabulous Face Cleanser from Aesop, a brand that includes plant-based ingredients, while in business class it’s toiletries from biodynamic cosmetics company Jurlique.\nQantas passengers receive natural skincare products from Payot in first class, and Aurora in business; British Airways dishes up Aromatherapy Associates offerings in the women’s first-class kit and London grooming specialist The Refinery for the men’s kit, both brands based on essential oils.\nGaruda Indonesia has partnered with French botanical brand L’Occitane en Provence for its business class, while American Airlines first- and business-class kits contain products from red flower, a New York-based, eco-friendly brand.\nReducE stress\nHaving to listen to the stockbroker next to you pontificate about market trends is certain to skyrocket stress.\nNoise-cancelling headphones are the answer, with most premium airlines offering them to high-flyers – some top-of-the-line Bose – as well as eye masks.\nMood lighting designed to control cabin illumination in sync with the light outside the aircraft and help reduce jetlag is also widespread.\nLAN claims advanced air humidification techniques on its new Boeing 787 that helps reduce possible discomfort for passengers in terms of fatigue and dryness.\nOn Virgin Australia, travellers on international long-haul services (to Abu Dhabi or Los Angeles) eligible for a complimentary limousine service enjoy free transfers to and from participating airports, a service sure to ease travel tension.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T10:07:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
