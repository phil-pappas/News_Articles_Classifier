UK additions of 506,000, breaking the 12 million barrier, also accounted for more than half the customer growth across the pan-European company. \nAlthough Now TV customers pay a fraction of the monthly bills faced by satellite TV households, Sky said there was no evidence of its big-spending customers switching to the cheaper service. Nevertheless, average revenue per customer increased by only £1 in the UK, in spite of price rises, although the company argued the figure is now less important as it serves multiple segments of the market. \nIt helped deliver a 6pc increase in pre-tax profit to £1.2bn, adjusted for the acquisitions of Sky Deutschland (Other OTC: SKDTF - news ) and Sky Italia during the year. Sky (Amsterdam: BK8.AS - news ) increased its dividend by 3pc to 32.8p per share ad its bottom line beat the consensus of analysts' forecasts. \nJeremy Darroch, chief executive of Sky, said the UK delivered a particularly strong performance compared with the company’s continental markets. As well as increased growth, churn - the measure of how many customers cancel their Sky contracts - was at its lowest level for 11 years. \nMr Darroch said: “The UK remains the engine of growth and the template for our other territories.” \nJeremy Darroch said the UK was Sky's engine of growth \nHe dismissed reports of intense competition in the UK market as BT attacks Sky’s pay-TV business with its exclusive deal for Champions League football, due to begin with the new season. \nWhile Mr Darroch said he expected a challenging three-month period, he said Sky would trade through it normally and that the deep discounts and promotions it and rivals are offering are now a normal aspect of the UK market. \nItaly remained the company’s most difficult market, where revenues were down following the end of a wholesale deal. Sky pointed to a flat customer base of 4.7 million, after three years of decline, as evidence of progress for its “self-help plan” in “a challenging market”. \nMr Darroch said the integration of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland, which is scheduled to deliver £200m in savings by the end of 2017, was progressing on track. \nNew (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) commissions such as The Young Pope, a big budget drama starring Jude Law, are designed to exploit the company’s greater scale. Mr Darroch said such investments “show the scale of our ambition as we build a new European powerhouse for TV content”. \nAnalysts noted that Sky's finances benefitted during the fourth quarter from the weakness of the euro, as most of its debt is held in the currency. The foreign exchange moves meant total debts of £5bn were £700m less than the consensus, UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) said. \nSky shares were up almost 3pc in early trading. * Sky prepares launch of new 'Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) and Netflix (Xetra: 552484 - news ) -style' set-top box", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T11:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T11:48:49.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
