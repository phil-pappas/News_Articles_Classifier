These include: lowering the 2-for-1 ratio of US to foreign fabric to a 1-for-1 ratio; expanding the programme coverage to enable other types of fabrics and apparel items to be included in the EIAP; and eliminating the requirement that dyeing and finishing of eligible fabrics occur in the US.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T12:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T14:22:45.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
