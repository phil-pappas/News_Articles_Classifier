We are very committed as a government to making sure that we build new nuclear and Hinkley Point will be the first of those. \n• Hinkley Point new nuclear power plant: the story so far \n“Old nuclear is coming off and I think we need as much investment as we can procure in order to support new nuclear.” \nProtracted negotiations between EDF (Paris: FR0010242511 - news ) and Government over subsidies for Hinkley resulted in a headline deal in October 2013 but details are still being ironed out, while investments from Chinese nuclear partners are yet to be finalised and financial turmoil at reactor-maker Areva (Paris: FR0011027143 - news ) has caused further problems. \nMs Rudd said: “I haven’t got the scars of the past three to four years, or two and half years, as my permanent secretary may have in terms of taking forward that negotiation, but I have met the parties involved in the past 10 weeks and it looks to me like there is a very good prospect of it reaching a happy conclusion later this year.” \nIllustration of the proposed Hinkley Point C plant (pic: EDF Energy) \nEDF laid off hundreds of construction workers earlier this year as preparatory work at the Somerset site ground to a halt and Jonathan Reynolds, Labour’s shadow energy minister, wrote to Ms Rudd last month urging her to “admit the project will not proceed and inform Parliament what your alternative energy strategy will be”. \nBut Ms Rudd told MPs: “This is going to be the first new nuclear plant in over 20 years so it is essential to me that we succeed in it.” \nA legal challenge from Austria to the EU’s state aid approval for Hinkley subsidies, while “very unwelcome”, was not expected to affect the final investment decision being taken later this year, she said. \nMs Rudd, who said value for money was her top priority in the department, rejected suggestions she was “secretly having regrets” about the subsidy terms agreed by the Coalition, which will see consumers on the hook to pay roughly double the current market price of power for 35 years. \nMs Rudd suggested the price was worth it because nuclear was reliable, unlike renewables. “We have to have secure base-load, so you should not be surprised that we are prepared to pay more for that in order to ensure nuclear is part of the mix. The requirement for nuclear is absolute,” she said. \nHowever, future nuclear plants were expected to come in more cheaply, she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T21:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T09:06:40.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
