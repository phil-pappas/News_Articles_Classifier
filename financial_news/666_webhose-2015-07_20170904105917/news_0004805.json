It will look at “whether Royal Mail’s commercial flexibility remains appropriate”, and, if not, “whether wholesale or retail charge controls might be appropriate”. \nAny shake-up Ofcom decides to make will also take account of Royal Mail's financial position, which it noted had improved considerably since 2012, when the company was in the doldrums and the current regulations were established to protect the universal service. \nSince its privatisation in 2013, Royal Mail's performance has been steadily improving, with parcel deliveries rising. It was floated at 330p a share and now trades at more than 500p. \nThe upturn in Royal Mail’s fortunes and other changes to the market have triggered a new look at the regulations. “We are concerned that the regulatory framework is not working as we had envisaged at the time of its introduction,” Ofcom said. \nRoyal Mail was privatised in 2013 \nThe review, first announced in June, will also look at how Royal Mail can become more efficient, in the absence of effective competition in the delivery of letters. \nThe review was sparked by the withdrawal of Dutch company Whistl from door-to-door delivery of mail in June. It suspended its deliveries of letters in London, Manchester and Liverpool where it had been in direct competition with Royal Mail after funding fell through. \nInterested parties have until September 11 to respond to Ofcom’s review, which will also consider whether some areas of Royal Mail’s business could be deregulated to improve its service. \n\"Royal Mail will participate fully in Ofcom’s review,\" said a Royal Mail spokesman. \"In particular we will be highlighting the need for a consistent approach to regulation. Ofcom’s existing framework, put in place in 2012, was to have provided certainty for seven years. \n\"Royal Mail believes it has used the commercial freedoms granted by Ofcom in a responsible and appropriate manner to help secure the financial sustainability of the universal service in the face of significant ongoing change across the postal market.\" \nThe company has complained in the past that rivals “cherry pick” dense parts of the UK for their delivery services, hitting its profits and making it harder to pay for deliveries to more remote parts of the UK, where it is obliged to maintain the universal service. \nOfcom’s review will focus mainly on letters delivery, as Royal Mail has substantial competition in parcel delivery from the likes of Yodel, TNT and others. \nAny changes to regulation would be put in place in 2016, Ofcom said, though it did not give more details of its timeframe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T15:21:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
