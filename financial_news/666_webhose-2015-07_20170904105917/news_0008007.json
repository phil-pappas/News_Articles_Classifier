Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT - news ) shares fell 3.6 percent to $76.88 and touched a four-year low. The world's largest construction and mining equipment maker reported sales declines in key markets in a sluggish global economy. \nAmerican Express fell 2.5 percent to $77.01 after its revenue missed expectations, while diversified manufacturer 3M was down 3.8 percent at $149.50 after cutting its full-year forecast. \n\"The initial take on big earnings reports has been lukewarm at best,\" said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Bolton Global Asset Management in Boston. \"The strong dollar certainly has been mentioned a lot, and I think there are still questions about demand in the economy.\" \nEuropean equities were also stung by disappointing updates from companies, including Aberdeen Asset Management (Other OTC: ABDNF - news ) and British energy supplier SSE (LSE: SSE.L - news ) . European stocks fell 0.5 percent. \nIn currency markets, the euro briefly traded above $1.10 for the first time in a week, as the Greek parliament signed off on reforms needed to start negotiations with lenders in a bid to avert bankruptcy. \nThe dollar index pared early losses on news that U.S. weekly jobless claims fell to their lowest level in more than four decades. It was last off 0.42 percent. The data made rate hikes by the Federal Reserve appear more likely. \nThe euro was last up 0.5 percent against the dollar at $1.0990 and 0.5 percent against the yen at 136.12 yen . \nWorries over demand for commodities from markets such as China and the impact of an expected U.S. interest rate hike on emerging market capital flows have taken the shine off global markets. \nOil turned lower in volatile trading, after the dollar trimmed early losses and on concerns about shaky demand and ample global supply. \nU.S. September crude settled down 74 cents at $48.45 a barrel, the lowest settlement since March 31. Brent September crude was down 86 cents at $55.27, the lowest since April 2. \nIn metals, gold edged up from a five-year low, though bearish investors were still hovering. Gold was last off 0.30 percent at $1,090.20 an ounce. \nU.S. Treasury long debt yields dropped to two-week lows as investors sought a safe haven from Wall Street's drop and slumping commodities prices. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were up 14/32 in price to yield 2.2695 percent, from 2.325 percent late on Wednesday.
