But there was little that would expose large businesses to more competition.\nBillson steadfast But small business minister and acting Treasurer Bruce Billson said he would stick to his guns. Mr Billson told the lunch the Harper review had made the case for change and the proposed law would likely capture anti-competitive conduct not currently caught.\n He listed dominant firms locking up limited supplies of key inputs, land banking, hogging retail display opportunities, retailers insisting on joint marketing fees, retaliation in one market against new entrants in another market, and targeted geographic discounting to dissuade new entrants.\nBig business is fighting the effects test. Arnold Bloch Leibler partner Zaven Mardirossian said the proposed law left much to the courts.\n\"This means it will take a long period of time before we have clear judicial precedents on predatory pricing, refusals to deal, information sharing, access to essential facilities and other situations,\" he said.\nMr Billson said he would resist big business pressure to relent on his unfair contracts legislation, which was introduced last week after a four-year gestation.\n\"I have been pilloried by every big business interest in this continent. In fact you can buy an effigy of me off any of them,\" Mr Billson said.\nBut \"there is no place on our economy for an advantaged, strong, dominant business to insist a smaller vulnerable business be subject to a take-it-or leave-it standard form contract that has terms in it that are patently unfair\", he said.\n\"That is not the kind of economic ecosystem we want to nurture.\" But the government was resisting pressure to raise the upper limit on contracts protected by the law to $1 million.\nBut Mr Billson said the government was looking at pharmacy location restrictions to see if they are the best way to ensure distribution of prescriptions, and the extension of competition law to a greater range of government business activities such as procurement. He said the government was not ready to relax the ban on parallel imports of second-hand cars for safety reasons.\nIntellectual property rights But it was concerned about holders of intellectual property rights using them to inhibit competition by new entrants and innovators.\n\"Intellectual property rights aimed to provide clear air to commercialise an idea\" and were not \"envisaged as some way of getting a clip on the way through for ever more\", he said.\n\"We think there's a need to revisit that,\" he said. \"All I can say is watch this space.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T05:59:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
