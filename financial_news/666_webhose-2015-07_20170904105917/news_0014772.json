There are 400 building projects worth over $1 million each in the ACT. Graham Tidy Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Sitting upstairs at the Tradies Club in a Canberra suburb two years ago, Petar Josifoski had heard enough. Josifoski, along with owners of other scaffolding companies, had been listening to construction union officials Tony Vitler and Jason O'Mara explain their plan for an agreement between the union and their businesses.\nJosifoski was already feeling aggrieved after learning the union wanted him to give his employees 5 per cent pay rises.\n\"As a small business owner, I couldn't afford to pay my staff the conditions and entitlements the CFMEU wanted in their EBA,\" he says.\nBut what pushed him over the edge was when Vitler or O'Mara (he can't recall which) allegedly told the meeting: \"We are trying to get you more money on the jobs by getting all the companies to agree on a minimum price for jobs.\"\nScaffolder Petar Josifoski says, \"As a small business owner, I couldn't afford to pay my staff the conditions and entitlements the CFMEU wanted in their EBA.\" Andrew Meares According to Josifoski, he rose from his chair, and said: \"This is price fixing. I can't be listening to this. I could go to jail just for talking about it.\"\nJosifoski described the meeting this week to the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption, which has been examining how the the Construction, Forestry, Mining, and Energy Union operates in the ACT.\nWelcome to the shady business world of Australia's capital . Evidence to the royal commission suggests that, under the nose of the federal government, the union and building industry operated a cartel in Canberra that sought to control prices through monopoly agreements and physical intimidation.\nAs well as allegations of corrupt payments in made in cars, cafes and restaurants, the commission heard companies say they were told they could not get building contracts unless they signed agreements with the union. Evidence has been given that employers sought to appease the union by paying union memberships even when the employees did not want to join.\n \"The evidence quite clearly shows that the CFMEU has been successful in operating a closed shop in the ACT,\" the chief executive of Master Builders Australia, Wilhelm Harnisch told The Australian Financial Review .\nA month ago, business figures were complaining the royal commission hadn't uncovered much. That criticism has now stopped. On Thursday the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which enforces anti-price-fixing laws, said it will use a special unit to investigate the CFMEU's behaviour in Canberra.\n\"Cartel conduct such as price fixing, anti-competitive agreements and attempts to bring about collusive arrangements are matters of grave concern to the ACCC,\" ACCC chairman Rod Sims said.\nIn an opening statement to the Canberra hearings, the commission's barrister, Jeremy Stoljar said the evidence would \"paint a disturbing picture of the conduct of the CFMEU in the ACT: alleged corrupt payments, standover and intimidation tactics, and the apparent establishment and promotion of cartels for key trades\".\nCartel alleged He alleges that the CFMEU encouraged employers to sign an enterprise agreement as a group and were told to agree to common minimum prices to ensure they would remain profitable despite paying generous wages - a classic example of a union-employer cartel.\nDespite its relatively small population of 300,000, Canberra has a thriving construction industry, driven by a big public sector, strong economic growth and surging property prices. There are currently 400 building projects worth over $1 million each in the ACT, according to the ACT government.\nStoljar has delivered on his promises, at times in quite spectacular fashion. Most notably, former CFMEU organiser and local Labor Party branch president Halafihi Kivalu was arrested and charged with blackmail after evidence he allegedly extorted tens of thousands of dollars from Canberra contractors. Kivalu denies the claims.\nIn a sometimes farcical appearance in the witness box, Kivalu admitted taking $60,000 from a contractor Elias Taleb, but insisted the cash was given voluntarily and without the knowledge of the union.\nSetting up a classic gotcha, Stoljar asked Kivalu whether he had demanded $50,000 from Taleb for the \"Morris job\".\n\"I didn't demand any money from anyone,\" Kivalu insisted.\nEveryone watching, with the apparent exception of Kivalu, suspected what was coming. The commission played a telephone call covertly recorded in April this year in which Kivalu is heard demanding Taleb pay him $85,000.\n\"Remember we agreed on fu--king 50 grand for the Morris job,\" Kivalu says during their expletive-laden exchange.\nThe commission heard how Kivalu met with employers in his car, cafes and restaurants around Canberra where they handed over envelopes stuffed with cash totalling tens of thousands of dollars.\nDave Noonan, the national secretary of the CFMEU's construction division, acknowledged \"the allegations about Kivalu are very serious\".\n\"He is going to be facing a criminal court over it and so are any employers who engaged in corrupt activity with him,\" Noonan said. \"He's been expelled from the union and we will make no further comment until the criminal court have dealt with the matter.\"\nHowever, he added: \"If anyone thinks the union would retain someone who we knew to be collecting bribes then they are absolutely crazy. There's just no way that the union or a branch would do that.\"\nKivalu is one of three current or former members of the union to be charged by the police task force investigating alleged union criminal activity. The first was Queensland CFMEU official Justin Steele. Last week, former Canberra Raiders rugby league prop John Lomax was arrested for allegedly pressuring building contractors to sign workplace agreements . Lomax, the Canberra Raiders player of the year in 1994, was charged with one count of blackmail and will face the ACT Magistrates Court on August 5.\nIn an opening statement to the Canberra hearings, Stoljar said the evidence would show the CFMEU encouraged employers to sign an enterprise agreement as a group. He said employers were told to agree to set minimum prices to ensure they could sustain a profit after meeting the conditions of the deal. The arrangements, he argued, could substantially lessen competition and inflate the cost of construction work in Canberra.\nThe commission heard how Canberra concrete companies allegedly agreed to charge identical minimum rates to customers to make a profit after covering the cost of striking an inflated wage agreement with the CFMEU.\nDirector says firms negotiated pattern agreement Clive Arona, a director of concreting company Multi-Crete Australia, said a group of Canberra concrete firms jointly negotiated a pattern agreement with the union in late 2013.\nArona said they agreed to pay the same wage rates to all employees after the union said it wanted a \"level playing field\". He said it was further agreed the companies would charge $16.50 per cubic metre for a concrete pour and $6.50 per square metre for finishing work.\nHe said the price to be charged to customers was calculated on the basis it could cover the cost of the pattern agreement.\nArona said elements of the deal were expensive, including the payment of $90 to $95 a week per worker into a redundancy fund, up to three times the award rate.\nArona, like many other companies, agreed to not only have a union-appointed auditor examine his firm's accounts but actually pay the union to rifle though his financial affairs.\nWhen Josifoski this week recounted his version of the Tradies Club meeting in 2013, lawyers for the union argued that he was wrong, that there was never a conversation about price-fixing.\nAccording to counsel for the union, John Agius, the only discussion about a minimum price was \"a conversation about what was the minimum amount of money that people would need to charge in order to cover their obligations under the EBA\".\nHe said there was a difference between determining that $16 a square metre was what the scaffolders would need to charge to cover the EBA cost and an agreement between them that they would all charge the same rate.\nJohn Ryan, managing director of To The Top Scaffolding, gave evidence that O'Mara and Vitler had told the Tradies Club meeting about how to get around the problem of non-union companies beating them for work.\nRyan said either Vitler or O'Mara said \"all of the scaffolding companies should give their tender information to the CFMEU to see our pricing\".\n\"A minimum per square metre rate would be decided on and if the CFMEU found out that a scaffolding company was quoting for jobs under that rate, they would be hammered and run out of town,\" Ryan said.\nHe said the duo suggested the companies each give $10,000 to the union which would be held as \"security\" by the CFMEU.\n\"If a scaffolding company started charging prices under the agreed minimum rate, that company would lose their $10,000 and it would be dispersed amongst the other scaffolding companies,\" Ryan said. \"They also said that the company would then be targeted by the CFMEU. The companies opposed the proposal and it did not proceed.\"\nOutside the commission, Harnisch said the \"real price fixing\" occurred when union imposed pattern enterprise agreements on companies.\n\"The issue of how the unions are quite blatantly exercising raw industrial power has become evident during the royal commission hearings in Canberra,\" he said. \"Contractors are not voluntarily signing up to the pattern agreements. They are forced through commercial pressures to do so.'\nCFMEU denies price-fixing Noonan denied the union engaged in price-fixing. \"We have no interest in price fixing,\" he said. \"We do try and set minimum standards for wages and conditions of workers. That's kind of what unions do.\n\"If there has been any cartel-like behaviour, the union doesn't encourage it, doesn't support it. It's a breach of the Trade Practices Act and if employers have engaged in it then the Master Builders should report to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission which of their members have been engaging in cartel activity.\"\nEmployment Minister Eric Abetz said he was concerned about the price-fixing allegations.\n\"The excuse put forward by the MBA is what is said. But if every builder had the moral integrity and fortitude to say 'no' there would be no capacity for pattern bargaining,\" he said. \"Nevertheless if one's house and livelihood is on the line the temptation would potentially be quite high.\"\nAbetz agreed with Harnisch's claim that the CFMEU had been successful in operating a closed shop in the ACT. \"The evidence is clear that this is the case,\" he said. \"Union thuggery and employer complicity has allowed this to occur.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-07-30T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:05:45.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
