Photo: Reuters\nEuropean shares are set to outperform as investors are too worried that a Grexit - which is still a possibility - could spark a fully blown systemic crisis, Credit Suisse says.\nA team of analysts for the Swiss investment bank led by Andrew Garthwaite said there was a 30 per cent chance of a Grexit (a Greek exit from the eurozone) occurring, despite a bailout agreement being signed between the nation and its creditors on Monday.\nMany of the aspects of the agreement appear more intrusive than prior offers rejected by Greece.\nAndrew Garthwaite, Credit Suisse The short-term concerns of getting the agreement voted through six parliaments were secondary to the bigger issue: the implementation of the conditions in a country which unanimously voted against austerity, he said.\n\"Many of the aspects of the agreement appear more intrusive than prior offers rejected by Greece,\" Mr Garthwaite said.\n\"The loss of trust is hard to rebuild.\"\nBut even if a Grexit were to happen, there was just a one in three chance of this becoming a systemic crisis in Europe, he said, while the market was more pessimistic, pricing in a 35 per cent chance of a crisis.\nThe real risk was lower because the European Central Bank had the tools to intervene as necessary and the risk of contagion is reduced thanks to substantial reforms in at-risk countries including Italy, Spain and Portugal, Mr Garthwaite said.\nThere are already signs that the deal is under threat even before the ink has dried. A leaked International Monetary Fund report overnight revealed that Greece needed far more debt relief than any of its creditors were willing to provide .\nThe report suggests that Greece's debt is forecast to peak at 200 per cent of gross domestic product, and creditors would be faced with having to forgive some of its debt â€“ against the eurozone rules.\nEquity upside exhausted Meanwhile, the equity markets had already exhausted their upside from the deal, Mr Garthwaite said.\n\"European markets (relative to the US) were on Friday night in dollar terms only 1 per cent below where they were before Greece started to become a major issue,\" he said, from June 24 when Greek bond spreads began to rapidly widen.\nThey were also just 3 per cent below their April highs, he said, and while flows into equity funds had dropped since then, their outflows had been limited.\n\"Despite the uncertainty of recent weeks, foreign investors were net buyers over the past month,\" Mr Garthwaite said.\nRegardless, he said European markets were unduly \"pessimistic\". The continental markets have priced in GDP growth of just 0.8 per cent this year, compared with consensus estimates of 1.5 per cent. But PMI manufacturing data pointed to growth above 1.5 per cent, and would need to fall a full 4 points to hit the 0.8 per cent GDP growth mark.\n\"We continue to like the underlying fundamentals of the European cycle: in particular the degree of pent-up demand; the fact the banking system is now expanding credit; and we believe the weaker euro and lower oil price should have added 1.5 per cent to GDP growth,\" Mr Garthwaite said.\nValuations also remain attractive. As of Friday, Europe was 9 per cent cheaper on average compared with the US. Margins were lower relative to their norms than in the US, and there was more spare capacity in the economy, he said.\nBund yields and PMIs also point to Europe outperforming.\n\"Continental equities tend to outperform the US in dollar terms when bund yields and global PMIs rise, and both suggest that Europe should outperform from here,\" Mr Garthwaite said.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/greece-debt-crisis-leaked-imf-report-shows-greek-bailout-nowhere-near-enough-20150714-gice6w"], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:04:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
