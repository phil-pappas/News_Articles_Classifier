I don't think the Eurogroup still believes those promises just like that.\" \nSky (Other OTC: BSYBF - news ) 's Robert Nisbet says the Greek Parliament has been closed ahead of the referendum on Sunday but may reopen if a bailout deal can be reached. \nHe said there is confusion over whether the latest proposal relates to the bailout deal that has already expired or a deal relating to a later tranche of funds due to become available shortly. \nIf a deal is to be reached, Mr Tsipras wants to keep VAT in the Greek islands at 16%, compared to the level on the mainland at 23%. \nThe discount is in place to account for the added cost to residents of goods being shipped off shore, but could increase costs for tourists if abolished. \nHe also wants the EKAS scheme phased out more slowly. Under Mr Tsipras' plan, the variable supplement that gets paid to pensioners to bring their monthly income up to €700, would continue to be paid to the richest 20% for longer. \nThe original deal asked for EKAS to be phased out for the richest fifth immediately, with it being phased out for all pensioners by 2019. \nThe letter also asked for a delay to an extension of individual business income tax, and a smaller cut in the military budget. \nFinancial markets reacted positively to the developments initially, with all the major stock markets regaining some of the ground lost this week. \nThe euro climbed against sterling, but investors remained cautious. \nAt a news conference to outline the Bank of England's latest Financial Stability Report, its governor Mark Carney warned the outlook for UK financial stability had \"worsened\" because of the crisis in Greece.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T16:20:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
