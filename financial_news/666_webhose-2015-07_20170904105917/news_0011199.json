There is no medical science in tourism. It is about openness,” added the Minister. \nMzembi, who is also the African President for the World Tourism Organisation (WTO), meanwhile stressed the need to have an open policy on the country’s skies and borders so as to attract more tourists into Zimbabwe. \n“This is the part of the concept! We are dreaming of a future in Zimbabwe of a through the 2015-2020 vision. This is a $5 billion tourism economy,” said Mzembi. \nThrough the vision, the Southern African country aims to attract at least 5 million arrivals per year and growing the sector to contribute 15 percent gross domestic product (GDP). \nMzembi said Zimbabwe was currently receiving 2 million visitors generating annual revenue of $1 billion (about R12 billion) income while contributing 10 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. \nThe minister, citing Biblical verses during his presentation, spoke strongly about the country’s need to adopt an “open door policy” especially the opening of borders and skies in order to increase tourism arrivals in the country. \n“Day and night your gates will be open, so that the kings of the nations may bring you wealth,” he said, quoting from a prominent prophet. \n“So, going forward, if you want to invest in tourism sector, you have to watch whether we are opening our borders sufficiently enough, and our skies sufficiently enough,” said Mzembi. \nExperts have projected that the growth of low fare airlines in the country is expected to help spur the growth of the tourism sector as connectivity improves and the cost of traveling becomes more affordable. \nZimbabwe has decided to adopt an open skies policy that has led to the entry of some low-cost airlines such as Fly Africa and Fastjet, into the country while it has also relaxed the visa requirements for emerging-economies in a bid to increase arrivals. \nIn addition, the government has also run a campaign that is aimed at improving peoples’ perception of Zimbabwe as a security risk. \nAir Zimbabwe, the national airliner, has also revived its flights to the country’s major tourism destinations. \nThe expansion of the Victoria Falls International Airport is also envisaged to significantly improve the port’s aircraft handling capacity. \nIt includes the expansion of the existing-runway, construction of a new runway, construction of a new terminal building as well as a car park and road network. \nMzembi meanwhile said presently the Beitbridge border post was receiving 1,6 million travelers. \nThe border-post bridge is envisaged that its revamp, coupled with the upgrading of roads, would see the numbers treble. \nHe said the Beitbridge border-post was Africa’s busiest, which thus had the potential to generate significant revenues for Zimbabwe through tourism arrivals and departures. \nMzembi also projected the upcoming project to construct the Victoria Falls International Airport in September would culminate in the arrival of 1,8 million annual arrivals more, thereby generating more than $5 billion (about R60 billion) for the country. \nMeanwhile, potential investors applauded Mzembi and pledged to attend the second Trade and Investment Forum that the Mail and Guardian Africa is planning for Harare, Zimbabwe early next month. \nZimbabwe boasts several tourist attractions, mostly located in the North West of the country. \nAmong these are the Victoria Falls National Park, Hwange National Park, Eastern Highlands , Vumba Mountains and the Nyanga National Park as well as the World’s View in Matopos. \nOther sites include the Great Zimbabwe Ruins, Khami Ruins, Matobo Hills and Mana Pools, a United Nations Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). \nHowever, arrivals at these sites have significantly reduced over the years as the tourism sector was not spared the economic problems that have characterized the country over the past two decades. \nThe country’s image has been dented since 2000 when the government endorsed a largely violent takeover of mainly white owned farms by the combatants of the country’s liberation struggle. \nThe takeover culminated in the government embarking on a contentious land redistribution exercise, which government insisted was addressing colonial imbalances. \nOn the political front, violence, blamed on the ruling ZANU (PF) supporters escalated while general polls which the country held during the period, were rejected by the West, thus exacerbating the situation. \nAmid the souring relations, Western countries dissuaded their citizens from visiting the Southern African country, which was seen as hostile to whites. \nSeveral airlines, some which have reversed their decisions, also pulled out of Zimbabwe. \nThe economic malaise also led to the deterioration of key infrastructure such as roads, airport facilities and structures at national parks, also contributing to a lull in the industry. Subsequently, thousands of jobs were lost in the industry due to companies closing down or simply being unable to pay staff wages due to the decreasing number of tourists. \nThere has been hope in recent months the industry can be revived as relations between Zimbabwe and its foes of the past two decades have vastly improved. \nIn recent times, the United States, the European Union bloc and other western countries have been working on normalising ties with the African country after years of frosty relations. \nAdditionally, Zimbabwe has embarked on an aggressive marketing exercise to repair its image soiled in the course of the economic and political crises. \nThe Zimbabwe Tourism Authority has in the past few years implemented various programmes aimed at improving the country’s image on the regional, continental and international scenes. \nIn 2013, the country enhanced its profile by co-hosting the 20th United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) General Assembly alongside neighbouring Zambia. \nHosted at the Victoria Falls, was declared the best-attended with a record 900 delegates from the media fraternity, 121 full delegates from the member states and 140 delegates from all over the world as well as 49 foreign ministers. \n- CAJ News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T18:47:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
