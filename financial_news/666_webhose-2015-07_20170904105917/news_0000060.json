But the new data aren’t final proof of the drug’s benefit—a separate, continuing study due to end in late 2016 is designed to more definitively test its efficacy and safety.\nIn another study, researchers said Biogen Inc.’s BIIB, +0.14% experimental Alzheimer’s drug reduced the volume of a substance in the brains of patients that is believed to contribute to the disease. Results of both studies are due to be presented Wednesday at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Washington.\nLilly LLY, -2.62% hopes solanezumab becomes the first marketed treatment to slow the worsening of the underlying disease. Current treatments for Alzheimer’s can alleviate symptoms but don’t slow underlying disease progression. Jefferies & Co. analyst Jeffrey Holford estimates the Lilly drug could generate peak annual sales of more than $3 billion world-wide if it is approved for marketing by regulators.\nEric Siemers, an Alzheimer’s researcher at Lilly, said the new clinical data increases his confidence in solanezumab but “we’ll find out if it works or not” when a separate, continuing study of the drug is completed by the end of 2016. The study of about 2,100 patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease is comparing solanezumab with a placebo, and its outcome will determine whether Lilly submits the drug for marketing approval in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/lillys-alzheimers-drug-may-slow-patients-decline-study-shows-1437562986/?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T14:23:42.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
