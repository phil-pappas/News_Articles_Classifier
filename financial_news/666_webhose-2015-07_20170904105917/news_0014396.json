We hope that this Expo and the discussions here will find ways in which the young people who are developing these apps will make them attractive to us”. \nHe added that Mobile Devices have come to stay and “we cannot help but embrace them and keep up with the rapid pace of development in the sector. \n“We must recalibrate our educational system to provide our students with the skills for matching this pace in order to make them relevant for the job market and the many opportunities in the ICT sector”, he added. \nThe vice president noted that it was important to emphasize however that the Mobile Device assumes the character of its owner and user; it never has a character of its own. \nMr Amissah Arthur said mobile devices could be used for good and bad things but as a society “let us all, therefore, resolve to use them in ways that will promote human development, peaceful co-existence among ourselves and to deliver shared economic prosperity for all our people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T05:35:01.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
