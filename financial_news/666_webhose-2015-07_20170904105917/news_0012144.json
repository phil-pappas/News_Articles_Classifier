(NYSE:JEC) announced today that it has been selected as a preferred bidder by EDF Energy to support its proposed new 3,200 MW nuclear power generation plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset, United Kingdom. \nUnder the terms of the contract, Jacobs is to provide project management for the building and civil work on the main construction site including the marine works. \nJacobs Group Vice President Bob Duff stated, “We look forward to integrating our technical and project execution capability with other local providers and the EDF Energy team to support this major energy investment. \n“Our long term vision is to create a global center of nuclear expertise here in the UK and use our key locations to provide and secure high quality jobs in nuclear. Ultimately, we see potential to leverage this UK-developed knowledge and expertise to support projects internationally.” \nJacobs has worked on every nuclear licensed site in the UK, providing specialist expertise across the complete nuclear lifecycle from the existing nuclear power generation fleet, the new build program, through to decommissioning and clean up. \nJacobs is currently providing a wide range of services to the EDF Group for projects in the UK and Europe. These include project management services to support EDF Energy’s program of maintenance and life extension projects at its eight UK nuclear power station sites and environmental services to support the 2000 megawatt Cottam and West Burton coal-fired stations. \nEDF Energy is the prospective owner, operator and licensee for two new reactors planned at Hinkley Point C. If the investment framework is approved, Hinkley Point C will be the first in a new generation of UK nuclear power stations, marking a significant moment in the revitalization of the UK’s nuclear power industry. EDF Energy is one of the UK’s largest energy companies and the largest producer of low-carbon electricity, producing around one-fifth of the nation's electricity. \nJacobs is one of the world's largest and most diverse providers of technical professional and construction services. Jacobs has operations in 250+ locations across more than 35 countries, and employs approximately 65,000 people. \nStatements made in this release that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements.
