STR Share on twitter by Angus Grigg\nIn the choice between Mao and markets, China has never chartered the direct course.\nIt has always veered wildly between these two opposing ideologies and its recent efforts to tame the sharemarket are no different.\nBut this should not be interpreted as an abandonment of broader economic reform, rather a bump on a difficult road.\nIndeed, the central government's efforts to prop up the sharemarket can be viewed as an attempt to preserve its longer-term reform agenda.\nTrading was halted in more than 25 per cent of Chinese listed shares on Tuesday but that failed to life the markets with the Shanghai Composite Index opening 3.2 per cent lower, while the Shenzhen Composite Index was down 3.44 per cent.\nBeijing appears to be signalling that a total capitulation of the sharemarket would dent growth and confidence and therefore make it harder to enact tough reforms.\nThis would force policymakers to concentrate on stabilising growth rather than initiate reforms like opening up closed sectors of the economy, including telecommunications, transport and energy.\nThat said the government's intervention in the capital markets over recent days will do nothing to engender confidence from the foreign investors.\n It will also push back the timeline for a full opening of its capital account and liberalisation of exchanges rates.\n\"It certainly kills hopes that China's stock markets will become driven by market fundaments, rather than policy, or that moral hazard has been alleviated,\" the Economist Intelligence Unit said in a report on Tuesday.\nThe government intervention is also likely to make MSCI more wary of increasing the weighting of China stocks in its index's across Asia.\nThe broader issue, however, is why the central government pumped the market up so much in the first place, with a series of supportive statement via the state media.\n\"The damage was done when the bubble was allowed to inflate,\" said Mark Williams, from Capital Economics.\nHe argues the central government has tied its credibility to a buoyant sharemarket and is therefore trying to save face by halting the slide.\n\"China's leadership has doubled down on its efforts to prop up equity prices because it believes that its own credibility is now coupled to continued gains on the markets,\" Mr Williams said in a note to clients.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/AngusGrigg"], "published": "2015-07-07T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:59:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
