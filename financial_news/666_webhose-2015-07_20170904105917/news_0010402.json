This age group has grown by nearly 3 million over the last six years, to 62.6 million this year, but fewer in this age group are heading U.S. households. In the first third of 2015, about 42.2 million 18- to 34-year-olds lived independently of their families versus 42.7 million adults before the recession began in 2007. Only 67% of this age group live independently in 2015 versus 69% five years ago.\nThere are other reasons young adults should be leaving the nest. The U.S. unemployment rate for adults aged 18 to 34 fell to 7.7% in the first third of 2015, far below the 12.4% of 2010. “This may have important consequences for the nation’s housing market recovery, as the growing young adult population has not fueled demand for housing units and the furnishings, telecom and cable installations and other ancillary purchases that accompany newly formed households,” says Richard Fry, the report’s author and a senior researcher focusing on economics and education at Pew Research Center.\nWhy haven’t they budged? The earnings of young adult workers have only increased slightly in the last three years. The median weekly earnings of young adults was $574 through the first four months of this year, up marginally from their recent 2012 low of $547. And they are still below a recent high of $592 in 2008. College-educated young adults are also more likely to live apart from their parents (86% versus 75% for those with a high school diploma or less), suggesting that they’re able to find better paying jobs and/or receive help from their wealthier parents with a down payment for a home.\nAmericans are also getting married later in life and less frequently: In 2012, about 1 in 5 adults ages 25 and older (42 million people) had never been married, compared with about 1 in 10 adults in 1960, according to a separate 2014 Pew analysis, “American Community Survey,” and the government’s decennial Census Bureau. In a survey of 2,000 people, Pew found that 30% of those aged 18 to 34 said they didn’t get married because of financial concerns, 23% said they aren’t ready to settle down or consider themselves too young, while 27% said they haven’t found what they’re looking for.\nMany millennials living in big cities are priced out of the housing market. The gap between rental costs and household income is widening to “unsustainable levels,” research published last March by the National Association of Realtors found, “and the situation could worsen unless new home construction meaningfully rises.” The top markets where renters have seen the highest increase in rents since 2009 are New York (51%), Seattle, (32%), San Jose, Calif., (26%), Denver, (24%) and St. Louis. (22%). And others predict that this decline in homeownership rates may last until 2030.\nRead: Spending on home remodeling is (slowly) improving\nMore from Quentin Fottrell This is how much it will cost to buy your own egg-producing chicken Americans are the unhealthiest snackers in the world Coke, like America, sweetens on Stevia", "external_links": ["http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/07/29/more-millennials-living-with-family-despite-improved-job-market/"], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T20:58:31.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
