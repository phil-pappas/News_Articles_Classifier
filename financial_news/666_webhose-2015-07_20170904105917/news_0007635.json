For example, one of the “great deals” Ollie’s was offering Tuesday is Neutrogena SPF 70 “Ultimate” Sport Spray for $5.99. The same product can be bought on Amazon.com for $33.\n“America has always loved a bargain...that’ll never go out of style,” Chief Executive Mark Butler has said.\nBut Ollie’s claims to be more than just your typical bargain retailer. “Our differentiated go-to market strategy is characterized by a unique, fun and engaging treasure hunt shopping experience, compelling customer value proposition and witty, humorous in-store signage and advertising campaigns,” the company said in a regulatory filing.\nThe company OLLI, +0.00% said it attempts to make its customers laugh by poking fun at itself, because it believes that by getting its customers to “giggle a bit,” they are able to trust the products for what they are, “extremely great bargains.”\nDoes it work? Ollie’s has been growing steadily, and it makes money.\nHere are some other things to know ahead of its IPO:\nOllie Ollie’s looks to raise $133.9 million in IPO Slide 2 of 5 Ollie’s said in a regulatory filing that it plans to sell 8.925 million shares at an IPO price of between $13 to $15, which would raise up to $133.9 million. If the underwriters exercise their options to buy more shares to cover over-allotments, the company could raise about $154 million.\nThe lead book runners on the deal are J.P. Morgan, Jefferies and BofA Merrill Lynch.\nPrivate-equity firm CCMP Capital, which currently owns 71.8% of Ollie’s shares, will own 60.6% of the company following the IPO, or 59.2% if the underwriters exercise their options.\nThe stock would be listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, under the ticker symbol “OLLI.”\nOllie’s said it plans to use the money it makes from its IPO to repay $113.4 million in borrowings under its senior credit facilities. If the underwriters exercise their option to buy additional shares, the company said it would use the additional proceeds of $17.5 million to repay debt under its term loan facility.\nSince it will use earnings to finance the growth of the business, the company said in its filing that it did not expect to pay cash dividends on its common stock “in the foreseeable future.”\nSeparately, Ollie’s listed some standard risk factors that could hurt growth, such as the ability to buy appropriate merchandise and manage inventory, a dependence on consumer confidence and spending, intense competition and the ability to retain the loyalty of its customers. Although no single supplier accounted for more than 5% of its purchases last year, Ollie’s said the loss of or disruption in the operations of its two key distribution centers could have a material negative effect on its business.\nOllie Ollie’s sees the ‘white space’ as room to grow Slide 3 of 5 Ollie’s opened its first store in 1982. It operated 187 stores across 16 states in the Eastern half of the U.S. as of June 30.\nThe company plans to open between 25 and 30 stores in fiscal 2015, after opening 22 in 2014 and 23 in 2013. From fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2014, the store base expanded to 176 from 95, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.3%.\nAnd based on internal estimates and third-party research, Ollie’s believes it can profitably expand its store count to more than 950 nationally.\n“As we grow, we believe our increased scale will provide us with even greater access to brand name products because many large manufacturers favor large buyers capable of acquiring an entire deal,” the company said in its filing.\nThe company doesn’t own any property, as the locations for its retail stores, distribution centers and corporate headquarters in Harrisburg, Penn. are all leased.\nWith reference to the Elvis Costello hit song from the 1970s, “Ollie’s Army” is what the company calls its customer loyalty program. It included 5.2 million members as of May 15, and had a compounded annual growth rate of 37.2% since fiscal 2006.\nThrough June 30, the company had about 5,000 employees, of which about 2,000 were full time. The typical store employs 16 to 30 people, with generally 65% part time and 35% full time.\nOllie Ollie’s believes bigger is better Slide 4 of 5 From 2010 through 2014, net sales have nearly doubled to $638 million from $335.7 million, representing a CAGR of 17%. Meanwhile, same-store sales grew at an average rate of 1.7% a year.\nNet income has increased to $26.9 million in 2014 from $19.5 million in 2013, while earnings per share have grown to 55 cents from 40 cents. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), has grown 16% (CAGR) to $80.3 million from $43.7 million.\nCash flow rose to $31.8 million in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2015 from $19.7 million as of the year ended Feb. 1, 2014.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased to $178.8 million from $153.8 million.\nOllie’s had total current assets, including cash, inventories, deferred income taxes and prepaid expenses, of $198.3 million, and long-term debt of $313.5 million.\nMeanwhile, because Ollie’s had less than $1 billion in revenue during the last fiscal year, it qualifies as an “emerging growth” company, meaning it can take advantage of reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements for up to five years, that are generally applicable to larger public companies.\nOllie ‘Other represents the biggest slice of the sales pie Slide 5 of 5 Ollie’s 12-member merchant team is led by five senior merchants, including co-founder and Chief Executive Mark Butler. They principally buy “produced, overstocked and closeout merchandise from manufacturers, wholesalers and other retailers.”\nIn 2014, the biggest piece of the merchandise sales pie, at 32% of total sales, was “other,” which includes diverse offerings such as electronics, personal health care, candy, pet products, automotive and furniture.\nThat was followed by housewares at 14.7%, food at 12.5% and books and stationary at 10.9%.\nThe company has two distribution centers, one in York, Penn. and the other in Commerce, GA.\n“The common element of our dynamic merchandise selection is the consistent delivery of great deals to our customers, with products offered at prices up to 70% below department stores and fancy stores and up to 20%-50% below mass-market retailers,” the company said in its IPO filing.\nWATCHES\n• The wristwatch’s time isn’t up\n• Smartphones leave room for Swatch (24/7 Wall St.)\n• Swatch buys U.S. jeweler Harry Winston Prev Page 1 2 3 4 5 Next Page You Might Like", "external_links": ["http://247wallst.com/consumer-products/2013/07/23/swatch-and-the-robust-health-of-the-watch-economy/?link=mktw"], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T22:31:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
