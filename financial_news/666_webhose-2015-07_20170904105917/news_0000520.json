The ECB’s Executive Board recommended that the limit stay in place for now, one person said. The Greek central bank asked for an increase of 1.5 billion euros, the people said. Spokesmen for the ECB and the Bank of Greece declined to comment.\nWhile Greek lawmakers have now passed reform measures demanded by creditors in return for negotiating a third bailout package, that may not yet be enough for the ECB to change its stance. With European-led funding still not signed off, Greece’s ability to repay a 3.5 billion-euro bond to the central bank on July 20 isn’t guaranteed.\nThe Governing Council meeting is currently taking place in Frankfurt and no decision has been announced. ECB President Mario Draghi is scheduled to hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. local time. The current freeze on Greek ELA has been in place since June 28.\nGreece’s parliament debated for more than four hours into early Thursday morning to approve the austerity measures that are a precondition for talks on an aid package of as much as 86 billion euros.\nThe country’s banks, which have been shut and under capital controls for more than two weeks, may need more liquidity on hand to allow them to reopen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T12:29:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
