Photo: New York Times\nTelstra is taking on US internet giant Airbnb over the Australian use of its global tagline - \"Belong Anywhere\".\nAirbnb is an internet service that connects home owners with spare rooms to customers that want to rent them out. The company was valued at $US25.5 billion ($34.7 billion) during a June capital raising, where it reaped $US1.5 billion ($2 billion) from investors .\nBut its global clout has come a cropper in Australia after Telstra lodged an attempt to stop Airbnb from trademarking its international tagline. This would protect the US company's branding across the country.\nTelstra's efforts are likely due to its October 2013 launch of a low-cost broadband subsidiary, named Belong. The junior telco is a Jet Star-style play that attempts to capture younger customers who wouldn't normally sign up with Telstra.\nAccording to documents seen by Fairfax Media, Airbnb first attempted to gain trademark rights over the \"Belong Anywhere\" tagline on October 9, 2014 with approval granted at the end of the month.\nBut in January Telstra notified the regulators that it intended to oppose Airbnb's efforts through its intellectual property legal representatives at Davies Collison Cave.\nAirbnb attempted to change its application in February but Telstra opposed the new bid as well, which lead to the US tech company lodging its intention to defend in March.\nMany of Telstra's targets give up their attempts due to the time and cost required to fight back.\nBut Airbnb co-founder and chief executive Brian Chesky said \"Belong Anywhere\" was more than just a marketing slogan when he helped launch the new branding campaign in July 2014.\n\"We asked ourselves, 'what is our mission? What is the big idea that truly defines Airbnb?,'\" he wrote on the company's website. \"Really, we're about home. You see, a house is just a space, but a home is where you belong.\n\"And what makes this global community so special is that for the very first time, you can belong anywhere. That is the idea at the core of our company: belonging.\"\nTelstra's efforts will most likely be lauded by hoteliers and bodies like Tourism Accommodation Australia , which have called for Airbnb to face more regulations.\nAirbnb is being represented by Addison Lawyers and both parties are in a cooling off period. This means they can continue using their brands and taglines until an injunction is filed.\nTelstra is separately working to block the \"Ready Business\" trademark of its rival, Vodafone Australia .", "external_links": ["http://blog.airbnb.com/belong-anywhere/"], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T12:14:38.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
