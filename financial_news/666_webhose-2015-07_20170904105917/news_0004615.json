In Europe, chip designer ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) , a major supplier, fell 6 percent and German chipmaker Dialog Semiconductor tumbled 6.6 percent. \n\"Apple is a really big company, and having disappointed a little bit on the sales side of things, does tend to reverberate around the world in technology stocks,\" said Wouter Sturkenboom, a senior investment strategist at Russell Investments. \nAcross Europe, technology stocks shed nearly $6 billion of market value. \nArt Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York, said there is concern regarding the lack of organic revenue growth and the strong dollar, which will continue to be a drag but that effect should moderate over time. \nThe FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares fell 0.55 percent at 1,587.50, while MSCI (NYSE: MSCI - news ) 's all-country world stock index was down 0.67 percent. \nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 58.76 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,860.53. The S&P 500 slid 5.46 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,113.75 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 39.47 points, or 0.76 percent, to 5,168.65. \nThe dollar index, a gauge of the greenback against a basket of currencies, extended its rise after data showed U.S. home resales hit an 8-1/2-year high in June, and was last up 0.33 percent at 97.648. \nThe euro fell 0.39 percent to $1.0893, while the dollar rose 0.12 percent at 124.02 yen. \nSterling gained in response to minutes from the Bank of England's last meeting that suggested some policymakers support higher interest rates. \nThe British pound rose 0.5 percent at $1.5631. \nOil prices fell as U.S. crude stockpiles rose last week, remaining high above the five-year seasonal average, while gasoline stocks decreased and distillate inventories rose, data from the Energy Information Administration showed. \nBrent crude was down 69 cents at $56.35 a barrel. U.S. crude dipped below $50 a barrel, trading down 92 cents at $49.94 a barrel. \nGold fell more than 1 percent to a five-year low as a bounce in the dollar fueled downside momentum. \nU.S. gold futures for August delivery were down 1.3 percent at $1,089.10 an ounce. \nCopper prices hit a two-week low as worries about demand from top consumer China mounted. \nBenchmark and long-dated Treasury yields hit their lowest levels in nearly two weeks as poor sentiment from U.S. corporate earnings reports drove safe-haven buying. Uncertainty ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting capped gains. \nBenchmark 10-year Treasury notes were last up 10/32 in price to yield 2.3055 percent. \n\"The weakness in the stock market over the last two days has helped push Treasuries prices higher,\" said Shyam Rajan, U.S. rates strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. \n(Reporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T18:45:11.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
