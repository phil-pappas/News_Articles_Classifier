Citigroup had no immediate comment. Credit Suisse Group AG, one of the other banks named by CADE, had no immediate comment.\nThe alleged acts took place from at least 2007 to 2013, CADE said. The banks coordinated their actions using chat services provided by Bloomberg LP, and some of the participants referred to the group as \"the cartel\" or \"the mafia,\" according to CADE. Bloomberg had no immediate comment.\nBloomberg is a competitor of The Wall Street Journal in the provision of financial news.\nThe banks also collaborated to influence certain reference indexes that affect the exchange market such as the Central Bank of Brazil's PTAX rate, CADE said. The banks shared information on clients' orders, futures contract prices and the size of operations already carried out, among other things, according to CADE.\nAt least one of the participants in the alleged cartel is cooperating with authorities, CADE said.\nWrite to Jeffrey T.
