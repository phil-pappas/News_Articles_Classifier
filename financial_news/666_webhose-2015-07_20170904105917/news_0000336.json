We will look at opportunities once able to do so.\" \n- Lid on prices - \nLooking ahead, \"the extent of the impact on oil prices will depend primarily on the domestic capability to get oil on the market\", said Nina Skero, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. \n\"We expect Brent crude to recover somewhat from the price drop which followed today's deal announcement and trade around $60 per barrel for the remainder of the year,\" she added. \nWorld oil prices collapsed by 60 percent between June 2014 and January when it hit a low of $45. This in part was owing to excessive supplies caused by the boom in US shale oil. \nWhile OPEC on Monday revised upward its forecast for global crude oil demand growth for this year, it warned that crude output would also continue to increase. \nIran's OPEC peers Saudi Arabia and Iraq \"have both significantly ramped up production this year\", noted Richard Mallinson, analyst at research group Energy Aspects. \n\"There is little chance that these countries, and other OPEC members, are going to reduce output to make space for a return of Iranian production,\" he told AFP. \n\"While the actual increase from Iran will only start next year, expect to see significant competition between sellers for market share, particularly in Asia.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T20:01:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
