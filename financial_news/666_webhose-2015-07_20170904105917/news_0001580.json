Julienne Schaer Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Australian's purchasing power will deteriorate rapidly within two years to levels last seen in the 1990s, according to research that one prominent economist says highlights the need for a fresh wave of growth-enhancing policy reform.\nThe so-called global purchasing power of Australians households will fall to ninth place this year from fifth last year, when only Luxembourg, Norway, Qatar and Switzerland out-ranked Australia.\nInternational Monetary Fund data analysed by Deutsche Bank, measured in terms of per capita gross domestic product in US dollars, shows the days of cheap internet shopping and holidays to Disneyland or New York of the past decade may soon move beyond the reach of many Australians.\nIn a blunt demonstration of how the Reserve Bank of Australia's strategy to drive down the dollar and the end of the resources boom is hitting living standards, Australia's ranking is predicted to worsen to 17th place within two years, driven by lower income growth from commodities, soft wages and a slide in the dollar to US60¢ by 2017, Deutsche Bank economist Adam Boyton estimates.\nThe findings are a wake-up call for the Abbott government, which is expected to call an election within the next 12 months, with analysts warning the new reality of a lower dollar will weigh on consumer sentiment, which is already under pressure from political paralysis in Canberra.\nMr Boyton indicated that Australia's ranking may head back to what it was in the 1990s, when it was around 20th but not as bad as the nadir reached in 2001 when it came in at 25th.\nThe fall in household living standards may add to a growing political debate about Australia's key economic settings. M any economists – led by those at the Reserve Bank of Australia, which is actively seeking to lower the dollar through official interest rate cuts – have welcomed the adjustment of a lower currency as a way of boosting the competitiveness of export sectors such as mining, tourism and education.\nGovernor Glenn Stevens on Tuesday again called for further falls in the currency, even as it traded late on Tuesday at US74.39¢, a six-year low and more than 30 per cent below its 2011 record of more than US$1.08. The Reserve Bank board on Tuesday kept official interest rates at 2 per cent, the lowest level in history.\n Others argue that instead of trying to manage the currency lower – thereby reducing the purchasing power of households further – governments should focus on boosting productivity to ultimately enhance wages and growth.\n\"Falling purchasing power partly reflects the inevitable end of the mining boom but it also reflects that much of the adjustment in the economy is happening through interest rates and the currency, and not enough through economic reform that could lift productivity, lift wages and support growth in that way,\" Mr Boyton said.\n\"What was never explained well to Australians was that when the currency was high and things from online retailers were cheap, and holidays overseas were cheap, that was how everyday Australians – even if they didn't go near the mining sector – got a benefit from the mining boom.\"\nWhile Mr Boyton said households are wealthier than ever before, their relative global purchasing power headed back to where it was two decades ago, when the economy ground through an agonisingly slow recovery from the early 1990s recession.\n\"These are the real things that impact the ability of Australians to have higher living standards or take advantage of things beyond our shores,\" Mr Boyton said.\nA spokeswoman for Treasurer Joe Hockey said the government has consistently recognised the need to raise productivity to create new jobs and boost incomes.\nDespite the largest fall in the terms of trade in half a century, economic growth remains among the world's fastest, she said.\n\"That's why this government is focused on improving workforce participation, committing to building productivity enhancing infrastructure, boosting innovation and competitiveness and encouraging the entrepreneurial spirit of Australians including through our $5.5 billion jobs and small business package.\"\nLabor Treasury spokesman Chris Bowen said the Deutsche Bank research was \"exactly the reason we need a government with an economic plan for diversified growth.\n\"The Abbott government hasn't seen an industry it doesn't want to see the back of … we see the Treasurer and Agriculture Minister regularly attacking different sources of foreign investment.\n\"Labor has already begun to put forward policies to enhance investments and training in STEM, that's the key to developing the businesses and jobs of the future.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-07-07T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T18:12:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
