He told reporters in Vienna on Tuesday that “a mix of different alternatives” will be found.\nEuro-area ministers will discuss Greece’s short-term financing on a conference call later Tuesday or Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T13:52:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
