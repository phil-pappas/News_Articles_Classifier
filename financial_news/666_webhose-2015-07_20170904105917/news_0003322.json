PUBLISHED: 17:21, Mon, Jul 20, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:39, Mon, Jul 20, 2015 GETTY A french bank is offering a top savings rate in Britain \nRCI Bank launched in the UK last month with its Freedom Savings Account and has now increased returns for all customers - new and existing. The account can be opened with £100 and a maximum balance of £1 million can be deposited. Customers don't have any \"gimmicks or small print\" to tackle with no penalties, notice periods or tiered rates applied to the account. Critics said the account was a \"breath of fresh air\" for Britain's beleaguered savers. However, savers should be aware that the account is covered by the French Compensation Scheme - covering savings up to the value of €100,000 (£70,000)- and not the UK's Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).The FSCS is Britain's safety net for savers - it means your cash pot (up to £85,000) is protected if the brand were to go bust. Charlotte Nelson, finance expert at Moneyfacts.co.uk, said: “RCI Bank UK is setting the market on fire with this market-leading easy access account, which has consequently stormed to the top of the charts. “Many easy access accounts on the market today limit the number of withdrawals savers can make per year, but the Freedom Savings Account is a breath a fresh air as it allows unlimited withdrawals. “This is a great account for those looking to kick-start their savings habit and watch their savings grow.\" Steve Gowler, chief executive of RCI Bank, said: “Our aim is always to offer simple, straightforward and competitive savings products. \"When we launched back in June, our vision was to create innovative and competitive products that made saving money simple. We were confident we had a product that people would love, but we've been thrilled by the response and warm welcome to our Freedom Savings Account. Over the next few months we plan to follow this up with further product launches.\"The brand is backed by French car maker Renault and hopes to bring more products to the market later this year and has a dedicated UK based customer service team open seven days a week. The provider is one of a number of new brands trying to take on the UK financial stalwarts. The Al Rayan Bank offers a top rate of two per cent on its Notice Cash ISA, while Paragon Bank offers a leading 2.07 per cent return on a one-year fixed rate bond.
