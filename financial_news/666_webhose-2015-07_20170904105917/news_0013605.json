Further indications that the economy is still not anywhere close to turning the corner could certainly spook Chinese stocks again,\" Markus Huber, senior analyst at Peregrine & Black, said. \nA sharp sell-off in Chinese shares over the past weeks have stoked concerns about a growth slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in BP, Statoil (Xetra: 675213 - news ) , Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) fell 1.2 to 2.0 percent. \nAntofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGF - news ) slumped 4.7 percent, also under pressure after Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) cut its target price for the stock of the company, which is buying half of Barrick Gold (Hanover: ABR.HA - news ) 's Zaldivar copper mine for $1 billion in cash. \nThe FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.2 percent at 1,567.74 points by 1045 GMT after rising to a one-week high of 1,575.11 points earlier in the session on the back of some positive earnings updates. \nUCB surged 6.8 percent, the top gainer in the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, after the Belgian pharmaceutical company raised its 2015 forecasts as sales of its three major upcoming drugs propelled first-half earnings by more than expected. \nBNP Paribas gained 2.7 percent after its revenue rose nearly 16 percent in the second quarter, while Natixis was up 2.8 percent after reporting a 5 percent rise in net income. \n\"Overall, the results so far have been pretty good, with the banking sector putting in some good numbers as well,\" said Clairinvest fund manager Ion-Marc Valahu. \nAirbus rose 3.7 percent after posting a 6 percent rise in first-half core operating profit. \nAccording to Thomson Reuters StarMine, nearly half of the STOXX Europe 600 companies have announced results so far, of which 53 percent have met or beaten analysts' forecasts. \nOn average, 48 percent companies beat analyst EPS (earnings per share) estimates in a quarter. Second quarter earnings are expected to grow by 5.7 percent from the corresponding quarter of the previous year. \nEurope bourses in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/pap87v \nAsset performance in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/gap87v \nToday's European research round-up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T14:10:22.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
