Bank of America had asked junk-bond investors whether it should remove emerging-market bonds after a slew of rating cuts to Brazilian and Russian companies boosted their share of the benchmark.\nA majority of funds surveyed in the annual review voted to keep emerging-market bonds in the broader measure, while “a large number” expressed interest in trading benchmarks that exclude the borrowers, according to analysts Phil Galdi and Preston Peacock. The decision is a compromise between investors who want the measure to better reflect the corporate high-yield market and those seeking higher yields associated with extra political risk.\n“While we chose to side with the majority,” the analysts wrote in a report on Tuesday, “the results of the vote make it clear that no single answer addresses all needs.”\nPrice Swings A removal of emerging-market companies, which accounted for 18 percent of the index at the end of March, could have triggered price swings if bondholders were forced to sell those securities and raise funding costs for excluded companies. Any change would be a “short-term reaction to recent events” and could cause “an undesirable level of rebalancing volatility and associated costs,” they wrote.\nInvestors argued that sovereign risk also exists in developed markets such as Greece and that there’s precedent for maintaining companies in the global benchmark after large-scale downgrades such as those to telecommunication, automotive and financial sectors between 2001 and 2009.\nThe global index tracks 3,711 securities. Brazilian and Russian companies now account for 8.2 percent, compared with 3.7 percent at the end of 2014, while U.S. companies make up 52 percent.\nEmerging-market companies will also remain in the euro high-yield index, which tracks securities with a face value of $313 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T13:39:15.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
