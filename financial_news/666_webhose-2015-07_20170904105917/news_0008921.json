Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, revenue rose 25 percent. \nThe company's search and applications business, which houses brands such as Investopedia, About.com and Dictionary.com, fell 11 percent. The business accounts for half of total revenue. \nThat dragged down total revenue growth to 2 percent. Still total revenue of $771.1 million beat analysts' average estimate of $776 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nIAC's net income was $59.3 million, or 68 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $18 million, or 22 cents per share. \nOn an adjusted basis, IAC earned 85 cents per share, easily beating estimates of 59 cents. \nIAC's shares have risen more than 32 percent this year through Tuesday's close of $80.60 on the Nasdaq. \n(Reporting by Sai Sachin R and Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T00:57:39.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
