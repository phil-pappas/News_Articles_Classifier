The 2014 second-quarter earnings were depressed by $1.2 billion in elevated costs for car recalls following an ignition-switch scandal. \nRevenue dipped 3.7 percent to $38.18 billion. GM attributed the drop to the strong dollar. \nOperating earnings in North America were roughly double that of last year at $2.8 billion, setting a new company quarterly record due in part to robust sales of sport utility vehicles and other large cars in its home market. \nThe profit margin in North America, by far GM's largest region by revenues, hit 10.5 percent in the quarter, up from 8.8 percent in the first quarter of the year. Barra has promised to reach a 10 percent profit margin in 2016. \nEarnings in GM International Operations, which includes China, rose 10.8 percent to $349 million. GM delivered 823,000 cars in China, up 2.6 percent from a year ago. \nGM chief financial officer Chuck Stevens said the company has taken a number of steps to manage the Chinese market through cost cutting, working with dealers to manage inventory levels and boosting output of popular SUV models. \nGM owns research and auto parts businesses in China and manufactures vehicles through a number of joint ventures with Chinese companies. \nThe automaker \"will continue to closely monitor\" China as growth slows, Stevens said. The company has analyzed downturn scenarios for China, but believes car sales will remain healthy, he added. \n\"GM expects strong results in China will be sustained through\" the second half of 2015, the company said in an investor presentation. \nGM had a smaller operating loss in Europe than in the year-ago quarter. Stevens said the company was on track to reach a target to return the division to profitability in 2016. \nThe weakest division was South America, where GM had an operating loss of $144 million, deeper than the $81 million lost a year ago. In Brazil, sales slid 35.2 percent to just 92,000 vehicles. \nGM's earnings were negatively affected by charges totaling $1.1 billion. These items included a $600 million charge for a currency devaluation in Venezuela and $400 million write-down on assets, primarily in Thailand. \nThe company also spent an additional $100 million in compensation for victims of accidents due to defective ignition switches. \nIn the year-ago quarter, GM had $1.3 billion in charges, including $400 million for the ignition-switch compensation fund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T20:46:02.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
