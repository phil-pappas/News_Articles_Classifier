To aid in the transition, the Arkansas Insurance Department eliminated its Health Connector Division and replaced it with the Regulatory Health Link Division. \nThe department says the new division will provide regulation and guidance of federal health insurance market reforms. \nInformation from: Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, http://www.arkansasonline.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:22:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
