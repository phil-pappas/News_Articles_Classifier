Simon Schluter by Trevor Sykes There's a touch of hockey-stick about the prospectus for horticultural giant Costa Group.\nInvestors are being asked to put up about $600 million for three-quarters of a business whose statutory accounts show it barely broke even in the past two years but will return net profit after tax (NPAT) of $23 million after the float. This jump is supposed to happen because Costa will be selling more produce, largely thanks to its blueberry joint venture in Morocco.\nNevertheless it's an impressive business, Costa being Australia's largest horticultural company and the largest supplier of fresh fruit and tomatoes to Australian retailers. The group generated revenue of $704 million in 2014-15, accounting for about 9 per cent of total fruit and vegetable sales in Australia. That revenue includes sales on behalf of third parties.\nCosta has 91 per cent of the raspberry market in Australia (of which 66 per cent is grown by Costa), 77 per cent of the blueberry market (41 per cent grown by Costa) and is Australia's largest provider of tomatoes with 18 per cent of the market. It is also the largest supplier of citrus fruits.\nInternationally Costa earns royalty income licensing its blueberry varieties and is expanding into blueberry farms in southern China and Morocco (as a springboard into Europe).\nIn Australia, Costa has operations in every state and can deliver to its customers 52 weeks of the year. It is vertically integrated from planting and growing into warehousing and distribution.\nThis is a high-tech business. Taking mushrooms as an example, the spawn is produced at Costa's laboratory in Victoria and inserted into growing medium which has been prepared under sterile conditions. Compost is prepared carefully over 20 to 21 days and heated in a controlled temperature environment for a week, before spawn and supplement are added plus a surface layer of peat. The mushrooms are grown in temperature and humidity-controlled rooms, and taken to distribution centres in refrigerated trucks.\nCosta is organised to deliver all its products fresh every day to every major customer in Australia, which includes Woolworths, Coles, Aldi and IGA.\n Drawback One drawback is that the float is being done through a book-build with the indicated range between $2.20 and $2.70 a share. That means subscribers to the float will, once again, have to nominate how many shares they want by Thursday without knowing the price, which will be confirmed at the book-build next Wednesday.\nThe vendors are selling 167 million shares and a further 68 million to 78 million new shares are being offered. After the float, the vendors will retain about 23 per cent equity in the company with the rest being held by subscribers. Costa will have about 315 million shares issued and is forecasting NPAT of $47.6 million (excluding float costs) in the current financial year. At, say, $2.50 a share, that indicates a price/earnings ratio around 17 times and a dividend yield of maybe 3 per cent.\nAnd after the float, the company will still have gross debt of about $142 million and be facing capital expenditure of $27 million, mostly to build a super-glasshouse at Guyra in NSW.\nThe biggest drawback is that subscribers are only being offered shares in the business. Apart from the mushroom business, the farms are nearly all leased. Blueberries, which are Costa's biggest single business, are grown on farms covering 533 hectares, of which 477 remain owned by the Costa family. The good news is that the leases are generally long, some not expiring until 2036.\nProperty, plant and equipment are valued at $180 million in Costa's balance sheet, although much of the land and equipment is leased. Several of the berries are increasingly grown in tunnels or hydroponically. Glasshouses, orange trees and watering systems are not easily mobile assets - and where would the company move them to, anyway? The existing farms are mostly on prime (hence expensive) agricultural land, which was specifically bought for the crops concerned.\nSo the vendors will pick up about $400 million by diluting their equity, but they remain landlords of a business which would be difficult to move. The rent on these leases will amount to nearly $20 million in 2015-16. But food is such a great strategic business, my super fund will grit its teeth and subscribe for shares anyway.\nTrevor Sykes is not a licensed investment adviser.
