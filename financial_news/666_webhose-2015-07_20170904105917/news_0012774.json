The price range represents a 13.7 percent to 20 percent discount to Haitong’s last close in Hong Kong.\nHaixia Capital is offloading its stake at a loss after a 45 percent plunge in Haitong’s Hong Kong-traded shares over the past month. A flurry of measures to stabilize the Chinese stock market, including a pledge by state-run financial firms to buy 120 billion yuan ($19.3 billion) of shares and a halt to initial public offerings, is failing to stop a rout that erased more than $3.2 trillion of value.\nThe fund manager, backed by government-owned State Development & Investment Corp., bought the Haitong shares earlier this year at HK$17.18 each, as part of a $4.2 billion stock sale completed in May, Hong Kong exchange filings show.\nHaitong fell 13 percent to close at HK$13.90 in Hong Kong trading on Tuesday.\nUBS Group AG is sole bookrunner for Haixia’s disposal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T20:50:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
