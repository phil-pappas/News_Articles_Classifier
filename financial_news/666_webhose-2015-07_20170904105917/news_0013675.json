Engagement with a platform [like Facebook] is different – that’s about being entertained,\" Dr Karen Nelson-Field says. by Paul McIntyre Designing content to \"go viral\" or be shared is a myth that corporate strategists and brand owners the world over have mistakenly believed, in part because of Facebook and the \"textbook of Zuckerberg\", a leading academic says.\nDr Karen Nelson-Field, director of the newly formed global Centre for Digital Video Intelligence at the University of South Australia's Business School, says a two-year study of thousands of digital videos unpacking what makes them shareable is good news for media owners and not so flash for those advocating companies create their own content and have it shared across social networks for free.\nAt the core of Dr Nelson-Field's research is that brand owners must realise they need to \"pay to reach audiences\" with their content, rather than rely on people sharing voluntarily between each other. The average piece of content had to be viewed by 24 people before it generated one share. Using paid media fast-tracked the exposure of a video piece to a bigger audience and subsequently improved sharing, she said.\n\"What we found is most content is shared a lot less than people think,\" Dr Nelson-Field told The Australian Financial Review. \"The average view-to-share ratio is 24 to 1. So when you have 100 people in a room the actual sharing is small but when you have 1000 people in a room you get a whole bunch more shares, even though the content itself hasn't changed.\"\nBuy their way It essentially means brands can buy their way into the sharing economy through paid advertising. At first glance the argument does not bode well for the creative industries, which have argued for decades that content quality and ideas are a key influence in determining the commercial outcome for an advertisement, for example. And Dr Nelson-Field agrees. \"The average piece of high-arousal content has an 8 to 1 sharing ratio, so when you throw in creative it does change the ratio and significantly so,\" she said. \"It's still important to build quality content but the problem is you can't do that every single time because not every piece of content can be outstanding. There are really very few pieces of hero content. Marketers get a bit depressed at that. But even if you've got an average piece of creative, you can still seed that appropriately. You have to buy more [advertising space] upfront to do it but you will still end up with the same amount of shares at the other end.\"\nStill, Dr Nelson-Field's research fundamentally challenges widespread belief among the digerati that building \"brand communities\" from loyal brand users through social platforms and brand-owned media channels is a strategic imperative for companies. She said it was generally wayward thinking perpetuated by vested interests.\nThe former SA Tourism marketer-turned academic caused all sorts of trouble on this front for Facebook in the lead-up to its IPO in 2012, challenging Facebook's widely accepted mantra that brands should shift their focus away from paid media advertising to \"engagement\" and \"conversations\" with customers in a new digital world of two-way interaction. The problem for Facebook at the time, and even for today's social media marketing gurus, is that Dr Nelson-Field empirically showed that just 1 per cent of fans on Facebook brand pages actually ever returned.\n Not interested Moreover, she drew on research showing the majority of people are not interested in interacting regularly with brands, are not loyal to them but rather are loyal to switching between brands in any given category. In other words, most are perpetually promiscuous about the brands and products they choose. It has blown-up many digital marketing agendas but Dr Nelson-Field said there remained an army of advisers and marketers perpetuating the idea that people are genuinely interested in \"engaging with brands\".\n\"I could nearly choke on that word 'engagement',\" she said.\n\"Engagement with a brand is a total myth. Engagement with a platform [like Facebook] is different – that's about being entertained. But the idea of engagement with brands was led by the textbook of Zuckerberg. My understanding with Facebook's business model is they have realised that and they're trying to express to their brand partners that it is not the be-all and end-all any more. I can't speak on behalf of them but from the meetings I have had with Facebook I think they've actually worked it out. Growth for brands comes from light buyers, definitely outside the brand community and you have to pay to reach them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:04:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
