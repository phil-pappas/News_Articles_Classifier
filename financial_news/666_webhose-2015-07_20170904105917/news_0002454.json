A month-long moving average of the gauge, a smoother barometer than the weekly data, is also close to the greatest level since the summer of 2013.\nApplications for mortgages to buy a home are good news for home sales, which have struggled to regain their footing during a protracted recovery after the bubble burst.\n#MBA #mortgage applications for purchase have been accelerating, a positive sign for existing #homesales http://t.co/1bcZcHqs1E\n— Joseph A. LaVorgna (@Lavorgnanomics) July 8, 2015 Some economists say that the housing market is finally ready to ramp up, with sales of both new and used properties running at multiyear highs. The unemployment rate has dropped and hiring is on the rise, factors that will inspire confidence among prospective borrowers to buy homes and banks to make loans.\nRead more: Housing has ‘turned a corner’ as sales fastest in eight years\nThose worried that the increased interest in purchase mortgages surely signals a housing bubble that is set to burst may take comfort in knowing that applications are still down 59% from a 2005 peak. Elsewhere in the housing market, data from federally controlled mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac FMCC, -2.88% show that homeowners, for the most part, aren’t treating their properties like piggy banks. The share of refinanced mortgages with cash-outs rose 10 percentage points to 27% in the first quarter from a year earlier. However, the amount of equity that owners cashed out when refinancing conventional prime mortgages was low, less than $8 billion in the first quarter, down 91% from a 2006 peak.\nRapidly rising home prices are also worrying some observers. Annual home-price growth just hit a 10-month high, with 10 states reaching records. Even as the growing economy has enabled more families to buy a home, they’ve found a relatively limited number of properties on the market—a dynamic that is supporting home prices.\nThere are benefits and disadvantages to rising home prices. Higher prices help struggling homeowners gain equity, sell their home and firm up their personal finances. But prices that run higher too quickly mean that families, especially younger households, can’t afford to buy a home.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://t.co/1bcZcHqs1E", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/mortgage?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/homesales?src=hash", "http://www.freddiemac.com/finance/pdf/RefiReport2015Q1.pdf", "https://twitter.com/Lavorgnanomics/status/618798195112570881", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MBA?src=hash"], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T22:30:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
