Erin Jonasson Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Mercedes Ruehl Australia is benefiting from the continued expansion by global retailers, especially in luxury products and food, which is helping to drive up rents for prime CBD properties .\nCBRE head of research Stephen McNabb said Australia was benefiting from a continued influx of foreign entrants, with 40 new store openings last year by new or expanding retailers and a further 12 openings in the first half of 2015.\n\"What is important is the drivers for that,\" he said at the CBRE Sydney Market Outlook breakfast on Wednesday. \"From my perspective, that is what Australia's consumption-per-capita growth stands at versus other economies. It is about 4 per cent, whereas the United States and Europe are closer to 2 to 2.5 per cent.\"\nPopulation growth had also averaged about 1.7 per cent over the last decade, whereas other advanced economies had been closer to 0.6 per cent. In Sydney, the amount of new retail supply was low and rents were expected to rise 1.5 per cent.\nThis was helping to drive CBD rental growth, Mr McNabb said, with Sydney CBD rents having increased by 20 per cent in the past 12 months and rental growth also recorded in the shopping centre sector.\nThe CBRE event reviewed the outlook for the office, retail and industrial sectors both in Australian and the broader Asia-Pacific region.\nThe residential market was another focus, with CBRE's managing director, residential projects, David Milton, forecasting continued strength in the Sydney market.\nHowever, with more stock coming on stream, Mr Milton said buyers were becoming increasingly selective, with conversion rates having increased from one in five visitors to a display centre to one in seven or eight. But sales hadn't slowed overall, with total sales 11 per cent higher in the first half of 2015 relative to the corresponding period in 2014.\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/114522070827507984683/posts", "https://twitter.com/mjruehl"], "published": "2015-07-22T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:08:40.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
