The 8-K filing announcing the change offered no context or reason for his departure, saying only that it was \"effective immediately.\" \nSarnoff leaves at an interesting time for the company. Despite the loss of three million World of Warcraft subscribers earlier this year, strength in franchises such as Destiny and Call of Duty have the company producing improved results. In the first quarter, revenue jumped 15% year-over-year, according to data from S&P Capital IQ . Earnings from continuing operations grew 34.5% over the same period, and more growth could be on the way. \nAs I write this, Activision is preparing to unveil upgrades to its signature Skylanders franchise at San Diego Comic Con. Why leave when the growth story is getting better? \nThere is no easy answer to that question, but Sarnoff could be lightening his workload in advance of taking on more responsibility at KKR, the private equity company where he has spent years directing investments in media and communications companies. That is apparently about to change. \nIn May, Reuters reported on a memo announcing Sarnoff and colleague Herald Chen as co-leaders of a new combined KKR team focused on technology, media, and telecom. \nFor Activision, this departure means it must either adjust its seats or find a new independent director to go with the seven who remain. The latter seems more likely. \nAccording to the latest proxy filing, Sarnoff was one of three directors on the audit committee, which oversees accounting and financial reporting processes at the company. \nThis $19 trillion industry could destroy the Internet One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed -- and if you act soon, it could make you rich.
