And so we'll see if the wage momentum continues today and if that conversation changes course again. \nIn a note to clients ahead of the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said that seasonal adjustments could impact the headline payrolls number, but nevertheless expects an above-consensus jobs gains of 260,000 in June. \nShepherdson added that he expects a drop in the unemployment rate to 5.3%. \nMarkets have been pre-occupied by the Greece situation all week, but that doesn't mean you can just go ahead and forget about the biggest US economic report of the month. \nIt's Jobs Day in America, and we'll be here with complete reaction when the numbers cross.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T15:14:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
