Firms must demonstrate that they cannot fill a post with a British-based worker before they can sponsor an application for this visa. \n“I understand the need of government to tackle public concerns about migration but I don’t think they are concerned about skilled migrants or students,” he said, referring to the Home Office plans to limit international students working during or after their studies. \nThe CBI's John Cridland said the Government was in a cul-de-sac on migration targets \nThe current cap on skilled migrants “worked during the recession\" but wouldn’t be appropriate now, added deputy director general Katja Hall, although the CBI has not suggested how much the cap should be raised. \nLast month, the Government asked the Migration Advisory Committee to report back this year on the effects of restricting tier two visas further, only allowing non-EEA candidates into the country if they are relevant to “genuine skills shortages and highly specialist experts”. \nAccording to the Home Office, there was a 13pc rise in tier two visa applications to 93,067 in the year to March., which includes the general visas included in the cap as well as visas for inter-company transfers, sportspeople and ministers of religion. Four-fifths of the applications came from the US, India, Australia, China and Japan. \nMr Cridland said the Conservatives \"need to back out of the cul-de-sac they are in\" on the net migration target of less than 100,000 people a year, suggesting that gross migration was a more useful measure of visa policies. \nHe also said that the new living wage is “a gamble” that could see firms reduce working hours to offset the additional cost. “The CBI supports a higher skilled, higher wage economy, but legislating for a living wage does not reflect businesses’ ability to pay, especially small firms.\" * David Cameron will never hit his net migration target - here's why", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T08:26:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
