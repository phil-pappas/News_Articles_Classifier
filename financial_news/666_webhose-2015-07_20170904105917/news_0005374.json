The next day, the Chamber of Commerce said in a press release that it is not promoting the use of tobacco, but is working to make sure intellectual property rights are protected and international agreements are upheld, and is fighting against discriminatory treatment of unpopular industries. \nOn Tuesday the Chamber of Commerce said it makes a \"principled defense of the rights of companies and the free enterprise system\" that applies to all industries, not just tobacco. The organization advocates says its members include about 3 million businesses ranging from small companies to major corporations. \nCVS Health Inc. runs the second-largest chain of drugstores in the U.S., with about 7,800 locations, and manages prescription benefits for about 70 million people through its Caremark division. The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based stopped selling tobacco products at its stores in September because it was concentrating on health care. \nCompetitors Walgreen Boots Alliance Inc. and Rite Aid Corp. haven't announced any plans to stop selling tobacco products. Walgreen has about 8,200 stores in the U.S. and Rite Aid has about 4,600. \nShares of CVS Health rose $1.57 to $106.38 on Tuesday.
