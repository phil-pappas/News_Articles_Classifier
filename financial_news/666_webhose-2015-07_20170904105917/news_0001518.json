The report analysed 9 banks wherein it collected data and counting the mentions for each company on Twitter and Facebook. The report said that HDFC Bank replied to 45 per cent of the queries while SBI replied to 41 per cent. Among other banks, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and Standard Chartered Bank has failed to address 80 per cent of the queries, it says. \"ICICI Bank and Axis Bank fared the best on Facebook but they did not do exceptionally well on Twitter,\" the report said. As of now, Yes Bank has the highest number of followers on Twitter - a little over 5 lakh, State Bank of India is second highest at a little over 2 lakh follows while Kotak Mahindra has a little over 1 lakh followers. The report point out that HDFC Bank is most active bank of Twitter but couldn't get much attention for their effort. The study says that on Facebook, SBI is most active bank with 3 post per day while 'Kotak Mahindra Bank couldn't see much attention of fans with almost zero post per day.' The report took into account social media interaction between June 13 and June 28. The nine banks include SBI, HDFC Bank, Yes Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank , Axis bank, Citibank, IDBI Bank and Standard Chartered Bank.
