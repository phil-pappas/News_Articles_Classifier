Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Geoff Winestock Shenhua Watermark faces a contractual obligation to start construction of its controversial $1.2 billion coal mine by the end of 2016, making it harder to delay the project to help Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce retain his seat at the next federal election.\nThe Australian Financial Review has learned that Chinese state-owned Shenhua agreed in October 2008, when it paid $300 million to NSW for its exploration licence in the prime agricultural land of the Liverpool Plains, that if it failed to start \"substantial development of a mine within eight years\" it could forfeit the licence.\nThat means Shenhua has to start the mine before October 2016, about the time a federal election is due.\nThat could add to pressure on Mr Joyce, the local member, who local farmers could blame for failing to stop the unpopular project, which they say threatens local water supplies . Former independent MP for New England Tony Windsor has suggested he might re-enter politics on a ticket of fighting the mine.\nJoel Fitzgibbon, the Labor MP for the nearby seat of Hunter, said on Sunday Mr Joyce should resign to prove he was serious.\n\"He has two choices â€“ he backs the government decision or resigns.\"\nThe project received approval from federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt last week despite Mr Joyce's opposition .\nShort delay It is understood that Shenhua could ask for a short delay from the October 2016 deadline because of a court challenge by environmental groups to NSW state government planning approval for the project, which was given in January. That challenge is over concern for the local koala population.\nHowever, Shenhua project manager Paul Jackson said on Sunday that the company wanted to push ahead with the mine as fast as possible, given the five-year delay already caused by planning and environmental approval.\nMr Jackson dismissed suggestions that the low price of coal made the project financially unviable.\n\"The project has a sound economic case regardless of the current coal price, given the quality of the coal, multiple products available from different seams and the low expected operating costs.\"\nThe low-sulphur coal in its Watermark tenement was needed to help Shenhua's Chinese power plants comply with more stringent pollution controls, Mr Jackson said.\n\"Unlike other miners, Shenhua is not just a coal trader but an end user of the coal at its power plants. China is moving towards building high-efficiency, low-emission power stations and this means there is value in securing a long-term, stable supply of high-quality coal.\"\nGiven federal and NSW state planning approval has already been given, the only procedural step remaining before construction starts is for Shenhua to convert its exploration licence formally into a mining licence.\nNo discretion A spokesman for NSW Energy Minister Anthony Roberts said the NSW government had \"almost no discretion\" in this process, which sources said was usually an administrative formality.\nThe NSW Department of Energy and Resources can reject an application for converting an exploration into a mining licence at this stage only on a few technical grounds, including that the applicant is not a fit and proper person or lacks technical expertise, or the site is subject to a land rights claim.\nMeanwhile, NSW opposition energy spokesman Adam Searle said the NSW government should force Shenhua's proposal to be reassessed using new planning policies announced last week, which give equal weight to the \"trinity\" of economic, environmental and social considerations.\nThis amends the previous policy, which made economic benefit the primary consideration.\n\"Any failure to have the Shenhua proposal assessed under the reintroduced trinity would make the NSW government's planning policy change a joke,\" Mr Searle said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/GeoffWinestock", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108137886892627412852"], "published": "2015-07-12T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T10:57:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
