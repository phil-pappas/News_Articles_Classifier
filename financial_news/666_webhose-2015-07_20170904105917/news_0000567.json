However, Delta and others are facing intense competition and lower demand, which is weighing on their ability to raise fares . \nThe rest of the airline group doesn't report until later in the month. \nDeutsche Bank projects pre-tax profit for U.S. airlines of $6.3 billion compared to $5 billion a year ago with operating margins expanding 3.8 points to 17.6%, according to a July 12 note. More Headlines The 11 Highest-Yielding Nasdaq 100 Dividend Stocks \n\"Lower fuel expense accounts for more than double the improvement in operating and pretax profits,\" the note said. \n\"For that reason, we have seen investors ascribe lower valuations to fuel-driven earnings growth, particularly for major airlines which are bearing the brunt of the revenue declines,\" the Deutsche Bank note said. \"We continue to favor domestic names, especially those with a self-help element underlying their investment thesis.\" \nDelta Air Lines is a \"buy\" as per TheStreet Ratings. Here's five more airline stocks worth considering. \nTheStreet Ratings , TheStreet' s proprietary ratings tool, projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and dividends. Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nNote: Year-to-date returns are based on July 14, 2015 closing prices. \n\nRating: Buy, A-Year-to-date return: 28.7% \nAllegiant Travel Company, a leisure travel company, focuses on the provision of travel services and products to residents of under-served cities in the United States. \nTheStreet said: \"We rate ALLEGIANT TRAVEL CO (ALGT) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, expanding profit margins, good cash flow from operations, notable return on equity and solid stock price performance. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company is trading at a premium valuation based on our review of its current price compared to such things as earnings and book value.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: ALGT's revenue growth has slightly outpaced the industry average of 3.0%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 8.8%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share. 47.11% is the gross profit margin for ALLEGIANT TRAVEL CO which we consider to be strong. It has increased significantly from the same period last year. Along with this, the net profit margin of 19.70% significantly outperformed against the industry average. Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 51.78% to $162.96 million when compared to the same quarter last year. Despite an increase in cash flow, ALLEGIANT TRAVEL CO's cash flow growth rate is still lower than the industry average growth rate of 74.13%. The company's current return on equity greatly increased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of significant strength within the corporation. In comparison to other companies in the Airlines industry and the overall market on the basis of return on equity, ALLEGIANT TRAVEL CO has underperformed in comparison with the industry average, but has greatly exceeded that of the S&P 500. Powered by its strong earnings growth of 101.07% and other important driving factors, this stock has surged by 54.82% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period. We feel that the stock's sharp appreciation over the last year has driven it to a price level which is now somewhat expensive compared to the rest of its industry. The other strengths this company shows, however, justify the higher price levels.
