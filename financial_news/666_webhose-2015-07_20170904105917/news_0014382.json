Now that Greek voters have rejected the terms of Europeâs bailout, Mal Maiden analyses the potential fallout.\nPT3M50S 620 349 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings Not even the Greeks know for sure what they voted against on Sunday.\nOfficially, it was whether or not they supported the terms of Europe's offer of continuing financial assistance, but the offer had already been rejected by the left-wing Tsipras government, and Angela Merkel and other European leaders were adamant that as a result, the bailout package that Europe and the International Monetary Fund put together for Greece in 2012 had ended.\nGreeks were not voting on Sunday for or against continued austerity as Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his and his finance minister Yanis Varoufakis were suggesting, but about whether Greece stayed in the European Monetary System and the euro, they insisted.\nNot even the Greeks know what they voted against on Sunday. Photo: Reuters\nWhatever the question actually was, the Greeks resoundingly answered no. Tsipras then said his government was ready to begin negotiating again. Varoufakis said a deal was possible within hours - and then he quit, hinting that his resignation had been requested by Tsipras, and asserting that he had agreed to go to help Greece get the deal that it needed and deserved.\nThe markets viewed the fiery finance minister's departure as a positive, and it was. Things could still get out of hand quickly if cool heads don't prevail.\nThe short term issue is whether a way can be found for the European Central Bank to keep giving Greece money that is keeping Greek banks afloat. The key, if there is enough will, is the fact that Europe and Greece haven't actually talked about a new bailout yet.\nThe talks that broke down after months of negotiations and led to the Greek referendum were about Greece agreeing to continue, tough budget reform in return for the final tranches of bailout money from Greece's second rescue in 2012. Regardless of what happened with those talks, a new round of talks about a third bailout package was always going to be needed.\nAfter talks over the final tranche of the 2012 bailout broke down last week the Tsipras government last week actually unsuccessfully asked Europe to begin talking about a new bailout. Now, with the referendum result in and Varoufakis out, Europe might be prepared to return to the table.\nNew talks could give the European Central Bank a reason to continue providing emergency liquidity to Greece, and perhaps, expand it, enabling deposit withdrawal limits in Greece to be eased.\nIt is possible of course that the view Germany led ahead of the referendum that \"no\" vote was a vote against Greece's participation in the euro will still prevail.\nIf it does however, funding for Greece could dry up, and the wheels of a Greek exit from the Euro will begin turning. Greece could start issuing government IOUs to financiers to get emergency funds for its banks. The IOUs would be issued at interest rates and prices that in effect turned them into a new, de facto Greek currency, deeply discounted against the value of the Euro itself: Grexit - Greece's exit from the euro - would be underway, by default.\nFor some, that is the most logical conclusion of the Greek debt crisis.\nA separate currency would have depreciated progressively as Greece's debt crisis developed, boosting Greece's international price competitiveness, and lifting economic growth. A rushed exit from the euro would create much more economic dislocation and deepen Greece's economic downturn in the short to medium term, but still might lead to an economic recovery more quickly than the cash-for-austerity programme that Europe has been prescribing since 2010.\nMarkets sold off on Monday after the Greek referendum, but Europe and the world are better placed today to withstand a Greek meltdown than they have been for years.\nEurope's economy is growing, for one thing. It was not in 2012 when Greece's original rescue package was renegotiated. The earlier bailouts also transferred most of Greece's debt to the public sector, limiting the risk of market contagion, and the European Central Bank has funding in place that will enable it to buy bonds-on market to offset a selling attack if it develops.\nNone of that is to say that Europe should let Greece go easily. The geopolitics of a Greek separation from the euro would be dangerous as Russia seeks to grow its influence. Europe also doesn't want Greece to set a precedent that will encourage anti-EU movements in other countries, including the United Kingdom, Spain and France. Logic says the referendum shock will lead to a compromise deal with Europe that embraces a longer timetable for repayment, and a clearer pathway to growth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T00:59:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
