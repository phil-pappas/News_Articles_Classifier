Pro-European Union opposition parties were left to save the bill and have continued to prop up Tsipras’ government.\n“We have to agree that we can’t go on this way,” Tsipras told the committee members, adding that “the absurdity of this peculiar and unprecedented dualism” within the party must stop.\nFar-left dissenters argue Syriza has abandoned its principles over the past six months under the country’s popular prime minister. They have openly voiced support for Greece to turn its back on the euro as its national currency.\n“This country no long has democracy, but a peculiar type of totalitarianism a dictatorship of the euro,” prominent dissenter Panagiotis Lafazanis said.\nDespite the heated debate, Dimitri A. Sotiropoulos, an associate professor of political science at the University of Athens, says that at the moment a party split still looks unlikely.\n“Being in power has a binding effect … and (dissenters) will not want to be held responsible for a break up.”\nGreece is currently negotiating the terms for a third bailout worth an some 85 billion euros (USD 93 billion) that will include a new punishing round of austerity measures heaped on a country reeling from a six-year recession and more than 25 per cent unemployment.\nAccording to government officials, bailout negotiations must be concluded before August 20, when a debt repayment to the European Central Bank worth more than 3 billion euros is due.\nFirst Published on July 31, 2015 8:45 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:07:05.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
