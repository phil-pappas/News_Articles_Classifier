Only cooking gas prices dropped over the period by 1.28 per cent to an average cost of Sh2,393 for a 13-kilogramme cylinder. \nThe rising rate of inflation and the weak shilling are seen as the main reasons the Central Bank's advisory body- Monetary Policy Commitee - will likely maintain the key lending rate at 10 per cent at its upcoming meeting next Thursday. \nAlthough there was a decrease in fuel cost adjustment in power bills last month, the cost of electricity remained high because of higher foreign exchange charges due to the weak shilling, KNBS said.
