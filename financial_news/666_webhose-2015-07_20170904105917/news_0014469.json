The bond priced at a final yield of 7.125% - 12.5bp tight to price talk of 7.25% but still wider than early indications of mid 6%s.\nBankers covering the region said conditions were constructive for new bond sales, but they are not expecting a lot of supply in the next few weeks.\nBrazilian conglomerate Cosan is yet to make a move on a potential bond sale after completing investor meetings last week, but insurance company Sagicor Financial could emerge early next week with its US dollar bond issue.\nSagicor, which has operations in the Caribbean and the US, is looking to raise up to US$320m through a bullet bond, which will refinance some US$300m in debt maturing in 2016, according to an investor presentation seen by IFR.\nThe company derives nearly half of its premium revenue from Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad.\nOutflows from dedicated emerging markets bond funds intensified in the week ended July 29, with nearly US$394m leaving the asset class, according to EPFR data Quote: d by UniCredit.\n\"Risk appetite for emerging markets remains fragile given global rate risks, although yields are becoming more attractive, particularly in LatAm,\" UniCredit analyst Martin Rea said in a note to clients on Friday.
