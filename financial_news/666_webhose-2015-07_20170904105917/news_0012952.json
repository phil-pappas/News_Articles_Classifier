This represents an overall reduction of 80% since annual reporting was introduced in 2007-2008. \nCommenting on the report the Minister said: “My department has worked extensively across government to reduce the dependency on external consulting and I am encouraged that the latest figures show a further reduction in the number of external consultancy projects and the spending on those projects. This indicates that government departments and other public bodies are properly planning, procuring, managing and reviewing all consultancy projects.” \nThe Minister concluded: “While there is undoubtedly value in the use of external consultants to bring specialist expertise or an independent assessment, the use of such services will continue to be deployed only where necessary and when their use represents value for money.” Notes to editors: Full details of the 2013-14 Annual Compliance Report on the use of consultants can be accessed on the DFP website The Northern Ireland Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee reported on the use of consultancy in February 2008. It published a set of recommendations regarding the use of, and monitoring arrangements for, consultants. This sixth annual compliance report forms part of DFP’s ongoing response to that Report. The Committee published a follow-up report on the use of consultants in April 2012.
