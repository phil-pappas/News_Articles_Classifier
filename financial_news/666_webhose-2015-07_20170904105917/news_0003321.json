More Aberdeen names new global head of equities \nThe appointment comes only weeks after Rhône finished raising its latest buyout fund, gathering €2.6bn from institutional investors in six months. \nSince its founding in 1996 by former Goldman Sachs and Lazard bankers, Rhône has specialised in investing outside the US — avoiding the limelight while doing so. \nLast year it worked with KKR on a takeover bid for Treasury Wine Estates , which the Australian vintner ultimately rebuffed. \nOther investments in recent years have included carving out the German chemical giant Evonik ’s carbon black unit as a standalone business, and investing in Coty , the beauty company, before its listing in 2013. \nMr Héfès will be charged with finding further transatlantic investments in Europe. \n“Sylvain shares our culture, business ethos and value of discretion,” said Robert Agostinelli, Rhône’s co-founder. \nMr Héfès would seek to broaden the group’s “long-term relationships base throughout Europe with internationally minded industrial families and corporations,” he added. \nInvestors — who last gave Rhône money in 2011, when it raised a €1.1bn fund — will be watching its strategy closely, as will other big buyout firms. \nIn 2014 Preqin , a data provider, ranked three previous Rhône buyout funds among an elite few to have delivered the most consistent returns over time — a feature prized by investors in the often-cyclical private equity industry. \nAs of March, Oregon ’s public employee retirement fund disclosed that it had made 1.4 times its money on investing in a 2006-vintage Rhône fund and 1.07 times on the 2011 vehicle so far. \nAs part of the expansion into Europe, Rhône recently hired Ferdinando Beccalli-Falco, a former chief executive of General Electric’s continental Europe division, to join its industrials team, and also brought in as a managing director Peter Ezersky, co-founder of Quadrangle, a private equity firm. \nMr Héfès first worked with Mr Agostinelli, and Rhône’s other co-founders Robert and Steven Langman, more than 30 years ago. \nHe was later head of French operations and partner at Goldman, before moving to Rothschild, eventually helping to bring about the merger of the banking dynasty’s French and British arms under one Paris-listed entity. \nMr Héfès will remain on the board of Paris Orléans and Rothschild Concordia, its holding company where he is the only non-family member to serve in the capacity.
