But they cost a significant amount and took years of planning to reach fruition.\nAdvertisement The developers of the main stadium at Homebush, Lend Lease, and the olympic village at Newington, Mirvac and Lend Lease, had been able to sell the apartments and the surrounding buildings.\nIn London, Westfield has capitalised in the Stratford, East London mall, at the site of the London Olympics and Lend Lease recently teamed up with the London and Continental Railways as joint venture partners to deliver The International Quarter at the site of the London Olympics' main stadium.\nThe organisers of the Rio Summer Olympics in August 2016 are also using all the resources of contractors, developers and the government to be ready. They have also drawn on the experiences from last year's FIFA World Cup competition.\nGlobal quantity surveyors and construction consultants Rider Levett Bucknall has been involved in the bidding, planning and delivery of the Olympic Games and other major global sporting events for more than 20 years.\nSydney-based Louise Vlatkoâ€‹ worked on the inaugural European Games, in Baku in June, working with 18 quantity surveyors, commercial, construction and project managers who were deployed to Baku full-time.\nMark Sims, director at Rider Levett Bucknall said the complexities for an Olympic Host City have always been significant, requiring resource commitment over an extended period of time.\n\"Following the exhilaration of winning the right to host a major international sporting event, the reality of delivery dawns and the hard work begins,\" Mr Sims said.\nBob Richardson, global consultant to Rider Levett Bucknall said the IOC recognises the need to achieve value for money and future Games will need to reduce time and cost in delivery.\n\"A measure of success for any major sporting event is avoiding the perception of wasted public money,\" he said.\n\"Temporary facilities can provide cost-effective solutions where a legacy plan does not provide for a permanent venue as part of a city's long-term plans. This was the case for London hosting the 2012 Olympics where the legacy drive resulted in more temporary venues being installed than the previous four Summer Olympic Games combined.\"\nMr Richardson said the real opportunity to minimise costs is for venues to be temporary and relocatable, so they can be dismantled, stored and relocated to the next host city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:16:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
