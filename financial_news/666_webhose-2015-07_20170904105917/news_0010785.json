The alterations will mean the government raises more money from banks during this administration, he said.\nBanks had been lobbying the government to review the tax, which was designed to raise at least 2.7 billion pounds ($4.2 billion) this year and was increased in March. The British Bankers’ Association sent a letter to Finance Minister David Gauke last month highlighting the danger of banks moving operations abroad.\nRead this next: \\r Osborne Outlining All-Tory Budget Says U.K. Recovery to Continue \\r U.K. Budget 2015: Rolling Coverage \\r HSBC, which makes most of its revenue and has most of its assets outside the U.K., is examining whether to stay in London and has said the levy is one of its main concerns. Europe’s largest bank is hardest hit by the tax, which slashes 750 million pounds from its profit a year.\n“Our bank levy was introduced to raise revenue and increase the stability of balance sheets and it’s worked, but now it risks doing harm unless we change it,” Osborne said. It’s important that banks “go on creating jobs,” and the changes “make our country a more competitive place to do business,” he said.\n‘Welcome News’ Chirantan Barua, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. in London, had estimated that HSBC’s bank levy for 2016 would be cut in half to 552 million pounds if it was only applied to British assets.\nOsborne’s changes are “very welcome news for the sector, and can be seen as an acknowledgment from the government that the U.K. does need to remain a competitive location for global financial services companies,” Anna Anthony, head of financial-services tax at EY for Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India, said in an e-mailed statement.\nShares in HSBC and Standard Chartered Plc, the other major British bank with most of its assets abroad, briefly rose after Osborne’s remarks before erasing their gains.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T16:32:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
