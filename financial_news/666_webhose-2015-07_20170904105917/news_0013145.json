Reuters by Jane O'Sullivan \"Sales are moving increasingly online. Buyers are using online for research. You can't ignore it,\" says Karen Zadra, the former director of Marshall Arts and the developer of a new art app. Itondo is pitched as a marketplace and viewing app that gives buyers a live preview of how artworks will look hanging on their wall.\nThe idea took root when Zadra realised she was spending an increasing amount of time photoshopping artworks onto photos for her gallery clients, but she quickly decided there would be a broader audience for an app.\nBefore starting, users need to print a \"marker\" to stick to the wall. This helps the app calculate scale and angle, so that artworks can be viewed from any position in the room. (It currently only works for two-dimensional works.)\nA drawback of the current release is how close you need to stand for the app to recognise the marker â€“ inevitably too close to get a good view of the artwork. There is also no function to search by artwork size, though you can search by style (including the rather broad category of \"contemporary\").\nBut whether collectors find the app useful is more likely to depend on Zadra's success marketing to galleries and artists: users won't come if there is no art to view. For her part Zadra is confident that \"itondo will gather its own community\" in a space already dominated by the likes of Artsy.\nShe has made efforts to get galleries on side. Rather than paying a flat subscription fee, they purchase credits which are deducted as users engage with their listed artworks. Itondo will take no cut of sales.\nZadra and her husband Dirk Zadra moved to Luxembourg to build the app after closing their Adelaide gallery late last year. \"Luxembourg is very central to the main art markets,\" she says. Of the galleries currently listing artwork on the app, two are international and there is also the Zadras' own new online venture, Galerie Zadra. Melbourne's This is No Fantasy and Sydney's Janet Clayton Gallery are also taking part.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T14:00:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
