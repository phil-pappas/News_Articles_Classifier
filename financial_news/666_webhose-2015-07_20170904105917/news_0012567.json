He says the chamber will take up a bill alongside the budget that would repeal prevailing wage requirements, which set minimum salaries for construction workers on public projects. \nSenate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald says he doesn't have the votes to pass the budget out of his chamber yet. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T18:33:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
