Yields on short-dated notes rose as much as 2.5 basis points as the curve flattened a touch.\nIn contrast, the Australian dollar was nursing losses at $0.7367, having retreated from a peak of $0.7440 on Wednesday as upbeat U.S. economic data reinforced expectations of higher rates from the Federal Reserve.\nThe Aussie was pulling closer to a six-year through of $0.7328 touched last week, with immediate support found at $0.7360.\nWeighing was ongoing weakness in commodity prices with iron ore &lt;.IO62-CNI=SI&gt;, Australia’s top export earner, slipping nearly 3 percent.\nThe Aussie derived no comfort in an encouraging corporate survey which found that Australian businesses were in a better mood last quarter, while confidence had turned positive for all sectors outside mining.\nThe Aussie remained near its lowest since 2009 against the pound which rose to A$2.1167 on rising speculation of higher interest rates from the Bank of England.\nAustralian government bond futures rose, with the three-year bond contract up 1 tick at 98.020. The 10-year contract added 4 ticks to 97.100, leading to a bullish flattening of the curve.\n 23, 2015 9:02 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T14:27:38.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
