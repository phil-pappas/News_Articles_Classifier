Photo: Reuters \nPublic bidding for Bank of China (Hong Kong)’s Nanyang Commercial Bank will start on Wednesday at the Beijing Financial Assets Exchange, the bank and its parent Bank of China said in a joint statement on Tuesday. \nBank of China and BOCHK said they have received regulatory approval from the Ministry of Finance for the disposal of 100 per cent of Nanyang Commercial Bank. \nAfter a feasibility study, the bank said in late May that a complete sell-off of the wholly owned subsidiary \"would be consistent with the long-term development strategy of the group\". \nFew were surprised by the announcement as rumours of a potential disposal of the bank, which overlaps with the group’s businesses on the mainland, had circulated for months.
