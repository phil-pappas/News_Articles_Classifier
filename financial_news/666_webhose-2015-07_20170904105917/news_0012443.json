Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Tony Abbott has hardened his stance towards superannuation tax reform by vowing there will never be any change under a Coalition government.\nFollowing revelations that the government had been examining options right up until April 22, the day Labor released its policy on super taxes, Mr Abbott was his most emphatic on Wednesday.\n\"We made a very clear commitment prior to the last election that there would be no adverse changes in superannuation under this government in this Parliament and we have made a very clear decision that we aren't ever going to increase the taxes on super, we aren't ever going to increase the restrictions on super, because super belongs to the people,\" he said.\nBefore the last election, Mr Abbott promised no adverse changes to super this term. But after Labor unveiled its policy, the Coalition changed tack, ruling out taking any proposals to the next election, regardless of what was recommended by its own tax white paper.\nMr Abbott's statement on Wednesday makes the pledge permanent and goes further than Treasurer Joe Hockey, who has been trying to keep alive the prospect of super tax reform further down the track.\n\"I don't subscribe to never-ever, I've seen that before,\" Mr Hockey told the ABC's Q&A program a month ago.\nOpposition treasurer Chris Bowen said on Wednesday that the letter confirmed Mr Abbott had \"chosen to play a cheap political scare campaign over good policy\".\nThe Freedom of Information request lodged by the office of shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh revealed the government was examining options to change the tax treatment of super up until Labor released its own policy proposals three weeks before the budget.\n The letter, dated June 26, lists four submissions to Mr Hockey on January 29, March 6, April 21 and April 22. It is believed the final submission was from Mr Hockey requesting Treasury run the ruler over Labor's proposal.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-01T13:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T10:06:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
