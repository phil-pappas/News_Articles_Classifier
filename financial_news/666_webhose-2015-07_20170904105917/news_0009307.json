Ghana's current deficit of 50,000 tonnes in supply could hit over 100,000 tonnes in the near future. This trend can be reversed and Ghana can become a net exporter of palm oil,' Opoku-Asare said. \nHe said, 'Currently, most of the global consumer goods companies like Unilever source their palm oil from South East Asia. Since their businesses in Africa have expanded, they import part of their palm oil from outside Africa to supplement local supply. \n'This doesn't make sense as palm oil is a crop indigenous to West Africa, but Ghana will only be able to access the large and growing market for sustainable produced palm oil if it commits to sustainable production,' he added. \nGlobal Commitment Touching on Unilever’s commitment to sustainable palm oil, he said as far back as the mid-1990s, the company started developing Good Agricultural Practice Guidelines for palm oil as part of its Sustainable Agriculture Programme. \n'Unilever believes that a profitable and sustainable palm oil sector must find the right balance between social, environmental and economic objectives. \n'This is a shared responsibility between government, the private sector and civil society to work towards a collaborative solution for a sustainable palm oil industry,' he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T15:57:29.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
