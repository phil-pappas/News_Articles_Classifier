The Government has pledged to increase it to £12,500 by 2020. \nIt should be noted that the personal allowance is steadily removed once you earn more than £100,000. The complicated way this is done effectively means you pay a combined rate of income tax and National Insurance of 62pc between £100,000 and £122,000. This won't change. \nThe threshold for higher rate tax (40pc) will also rise, from £42,385 to £43,000. Buy-to-let: a hit for landlords \nMortgage interest relief for landlords will be reduced in a \"proportional and gradual way\". The tax perk allows landlords to put the cost of the interest on a buy-to-let mortgage on their self-assessment forms, offsetting the income they receive in rent from tenants. \nThe system of mortgage interest relief will be retained but restricted to the basic rate of tax. \nHigher-rate relief will start to be withdrawn over four years, starting in 2017. Pensions tax relief \nThose earning more than £150,000 will have the amount they can invest in a pension each year tax-free reduced from £40,000 to £10,000, as promised in the Conservative manifesto. Inheritance tax \nThe amount that couples can pass on tax-free will rise from £650,000 to £1m, including a property allowance. \nA “family home allowance”, worth £175,000 per person on top of the existing £325,000 tax-free allowance, will be introduced on April 6 2017. This means that individuals can pass on assets worth up to £500,000, including a home, without paying any IHT at all. For married couples, the total is £1m. \nThe “family home allowance” will be gradually removed from estates worth more than £2m. 'National pay rise' \nA new \"living wage\" will be introduced at £7.20 an hour next April, giving a \"pay rise\" to 2.5 million workers. Cost of insurance \nInsurance premium tax, currently 6pc, will rise to 9.5pc. This will cover the likes of car and home insurance but not travel insurance, which already has its own special rate of 20pc. The British Insurance Brokers' Association said: \"Those hit by this stealth tax will include the 20.1 million households with contents insurance, 19.6 million with motor insurance and 17 million with buildings insurance.\" \nThe announcement was coupled with a promise to review the regulation of claims management firms, with a view to imposing a cap on the charges they impose on those involved in accidents and who seek compensation. Car tax \nNew vehicle excise duty (VED) bands will apply from 2017 for new cars. There will be three bands: zero, standard and premium. The standard cost will be £140. \nExisting cars will be unaffected. The money will go directly into a \"roads fund\". \nDividend tax \nPeople with dividend income from investments, such as shares or some equity funds, outside of Isas - or contract workers who set themselves up as companies, known as Personal Service Companies, to pay themselves dividends could face higher bills. \nCaroline Le Jeune, tax partner at Blick Rothenberg, said: \"Those with low dividend income, will probably pay around the same and some may pay less, as a new dividend tax allowance of £5,000 a year replaces the dividend tax credit. But higher rate or additional rate taxpayers will lose out.\" \n• Income tax tables will be published later The UK Government debt total is now...
