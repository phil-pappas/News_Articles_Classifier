June is typically a transitional month encompassing toward the end of summer selling with the onset of clearance toward the end of the month. \nConsumer spending has been shifting away from traditional retail towards auto purchases, subscriptions, gadgets, entertainment and dining in recent months. \n\"Retailers are struggling to gain their footing in this environment where consumers are feeling better but still have limited discretionary funds at their disposal,\" said Retail Metrics president Ken Perkins. \nWinners and losers While Stein Mart was undoubtedly the stand-out performer in June, Zumiez and Gap suffered. \nStein Mart's 5.8% comparable store sales gain came in above Retail Metrics' expectations for a 2.9% increase, as the discount and off-price space remains one of the better-performing retail segments. \nMeanwhile, L Brands' 3% rise was at the top end of its guidance range, with the chain'smerchandise margins up year-on-year, but inventories per square foot were down 6% from a year ago. The company expects July comparable store sales to rise by low single digits. \nAt the other end of the scale for a second consecutive month were Zumiez and clothing giant Gap Inc - the only retailers to report declines. Zumiez missed expectations with its third consecutive monthly fall, after generating consistent growth from April 2014 to March 2015. \nAnd Gap saw comparable store sales fall 5% at its namesake brand, while Banana Republic and Old Navy each booked 1% gains. Nonetheless CFO Sabrina Simmons noted: \"As previously announced, we’re taking significant actions to help improve Gap brand’s performance. \n\"We’re pleased customers continue to respond favourably to Old Navy’s on-trend collections with the brand delivering yet another month of positive comps.\" \nJune sales overview Action sportswear and footwear retailer Zumiez saw comparable store sales fall 3.3% for the five weeks to 4 July. However the company, which operates 635 stores, said net sales increased 2.6% to US$67m from $65.3m in the same period last year. \nDenim specialist The Buckle said comparable store sales, for stores open at least one year, climbed 0.5%. Net sales rose 2.7% to $87.1m from $84.8m for the company which operates 464 stores. \nAt value-priced fashion retailer Cato , comparable store sales were flat on a year ago.
