The formation of this joint venture brings together two strong companies – Amec Foster Wheeler and BBS Engineering, with a combined vision of delivering high quality technical services to the energy sector in Ghana. \nThe new partnership combines the local skills, knowledge and experience of BBS Engineering with the global capability, quality and international standards of Amec Foster Wheeler. A key aim of the joint venture company is to be recognised as a provider of training and development to local Ghanaians who wish to build a career in the oil and gas industry. \nAmec Foster Wheeler has a workforce of over 40,000 people in more than 50 countries worldwide and has been active in Ghana since 2005 in a variety of market sectors, including hydrocarbons, mining and environmental services. \nAmec Foster Wheeler’s current Ghanaian projects include: Working on three inland gold mining projects at the Ahafo, Akyem and Subika Underground mines, all for divisions of Newmont Mining Corporation; and Since 2014, a multi-disciplined on-the-ground 50-strong engineering team, supported by Amec Foster Wheeler’s global network, has focused on the Kwame Nkrumah Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel (FPSO) in the Jubilee field, where it is executing various brownfield engineering projects. \nBBS Engineering Limited was established in 2003 to provide support services to oil field, industrial and construction engineering businesses. BBS Engineering offers services to most of the active oil companies in Ghana and is the main representative for Castrol BP lubricants and Sealite UK Ltd (Marine Navigation Aids) in the country. BBS Engineering is a successful local Ghanaian firm, having recently been awarded the BID International Quality Crown award in 2014. The company has various divisions including the construction of storage tanks, piping fabrication, marine engineering, general supply and oil and gas services. \nDr Cyril Titus-Glover, Country Manager for Amec Foster Wheeler’s Ghanaian operations and Managing Director (MD) for the new joint venture said: “Our new joint venture is well positioned to support the growth of Ghana’s hydrocarbon industry and provide training and development to its citizens. We look forward to a long and successful partnership with BBS Engineering, as we seek to enhance the already significant opportunities for Ghana’s hydrocarbon industry.” \nBenedict Tandoh, CEO of BBS Engineering and Deputy MD of the new company said: “Together, this exciting partnership will enable two committed companies to provide world-class services to local and international clientele in Ghana and across West Africa. \nThere is a critical need for local skills development in an industry that is increasingly becoming a key growth driver of the Ghanaian economy, so the timing of our JV could not be better. Amec Foster Wheeler & BBS Limited is well positioned to contribute significantly to the country as it establishes itself as an oil and gas services hub in the West African sub-region and the African continent at large.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:41:38.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
