What if you knew that if you dropped your labours and turned to a completely different task, like running, gardening or solving a Rubix cube for 15 minutes, the solution would likely occur to you when you returned to the task?\nLeadership experts are now exploring the science of the mind. One important finding – and there’s scientific research to prove it – is that the unconscious can be better at insight-based problem-solving than conscious deliberation.\n“A lot of problem-solving is analytical but the world is moving too fast, with the amount of data and technological advances, for that to be enough,” says Corinne Canter, senior consultant at Human Synergistics Australia. “We need to use the whole brain – we need to access our creativity.”\nExtreme thinking HSA collaborated with neuroscientist and clinical neuropsychotherapist Trisha Stratford, who identified what she calls the “super mind”, where gamma waves are produced by the parietal lobe (the part of the brain that produces creative thinking and dreams).\nThey developed a practice called “extreme thinking”, which can routinely tap the power of the unconscious mind to deliver insights, and tested their practices in the neuroscience unit at the University of Technology, Sydney. They wired up 30 executives to an EEG machine to establish baseline brainwave patterns as they tackled a problem-solving task.\nThe executives then did a one-day workshop where they learnt circuit-breaking practices aimed at improving their ability to think clearly and access their imaginative insights. A key skill is switching off the “try harder” cycle. They were trained to relax with an activity that occupied their brain in a different way.\nAt least 15 minutes – or sometimes hours or a day or two – later, the executives would revisit the problem. After practising the techniques and yoga nidra (for deep relaxation) for a month, once a day, they returned to the lab to have their brain activity measured again.\n The results showed a 33 per cent increase in cognitive function across the group, and 63 per cent more problem solutions were generated. Several executives said they also acquired valuable insights into how their brains functioned best. “I had no idea you had an unconscious mind,” says Michael Combs, the founder and chief executive of Indigenous internship organisation CareerTrackers.\n“Now I find that if I have a really challenging problem and it’s not something I can deal with, I send it to the unconscious mind. It’s like an order.” Routinely, he says, after a break, and often a run, the problem comes back solved.\nTNT Express apps development manager Andrew Purkiss used to get breakthrough ideas at odd times, such as in the shower, but he had no idea how to trigger them. Ever since he completed the extreme thinking training, he has been able to influence when breakthroughs occur. He now understands that getting to the “frustration” point is critical to the process. “I enjoy reaching that point – I realise I’ve gathered enough information and I’m on track for a solution,” Purkiss says.\nBenefits on the job The techniques have paid dividends at work. Purkiss says: “We’d built a major facility that cost hundreds of millions of dollars. There was an extremely high expectation of the productivity that would emerge, yet there was a portion that was still manual. The MD [managing director] said to me, ‘We can’t have 90 per cent of the costs associated with 10 per cent of the business. We need to find a solution and we need it now. Lock yourself in a room for however long it takes.’ ”\nPurkiss pushed back. “I said, ‘I need the opportunity to let it work its way through. It’s going to take more like three or four days to come to a solution.’ ”After following the techniques and going for a run, he had a breakthrough while shaving. “We implemented it and it was well received. I wouldn’t have arrived at it by sitting in a room.”\nIAG’s national manager of new markets, Helen Nott, now accepts that taking a break can produce the best result, and is less impatient to “nail the solution” to a problem. “The gathering of information feeds my unconscious mind as well as information needed by my conscious mind.”\nFor Nott, the best breaks combine tactile tasks and mental stimulation. “Gardening a new stretch of the yard was very helpful as this required me to be outdoors and away from the office, and focused on an activity with some physical activity, and [it]required mental planning,” she says.\nLike Boss on Facebook .
