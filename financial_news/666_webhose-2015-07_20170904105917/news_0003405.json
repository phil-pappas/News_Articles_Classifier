This follows the commitment given by the Minister in his Budget statement 2014 to reform the role, functions and structure of the Office of the Appeal Commissioners. The objective of the proposed reforms is to improve the administration of the tax system, and provide enhanced arrangements for an independent, efficient, well-defined, clear and transparent system for appeals relating to decisions of the Revenue Commissioners, while delivering value for money and increased certainty for both taxpayers and the State. \nFollowing the Minister’s announcement, the Department of Finance conducted a public consultation on the proposed reforms. Submissions were received in the main from representative bodies within the industry, from some tax practitioners, and from the Citizens Information Board on behalf of the taxpayer, as well as from the Revenue Commissioners. The Department has also had further engagement with the Revenue Commissioners and the representative bodies. These consultations have identified a wide range of proposals for reform. \nOne of the main proposals was to strengthen the independence, and the perceived independence, of the Appeal Commissioners. The measures to achieve this contained in this Bill include the establishment of a new Tax Appeals Commission to operate the revised arrangements. The Bill defines the functions of the new body and provides for appropriate selection and appointment provisions for Appeal Commissioners involving the Public Appointments Service, fixed-term appointments, a clear statutory statement of independence and new staffing arrangements. The proposed reforms will end the practice of appeals being made via the Revenue Commissioners. \nCommenting in the Bill Minister Noonan said “I am pleased to publish this reforming legislation which should help to ensure a modern and responsive tax appeals system in Ireland. I want to thank the current Appeal Commissioners who have assisted with the preparation of these reforms and acknowledge the work they have performed on behalf of taxpayers over the last twenty plus years.” \nThe texts of the Bill and associated Explanatory Memorandum are at:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T18:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T15:04:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
