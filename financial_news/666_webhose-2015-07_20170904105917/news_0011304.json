Petitioner Kishore Samrite had sought a retired Supreme Court judge to head the SIT. Samrite in his petition told the court that Dawood Ibrahim had two to three times approached people, expressing his desire to come back and face the law, but the government did not act on his offer. An apex court bench headed by Chief Justice H.L. Dattu while declining the plea said that it was not for the judiciary to look into it and the issue did not require judicial interference. Seeking a probe into government's cold shouldering of Dawood Ibrahim's offer, the petitioner pointed out to the claims by the former Delhi police commissioner Neeraj Kumar and veteran jurist and Rajya Sabha member Ram Jethmalani, saying that Dawood Ibrahim wanted to return to India.
