Lee Besford Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey A key reason why Tony Abbott and his government ran into so much trouble in the wake of the 2014 budget was because the Prime Minister treated voters like idiots.\nIt was plain that the budget was laden with broken promises, which in itself angered voters. What entrenched that anger was the Prime Minister's denial that he had done any such thing. Instead, he told voters they should have read the fine print; that his overarching promise had been to repair the budget and, therefore, anything goes.\nIt took the best part a year and the self-described \"near-death experience\" in February this year for the Prime Minister to publicly acknowledge the fault.\nThis makes it all the more surprising that he is doing it again, not so much to the voters this time but to his own colleagues, on the topic of gay marriage.\nThe vote to change Coaltion policy on gay marriage would have failed in the party room Lee Besford Before the election, Abbott did not promise to allow a conscience vote on gay marriage should a bill come before the Parliament. He promised that his MPs and senators – the party room – would be given the opportunity to debate a policy change from opposing gay marriage to a conscience vote.\nIt is a critical distinction.\nAbbott would rather allow Australia become a republic than do anything to facilitate gay marriage and subsequently, is now using the same form of weasel words that he fed voters after last year's budget to deny his colleagues even the debate they were promised.\nPlan backfires When leading Liberal gay marriage advocate Warren Entsch met Abbott last month, there was a general agreement that the government's priorities before the winter break were passing budget and national security legislation – which it did – and that Entsch should come back in August with a co-sponsored private members bill for the Parliament to consider. Abbott's publicly stated condition was that the bill be co-sponsored, not owned by any one party.\nPrivately, however, the Prime Minister was telling like-minded colleagues that he never wanted the issue to be debated at any time. He preferred the issue remain subterranean and it was his hope that the advocates, deterred by the numbers stacked against them internally, would back away from putting the issue to the test.\nIf he could stall it until the end of the year, it would be off the agenda because the advocates had promised not to raise it in an election year.\nBut that made those advocating change even more determined to test the issue and this week it exploded in all its glory. It emerged that Liberals Entsch and Teresa Gambaro would table the private members bill on Tuesday, August 11, co-sponsored by Labor, independent and Greens MPs, with the intention of a having a party room debate the following Tuesday.\nAbbott had two choices at this stage. Knowing that the overwhelming majority of his colleagues opposed gay marriage and a conscience vote – they see them as one and the same thing – he could have honoured his pledge and allowed the party room debate on August 18, secure in the knowledge that the advocates would be outnumbered and there would be no change in policy.\nEveryone would have walked away, to varying degrees, satisfied. The Liberals would remain bound to vote against gay marriage and the bill, if ever put to the vote, would have failed.\nInstead, as he did after the 2014 budget, Abbott changed the rules. Under pressure from the ever-demanding Liberal base, upon whom his survival depends, he hid behind process. He argued that unless the bill was to be brought on for parliamentary debate and a vote, there was no need for a party room debate.\nPrivate members bills need the support of the government of the day if they are to be progressed in the Parliament but Abbott claimed to be powerless.\n\"It's quite unusual for private members bills to come on for debate and vote in Parliament,\" he said.\n\"I have been in the Parliament now for 21 years and there's only been, from memory, two or three occasions when a private members bill has come on for a debate and vote.\"\nDisingenuous It was thoroughly disingenuous stuff. And also a stark contrast from John Howard who, as prime minister, allowed a conscience vote on the abortion drug RU-486. Howard and his health minister Abbott were firmly against the bill but Howard recognised the supporters in his ranks and permitted it to be progressed through Parliament.\nHe was on the losing side and out of respect, the bill passed on the voices, to spare Howard the indignity of losing a vote in the house. No one called a division so as to avoid the names being recorded as to how people voted.\nAbbott could equally permit the private members bill to be progressed, safe in the knowledge a binding Liberal no vote would see it defeated. He would be on the winning side.\nAbbott's iron-fisted approach of not even allowing his colleagues a policy debate is about more than his detestation of gay marriage. It is about appeasing the base, still cranky over his abandonment of plans to repeal section 18c of the Racial Discrimination Act and his support for the Constitutional recognition of indigenous Australians.\nAnd, as always, it is a key point of differentiation with that pesky progressive, Malcolm Turnbull, who has had a resurgence of late, partly due to him saving the government from itself and ensuring the terror-related citizenship laws were actually constitutional. Turnbull has proved again to be the best attorney-general Australia has never had.\nAbbott may succeed in kicking the can down the road on gay marriage and the majority of colleagues will thank him for it. But there are enough who are seething at the prospect of being betrayed to create a truckload of trouble.\nAnd that anger is only exacerbated by the likes of Eric Abetz telling Liberal ministers to quit the frontbench because of their views, or Cory Bernardi accusing colleagues of colluding with the Greens and Labor to derail the government's agenda.\nCome the end of this year, Abbott may have wished he had given the advocates what he promised. He has ensured the issue will linger well beyond August.\nPhillip Coorey is The Australian Financial Review 's chief political correspondent.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-03T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T12:16:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
