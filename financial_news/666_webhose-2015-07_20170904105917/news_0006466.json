Photo: Robert Peet\nStrong margins in refining and increasing sales of premium petrol and diesel have helped Caltex Australia to a 45 per cent increase in benchmark profit for the first half, despite a drop in volumes of transport fuels sold.\nThe unaudited numbers given on Thursday by Caltex, for net operating profit of $251 million for the June half, have set minds at rest in the market, after the company delayed its normal earnings guidance by two weeks.\nThe benchmark profit, which is before significant items, compares with $173 million for the June half last year. It is within the current range of analysts' estimates, being higher than Credit Suisse's $230 million estimate, but falling short of Citigroup's.\nCaltex has overhauled its business structure in recent years, closing one of its two refineries and relying more on imported product through its Ampol Singapore operation to supply its customers in Australia. That has given it increased flexibilitiy to optimise supply through its importing, storage and distribution activities.\nAdvertisement \"Despite the competitive landscape in Australia continuing to be challenging, particularly in the business-to-businesss sector, the change in our business model is enabling us to capture opportunities as we optimise the integrated value chain,\" Caltex said in Thursday's statement.\nUnderlying earnings before interest and tax in the supply and marketing division were about $294 million in the first half, up from $276 million in the same period last year, Caltex said. In refining, EBIT surged almost four-fold to $154 million, from $40 million a year earlier, thanks to average refining margins of $US15.71 a barrel in the first four months of the year, compared with $US9.20 on average in the first half of 2014.\nCaltex's sole remaining refinery, at Lytton near Brisbane, didn't operate in May and June as it was closed for a five-year maintenance check-up.\nCaltex shares were down 1.9 per cent at $32.75 in Thursday morning trading.\nTotal volumes of transport fuels sold were \"modestly lower\", at 7.8 billion litres, Caltex reported. But sales of premium petrol and diesel were up, more than offsetting declines in unleaded petrol and E10 ethanol blend. Sales from Caltex's own production were 2.4 billion litres, down from 2.8 billion a year earlier because of the shutdown for maintenance work.\nCredit Suisse analyst Mark Samter said the first-half figures were higher than his estimate, but he remained cautious awaiting the detail behind the numbers that will be released in the formal first-half earnings report in August.\n\"It's a beat versus our numbers, but it's hard to entirely decipher the quality of the beat until we get a bit more granularity on what costs are included in which division,\" Mr Samter said.\nNet profit on a historical cost basis, including one-time items, more than doubled in the first half to $375 million, from $163 million the same half last year, Caltex said.\nThe bottom line figure includes a $28 million gain on the sale of a property in Western Australia and a $95 million gain on the value of oil and fuel inventories. This figure is less closely watched by analysts as it is muddied by the impact of changing crude oil prices on stockpiles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T04:50:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
