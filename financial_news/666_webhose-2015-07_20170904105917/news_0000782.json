Photo: Getty Images\nDiscounter Aldi Australia makes more profit on each dollar of sales than its much larger rival Coles, and has more scope to cut prices in the event of a prolonged price war.\nAccording to detailed accounts provided by Aldi to the Senate tax avoidance inquiry, the discounter earned a pre-tax profit margin of 5.2 per cent on sales of $5 billion in 2013 - exceeding Coles's pre-tax food and liquor margin of 4.3 per cent but falling short of Woolworths's world-beating pre-tax food and liquor margin of 7.1 per cent.\nAldi's pre-tax profit margins are likely to have risen further in 2014, when group sales reached $6 billion.\nBrokers believe Aldi's healthy profit margins provide the company with scope for further growth and room to cut grocery prices to maintain its 15 to 20 per cent price gap with Coles and Woolworths amid escalating price competition between the three major chains.\nAdvertisement \"The financials for Aldi confirm both its success and its room for further growth in Australia,\" said Citigroup analyst Craig Woolford, who expects Aldi to continue to gain market share from Woolworths and Coles, placing pressure on margins.\n\"These numbers suggest Aldi's operating margins in Australia are very healthy compared with the rest of the world and may be boosted by significant sales of high margin general merchandise,\" said Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Simotas.\n\"This provides the group with headroom for price investment if needed. However, given the momentum, we do not believe it is needed at this stage.\"\nAldi is structured as a limited partnership in Australia and does not need to file detailed accounts with ASIC.\nHowever, the discounter was asked to provide detailed financial information to the Senate tax inquiry after rivals including Wesfarmers chief executive Richard Goyder questioned last month whether it was paying its fair share of tax.\nAldi's submission suggests that it paid $83 million income tax on pre-tax profits of $261 million in 2013, representing an income tax rate of 31.8 per cent, and $67 million in income tax on earnings of $232 million in 2012, a tax rate of 28.8 per cent.\nOver the four years to December 2013, Aldi's effective tax rate ranged between 29 per cent and 34 per cent, the company said, referring to audited accounts. Based on actual tax paid, Aldi's effective tax rate over the last four years ranged between 30 and 35 per cent.\nReiterating previous claims that the company did not minimise its tax bill through mechanisms such as intercompany loans, licence fees or royalty fees, Aldi chief executive Tom Daunt told the committee the company did not hold related party loans and did not pay royalties or licence fees to related parties overseas.\nOnly 1 per cent of its merchandise and services expenditure was made to international related parties, the company said.\nAldi also claimed that 100 per cent of profits had been reinvested back into Australia, rather than paid as dividends to its parent.\nDespite the detailed submission, Aldi is expected to face further scrutiny by the Senate Economics committee, which is chaired by Labor Senator Sam Dastyari, and it may be asked to appear before an upcoming inquiry.\nAldi's submission did not disclose earnings before interest and tax, debt levels or ratios such as gross margins or cost of doing business to sales.\nDeutsche Bank assumed that if the company had $500 million of debt, earnings before interest and tax to sales margins would have been closer to 5.7 per cent in 2013, boosted by sales of higher margin general merchandise.\nThis would have exceeded Coles's EBIT margin of 4.9 per cent in 2013, but fell short of Woolworths's EBIT margin of 7.65 per cent.\nAldi's healthy margins reflect its low cost of doing business, rather than high prices.\nAccording to a recent Choice survey, a basket of private label groceries at Aldi is 28 per cent cheaper than a similar basket of private label goods at Coles and 34 per cent cheaper than Woolworths, based on standard shelf prices rather than promotional prices.\nAnalysts believe the price gap is 15 to 20 per cent after taking into account promotions, which now account for about 40 per cent of the average shopping basket.\nIn its submission, Aldi said it kept costs down by stocking a smaller range of private label products, (an average of 1,350 lines compared to 15,000 to 25,000 for a full service supermarket), developing long-term relationships with suppliers, operating smaller stores with fewer, multi-skilled staff and simple and efficient layouts, and using shelf ready packaging displays.\nCitigroup estimated that Aldi employed on average 47 staff per store, compared with 116 at Coles and 124 at Woolworths.\n\"This is a crucial metric that highlights that full service supermarkets like Coles and Woolworths cannot tackle Aldi head-on, they need to differentiate,\" said Mr Woolford.\nWhile Aldi's sales have grown rapidly in the last few years from $3.14 billion in 2010, to $6 billion in 2014, sales per store remain below those at Coles and Woolworths, reflecting its smaller stores and narrower product range.", "external_links": ["http://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=a5857f2a-e3b1-4dbf-9176-876a92c13f4d&subId=353760"], "published": "2015-07-13T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:49:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
