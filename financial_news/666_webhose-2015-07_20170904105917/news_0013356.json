Daiwa advanced as much as 6 percent, the most since November. The benchmark Topix index gained 1.3 percent, led by securities firms.\nThe firms have been capitalizing on a growing inclination by Japanese to invest their savings since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office in December 2012 with a vow to end years of deflation. While consumer prices are still barely rising even after monetary easing, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average has doubled, prompting companies such as Toyota Motor Corp. to offer new shares that the brokerages can sell to customers.\nNomura’s net income more than tripled to 68.7 billion yen ($554 million) in the three months ended June 30 from 19.9 billion yen a year earlier, the company said after the close of trading Wednesday. Net income at Daiwa rose 30 percent to 44.8 billion yen, the highest in eight quarters.\nAnalysts had estimated Nomura would earn 59 billion yen in the quarter, according to the median of seven estimates. Daiwa’s result exceeded a 36 billion yen projection.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T04:12:54.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
