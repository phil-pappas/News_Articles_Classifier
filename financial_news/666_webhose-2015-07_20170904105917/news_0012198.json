The amendment in Rule 25 of the HVAT Rules, 2003 has been approved to streamline and clarify the provisions for allowing deductions of value of land from the gross turnover of a works contractor. The amendment in Rule shall come into force with effect from May 17,2010, the day the existing Rule was inserted in the HVAT Rules, 2003.

As per the amendment, a VAT dealer may claim Input Tax Credit (ITC) of the amount of tax paid by the purchasing dealer to the selling dealer, and may further claim refund of the input tax if the input tax exceeds the output tax liability, it said. A VAT dealer conducting inter-state sales may claim refund of input tax on account of difference in the rate of tax on purchase of goods and rate of tax on sale of goods in the course of inter-state trade and commerce.
