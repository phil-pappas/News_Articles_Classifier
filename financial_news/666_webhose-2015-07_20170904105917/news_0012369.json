Moto runs Simply Food outlets at motorway service stations. \nM&S has already introduced click-and-collect to its 200 wholly owned Simply Food stores and to its 300-strong store estate. \nThis agreemeent will see 100 franchise stores added to the click-and-collect network. \nHowever, consumers will be limited to what they can order. The service only extends to clothing, accessories and smaller homeware items. \nWith consumers increasingly choosing to shop over the internet, the UK's high-street retailers have been battling it out for market share by introducing ever-shorter delivery options and cut-off times for online shoppers. \nBut many industry experts have questioned the profitability of online shoppping and believe a number of well-known high-street names actually subsidise the service. \nAmazon operates a slick and sophisticated delivery service \nIt hasn't helped that online-only players have upped the ante: last month, cyber behemoth Amazon cranked up the pressure on high-street rivals by offering a one-hour delivery service. \nThat has prompted John Lewis to become the first department store in the UK to charge a fee for in-store collection. \nThe move could prove to be a significant point in the evolution of online retail as businesses debate how to wring more profits from online shopping. \nAndy Street, managing director of John Lewis, had previously pointed to the collapse of delivery firm City Link last Christmas as evidence that “illogical” business models have to change for retailers and logistics groups. \nLast month Sainsbury’s and Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) axed their click-and-collect points at selected London Underground stations amid claims that they were being used by motorists rather than the Tube passengers who were supposed to use them. \nM&S boss Marc Bolland is under pressure to around the British retailing giant \nMeanwhile, Marks & Spencer is set to unveil quarterly results on the morning of its annual general meeting at Wembley Stadium on Tuesday. \nThe expectation is for a slide in like-for-like sales in the crucial general merchandise division. The setback is expected to be painful for chief executive Marc Bolland who, just a few weeks ago, pointed to a recovery of clothing sales in the last quarter as a sign that his turnaround was beginning to pay off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T17:49:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
