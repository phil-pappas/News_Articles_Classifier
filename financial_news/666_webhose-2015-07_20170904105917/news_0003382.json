Photo: Bloomberg\nGlobal equities are expensive and the best value can be found in Australia, particularly in the ravaged mining services stocks, an Australian value fund manager says.\nForager Funds chief investment officer Steven Johnson said there was more pessimism in parts of the Australian market than in its international peers.\n\"There is half of the Australian market that is similar to the US or Europe, where there are good-quality businesses that have been trading at fairly expensive prices,\" he said.\n\"Then there is half of the market in Australia that's very beaten up and where share price performances have been very bad and where no one wants to own them.\"\nAdvertisement Among the most beaten-up stocks are the mining services stocks, whose share prices have plummeted following heavy write-downs on equipment and loss of business as the big miners tighten their belts.\nMr Johnson said while the operating environment had been \"horrible\" – with the downturn in demand from a slowing Chinese economy and falling commodities prices – some businesses had managed to find ways to remain profitable.\n\"The landscape has settled and we've been able to identify those companies which are doing fine and which aren't,\" he said.\nHuge discount Some businesses were trading at a \"huge discount\" to the value of their assets, while other companies, such as Watpac, had been \"tarred with a mining services brush\" when it accounted for only a small amount of their overall business, he said.\n\"Macmahon is an example of a company that where everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. You've still done very well if you were able to buy their share price at their lows because it was trading at just a really absurd price.\"\nMacmahon had $40 million in cash and $50 million in equipment that could either be sold or put back into use, indicating it had opportunities to make money. That its share price has fallen from 36¢ in 2013 to just 8¢ \"showed how much pessimism there is\", he said.\nHe also noted that \"darlings\" such as Seek and Flight Centre had been punished heavily, with share price falls of 17 per cent and 15 per cent respectively after flagging relatively benign profit warnings, which highlighted the pessimism.\nDeutsche Bank analyst Craig Wong-Pan agreed there were some opportunities in the mining services.\n\"These companies aren't standing still. They're in cost-cutting modes themselves, but I think the next 12 to 24 months is going to be a time when we see big work projects come to an end,\" he said.\nDiversified into infrastructure But he said \"the uncertainty is around what replaces them\", adding some companies had diversified into infrastructure projects.\nMr Wong-Pan upgraded ALS Limited recently to \"buy\", saying conditions had stabilised across its divisions and it was set to deliver 42 per cent growth in earnings.\n\"Transfield Services has also been undergoing a transformation, improving their margins and taking cost out. This is a feature across the sector, which has been focused on cost cutting, improving processes and reducing debt,\" he said.\n\"The valuations do look very cheap but I still think there are some earnings headwinds for most of these companies for the next 12 to 24 months.\"\nMr Johnson said the upcoming reporting season would be \"very interesting\", to assess whether those companies could deliver on their profit guidances.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T10:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:30:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
