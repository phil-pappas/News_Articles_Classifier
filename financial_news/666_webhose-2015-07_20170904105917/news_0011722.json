It starts in the coming hours with the aim of concluding it by the end of the week, at the latest,\" he said.\nThe new Greek proposals will be discussed by eurozone finance ministers on Saturday.\nOver dinner this evening, Greek PM Alexis Tsipras told his fellow leaders what he wants to achieve in the wake of his victory in the Greek referendum.\nThe suggestion is that he will agree to many but not all of the demands for reform which have been made by Greece's creditors. Some of them he had previously rejected. But he wants much more in return - a third bailout from the eurozone, some sort of agreement on restructuring his country's huge public debt, and more measures to encourage economic growth.\nThere is huge pressure on the Greek government because both the state and the banking system in Greece are on the verge of running out of money. But there is also pressure on other eurozone leaders. Mr Tusk said this was perhaps the most critical moment in the history of the single currency and of the EU itself.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said the eurozone leaders had had a \"serious, candid discussion\" in Brussels that \"reflected the seriousness of the situation at hand\".\nShe said the leaders \"obviously respect the results of the referendum\" but added: \"As regards the euro, we don't have the sovereignty of just one country to contend with, but of 18. Shared sovereignty, shared responsibility.\"\nMrs Merkel said Greece needed a new debt programme that would last several years, not a short-term fix.\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he wanted Greece to remain in the eurozone but that Greece had to \"tell us where they are heading\" by the end of the week.\nEarlier there was anger among some eurozone members at the lack of new written proposals from Greece.\nLithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said: \"There was a promise for today. Then, they're promising for tomorrow. For the Greek government it's every time 'manana'.\"\nGreece's banks have been shut since its last international bailout programme expired last Tuesday.\nCapital controls have been imposed, with people unable to withdraw more than €60 a day from cash machines.\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has refused to increase emergency lending.\nHowever, Mr Hollande said on Tuesday the ECB would now ensure minimum liquidity for Greece until Sunday.\n[bbc]", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/004E/production/_84087000__84080855_greek_exit_scenarios-01-01.png", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/78D6/production/_83943903_who_owns_greeces_deb_v2_624.png"], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T02:32:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
