ANZ Banking Group gained 0.6 per cent, Westpac rose 0.9 per cent, while the National Australia Bank added 1 per cent.\nMacquarie Atlas Roads was the day's best performing stock, up 5.4 per cent after it announced weighted average toll revenue had grown 3.6 per cent in the June, while traffic rose 2.6 per cent.\nOil and gas producer Oil Search meanwhile gained 3.9 per cent after it lifted its production targets from 26 million barrels or equivalent to 28mboe up to 27 to 29mboe.\nCasino operator Echo Entertainment shares closed up a record high $4.87, up 0.6 per cent after rising as high as $5.06 on news it won a $2 billion contract to build a casino in Brisbane , edging out rival Crown Entertainment.\nMr McCarthy noted however two of the strongest performing sectors, information technology that closed up 1.2 per cent and consumer staples up 0.7 per cent, indicated a move towards value buying.\n\"Some of the standouts today are Woolworths and Computershare... buyers are cautious, and looking at value stocks,\" he said.\n\"Nobody's getting too excited.\"\nWoolworths rose 0.6 per cent to $28.76, Wesfarmers rose 0.7 per cent to $42.22, while Computershare rose 1.3 per cent to $12.74. Telstra shares gained 0.2 per cent to $6.43.\nThe materials and industrial indices were the only sectors to fall, with materials down 0.3 per cent despite the benchmark iron ore price rallying 3.3 per cent to $US52.39 a tonne overnight.\nBHP Billiton fell 0.6 per cent, while Rio Tinto fell 0.9 per cent.\nThe gold price steadied in the Asian trade on Tuesday, a day after falling 4 per cent, and the local gold miners stemmed some of their Monday losses.\nNewcrest Mining fell 1.5 per cent, but Northern Star Resources rose 3 per cent.\nSt George chief economist Hans Kunnen said with commodity prices falling the extent they had over the past three weeks, he did not see the miners as being \"a short term driver of the sharemarket\".\nHe said however with a solid earnings season coming up he was \"confident\" the market would hit 6000 by year's end.\n\"I prefer to keep the focus on the earnings rather than the sentiment, which I think will be reasonable but not outstanding,\" he said.\n\"I see the sharemarket chugging towards the 6000 mark but it could be a Christmas story rather than a spring story,\" he said.\nAnalysts will be watching US earnings overnight, which is set to be one of the key days for earnings, with Apple among others to set to report.\nMr McCarthy said US earnings were set to be weaker than expected.\n\"That could see us entering our reporting season on a bit of a downbeat note, which could be good for companies: they only have to deliver in a modest way to get a significant uptick in their share prices,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/earnings-season-has-6000-back-on-radar-for-asx-20150721-gigv4m", "http://www.afr.com/brand/chanticleer/hard-work-begins-for-echo-after-beating-crown-resorts-in-brisbane-20150721-gigwlu", "http://www.afr.com/business/energy/oil/oil-search-upgrades-output-forecast-as-png-lng-venture-20150721-giguu7", "http://www.afr.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold-to-hit-us1000-by-december-20150720-gigtvt"], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T15:17:25.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
