It has greater liquidity. We don't have a liquidity problem,\" Mizutani said. \"We need to assess what is best in terms of the market. At the moment, it continues to be sugar.\" \nThe executive did not rule out shifting Raizen's production mix more toward ethanol later if demand for the biofuel proves robust. \nCrushing officially began in April, and shipments and loading of sugar at Brazil's ports have been normal so far this season. \nMizutani did express concern that too much rain in July, typically one of Brazil's dryest months, could keep mills from harvesting all the mature cane available before they have to shut down in December due to the rainy season. \n\"If rains continue strong in July, it could mess things up,\" Mizutani said. \nBrazil's center-south cane belt has been wet in recent days, but Mizutani said, so far, weather has been normal and mills have only lost a few days to wet weather. Mills tend to suspend the crushing of sugar cane during rain.
