Picture: AFP PHOTO Related articles Senegal finally puts Chadian dictator on trial Amid spat with ICC, Habre trial raises hope for African justice In this article Companies and organisations: African Union | United Nations DAKAR — Chadian dictator Hissene Habre went on trial Monday in Senegal, a quarter of a century after his reign of terror came to an end, in a trial seen as a test case for African justice.\nConsidered \"Africa’s Pinochet\", the 72-year-old has been in custody in Senegal since his arrest in June 2013 at the home he shared in an affluent Dakar suburb with his wife and children.\nDressed in white robes and a turban, Habre pumped a fist in the air and cried \"God is greatest\" as he was escorted by prison guards into the Extraordinary African Chambers in the Senegalese capital. Mr Habre had said he did not recognise the court’s jurisdiction and vowed he and his lawyers would play no part in the trial. But guards forced him into the dock before a court packed with a thousand participants and media.\nJudge Gberdao Gustave Kam of Burkina Faso opened proceedings and announced the former military strongman had no legal representation.\nSupporters screamed out slogans hailing Habre as a \"liberator\" of Chad before they were removed by police.\nMr Habre — backed during his presidency by France and the US as a bulwark against Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi — is on trial for crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture in Chad from 1982 to 1990. He was overthrown by rebel troops in December 1990 and fled to Senegal.\nChief prosecutor Mbacke Fall paid tribute to the survivors of the Habre era \"who had the virtue to pursue the fight against impunity\".\nRights groups say 40,000 Chadians were killed under a regime propped up by crackdowns on opponents and the targeting of rival ethnic groups Mr Habre perceived as a threat to his grip on the Sahel nation.\n\"This trial is staged for our people, for our future, for the future of Africa. And it is being staged to reconcile us with ourselves,\" said Chadian Justice Minister Mahamat Issa Halikim.\nDelayed for years by Senegal, the trial sets a historic precedent as until now African leaders accused of atrocities have been tried in international courts.\nSenegal and the African Union (AU) signed an agreement in December 2012 to set up a court to bring Mr Habre to justice.\nThe AU had mandated Senegal to try Mr Habre in July 2006, but the country stalled the process for years under former president Abdoulaye Wade, who was defeated in 2012 elections.\nMacky Sall, Mr Wade’s successor who took office in April 2012 vowed to organise a trial in Senegal.\n\"This is the first case anywhere in the world — not just in Africa — where the courts of one country, Senegal, are prosecuting the former leader of another, Chad, for alleged human rights crimes,\" Reed Brody, a lawyer at Human Rights Watch (HRW), said.\nMr Brody described the trial as a \"test case for African justice\", adding it was the first time that the concept of \"universal jurisdiction\" — that a suspect can be prosecuted for their past crimes wherever in the world they find themselves — had been implemented in Africa.\n\"So there are a lot of historical aspects to this. But, for me, the most important kind of thing is that it is the survivors who have pushed for 25 years,\" he added.\nThe Extraordinary African Chambers were set up by Senegal and the AU in February 2013 to prosecute the \"person or persons\" most responsible for international crimes committed in Chad during Mr Habre’s rule.\nThe chambers indicted Mr Habre in July 2013 and placed him in pre-trial custody while four investigating judges spent 19 months interviewing about 2,500 witnesses and victims and analysing thousands of documents.\nAbout 100 witnesses will testify during hearings expected to last around three months, although 4,000 people have been registered as victims in the case.\n\"The African Union saw the importance of being able to show that you can have justice in Africa,\" Mr Brody added.\nThe UN described the opening of the trial as a \"milestone for justice in Africa\" while France issued a statement welcoming the opening of a process it said it had helped establish.\nFrance sent 3,000 paratroopers with air support to support Mr Habre when Libyan-backed supporters of his political rival Goukouni Weddeye launched an offensive in northern Chad in 1983.\nRights groups say the US, too, provided a variety of support to Mr Habre — including training, intelligence and arms for his feared secret police — despite being aware of the regime’s atrocities.\nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T02:08:58.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
