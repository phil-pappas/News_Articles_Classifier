The paper is now printed all over the world, including in New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Dubai. \nThe paper has been printed on distinctive pink paper since 1893. \nThe FT.com website -- which now accounts for 70 percent of total circulation -- was launched in 1995. \nThe newspaper's digital subscriptions overtook print circulation in 2012, while mobile -- tablets and smartphones -- account for about half of FT.com traffic. \nBack in February, Pearson forecast that group earnings could soar by a fifth this year, aided by cost-cutting and expanding online sales. \nEarnings per share -- a key measure of company performance -- could rise to between 75 pence and 80 pence this year, compared with 66.7 pence in 2014. \nNet profits slid 12.5 percent to £471 million last year on restructuring costs and adverse foreign exchange moves. \n- Focus on education - \nPearson -- which has become a world leader in education publishing -- is said to want to focus on the booming sector, according to analysts. \nThe group, which earns 90 percent of sales from its education division, had previously denied persistent speculation that the FT was for sale. \n\"Rumours have been circulating for a while about a possible sale of the FT, which is not a good fit with the rest of Pearson's business, which mainly concentrates on the education sector,\" said Schifferes. \nFT education products serve two-thirds of the world's top business schools, according to Pearson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T15:37:47.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
