Demand for its paints reflects how often people are moving house and splashing out on redecorating, while sales of industrial paint and chemical supplies gives an insight into the underlying health of a nation's industry and commercial companies. \nMr Büchner said that Europe had proved to be a “very, very tough” market over the past few years, though there were pockets of strength. \n“The UK was the first to recover, followed by the Netherlands this year,” he said. “There is weakness in France, and Spain is recovering but from a very, very low base... this is the run-up to the season for buying decorative paint.” \nLooking farther afield, he said Eastern Europe was seeing a lot of volatility because of Russia, while Latin America was suffering amid the downturn in demand for natural resources. North America is improving and while China is difficult, new markets in Asia, such as Indonesia and Vietnam, are improving. \nAkzo Nobel says it is being hit by a downturn in demand in Latin America \nDecorative paint, Akzo’s smallest division, had sales of €1.1bn in the quarter, a rise of 6pc. Specialty chemicals, which are used in detergents, foods, cosmetics and construction, saw sales increase 5pc to €1.3bn while performance coatings, which makes paints used in industries such as aerospace, shipbuillding and the oil and gas, posted an 8pc jump in revenues to €1.5bn. \n“The oil and gas sectors are cutting back on paint for their oil platforms and refineries, they are clearly hurting,” said Mr Büchner, adding that Akzo was also seeing the backlog from shipyards falling, with less demand to repaint ships. \nAkzo Nobel's performance coatings unit makes paint used to protect ships \n“In the consumer area, if people are buying furniture it is generally painted, and most consumer goods such as mobile phones have a coating of some kind. We are seeing steady growth in the area,” he added. \nCurrency movements were largely behind the increase in revenue, with Akzo’s international sales delivering a top line boost as the company reports in the euro, which has weakened recently. Akzo said foreign exchange movements lifted results by 9pc but this was pared back by lower volumes and the sale of businesses. \nCost controls helped to drive operating profits 38pc higher tp €486m, and the return on sales grew to 12.3pc, up from 9.5pc a year ago. \n“We get a benefit from currency movements [on revenue] but not really on return on sales,” said Mr Büchner, who added the company is on track to hit its full-year targets. “Currency does have some benefit on raw material costs.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T15:51:47.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
