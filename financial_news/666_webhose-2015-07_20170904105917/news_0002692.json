The site was formerly home of the city's famous Orange Bowl stadium, which was demolished in 2008 to make way for the Marlins baseball park.\nBeckham's group, which includes \"American Idol\" creator and fellow Briton Simon Fuller, has explored stadium options for months and saw two earlier downtown waterfront sites blocked by local politicians and business interests.\nThe 40-year old former England soccer captain, who played several seasons for L.A. Galaxy late in his career, announced he would exercise his option to become the owner of a new MLS franchise in Miami in Feb. 2014 but struggled to find political support for a stadium plan.\nHe has said he wants to build a 20,000-seat stadium with $250 million in private financing and launch the team by 2018-2019.\nThe group previously spurned the Orange Bowl site, about two miles west of downtown, which was long promoted by city officials.\nIt sits in the heart of the city's heavily Hispanic Little Havana district, and while less glamorous than Miami's downtown waterfront it is close to a major expressway and could share existing parking with the Marlins stadium.\nThe MLS board of governors had begun to show signs of impatience with Beckham saying they aimed to make some decisions on new franchises in 2015.\nThe league grew to 20 teams this year with the addition of New York City FC and Orlando City FC, with Atlanta and a second LA-based team coming in 2017.\nThe league's commissioner, Don Garber, has said he believes Miami could be \"a great MLS market\" if Beckham can find the right venue.
