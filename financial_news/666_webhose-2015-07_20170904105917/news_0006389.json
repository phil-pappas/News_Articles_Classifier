They are commingled liquidity funds, uninvested cash, interest receivables, net unsettled trades, broker money, short duration derivatives (for example Eurodollar futures) and derivatives offsets.\nThe Pimco Total Return Fund increased its holdings in emerging markets to 21.6 percent of assets in June, compared with 19.1 percent in May, according to Pimco's website. In credit, the fund had an 8.84 percent allocation to investment-grade debt in June, up from 8.2 percent allocation in May, and 3.22 percent in high yield \"junk\" bonds in June, down from 3.3 percent in high yield the previous month.\nWe can add a Pimco spokeswoman declined to comment.
