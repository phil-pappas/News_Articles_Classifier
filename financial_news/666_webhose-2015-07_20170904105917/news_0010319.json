Investors will read carefully into the Fed's statement following a two day monetary policy meeting that ends Wednesday.\n\"The overnight action with the flight to quality in China and Europe as well, is a continuation of a larger move in the last six to eight trading sessions of a relentless flattening of the yield curve,\" said Edward Acton, U.S. Treasuries strategist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.\nActon added that Chinese purchasing managers data late last week showing a decline exacerbates concerns of real economic growth worries in addition to the destabilizing impact of the drop in asset prices despite the government's emergency measures.\n\"It is not a risk-on catalyst,\" he said.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries traded up 14/32 of a point in price in early U.S. trading, driving the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, down to 2.22 percent, its lowest since June 9..\nThe 30-year U.S. Treasury rose more than one full point in price, edging to its session high after a stronger-than-expected 3.4 percent rise in June U.S. durable goods orders.\nThe 30-year bond traded up 30/32 of a point in price, pulling the yield down to 2.92 percent.\nBuying in the Treasuries market began after Chinese stocks slid more than 8 percent after an unprecedented government rescue plan to prop up equity valuations fizzled. This raises serious concerns, after three weeks of relative calm, that Beijing's efforts to stave off a deeper crash will fail.
