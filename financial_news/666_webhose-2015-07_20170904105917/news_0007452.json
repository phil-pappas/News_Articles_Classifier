Jamila Toderas Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Plans by NSW to increase the GST rate to 15 per cent to fund public health would still leave a shortfall of up to $3 billion a year once compensation was factored in, putting pressure on a cash-trapped federal government to make up the difference, according to modelling to be presented at Wednesday's leaders' summit.\nNSW Liberal Premier Mike Baird, who is driving the GST push in a bid to cover the growing cost of public health, will present the modelling which estimates that by 2020, a 15 per cent GST rate applied to the existing base of goods and services would raise an extra $36 billion a year.\nTo fully compensate Australians with a combined income of less than $100,000, and partially assist those with a combined income between $100,000 and $150,000, for the cost-of-living increase, about half the money would have to be returned through welfare increases and tax cuts.\nThis would leave a shortfall of about $2 billion to $3 billion of the $20 billion needed in 2020 to fund the growing public health bill.\nThe NSW government modelled other options and found the only way to to meet the cost of health and ensure there was adequate compensation was to raise the Medicare levy to 4 per cent for everybody, or introduce a sliding scale for the levy based on income.\nThe premiers of Queensland and Victoria support an increase in the Medicare levy as an alternative to raising the GST rate but Mr Baird's presentation will rule it out on the basis it would amount to an income tax increase.\nKeeping the rate at 10 per cent but extending the GST to health, education, child care and financial services would fail to raise enough to pay for heath and cover compensation. Mr Baird's presentation describes ths option as \"not supported as it has fairness and equity issues\".\nThe summit, to be held at a military barracks in Sydney, is seeking a long-term funding solution for public hospitals and schools. This was thrown into turmoil at the 2014 federal budget when the federal government withdrew $80 billion in funding over a decade with the edict that the states should find the revenue themselves, given they administer the services.\n Prime Minister Tony Abbott has welcomed Mr Baird's proposal as \"very sensible\" and one that warrants serious consideration but would not be drawn on Tuesday when asked if the federal government would help with the financial compensation.\n\"Whenever anything comes up, people want to know instantly exactly what might happen now and one, two, three, 10, 20 or 30 years into the future,\" he said.\n\"We are at the beginning of a process here and I want the process to ensure that Australians have better schools, better hospitals, better TAFEs, better services and at the same time, that we have lower, simpler, fairer taxes.\"\nTreasurer Joe Hockey has previously argued against increasing the GST on the basis the federal government had no money in the budget to fund compensation. He has already flagged income tax cuts after the next election and not said how they would be paid for.\nWhen the Howard government introduced the GST in 2000, the states received the revenue while the federal government paid for compensation and the income tax cuts that were part of a broader tax changes.\nTo the chagrin of business and economic groups, Mr Baird's proposal is not one of tax reform but a to raise revenue to fund the growing shortfall in health spending , which will total $35 billion by 2030. Mr Baird's presentation said that funding gap would be the equivalent to running 30 Westmead hospitals.\nSouth Australian Labor Premier Jay Weatherill, who supports the proposal on the condition there would be adequate and enduring compensation for lower income earners, said on Wednesday that his \"starting point\" was that the states pocket all the money and the federal government cover the compensation bill, as it did in 2000.\nHe ruled out using any of the proceeds for anything other than health funding, including tax reform.\n\"Ths is not an exercise of shifting revenue from one hand to another,\" he said.\nMr Weatherill has broken away from federal Labor which remains implacably opposed to any increase to the rate or base of the GST but he was unperturbed by this.\n\"I don't have the luxury of opposing for the sake of it, I have a state to run, I have people who actually need their healthcare services,\" he said.\n\"We have a present government we have to deal with,\" he said.\nSouth Australian Liberal opposition leader Steven Marshall vehemently opposed a GST increase, saying businesses and individuals were already doing it tough.\nThere was further fracturing in the Labor position when Queensland Treasurer Curtis Pitt said he would be open to a GST increase but only if the case were compelling.\nFreemarket think tank The Institute of Public Affairs slammed the GST proposal and said that instead, the government should adopt a proposal by one of its own MPs, economist Peter Hendyâ€‹, and share existing income tax revenues with the states. States could levy their own income rates if they wished.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/gst_fundinggap_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-21T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:11:23.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
