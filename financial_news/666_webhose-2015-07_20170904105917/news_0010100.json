Wayne Taylor Share on twitter by Tony Boyd Watch the social media outlets carefully on Wednesday for photos of ANZ Banking Group's chairman David Gonski and chief executive Mike Smith when they were both about 10 years old.\nThe young Gonski's blond locks might come as a surprise given the current state of his pate but the suit and tie worn by the young Smith fits the image of someone who lived for years in the bubble created for HSBC's banking elite.\nThe two men have opened the family photo archives in the interests of kick-starting a renewed debate in Australia about gender equity including the lack of equity in pay and conditions.\nANZ's CEO Global Wealth, Joyce Phillips, is leading the charge with the release of a report that details the damning statistics about the huge gap in pay between men and women. She says the social media campaign encouraging people to post a photo of themselves as a child is aimed at encouraging people to think about a time when gender inequity was not something they confronted every day.\nANZ's CEO Global Wealth, Joyce Phillips, is encouraging people to think about a time when gender inequity was not something they confronted every day. Dominic Lorrimer Phillips says that as a triple with a brother and a sister she viewed the world as a place where boys and girls were equal.\nHowever, she says that during her extensive career in financial services at a range of organisations including GE Capital, American Life Insurance and Citi she has not experienced the sort of unconscious bias found in Australia.\nPhillips says that means it is much harder for women in Australia to achieve the positions that are warranted by their abilities.\nThe report she released found that full-time female workers are paid on average $295 per week less than men, or $15,000 a year. Over an entire career, this gap extends to around $700,000.\n Women on average earn 18.8 per cent less than men, around 90 per cent retire with inadequate savings to fund a comfortable lifestyle in retirement and almost 15 per cent of women are likely to experience poverty in retirement.\nANZ is stepping up its own commitment to women in the workplace through extending some existing services and adding new benefits to staff. These include an additional $500 a year to top up the superannuation of all permanent and fixed term female employees.\nOther measures include parental leave superannuation will be paid for up to 24 months, up from 12 months, for Australian based employees on their return to work.\nAs a service to customers the bank will offer free superannuation advice for customers with less than $50,000 in superannuation.\nMike Smith, who is a member of the Male Champions of Change said: \"Promoting diversity and gender equality is a priority in our business. This includes pay equality and an equal representation of women in leadership roles.\"\n\"Much more still needs to be done though to achieve full gender equality in the workplace and while we recognise we're not there yet, today's announcement is about rethinking how we address the imbalances women face in the workplace and in retirement.\"\nThe measures taken by ANZ will focus attention on the commitment of the top 200 companies to pay equality.\nA quick review of the annual reports of the top 20 companies shows that some have yet to disclose whether this is a priority.\nMore than a lawyer When Ten Network Holdings reshuffled its board and management this week all the attention was focused on the departing executive chairman Hamish McLennan and the new CEO Paul Anderson .\nThe lack of attention given to new chairman David Gordon was an oversight given his proven credentials as a successful businessman experienced in the art of digital disruption.\nGordon brings with him a rich history in mergers and acquisitions in Australia. He cut his teeth in M&A at Freehills in the 1980s and 1990s. For his first few years he worked alongside one of the country's most brilliant corporate lawyers, David Gonski, who was the youngest ever partner at Freehills.\nGordon's first association with Ten was doing the legal work on Westfield Capital Corp's takeover of Northern Star Holdings, which was the corporate vehicle for the TV company. At the time of the deal, Westfield Capital Corp was run by Gonski, who joined the company as managing director at the invitation of Westfield Shopping centre founder Frank Lowy.\nGordon's friendship with Gonski survived the Northern Star debacle in 1989. About $500 million in shareholders' funds was destroyed, half of which belonged to Westfield Capital.\nGordon went into business with Gonski in 1996 when he joined Wentworth Associates which included among its elite directors, Richard Longes and Geoff Levy. When Wentworth Associates was sold to Investec Bank, Gordon set up his own business called Lexicon Partners.\nSo, how did an M&A lawyer develop a track record as a successful businessman behind innovative companies? In Gordon's case, the first big leap into commerce was joining John Singleton in backing Tim Pethick's juice company Nudie. That company was last year sold to Filipino company, Monde Nissin.\nBut his biggest success story is RGC Corporation, the owner of several footwear businesses including Athlete's Foot and Podium Sports. That has been a successful turn around with the market capitalisation rising from about $20million in 2007 to $589million today.\nIn the e-commerce area, Gordon has backed the online shopping software company ShippingEasy, which is based in Austin, Texas and run by former SEEK senior executive Katie May.\nGordon has a deep understanding of the free-to-air TV business. He worked with former chairman Nick Falloon after Canadian group Canwest sold out.\nHe is conscious of the need for Anderson and his management team to respond to the threats to the Ten business from various online streaming products. Ten's immediate response is TENplay, which is available as an app on iTunes.\nThere will be no change to the core Ten strategy of focusing on the 25 to 54 age group. Assuming the competition regulator allows the Foxtel purchase of 15 per cent of Ten, the company will have increased ability to fund the purchase of sport. The outsourcing of advertising sales to Foxtel's Multi-Channel Network (MCN) and the purchase of 25 per cent of that company should make the company more cost efficient.\nGordon's appointment as chairman means that for the first time in many years, investors can be confident that appropriate corporate governance protocols are in place to drive a high performance culture. Separating the chairman and CEO role and dumping the chief operating officer position should deliver better results.\nTelstra's video play Fans of streaming video services are suddenly spoiled for choice. After spending years being denied access to the sort of video streaming services enjoyed by Americans, Australians can now take their pick of half a dozen offerings.\nThe launch by Telstra of the Roku 2 device in September will not only pose a threat to rival services, it will threaten its half owned subsidiary Foxtel.\nAs my colleagues, Max Mason and David Ramli, have revealed the Roku 2 will come with a remote control and allow catch up of free to air TV as well as be the platform for Netflix, Stan and Presto. The launch of Roku 2 will inevitably caused tension at the Foxtel headquarters in North Ryde in Sydney. There is industry talk that Foxtel was blindsided last month when Telstra replaced Foxtel in its entertainment bundles with the T-Box, which is the bridge to Roku 2.\nTelstra's moves will give more impetus to Netflix which is storming the world. It already accounts for about 35per cent of traffic online in the US. These disruptive video streaming services are rapidly changing people's perceptions of value. When you can watch all the movies you want for less than $10 a month it makes the pay TV offering look expensive.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-07-28T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T23:17:58.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
