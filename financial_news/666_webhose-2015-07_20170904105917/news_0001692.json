The Shanghai Index jumped 3.51 percent Friday, to give the market the second straight weekly gain following big drops the prior three weeks that rattled global markets. \nBut as with Greece, analysts were not convinced that China was completely out of the woods. The pullback in Chinese stocks has raised worries about slowing growth in the broader Chinese economy. \nThe stock upturn is \"a rally that has effectively been rigged by government intervention,\" said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare. \n\"The overarching point... is that the good times rolling in the Chinese stock market at the moment are too good to be true because they are being fabricated by government control.\" \nInvestors also took heart from two days of congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, who gave a generally upbeat appraisal of the US economy as she stuck to her forecast for an increase in the Fed's key interest rate later this year. \nBut many market watchers continue to believe a rate hike is unlikely before December, a timeframe considered friendly to stock market gains. \n- Netflix, Google lift Nasdaq - \nAmong the parade of earnings reports, Netflix vaulted 18 percent on Thursday to lift the Nasdaq to a record close after reporting that subscriptions jumped 3.3 million in the second quarter. \nThe streaming video company reported lower profits, but analysts view the stock as a must-have. \n\"It's a big believers story, the way Amazon is,\" said Mace Blicksilver, director of Marblehead Asset Management. \"On growth metrics, you must own it.\" \nOn Friday, Google lifted the Nasdaq to a second straight record after a blowout earnings report pushed the stock up 16 percent to an all-time high. \nThat brought the company's full market value to about $468 billion, a gain of $65 billion, the biggest one-day gain in US history, according to S&P Indices. \nGoogle reported a two percent rise in earnings to $3.4 billion and gave a bullish outlook on its YouTube business, while hinting that moves to return cash to shareholders were in the horizon. \nMost large banks either met or exceeded earnings forecasts. The biggest jump came at Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) , which reported $4.8 billion in profits, up from just $181 million in the year-ago period when litigation costs weighed on results. \nBut Goldman Sachs saw earnings drop by almost half, to $1.05 billion from $2.04 billion due to a $1.45 billion legal charge. \nNext (Other OTC: NXGPF - news ) week's calendar includes results from numerous heavyweights, including Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) , Microsoft (NasdaqGS: MSFT - news ) , Boeing (NYSE: BA - news ) and General Motors (NYSE: GM - news ) . The schedule also includes June sales of new homes and existing homes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T02:11:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
