David Bartho Share on twitter by Jacob Greber The two think-tanks hired to advise next month's National Reform Summit have clashed over whether repairing the long-term budget crisis should rely on cuts to spending – primarily to pensions, health and education – or an increase in taxes.\nIn a sign of the size of the challenge facing next month's non-partisan summit , which will attempt to build consensus on a broad program of economic and social reform, the Grattan Institute and Menzies Institute both acknowledge that focusing on spending cuts alone is politically unpalatable.\nHowever, the right-leaning Menzies Institute will urge the summit's delegates, which includes the nation's leading business, welfare and union leaders, to push for a range of measures that would curb government spending, such as a formal constitutional cap on outlays as a share of GDP.\nBy contrast, the Grattan Institute argues in its report that spending restraint is important but that the size of the future budget shortfall and political realities mean revenues will also need to be hiked.\n\"History suggests that governments usually only solve large structural budget problems through a mix of both spending and taxation reform,\" Mr Daley told The Australian Financial Review .\n\"If you try to solve a large structural budget problem only by cutting expenditure, the politics are unworkable.\"\nThe Menzies Institute's report, Fiscal Sustainability: Repairing Australia's Fiscal Accounts , which was edited by economist Henry Ergas, points to a \"very strong case\" for fiscal repair based primarily on spending cuts.\nThe report's authors warn that new tax imposts will worsen disincentives to work, save and invest, with a large portion of Australia's current budget deficits caused by the 2008-09 stimulus package.\n \"Australia pursued one of the most aggressive fiscal stimulus programs in the world, even though there was no banking crisis here,\" the Menzies Institute said in the report.\nCounterproductive spending Increased government spending in the wake of the crisis has also \"proved counterproductive\" as it pushed up market interest rates and the Australian dollar higher than they should have been.\n\"Australia's fiscal and competitiveness problems stem from this major policy mistake,\" the report stated.\nMr Daley's report – Fiscal challenges for Australia – argues that rising demand for health care as a result of the aging population, the need for higher education standards and pension costs mean revenues will need to be increased.\nHe says that an easy \"drift back to surplus\" as a result of faster economic growth is unlikely.\n\"Australia's governments are small by OECD standards, and our public sector operations more efficiently than most,\" he said. \"This makes it harder to find savings by cutting waste and shrinking non-essential services.\n\"To bring their budgets back to balance, governments will need to undertake reforms on both the revenue and the spending sides,\" he said.\nGrattan Institute analysis suggests the best way to narrow the budget deficit would be to impose tougher aged pension assets tests, increase the pension age and superannuation preservation age and wind back super concessions – a combination that would boost the balance by $27 billion a year, which is the bulk of the forecast shortfall over the next four years.\n\"These reforms will be politically difficult,\" he said. \"To build the public case, governments should adopt budget projection methodologies that provide a more realistic picture of the pressures on Australia's medium term budget outcomes.\n\"These will make it more obvious that we cannot rely on the hope that our luck will improve.\"\nThe August 26 summit in Sydney will hear from around 80 leaders across society on the challenges facing the federal government in dealing with retirement, taxation, jobs and productivity.\nBusiness groups, the Australian Council of Social Services and the Australian Council of Trade Union's Dave Oliver will also attend.\nThe peak union body's views differ markedly from those of the Grattan and Menzies institutes, with officials pointing to a recent discussion paper released last week by the left-leaning Chifley Research Centre's Inclusive Prosperity Commission, co-chaired by former Labor treasurer Wayne Swan and Chifley head Michael Cooney.\nTheir report argues that Australia is suffering from a new rise of inequality that threatens to undermine the gains in living standards of recent years.\nThey say the nation needs to adapt to rapid and disruptive technological change that increasingly allows machines to replace complex forms of human labour.\n\"A great divide is emerging between skilled and unskilled labour; capital owners and workers.\"\nMr Swan and Mr Cooney write in the report that a \"much more muscular mix of healthy labour market institutions\" is needed, as well as prudential rules for financial markets and corporate governance, and \"job-biased growth\" across all parts of the economy.\n\"The powerful forces leading to concentration of wealth and inequality of income in advanced industrial economies can't be countered simply through market competition, incentives for workforce participation and education and training,\" they argue.\nThe summit is being supported by The Australian Financial Review and rival The Australian .", "external_links": ["http://www.chifley.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Inclusive-Prosperity-Australias-record-and-the-road-ahead.pdf", "https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-07-28T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T07:14:56.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
