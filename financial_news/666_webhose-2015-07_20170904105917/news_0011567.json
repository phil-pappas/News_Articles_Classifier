The bank last year set up a $100 million fund to back fintech startups. \nThe deal with Monitise could help the software firm become profitable by 2017, analysts at UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) said. Shares in Monitise, which have fallen by 80 percent over the past year, were up 9 percent by 1015 GMT. \n\"We continue to be encouraged as Monitise executes and deepens its relationships with banks,\" UBS said. \nAs well as taking a 50 percent stake in the venture, Monitise said it would benefit from a multi-million pound upfront licence fee and ongoing revenues expected to be generated. \nAs part of the deal, fintech companies can use Monitise's recently launched cloud-based platform, which has been viewed by analysts as key to reigniting its growth \nFounded in 2003, Monitise linked banks and mobile operators, building a business capable of handling more than $101 billion a year in transactions. However, it has faced tough competition from the free mobile payment systems offered by Google Inc (Xetra: A0B7FY - news ) and Apple Inc (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) . \nIt warned in January that revenues would not be as high as expected this year and its losses would be greater than analysts had expected, causing its shares to fall by more than 20 percent. \nMonitise put itself up for sale at that time, blaming changes in its business model for its third revenue warning in a year. \nHowever, two months later it said it was no longer looking for a buyer and its founder and co-CEO Alastair Lukies would step down, handing over full executive control to long-time Visa executive Elizabeth Buse. \nThe joint (NasdaqCM: JYNT - news ) venture will be led by Julio Faura, Santander's head of R&D and innovation, and chaired by Lukies. It will operate from London. \nSantander paid 33 million pounds for a 5 percent stake in Monitise last November. \n($1 = 0.6371 pounds) (Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T14:22:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
