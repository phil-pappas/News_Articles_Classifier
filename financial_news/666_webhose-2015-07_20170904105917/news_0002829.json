But you blokes should have gotten rid of that 50 years ago.\"\nFoley, from Labor's Left faction, found himself oddly in agreement with Abbott, who was referring to the annual Neville Wran lecture Foley had just delivered in which he called on Labor to rid from its national constitution the Socialist Objective.\nAdopted by the party in 1921, the objective stated:\n\"The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields.\"\nThe objective was tweaked once or twice since but Gareth Evans, at the 1981 National Conference, was the last person game enough to try and have it abolished. He was defeated by what he said was a \"a combination of sentiment an apathy\".\nAs a compromise, the party in 1981 added 22 sub-paragraphs essentially qualifying the objective to the point it became meaningless anyway. At next weekend's national Conference, Foley will move during Sunday's rules debate to get rid of it.\n\"Labor does not exist to promote state ownership, but to ensure that the state advances the interests of all people,\" Foley said.\n \"The fact that no one in the party today argues that state ownership is Labor's central, defining purpose, is a compelling case for its revision.\n\"Modern Labor must say what we mean and mean what we say.\"\nBy any measure, the objective is absurd considering it was Labor which led in terms of privatisation and economic deregulation back in the 1980s.\nFoley said the objective should be respectfully consigned to the ALP's Statement of Origins and a new objective created. He proposed a version which speaks of \"a just and equitable society where every person has the opportunity to realise their potential\", and which supports active government and competitive markets.\nWithin the branch and the party more broadly, Foley has significant support. Paul Keating and Bill Shorten, who once said it was about as useful as a 100-year-old street directory, have previously expressed support to to dump the objective; shadow treasurer Chris Bowen did the same in his book Hearts and Minds .\n\"We can't expect the public to be clear about what Labor stands for if we are not clear about this ourselves,\" he wrote.\nTime to move on Last year, Bowen told a Fabian Society forum that \"it's time to replace the socialist objective with a better statement of what we stand for\", saying the objective did not reflect \"our ambition for a modern, fair, sophisticated, cosmopolitan, outward-looking multicultural country\".\nHe dryly noted that the last time Labor proposed a major nationalisation was in 1947 when Ben Chifley wanted to nationalise the banks.\n\"[That] was a major factor in our 1949 election defeat,\" he said.\nOutside the confines of the party's constitution, Bowen and Shorten have been busily trying to modernise the party's policy foundations.\nIn April this year, the first chapter of the party's platform, which will be ratified at the conference next weekend, was rejigged to reflect Labor's contemporary economic principles.\n\"Where once we sought to row, now we seek to steer, using competition to shape markets and let them work. We recognise that government can underpin markets, building institutions and underwriting stability, as well as releasing assets to allow for better competition and more opportunity. Our focus is on the circumstances, purpose and merit of each decision, not shackled by ideology,\" it now says.\nDespite the obvious arguments for change and the modernisation of the platform, there are still many in the party opposed to dumping the objective from the constitution and Foley says mischievously that he looks forward to the arguments against his motion next weekend.\nThese will come from his fellow travellers in the Left, notably former ALP national president and newly arrived Senator Jenny McAllister, a staunch supporter of the objective. She told the Fabians that, yes, the language in the objective was \"old-fashioned\" but \"at the heart of the objective is the confirmation that we understand the relationship between the economy and our society and that we're wiling to intervene democratically to make the economy work for all of us\".\nAs far as debates go at next week's national conference, this one doesn't threaten to overshadow expected debates over contemporary policy issues such as turning back boats, gay marriage, climate change or Labor's position on Israel and Palestine.\nAnd nor should it. Furthermore, if the motion fails, there will be no practical impact.\nBut to Foley and others, if it is of emblematic significance.\nFoley has no idea whether his motion will be successful because he hasn't spent the time trying to do the numbers. But he believes as NSW Labor leader he has a special responsibility to push the motion if only to drag NSW Labor out of the dark ages into which it has fallen in recent years.\nAfter all, NSW was the branch which gave Australia Keating but then became the branch in which unions rolled a Premier (Morris Iemma) and his Treasurer (Michael Costa) because of their support for to power privatisation.\nFoley, who was just 12 weeks into the job before facing the uber-popular Mike Baird in the NSW state election, played a role in fostering the socialist image.\nHe ran on a platform based almost solely on opposing power privatisation. While he dutifully stuck to the script he inherited, it has become apparent since the election that the matter is dead and buried as far as he is concerned, Baird won, the poles and wires will be sold and Labor won't fight it.\nTime to move on, he says with relief.\nPhillip Coorey is The Australian Financial Review 's chief political correspondent.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-17T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:04:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
