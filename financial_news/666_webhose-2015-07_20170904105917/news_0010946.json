In the euphoric rush to discard your goal-setting plans and feedback matrixes, stop for a second to consider what comes next.\nWhat does it mean for your next pay rise? How do companies deal with problematic employees? And what about companies that drop the annual performance review in favour of â€¦ nothing. Or worse still, constant and endless feedback!\n\"I think performance reviews should happen daily, like a constant feedback loop,\" Thorburn says. \"To me it's conversations every day, and not twice a year.\"\nNewest tech-savvy tools being flogged Human resources experts and consultants are already out in force, offering businesses a host of new tech-saavy, online and instant feedback tools that might have us pining for the good old days.\nAccording to the experts, the workplace of the future involves each of us constantly assessing and reviewing each other at work using social networks, such as the \"skill endorsement\" button on LinkedIn, Facebook's \"thumbs up\" and \"thumbs down\", emojis or possibly even swiping left or right about your colleagues like the dating app Tinder.\nHR apps are flourishing such as JobVibe and the recently ASX-listed REFFIND , which has signed up companies including Coca-Cola, Lion Nathan and Coles and allows businesses to send employees feedback questions, issue short training videos or send company-wide memos on a \"Tinder-style\" interface.\n\"A lot of clients are moving to technology solutions where you can effectively tweet feedback on a regular basis,\" head of PwC's People Business John Williams says.\n\"The thing that triggered this for me was last year when I went through Heathrow airport and they have a little iPad on a stand that asks 'how was your security experience today?' They have a happy face or a sad face and you just hit as you go by depending on how it went.\n\"So that's the direction we are going, putting iPads in workplaces, devices on people's phones and not asking 140 questions but one or two questions and over time you can build up a picture,\" Williams says.\nAnd it is no longer only your manager who will rate you but your colleagues and underlings too.\n\"It is much more flexible than a manager rating their staff, it is everyone rating everyone,\" Williams says.\nFor many employees this sounds like hell and Williams readily admits that no one has worked out the best way to process all the information.\n\"No one is there yet because most companies are still in transition,\" he says.\nChief executive of Vocus Communications, James Spenceley is a fan of this new \"outside of the box\" management style. His company's new head of human resources, Denise Hanlon, has a big job ahead following the company's planned acquisition of Amcom which will see an additional 350 people joining the tech company.\nMove to a live rating system \"We gave the job to Denise who said: 'I really hate your system of rating people. I think we throw that out and move to a live rating system, so people are peer-rated on a daily basis. We build an app for your iPhone and every time you interact with someone they can give you a thumbs up or thumbs down like Facebook. Is it that critical what your manager thinks of you compared to what value you are delivering to the business?',\" Spenceley says.\nHowever, there are those voicing their concerns about this new world order and say that while most of us don't like the annual review process, at least it provided some certainty.\n\"No annual performance review means a whole bunch of things including the business not being part of the development and journey of their staff,\" says principal at CoreData Andrew Inwood.\n\"The idea of immediate feedback for workers, without an annual plan of development, engagement, skills mapping and alignment with the issues facing the business and the marketplace reduces them to piece work.\n\"Here's what I want businesses to do: make a map for your people, review the work persistently, their progress quarterly and their goals annually. To do less is not to take the development of your staff seriously. People's careers matter, because their lives matter. As an employer you have a responsibility in that area,\" Inwood argues.\nInwood is not alone in his concerns.\nSoon to be released research by PwC, which surveyed 100 organisations and 1000 employees in June, found dropping the review and ratings system could have big unintended consequences.\nMore than half (53 per cent) of employees' bonuses are determined based on individual performance and a majority of employees still find the year end performance review useful. Nearly two thirds (67 per cent) said performance reviews help them understand how they are doing, four in 10 said they motivate them and nearly half (48 per cent) said they help them progress and think about their career. Only just over a third (37 per cent) said they were a waste of time.\nSomething better than nothing Yes, the silent majority believe that something is better than nothing, and certainly better than some sort of constant social media feedback loop.\nBut the results are in and there is no turning back now. The PwC research reveals the dam has already broken: two thirds of large companies are making changes to their end-of-year performance reviews, with 5 per cent of organisations considering dropping performance ratings altogether.\nThorburn argues NAB will still have mechanisms in place to award bonuses.\n\"I think we've still got ways to do it,\" he says.\n\"We want to allocate bonuses against KPIs in the 162 performance units. There are balanced scorecards and we go through those every month. It's bringing real transparency and real accountability for people who are in those roles and therefore bonuses get allotted in a transparent, objective, fair way over the course of a year, and then some of that gets deferred,\" Thorburn says.\nPwC's Williams warns that despite the current sense of euphoria, this time next year we may well be sorry for what we wished for.\n\"In a year people might suddenly go, 'hang on, we've lost something here', I am very nervous about that,\" he says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T10:06:06.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
