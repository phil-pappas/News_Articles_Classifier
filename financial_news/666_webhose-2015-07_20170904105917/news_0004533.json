An increasing supply of refined products, especially diesel fuel being offered by Saudi Arabia, helped push US ultra-low diesel futures to multi-month lows intraday, adding to bearish concerns about prices in the oil futures complex.\nBrent September crude was down 30 cents at $56.80 a barrel at 11.29am EDT (3.29pm GMT), having swung from $56.45 to $57.44.\nUS August crude was down 47 cents at $50.42.
