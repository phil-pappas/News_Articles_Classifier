More China passes US in race for FDI in R&D \nSo when Mr Levy announced last week he was backpedalling on one of his key promises — to quickly restore Brazil’s sinking public finances to good health — markets reacted with surprise. \nInstead of a primary fiscal surplus — the budget balance before interest payments — of 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product for 2015, Mr Levy said he would now deliver something closer to zero and even left open the possibility it could turn into a deficit. \nThe announcement drove Brazil’s currency, the real, to a 12-year low against the dollar the following day and knocked 2.18 per cent off the benchmark Ibovespa stock index amid speculation over whether Brazil can maintain its investment grade rating. \n“I don’t think there were a lot of people who were considering a primary deficit as a possibility this year,” said João Pedro Ribeiro, an economist with Nomura. \nMr Levy’s struggle to meet the budget targets comes as Brazil is sinking into what is set to be its worst recession in decades. \nUnemployment and inflation are rising and economists are downgrading their estimates for growth, with some forecasting a contraction as large as 2.5 per cent this year. \nLeft-leaning President Dilma Rousseff is struggling with record-low approval ratings, a restive congress and a huge corruption scandal at state-owned oil company Petrobras . \nThe tough environment means few analysts blame Mr Levy for the change in the budget targets or question his resolve. Yet most were shocked at the scale of the revisions. \n“He remains very credible and by all accounts very committed to do the best he can,” said Alberto Ramos, economist with Goldman Sachs. “But it [the revisions] shows the difficulty in actually turning around the fiscal picture.” FT View", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T13:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T19:02:52.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
