(While there was a marketing range, CHC was focused on an issue price of $9.25 a share – the mid point.) \nThere were additional orders but the buyers were only interested in participating at lower prices. Their reasoning: while they waited for the sector to recover, which may occur after further declines, they should receive a higher yield. (The planned yield was in the 5.2 per cent range.) That approach differs from what occurred earlier in the year when strong institutional interest meant a number of IPOs were either upsized or issued at higher prices. Related Sleep Country Canada said to seek about $250 million in IPO \nIn CHC’s case, rather than accommodate the buyers’ wish for a higher yield, it opted to pull the deal and consider a return to the IPO market at a later date. \nCHC did not have a lot of options given that part of the proceeds were to be used to acquire certain properties from third party sellers. And the sellers had no reason to cut the agreed prices. The sellers simply want the highest prices. If, on the other hand, CHC owned the properties that were part of the offering, then it presumably would have had more flexibility. \nIn a statement CHC said that it’s “reviewing various strategic alternatives for completing some of the acquisitions,” and agreed to provide updates as developments unfold. \nCHC’s offering was one of two real estate related IPOs in the market. The other is Automotive Properties Real Estate Investment Trust, which is seeking $75 million. That REIT, sponsored by the Dilawari Group, wants to consolidate automotive dealership properties. It currently owns 26 such properties in four provinces. \nXXX \nThe heft of the institutions in deciding prices was also at work in the recent IPO from Mogo Finance Technology. That offering raised $50 million from the sale of five million shares at $10 a piece. \nAt $10 a share the price was below the original range of $11-$13 a share. At the time Mogo said that while it could have closed the deal in the original range, it lowered the price because “there were a couple of key institutions that we wanted to get in the deal. We were happy to do that and we think that was the right long move,” it said. \nWhile it’s still early days, some of those institutions are probably regretting that they wanted in on the deal: the shares closed Wednesday at $7.50. \nFinancial Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T00:26:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
