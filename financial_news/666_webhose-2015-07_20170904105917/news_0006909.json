Belka will comment on the decision at 4 p.m. in Warsaw.\nPolicy makers are drawing a curtain on a three-year period of falling borrowing costs on the expectation that an economic upswing will beat forecasts and help consumer prices recover from their longest bout of deflation. As Greece prepares for last-ditch talks with creditors to avoid financial collapse, investors are selling eastern European assets including the zloty, the region’s most-liquid currency.\n“The focus of the news conference after the decision will be on potential market volatility stemming from the situation abroad,” Maciej Reluga, chief economist at Bank Zachodni WBK SA, said in a research note on Wednesday. “Belka may repeat his warning that the central bank stands ready to intervene on the currency market to smooth exchange-rate gyrations.”\nThe zloty has weakened 5.5 percent versus the euro since hitting its 2015 high in April, trading at 4.2256 after the rate decision. The yield of the government’s 10-year bond fell 5 basis points to 3.07 percent.\nEconomic Acceleration The European Union’s largest eastern economy, which last year doubled its pace of growth to 3.4 percent, will accelerate to 4 percent in the fourth quarter, according to the median of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.\nConsumer demand will remain the main driver of the expansion, with household incomes benefiting from falling prices and job gains that pushed unemployment to 10.4 percent in June, the lowest since January 2009. Consumer confidence reached its highest in almost seven years, according to the Central Statistical Office.\nPolish deflation eased in May as prices fell 0.9 percent from a year earlier after a 1.1 percent drop in April. Consumer prices will drop an average of 0.5 percent for the full year, the central bank estimates.\nOn Wednesday, policy makers are set to receive the latest staff projections, which will probably show milder deflation in 2015, a slightly faster pace of price growth in the next two years and economic gains hovering near 3.5 percent in that period, according to central banker Adam Glapinski.\nThe outlook won’t carry a “signal for any substantial change in monetary policy,” Glapinski said in an interview last month. The projections will be published next week.\n“It does not make sense for the central bank to undertake further policy easing,” Anisha Arora, a London-based economist at 4cast, said in a note on Tuesday. “The dynamics of inflation and growth into early 2016 support extended stable, accommodative policy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T13:35:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
