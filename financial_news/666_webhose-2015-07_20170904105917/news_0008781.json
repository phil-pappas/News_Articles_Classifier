Diageo is working to respond fully to the SEC’s requests for information in this matter.” \nThe SEC declined to comment on the allegations, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal . \nThe US is a key market for Diageo, making up a third of its $17.6bn (£11.3bn) sales and 45pc of operating profits. It holds around 20pc of North America’s spirits market, according to industry tracker Impact Databank. \nIn April, the group, which has been the subject of takeover speculation , said net sales fell 0.7pc in its third quarter on flagging global demand and the after-effects of a weak economic recovery. \nJorge Paulo Lemann, who founded private equity firm 3G Capital (Other OTC: CGHC - news ) and owns a stake in Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest brewer, has reportedly been eying a bid for Diageo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T03:36:14.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
