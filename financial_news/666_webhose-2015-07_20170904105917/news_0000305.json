At the same time, Abe’s hand picked central bank chief, Haruhiko Kuroda, is pumping money into the economy to rekindle inflation that Japan needs for growth.\nTapering before April 2017 “is a bit hard to imagine,” said Honda. “The BOJ will have to judge whether it can taper by looking at the degree of deceleration after the tax hike. When the economy is slowing, it can’t start tapering.”\nAn increase in the tax from 5 percent to 8 percent in April last year sparked two quarters of economic contraction, even after Abe unveiled a 5.5 trillion yen stimulus package in December 2013. The next planned move would take the levy to 10 percent\nHonda was instrumental in persuading Abe last year to postpone the next hike by 18 months to April 2017.\nTaper Debate While some private economists including those at Nomura Holdings Inc. predict that tapering of monetary stimulus could begin next year, Kuroda sees the BOJ’s 2 percent inflation target as distant as mid 2016.\n“The BOJ must make inflation stable,” said Honda,. “It has to discern if 2 percent inflation can be maintained, and then in principle they can begin tapering.”\nHonda added that there is no need for the BOJ to bolster stimulus now, with a recovery on track. While he says it’s unlikely, if inflation isn’t on the road to 2 percent by September or October this year, the central bank may have to consider the option.\nAny economic package the Abe government compiles will probably be designed to cut the impact of the levy hike in half for households, Honda said.\nThe yen, which has depreciated by about 30 percent since Abe came to office, is at a comfortable level, Honda said.\n“The yen between 120-125 is no problem at all,” according to Honda.\nIt traded at 122.05 per dollar as of 10:35 a.m. in Tokyo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T05:10:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
