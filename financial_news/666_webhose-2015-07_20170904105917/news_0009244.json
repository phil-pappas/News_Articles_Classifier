Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \nIn the discussion that follows, \"Mattel\" refers to Mattel, Inc. and/or one or more of its family of companies. \nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial information and related notes that appear in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Mattel's business is seasonal, with consumers making a large percentage of all toy purchases during the traditional holiday season; therefore, results of operations are comparable only with corresponding periods. \nThe following discussion also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"Regulation G\") to supplement the financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed below include gross sales, adjusted gross margin, adjusted other selling and administrative expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted earnings (loss) per share, and constant currency. Mattel uses these metrics to analyze its continuing operations and to monitor, assess, and identify meaningful trends in its operating and financial performance. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP financial measures. Refer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a more detailed discussion, including reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. \nFactors That May Affect Future Results \n(Cautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) \nMattel is including this Cautionary Statement to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \"Act\") for forward-looking statements.

While it is still early in the turnaround, the second quarter financial results were generally in line with management's expectations. Mattel's emphasis continues to be on rebuilding its culture to embrace brand building, creativity, and innovation, and stabilizing and growing its business. Additionally, Mattel continues to focus on broadening its innovation and invention pipeline, increasing shelf space productivity, and improving inventory levels. Management is also encouraged by its cost improvement initiatives where progress has been made in Mattel's global supply chain and other selling and administrative expenses.

The increase in gross sales in constant currency was due to higher sales of Wheels and Core Fisher-Price products, partially offset by lower sales of Entertainment, Barbie, and Other Girls products. Of the 26% increase in Wheels gross sales in constant currency, 25% was due to higher sales of Hot Wheels products.

Of the 16% decrease in Entertainment gross sales in constant currency, 18% was due to lower sales of Disney Planes products.

Of the 6% decrease in Other Girls gross sales in constant currency, 17% was due to lower sales of Monster High products, partially offset by higher sales of Disney Princess products of 9%.

Adjusted gross margin increased to 47.9% in the second quarter of 2015 from 47.2% in the second quarter of 2014.
