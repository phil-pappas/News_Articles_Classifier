President Dilma Rousseff is confronting opposition in Congress to her efforts to shrink spending and boost revenue as an unprecedented corruption investigation makes her increasingly unpopular with voters.\n“Primary balance projections have fallen, growth continues to slow, political woes continue and corruption scandals linger,” Christian Lawrence, a foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank Nederland in New York, said in an e-mailed response to questions.\nThe real dropped 1.8 percent to 3.2815 per dollar at 10 a.m. in Sao Paulo, the weakest level on a closing basis since March 19. The drop was the biggest among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Swap rates climbed 0.15 percentage point to 13.48 percent on the contract maturing in January 2017.\nThe real extended its decline this year to 19 percent, the worst performance among the world’s 31 major currencies. In addition to budget turmoil and a declining economy, the nation is also struggling with above-target inflation despite increases in interest rates, the prospect of reduced demand for its exports in China and an expected increase in U.S. interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\nApproval Rating The economic downturn has driven Rousseff’s approval rating to a record low, making it increasingly difficult to impose austerity bills in Congress. Lawmakers went on recess last week without voting on legislation that would raise revenue by creating incentives for Brazilians to pay a tax and repatriate money. The Senate delayed voting on a proposal to boost corporate sales taxes.\nStandard & Poor’s in March last year cut Brazil’s credit rating to one level above junk. Moody’s Investors Service followed six months later by lowering its outlook on its rating, the second-lowest investment grade. Analysts from Moody’s visited central bankers last week.\nBoth ratings companies said deteriorating fiscal accounts and faltering growth motivated their decisions. Since then, Brazil’s fortunes have worsened. The 12-month deficit before payments on interest widened to 0.7 percent of GDP in May, while the Budget Ministry on Wednesday said the economy will contract 1.49 percent in 2015 -- more than previously forecast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:32:34.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
