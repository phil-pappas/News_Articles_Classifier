In any case, markets are in for a period of uncertainty and protracted negotiation,\" said Bank of New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) Zealand currency strategist Raiko Shareef. \nThe 'No' vote triggered a rush to safety with the yen being the main beneficiary, with the euro down 1.6 percent against the yen to 134.24 yen, while the U.S. dollar traded at 121.94 yen from 122.80 on Friday. \nThe New Zealand and Australian dollars, often taken as a proxy for risk appetite, also trimmed early losses, but the kiwi was down 0.5 percent, just above a five-year low at $0.6645, while the Aussie was down 0.5 percent at $0.7473, just above a six-year low.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T00:50:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
