The founder of the Reform party, the Conservative party's forerunner, was once a vocal opponent of measures to curb climate change.\nNow he's a tree hugger -- it seems -- speaking publicly about how conservative political values align with environmental conservation.\nMCT\nTMS \n\nIt's quite a shift considering the current Conservative government is a stalwart defender of oil sands development, has been accused of ignoring its own scientists' findings on climate change and generally thinks less is more when it comes to environmental regulation. Yet Manning's change in stripes also marks a broader shift among the business-minded.\nToday, companies regularly consider their environmental and social footprint and how missteps in these areas can affect the bottom line. For investors, it's also a game-changer.\nNow more than ever, environmentally and socially conscientious investing is not merely a quaint, rose-coloured filter espoused by a few well-intentioned folks. Nor is it a hindrance for performance either.\nHaving a greener, kinder portfolio is easier and more financially prudent than it's ever been. And a bevy of studies in recent years back up the performance prowess of what is now referred to as 'Responsible investment,\" says Cheryl Crowe with Assiniboine Credit Union, one of Canada's leading investment advisers in this field.\n\"Responsible investments have increased from $600 billion to over $1 trillion in only two years,\" says Crowe, referring to data collected by the Canadian-based Responsible Investment Association.\nThat's a 68 per cent increase, and more tellingly, it's the industry pros -- pension funds and other institutional investors -- making up the lion's share of the money flowing into responsible investment portfolios.\nYet retail investors -- the little guy and gal -- are going green too in higher numbers than ever with mutual fund purchases up more than 52 per cent to $6.64 billion in Canada.\n\"Clearly more and more people are looking for these choices -- both from a value prospective and a risk mitigation strategy for institutional pools,\" Crowe says.\nEven the fact \"responsible investing\" has replaced the former term \"socially responsible investing\" or \"SRI\" for short speaks to the growth in the breadth of conscientious investment styles.\n\"Responsible Investment is a term used to describe investments that integrate environmental, social and governance -- ESG -- criteria, as well as financial analysis, in the selection and management of the investments.\"\nIt can also involve negative screening of stocks -- like excluding cigarette companies -- or shareholder engagement, where investors come together to vote at shareholder annual general meetings to force companies to change their ways. Others are going further out on the spectrum with impact investing that generates both financial and social and environmental returns--like investing in local cooperatives.\n\"Another growing trend that I am also seeing is an exclusionary screen from mining, oil and gas,\" Crowe says. \"This can be quite difficult to do in the Canadian marketplace as over 80 per cent of the Toronto Stock Exchange is made up of these three sectors.\"\nThat said, investors can now find responsible investment mutual funds that are globally-based portfolios that exclude companies directly involved in fossil fuel production, Crowe adds.\nAmong the growing number of options is a new specialized fund, recently launched in Alberta and B.C. by Wolverton Securities, that excludes companies directly involved in oil and gas.\nRun by another well-known environmentally conscious investment expert, Stephen Whipp, it's in part a reflection of a growing demand from investors wanting avoid firms directly involved in climate change.\nBut it also represents another view of the industry -- that oil is a dead asset.\n\"It is a dying industry. Will it be dead tomorrow? No,\" says the Victoria-based certified financial planner with Stephen Whipp Financial. \"Will we ever stop using it? Probably not in my lifetime.\"\nBut for long-term investors, it may pay dividends -- literally -- to be on the right side of history.\nInstitutional investors are slowly heading in that direction already.\n\"Norway's $850-billion US sovereign fund has divested from coal mining, oils sands and fossil fuel companies,\" Crowe says. \"Rockefeller Brothers Fund worth $860 million US has recently announced that it would exit its fossil fuels investments.\"\nCloser to home, professors at many major universities are urging their institutions' endowment funds to divest from fossil fuels.\nInvestment adviser Patti Dolan, a responsible investment specialist based in Calgary, takes a different tact, looking for responsible firms involved in oil and gas production that are also expanding their renewable energy capacity.\n\"Many oil and gas companies have been looking at this for a very long time,\" says the certified financial planner with Dolan Wealth Management--Raymond James.\n\"That's why Suncor and Enbridge have large renewable sides to their business.\"\nMore broadly, corporations are increasingly attuned to environmental and social justice issues than they were a decade ago.\n\"It's become entrenched in how they do business,\" Dolan says.\nOf course, a growing interest in responsible practices is one thing, but results are quite another.\nYet responsible investment strategies do hold up. A 2012 Deutsche Bank Climate Change Advisors analysis report found 85 per cent of comparative studies show a positive correlation between higher than average performance and ESG strategies.\nEven an argument can now be made that excluding fossil fuels leads to better performance.\n\"Is there a penalty to do this? The answer is no--at least not in the last five years,\" Crowe says.\nShe points to the performance of an index that excludes fossil fuel producers -- FTSE Developed ex Fossil Fuels -- compared with that of a similar global index -- FTSE Developed Index -- that includes the firms involved in the fossil fuel industry.\nIn four out of the last five years, the index excluding fossil fuels has outperformed its fossilized counterpart.\nMoreover, investors now have more choice including mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and a growing number of individuals stocks, such as renewable power companies that own portfolios of solar, wind and hydroelectric assets.\nEven the advisory industry is coming around, Whipp says.\n\"One of the issues I used to run into was that other colleagues would 'pooh-pooh' what we're doing.\"\nResponsible investing is all fine and good, they'd tell him, but it handcuffs the ability to get the best return possible for clients.\nThat's just no longer the case, he says.\n\"Institutional investors wouldn't be doing this unless they believed that it worked and it started to prove itself.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T12:08:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
