That means traders need to anticipate the prospect of both outcomes. A “yes” vote is likely to spark a rally in bonds from Europe’s most indebted nations and a selloff in its safest assets, while a “no” vote may prompt the opposite, according to Commerzbank AG.\nThat may spell opportunity for some investors, while others may be tempted to close out positions on Friday and sit out the turmoil entirely.\n“The prediction of the initial market reaction to the referendum is obvious: risk-off on ‘no’ and risk-on on ‘yes’,” Christoph Rieger, head of fixed-income strategy at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, wrote in a note published Friday. “As was the case after last weekend, trading this binary outcome is difficult though, with an excessive reaction already seen at the opening. We therefore stick with our suggestion from last week to fade the initial market reaction.”\nGerman bunds, the euro area’s benchmark sovereign securities, have risen since Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras last week called Sunday’s referendum, while Spanish and Italian bonds have declined. Even so, contagion has thus far been limited on optimism the European Central Bank would be able to contain any fallout from the crisis.\nGerman Yields German 10-year bund yields were at 0.84 percent as of 7:29 a.m. London time on Friday, down from 0.92 percent at the end of last week. The price of the 0.5 percent securities due in February 2025 was at 96.88 percent of face value.\nSpanish 10-year bond yields were at 2.30 percent on Thursday. While that’s 19 basis points, or 0.19 percentage point, higher this week, it’s down from as much as 2.60 percent in the first hour of trading on Monday.\nAll week, Greece’s banks have been shut and capital controls imposed. The stock market has also been closed and the Bank of Greece halted dealing of government bonds on its electronic trading platform. Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said he would quit his role if voters didn’t support him on Sunday.\nThe poll commissioned by Bloomberg showed 43 percent intend to vote “no” to reject the austerity demanded by creditors in exchange for financial aid; 42.5 percent back a “yes” to accept the conditions, the survey of 1,042 people by the University of Macedonia Research Institute of Applied Social and Economic Studies showed. The margin of error was 3 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:05:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
