Greece to vote on second bailout bill in new test for Tsipras By Katy Lee | AFP â€“ 30 minutes ago View Photo \n\nPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Wednesday faced a new test of his authority in parliament, where lawmakers were to vote on a second batch of reforms to help unlock a huge new bailout for Greece's stricken economy. \nThe embattled premier suffered a major rebellion by MPs in his radical-left party Syriza last week during a first vote on the reforms demanded by Athens' international creditors. \nTsipras had to rely on opposition MPs to pass the law, which approved sweeping changes to debt-crippled Greece's taxes, pensions and labour rules, a key condition for opening talks on a bailout worth up to 86 billion euros ($93 billion) over three years. \nThe second bill covers civil justice reforms, a bank deposit protection scheme, and measures to shore up the liquidity of the nation's banks, which reopened only Monday after a three-week closure that was imposed to avert a run on banks and a catastrophic collapse of Greece's financial system. \nTsipras is expected to win Wednesday's vote comfortably after opposition parties said they would back it, but analysts say the debate will show whether the prime minister can avoid another deep split within his own party and head off the risk of early elections after only six months in power. \nThe government received a boost Tuesday when Standard & Poor's raised its credit rating on Greece by two notches to CCC+ from CCC-, still in junk territory but a step in the right direction. \nOn Wednesday Tsipras met with executives from the banks, which have seen some 40 billion euros withdrawn since December by customers anxious over the safety of their cash -- seriously undermining the banks' ability to function normally. \n\"The priority right now is to normalise the (financial) system, but at the same time to protect low-income citizens,\" state news agency ANA quoted Tsipras as saying. \n- 'Urgent situation' - \nParliamentary committees were debating the second bailout bill on Wednesday ahead of a full sitting of the 300 lawmakers late in the afternoon with a vote expected around midnight (2200 GMT). \nJustice Minister Nikos Paraskevopoulos said he would back the legislation, despite having reservations over its changes to the justice system. \"The country is facing an urgent situation,\" he said. \"I do not want to contribute to an eventual default.\" \nCivil servants' union ADEDY and the communist-affiliated PAME union were set to stage protests during the emergency debate. When the more controversial reforms were passed last week, angry anti-austerity protesters clashed with police outside parliament, hurling petrol bombs. \nFor Tsipras, who came to power on an anti-austerity ticket, the bailout deal has been hard to swallow -- but he insisted at a meeting with colleagues on Tuesday that there was \"no alternative solution\". \nHe reshuffled his cabinet last week, having sacked three ministers for voting against the first bailout bill. \nVassiliki Georgiadis, a political science professor at Athens' Panteion University, said the split within Syriza was between hard-left MPs -- \"some of whom have spoken of a Greek exit from the eurozone as the only solution\" -- and those more sympathetic to Tsipras's arguments. \nShe added that it would be \"difficult\" for the 40-year-old premier to continue in office if he is forced to rely on opposition MPs to get laws passed. \nGovernment spokeswoman Olga Gerovassili said Monday that elections would not be \"useful at the moment\", and the government had \"no intention\" of calling early polls. \nBut while most Syriza MPs backed the government in the first vote last week, anger has mounted against the deal among the party's more radical rank-and-file members. \nGerovassili said negotiations with Greece's creditors -- the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- would resume immediately after Wednesday's vote. \nThe EU's Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said Wednesday that Greece and its creditors aim to finalise the deal by mid-August. \nBoth sides are under huge pressure to finalise the terms of the rescue before August 20, when Greece owes the ECB a loan repayment of 3.2 billion euros ($3.5 billion) it cannot afford.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T18:05:46.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
