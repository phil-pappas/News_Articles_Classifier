ADVERTISEMENT Any readings above 50 signal expansion. \nThe index is a survey of a wide variety of businesses. The services sector employs 90 percent of all workers, including those at restaurants, hotels and retailers. \nAn increase in business activity and new orders helped boost performance despite a slow down in hiring. \nBusiness activity increased to 61.5 from 59.5 while new orders rose to 58.3 from 57.9 in May. \nMeanwhile, employers pulled back on hiring with the index falling to 52.7 last month from 55.3 in May. \nWhether that is a sign that the sector will see a broader slow down in hiring remains to be seen. \nOn Thursday, the government reported that employers had added 223,000 jobs in June, while the unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent. \nThe economy has added 12.8 million private-sector jobs over a record-high 64 straight months. \nThe economy contracted at a 0.2 percentage point annual rate in the first three months of the year, but economists are expecting an acceleration of upward of 3 percentage points in the April-June period.
