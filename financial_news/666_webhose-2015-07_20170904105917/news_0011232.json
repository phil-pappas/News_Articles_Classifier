During this past quarter, however, oil prices and the dollar have been fairly stable, meaning analysts&apos; earnings per share estimates (EPS) may have hit bottom and it&apos;s more likely that earnings come in above analysts&apos; estimates, at least according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nIn new research from Savita Subramanian, BofAML strategist, the worst of the cuts to earnings estimates is likely behind us.\nIn her note, she says that estimates for the second quarter have fallen by just two percent since April, or just half the amount she typically sees. Here are two charts highlighting her points:\nThe first one shows that the aggregate EPS estimate for all the companies in the S&P 500 seems to have stabilized since late April.\nThe second chart underscores the trend in earnings estimates in the three months leading up to earnings season. As you can see, there is a huge difference in the revisions for the first quarter of this year and the second quarter.\nSo, with that in mind, which sectors should you own? Here are Subramanian&apos;s recommendations:\nEach quarter we have ranked sectors by these measures, and for 2Q15 earnings season we found that that healthcare screens as most attractive, while materials screens as least attractive.\nHealthcare has now screened as the most attractive sector the last three quarters, and has continued to surprise to the upside.", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iM0ZjsEyXk8E/v1/460x260.png\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iLvbg1HQ8hxM/v1/460x260.png\\"], "published": "2015-07-08T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T15:27:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
