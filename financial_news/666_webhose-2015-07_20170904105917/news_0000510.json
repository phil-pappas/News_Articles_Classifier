Google's market capitalisation, already around $US403 billion ($A544 billion), rose some $US65 billion on Friday to finish at $US468.3 billion, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. \nGoogle's Class A stock traded above $US700 for the first time on Friday since the company conducted a stock split last spring. The combined gains include Google Inc.'s Class A and non-voting Class C shares. \nGoogle's results had fallen short of Wall Street estimates for six straight quarters, but the Mountain View, California-based company reported a bigger-than-expected profit on Thursday. \nInvestors were also pleased that the search engine giant seems serious about cutting down on expenses, particularly on costly \"moonshot\" projects. \nNot adjusting for inflation, the current record holder is Apple. Apple Inc.'s market cap rose $US46.4 billion in value on April 25, 2012, after a better-than-expected first-quarter report. \nInvestors had expected weak iPhone sales that quarter because Apple was getting ready to launch the iPhone 5. Instead, Apple said its net income doubled and it sold 35 million iPhones that quarter, almost double its total from the year-ago quarter. \nGoogle's Class A shares gained $US97.84, or 16.3 per cent, to close at $US699.62. Google's Class C shares rose 16.1 per cent to $US672.93. @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Google shares gain a record $65bn in value AAP \nGoogle is already one of the largest companies in the world, and has just made one of the largest stock market â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T09:37:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
