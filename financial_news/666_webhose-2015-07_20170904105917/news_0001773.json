Andrew Campbell Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow That's it. I'm done. I'm going back to New Zealand.\nI do not want to live in a banana republic that gets into such a huff when the Speaker of the House flies in a helicopter , as is surely her right.\nNo wonder Tony Shepherd , Martin Parkinson and the gang have been in a such a state about the future of the country.\nSure, Shep's crew were mostly talking about the stalling of economic reform – but, in a broader sense, doesn't that include Bronwyn Bishop 's right to get her Vin Diesel on and fly in a chopper? Just a bit?\nIllustration: Rod Clement If I was a member of the Liberal Party, I would be calling Brian Loughnane and asking him to take me off the books. Pronto.\nSo let's get this straight – a senior NSW Liberal brought a bit of style to a party fundraising event at a golf club in Geelong, and this is how they treat her? Honestly, the Liberal Party should cough up the $5227. It sounds like a bargain to me.\nWhat doesn't pass the \" sniff test \" – to pinch a mangled, stolen Alan Jones phrase – is the treatment of the 72-year-old centre-right stalwart Bronnie by the NSW moderate leader (and Treasurer) Joe Hockey . What is wrong with that guy?\nSince when does that litigious , cigar-chomping , Canberra landlord get to give lectures about what's \"not a good look\" for the government? Not a good look is his trademark. Leave Bronnie alone.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/treasurer-joe-hockey-and-finance-minister-mathias-cormann-pictured-smoking-cigars-ahead-of-tough-budget-20140509-zr8i3.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/treasurer-joe-hockeys-impressive-housing-portfolio-20150610-ghkqzd.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/federal-treasurer-joe-hockey-and-fairfax-media-at-loggerheads-over-costs-of-defamation-battle-20150714-giaup9.html", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow"], "published": "2015-07-16T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:06:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
