PUBLISHED: 14:03, Fri, Jul 3, 2015 | UPDATED: 19:22, Fri, Jul 3, 2015 GETTY George Osborne could reveal a cut to pension perks in the Budget \nThe Chancellor is to unleash around £12billion worth of spending cuts that were promised as part of the Conservative manifesto - and retirement perks are in the firing line.Yesterday, a briefing paper on pension taxation was posted on the parliament website, which experts said increased the odds that the government is to make some brutal changes. The Government is widely expected to cut relief available to the highest earners to £10,000 from £40,000 a year on a sliding scale.But this could be just the tip of the iceberg, as Britain's ageing population and the Government guarantees on state pensions is putting the UK on track to spend more on welfare by 2019.Experts fear that the tax relief on the 25 per cent lump sum of pension savings that can be taken from the age of 55 could be reduced or dropped altogether. Some critics also think that the government could move to a flat-rate of pension tax-relief of 30 per cent to make the system easier to understand.Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"The UK’s pension system is still very much a work in progress and with so many radical changes already underway, further reform is inevitable. \"For the sake of all investors, young and old, modest or wealthy, we would like to see a system of pension taxation which encourages saving and investing and which rewards people for taking responsibility for their own retirement. \"We need to see a stable, long-term settlement which helps the UK to build good levels of retirement savings.“Our great concern is that the government will simply cap tax breaks for higher earners. This would do nothing for the vast majority of the population except make the pension system marginally more complicated than it already is.”The change would cost someone earning £210,000 or more £13,500 in lost tax relief, according to Hargreaves Lansdown.Experts have urged those who could be affected to act now while the perk is still available.

There are also suggestions that there could be a ban on salary sacrifice or a cut to the National Insurance relief granted to employers on pension contributions. Mr McPail added: “Curbing salary sacrifice or restricting employer NI relief could quickly raise hundreds of millions or even billions of pounds. \"For employers and pension scheme members, any restriction on their retirement savings would be unwelcome news.”The Chancellor is determined to pay off Britain's huge debt pile, which has now reached more than £1.5trillion . As well as pension changes, Mr Osborne is set to cut child tax credits back to the levels seen in 2003/4 to save the nation's coffers £5billion and incentivise parents to work.At the same time, Whitehall departments are set to see further budgets slashed as Mr Osborne desperately searches for the savings that he needs to balance the books.The Chancellor has promised not to hike income tax, VAT or national insurance. Mr Osborne also needs to deliver on election promises that were made.These include raising the income tax personal allowance to £12,500, meaning no tax is paid on earnings below that amount, and an increase to the 40 per cent tax threshold from £42,385 to £50,000.There were further pledges that inheritance tax would be reduced, cash help provided for first-time buyers and a freeze announced on rail fares and TV licence fees. But it could be that these measures, which would cut tax income for the treasury, are not introduced for another year or so.
