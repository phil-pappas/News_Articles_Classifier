In other words, we may not tell you (when it will commence), you will just see it,” Nigeria’s military spokesman Major General Chris Olukolade said.\n“The mission has been sectorised, various sector commanders have been briefed, the briefing is ongoing at different levels… the aspect of the Nigerian force that will be part of the Multinational Joint Task Force has been designated,” Olukolade added.\n 29, 2015 10:07 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T23:39:44.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
