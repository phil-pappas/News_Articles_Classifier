So-called “Club Med corners” will be set up in Thomas Cook travel agencies and there will also be a section of the tour operator’s website that is dedicated to the French resorts business. \nClub Med hopes that by tapping into Thomas Cook’s European sales network it will gain more customers in countries including the UK, Germany, Russia, Poland and the Czech Republic. \nThe partnership also brings Thomas Cook even closer to Fosun, which bought Club Med for €939m in February and became one of the biggest shareholders in the British company the following month. \nThomas Cook is forging close relationships in China \nStrengthening the relationship with Club Med is one of three initiatives that Thomas Cook is pursuing with the Chinese giant, which was co-founded by Guo Guangchang, an entrepreneur known as the Warren Buffett of the East . They are also setting up a €500m investment fund to buy hotels that would be managed by the FTSE 250 business, and last month established a joint venture in China to take advantage of the country’s fast-growing and lucrative market for domestic and international travel. \nInvestors are expecting a further update on the Fosun partnership when Thomas Cook posts third-quarter numbers next Thursday. The tour operator is also likely to estimate the size of the hit it has taken from the deadly terrorist attack in Tunisia last month, which resulted in travel companies scrapping trips to the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T18:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:45:48.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
