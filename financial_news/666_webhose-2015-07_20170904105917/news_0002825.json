FOXA is off 10.8% year-to-date, having closed at $34.25 Thursday, and down 3.9% over the past year. The company is scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings August 5. \nLast year, Bernstein also projected impressive upsides for Twenty-First Century Fox , however shares traded essentially flat. Now, analysts are expecting 0% downside with a roughly 25% upside, calling for fiscal year 2016 EBITDA of $7 billion. If Fox's results meet fiscal 2017 EBITDA expectations, the stock would likely hit $42 per share in a year, also boosted by expected growth in international cable, Juenger projects. \nMust Read: 10 Stocks George Soros Is Buying \nJuenger said he has \"confidence\" in the higher valuation, with political coverage and Super Bowl coverage expected to help boost affiliate fees and retransmission fees that would more than offset declines in advertising. Bernstein's advertising forecast calls for a low- to mid-single-digit declines for broadcast and low-to mid-single-digit increases for cable. TV segment ad revenues are expected to decline at low-to mid-single-digits through fiscal 2017, \"fading to low-singles in perpetuity.\" \nFurther contributing to Fox's upside potential, the media company has several equity interests that haven't been fully realized, namely its 39% stake in Sky ( SKYAY ) , its 50% investment in Endemol Shine , 33% stake in Hulu , and its 30% interest in Indian DBS company Tata Sky . \n\"All have received public valuation marks of late, most of which are not reflected in Fox's current book value of investments,\" Juenger wrote. \nRecently, Fox, which aired the FIFA Women's World Cup 2015 finals, in which the U.S. defeated Japan 5-2, scored an unexpectedly large audience in the final game July 5. More than 25 million viewers tuned in, making it the most watched soccer game, men's or women's, of all time on a U.S network. This article is commentary by an independent contributor.
