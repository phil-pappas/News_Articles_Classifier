Photo: Bloomberg\nFirst, United had a \"network connectivity\" issue that grounded all its planes for over an hour. Then, the New York Stock Exchange halted trading.\nThe Wall Street Journal's website also went down in the flurry of apparent technical problems that paralysed parts of the business world on Wednesday.\nThe NYSE glitch, which led to the suspension of trading for more than three hours, is the biggest outage to strike a US financial market in nearly two years, unnerving investors already rattled by the meltdown in Chinese stocks.\n(2 of 3) We chose to suspend trading on NYSE to avoid problems arising from our technical issue.\nâ€” NYSE (@NYSE) July 8, 2015 The exchange said the halt, which occurred shortly after 11.30am EDT, was not the result of a cyberattack. Other exchanges were trading normally.\n\"It's not a good day, and I don't feel good for our customers who are having to deal with the fallout,\" NYSE President Thomas Farley told CNBC.\nThe exchange also said on Twitter: \"The issue we are experiencing is an internal technical issue and is not the result of a cyber breach.\"\nThe exchange had hoped to reopen by 3pm, Mr Farley said. In the end, trading resumed late Wednesday afternoon, almost four hours after the shutdown began, less than an hour before the 4 pm closing bell.\nMajor problem Much of the trading on the NYSE happens at the end of the day, when portfolio managers put in orders designed to occur at the exact market close to ensure end-of-day pricing.\nThe NYSE accounts for more than 60 percent of S&P 500 volume at the close of the market, according to Credit Suisse analyst Ana Avramovic. Most of this is at the \"market-on-close,\" when those orders are processed for funds and institutions.\n\"That could be a major problem,\" said Peter Costa, president at Empire Executions, who trades on the NYSE floor. \"If you don't have all the orders on that marketplace on the close, the pricing on the close would be definitely not accurate.\"\nIn November 2012, a problem with a computer server forced NYSE to suspend trading in more than 200 securities, and there were no closing auctions in the affected stocks listed on the exchange. To solve the problem, it used official closing prices from other exchanges.\nThe US market was down more than 1 percent on Wednesday, as investors continue to focus on turmoil in China and Greece's debt crisis.\nUnited flights grounded Earlier on Wednesday, United Airlines flights were grounded after a router issue degraded connectivity in the airline's networks.\nThe computer glitch grounded many United flights around the US for nearly two hours on Wednesday morning, snarling the airline's schedule around the country and creating long lines at airports.\nThe carrier said by 10.50am that it was \"recovering\" from the \"network connectivity issue\" and was working to get passengers to their destinations.\n\"An issue with a router degraded network connectivity for various applications, causing this morning's operational disruption,\" United said in a statement to USA Today. \"We fixed the router issue, which is enabling us to restore normal functions.\"\nThe airline also waived change fees for affected customers. Additionally, United says customers scheduled to travel Wednesday could change their plans without penalty - with some restrictions - to avoid problems while the airline works to get back on schedule.\nThe airline's customers took to social media with reports of long check-in lines and delayed flights.\nThe NYSE came to a halt just as United was bringing its systems back on-line.\nNo signs of 'malicious activity' Separately, the website for The Wall Street Journal also appeared to go dark for a short time.\nThe Journal's website was partially restored later, and a message at the top of its homepage advised readers that the site was experiencing \"technical difficulties,\" and that the full site would \"return shortly.\"\nThe US Department of Homeland Security said there were no signs that the problems at NYSE and United Airlines stemmed from \"malicious activity.\"\nThe SEC said on Wednesday that it was closely monitoring the situation at NYSE.\nThe White House also said that there are no signs of malicious intent and spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama has been briefed on both the NYSE and United issues.\nReuters, McClatchy, The New York Times", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/NYSE/status/618819009211957249"], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T04:52:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
