The report provides a great snapshot about how higher education is being paid for today.\nOne of the key findings of the most recent study are that families paid 16% more on college in 2015 versus previous years. This is the most significant rise in education outlays in five years. It highlights the challenge of rising college education expenses that families across the United States are facing.\nBut what’s even more fascinating is how families are paying that higher cost.\nHow Families Are Paying For College\nDespite the headlines about the burden of student loan debt, according to Sallie Mae, only 16% of students are actually borrowing money this year to pay for college. In fact, 6 in 10 families did not borrow money at all to pay for college.\nIn fact, for the first time since 2010, parental income and assets covered the cost of college for 32% of families. Grants and scholarships was the second biggest source of funding for college, making up the cost of attendance for 30% of students.\nTo round of the funding sources, 11% of students paid their own way through school, 6% of parents borrowed themselves to pay for their child’s education, and 5% of students received money from other relatives and friends.\nFILE – In this May 20, 2013 file photo, graduates pose for photographs during commencement at Yale University in New Haven, Conn. There’s still plenty of pomp and circumstance, inspiring words from lofty speakers and tossing tassels, but today’s college graduation ceremonies include many a contemporary twist. In 1984, according to some estimates, only half of graduates had debt from college loans, averaging about $2,000. Now, two-thirds of recent bachelor’s degree recipients have outstanding student loans, with an average debt of about $27,000, according to a Pew Research Center report.
