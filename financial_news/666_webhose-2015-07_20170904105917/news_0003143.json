It is an indication of what fairly could be the case from the model that we have â€¦.' \n'BDCs may sell lower or may want to sell higher, they are at liberty but from our estimation and what we have seen in the market all this while, BDCs are likely to sell even lower than the XPI will show,' he explained. \nMr. Horsi disclosed that the Ex-Refinery Price Indicator (XPi) and Oil Traders Index (OTi) would be published on the 1st, 8th, 16th and 23rd of every month, stating that 'it will be circulated in press releases as part of market reports emanating from the CBOD. \nFormer CEO of the Volta River Authority (VRA), Dr. Charles Wereko-Brobby has also called for reduction of the prices of petroleum prices by 23 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T10:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T12:27:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
