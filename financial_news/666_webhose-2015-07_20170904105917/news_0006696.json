Third row (L-R): Robert Cobuzzi, Endo; Jeff Landry, Regeneron The launch of the inaugural Business & Finance Life Science 50 took place at the Royal College of Physicians on July 8th. \nThe Life Science 50 is a definitive guide to the top performing life science companies across Ireland, a country now a globally recognised centre of excellence in this industry. \nIreland’s life science sector has grown significantly in recent years and currently boasts a leading cluster of medical technology industries throughout the country. The infrastructure in Ireland is designed to attract world-class R&D, advanced manufacturing operations and global business services. \nAt the event, Antoinette Ryan, PwC Tax director and Pharmaceutical and Life Science lead, said: “As an economy where Life Sciences and research and development is critical for future economic prosperity, PwC’s 2015 CEO Pulse Survey revealed that over one in ten (14%) multinational CEOs said that maintaining Ireland’s status as an attractive location for innovation and R&D is important. Having an FDI created research, development and innovation (RDI) ecosystem will enhance Ireland’s standing. Ensuring our tax policy is leading edge is also necessary but is by no means sufficient. There is more work to be done on refocusing and improving our overall RDI ecosystem including further improvements to our R&D tax credit regime. Further encouragement will be required to encourage FDI companies to participate and lead innovation in growth areas through to commercialisation.” \nSpeakers at the event on May 21st included: Ian Hyland, publisher, Business & Finance ; Aidan Lynch, GSK Pharmaceuticals; and Reg Shaw, NIBRT.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T19:17:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
