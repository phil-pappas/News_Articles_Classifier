But Kevin Berg, general manager at Gladstone for Bechtel, the US contractor building all three of the Queensland LNG plants as well as Chevron's Wheatstone project in Western Australia, played down the claims.\n\"As is typical on all major projects of this scale, many closeout activities are in progress as we move closer to completion and handover of assets to our customers,\" Mr Berg said.\nIt's standard practice for parties in big infrastructure projects to set aside money for cost overruns or scope variation claims.\nWhat makes the LNG sector unique is the sheer magnitude of the sums involved.\nSeven giant LNG projects, costing about $193 billion, are due to reach completion in the next two years, a Department of Industry and Science snapshot of major resources and energy projects shows.\nLaw and accounting firms look to be the big winners of wrangles between producers, contractors and sub-contractors over liability for changes to work orders that have in some cases pushed projects billions of dollars over budget.\nOne legal source pointed to three claims each involving more than $1 billion, and others that involve several hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\"This will create a bed-load of work for those with the right expertise that will last several years,\" one legal source said.\nBig law firms Corrs Chambers Westgarth and Norton Rose Fulbright have been gearing up for the past two years in anticipation of large complex disputes arising in LNG.\nCorrs has hired two top-shelf infrastructure litigation partners, Andrew Stephenson and Michael Earwaker, and EY has raided rival Deloitte for one of its best brains in this field, Campbell Jackson.\nNorton's legal eagles – led by construction lawyer Matthew Croagh – have been embedded with clients' project teams on LNG projects in Queensland, helping them \"control costs\".\n\"This work has been substantial for us,\" Mr Croagh said.\nRon Finlay, a former managing partner of Corrs Chambers Westgarth and chief executive of Finlay Consulting, said oil and gas compared unfavourably with transport projects, where dispute resolution boards were now typical.\n\"Oil and gas has gone backwards, back to the bad old arbitration and litigation days,\" said Mr Finlay, who is also the secretary of the Australasian division of the Dispute Resolution Board Foundation.\n\"A lot of those projects are under the control of very large US EPC [engineering, procurement and construction] contractors. They like to have total control of the project and don't like other people telling them how to do their business; it's very much a client-control process.\"\nThe oil price slump, which has dragged down LNG prices, has made project proponents keener to escalate claims into disputes, as has the increased depth in the construction market in recent years because they are less worried about creating bad blood with a particular contractor, one lawyer said.\n\"Boards are becoming more willing to take the gloves off where they feel they have been wronged by a contractor,\" he said.\nMatt Fehon, a partner in McGrathNicol, which specialises in forensic accounting, said project principals and contractors were looking first to contain costs and then at how to recover them if there had been any non-compliance, scope creep or simply overcharging.\n\"That has led to a large number of matters that have been either litigated or arbitrated in the arbitration courts,\" Mr Fehon said.\nIt is believed some construction firms have forensic accountants working on a success-fee basis, using sophisticated data analytics to trawl contracts looking for inappropriately allocated costs.\nThe issue comes amid heightened concerns over construction costs in Australia, where vast investment is required for infrastructure projects and which overseas executives single out as already the most expensive country in the world for building.\nThe stretched construction market during the resources boom contributed to the problems, when producers were fiercely competing to get the \"A\" construction team but sometimes were lucky to get the \"B\" or \"C\" team, lawyers said.\n\"It was aggressive contracting in the boom times, then a focus on trying to deliver projects and get the thing done, average contract management, and then a scenario at the back end where there were overruns and contractors trying to get even more out of it because their workflow going forward was looking worse and worse,\" said one lawyer who is working on three separate disputes.\nA dispute emerging between two parties typically triggers claims further up and down the chain as all parties seek to claw back money, with potentially scores of subcontractors involved on a project such as Gorgon, or Gina Rinehart's Roy Hill iron ore venture in WA. Cases can last years as parties respond with exorbitant counter-claims, requiring a lengthy process to reach a settlement and creating a wealth of work for law and accounting firms.\nThis is driving a \"land grab\" to secure the best lawyers, barristers, arbiter panels, as well as seasoned forensic accountants with experience in the witness box.\nSeveral high-profile disputes have already hit the headlines, particularly at the ultra-complex Gorgon project. A dispute between South Africa's Murray & Roberts and dredging company Boskalis over construction of a materials offloading wharf at Gorgon was settled in mid-2014 for an undisclosed sum. AJ Lucas also suffered losses on a contract for Gorgon, while Marine & Civil fell into administration after losses on project works on Barrow Island.\nThe management of CIMIC, formerly Leighton Holdings, has declined to specify the size of claims it is negotiating but legal filings from former employees reveal that management has been pursuing $1.46 billion of claims from Chevron for work on a jetty for Gorgon.\nCIMIC and Chevron have been negotiating claims for years, with the US energy major rejecting most of the claims on alleged cost-blowouts, according to former employees.\nEarlier this year, UGL and its American partner CH2M Hill each set aside $175 million for provisional writedowns on a $550 million power plant built at the Ichthys site in Darwin. Project proponent Inpex is understood to be defending claims that the geotechnical data it supplied was inadequate.\nMonadelphous is pursuing more than $200 million in claims to recover costs associated with \"changes in scope and nature of the works\" for a jetty, ship berth and ship loader it built for Wiggins Island Coal Export Terminal together with Malaysia's Muhibbah Construction\nPressure on contract delivery teams to meet aggressive timetables agreed by their bid teams have contributed to the problems.\n\"Time equals people and resources and machinery, and there's a cost to that every day that ticks by,\" Mr Fehon said.\n\"In the case of a number of projects that could be marine vessels that run into the tens of millions for each month or period you have them on hire.\"\nA substantial portion of LNG-related disputes that reach formal arbitration will be dealt with in the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, which is chaired by an Australian, Michael Pryles. Domestic law firms are frantically trying to capture construction and engineering litigation work before it goes overseas.\nMr Finlay said transport projects had \"seen the light\" in their use of dispute resolution boards, which have become usual on government road and rail projects in Queensland and NSW.\nLindsay LeCompte, executive director of the Australian Constructors Association, said dispute resolution boards came at a cost because the parties had to pay for the experts.\n\"But at the end of the day, it's not a cost that's significant,\" he said, adding that spending a few hundred thousand dollars on experts to prevent a $1 billion contract blowing out 5 or 10 per cent above budget was worthwhile.", "external_links": ["http://www.industry.gov.au/Office-of-the-Chief-Economist/Publications/Pages/Resources-and-energy-major-projects.aspx"], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T01:12:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
