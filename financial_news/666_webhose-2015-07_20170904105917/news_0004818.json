But too fast a deceleration in investment can be harmful to overall growth. \nThey have been taking more aggressive preemptive steps with the People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988.HK - news ) (PBoC), the central bank, cutting benchmark interest rates four times since November and reducing bank reserve requirements in a bid to boost lending. \nSuch measures can take time to affect growth. \n- 'Upside risk' - \nThe NBS also said industrial output, which measures production at factories, workshops and mines, rose 6.8 percent year-on-year in June, accelerating from May's 6.1 percent. \nIt was ahead of a median forecast for 6.0 percent expansion in a survey of economists by Bloomberg News. \nRetail sales, a key indicator of consumer spending, increased 10.6 percent last month from the year before, the NBS said, a faster pace than May's 10.1 percent. \nIt also beat the Bloomberg News survey's median 10.2 percent. \nAnd fixed asset investment, a measure of government spending on infrastructure, expanded 11.4 percent in January-June year-on-year, the same as for the first five months of the year and remaining at its lowest since 2000. \nIn the light of the figures Nomura economist Zhao Yang emphasised an \"upside risk to our annual forecast of GDP growth for 2015\" of 6.8 percent. \nHe cautioned however, that \"headwinds in the economy\" were \"still strong\" and authorities were likely to further ease monetary policy in the form of another interest rate cut and further reduction in bank reserve requirements. \nChaotic trading on the country's key stock markets in recent weeks has added to uncertainty. However, Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at capital Economics, said in a note that GDP benefitted temporarily during the second quarter as a whole from the \"unsustainable surge in financial sector activity\". \n\"Looking ahead, the support to growth from the financial sector should soon fade,\" he said. \n\"But the recent step-up in policy support will limit the downside risks,\" he added. \nChina's total trade declined in the first half of this year, official data showed Monday, falling well short of the government's targets, and poses a significant weight on growth. Manufacturing has also languished with official and private surveys showing it hovering near the borderline between expansion sand contraction. \n\"The resilience of retail sales in June is a further encouraging sign that downside risk, while not negligible, is receding, despite recent equity-market volatility,\" Andrew Colquhoun, head of Asia-Pacific Sovereigns at Fitch Ratings, wrote in a reaction to the data. \n\"Nonetheless, the longer-term outlook remains one of structural slowdown as the economy works through a painful process of adjustment and deleveraging.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T08:10:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
