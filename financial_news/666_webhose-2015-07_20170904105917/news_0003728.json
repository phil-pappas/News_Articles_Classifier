The Eurekahedge Asian Hedge Fund Index slipped 1.3 percent last month, the first loss since April 2014, with 62 percent of the funds having reported.\nChina’s benchmark stock indexes peaked on June 12, tumbling as much as 40 percent by July 8 and wiping more than $3 trillion in value after retail investors who borrowed to buy shares had to unwind trades. Japan’s Topix index dropped 2.6 percent in June as investors worldwide sold riskier assets amid concerns about Greece’s ouster from the euro currency union.\nLi’s almost $1.3 billion Pine River China Fund was down 4.1 percent in June, said a person briefed on the matter. The flagship fund of Huttenlocher’s Myriad Asset Management, which oversees more than $4 billion, declined 3.6 percent, said two people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the returns are private.\nOnly about 35 percent of Credit Suisse Group AG hedge-fund clients in the region made money last month, with China managers the hardest hit, the Swiss bank said in a July 9 note seen by Bloomberg News. Greater China-focused funds lost 3.9 percent, according to Eurekahedge data.\nCouldn’t Dodge Even some who predicted the decline couldn’t dodge the Shanghai Composite Index’s 32 percent plunge from June 12. Marco Polo Pure Asset Management, which oversees about $100 million in a hedge fund that trades yuan-denominated shares listed in China, foresaw a correction in early June, said chief executive officer Aaron Boesky. The almost 11-year-old fund lost 5 percent in June.\nThe losses came after stocks and funds had soared earlier in the year. The June setback cut Pine River China Fund’s return this year to 14 percent, said the person. It made 30 percent for investors in 2014, benefiting from China’s move to connect the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges.\nThe Myriad Opportunities Master Fund, which hasn’t had an annual loss since it started in 2011, was still up about 6.5 percent this year through June, said one of the people.\nHedge funds also outperformed the Shanghai gauge, which fell 7.3 percent in June, and the 7.1 percent slide in the MSCI China Index that tracks mostly Hong Kong-listed China companies.\nIn the first six months of 2015, Asia hedge funds on average returned 9.8 percent, almost triple the gains of Eurekahedge’s global hedge-fund gauge. They beat global peers in each of the last three years.\nFurther Drops Hedge-fund returns may have suffered more in early July when the Shanghai Composite Index plummeted as much as 18 percent before the government stepped in to support the market, with measures including halting trading in more than 1,300 China-listed companies, freezing 72 percent of the market.\nMarco Polo’s fund dropped another 8 percent, Boesky wrote in an e-mail on July 9. The fund had cut net exposure to about 30 percent and was holding cash, Boesky said.\n“We will take it day by day and look to be buying when we feel the time is right,” he added. The fund returned 33 percent this year.\nAmong the minority that made money in June was Owl Creek Asset Management’s $600 million Asia fund, which gained 2.9 percent, helped by long-short China investments, said a person with knowledge of the matter. The fund focused on corporate events such as mergers and led by Jeff Altman, returned 16 percent in the first half.\nNine Masts Capital in Hong Kong, which is expected to start August with more than $750 million of assets, returned 0.6 percent in June for an 11.2 percent gain in the first half, according to updates sent to investors and seen by Bloomberg News. The fund seeks to profit from pricing gaps between different securities sold by the same companies. It added another estimated 2.6 percent this month through July 10.\nSpokesmen for Myriad, Pine River, Owl Creek and Nine Masts declined to comment on performance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T02:33:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
