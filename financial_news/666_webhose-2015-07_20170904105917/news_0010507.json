Marwyn, an existing investor, also backed the deal. \n($1 = 0.6439 pounds) ($1 = 0.9062 euros) (Reporting by Kate Holton; Editing by Louise Heavens and David Holmes)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T13:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T19:18:10.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
