One can only assume they [Aldi Australia Group] are giving back to their German parent company and charging a fee for using the Aldi brand name.\"\nAldi claimed in its submission that about 1 per cent of its merchandise and services expenditure is made to international related parties.\nBut it said it wanted to \"make it explicitly clear that it does not engage in the inappropriate pricing of international related-party transactions for the purposes of artificially reducing taxable profits in Australia\".\nThe discount supermarket chain, which has expanded rapidly throughout Australia to establish a network of 373 stores covering Queensland, NSW, ACT and Victoria, said it had an effective tax rate of 32 per cent in 2013, above the 30 per cent corporate tax rate.\nOne of the committee's other members, independent senator Nick Xenophon, had first suggested the inquiry take a look at Aldi Australia .\nSenator Xenophon said it would be a matter for the committee to decide whether Aldi is brought before the inquiry, but \"just because a company has been called before this committee, does not mean they are not paying their fair share of tax\".\nHe said the fact he had been the one to raise Aldi's tax practices as a matter for the inquiry to examine, was something he put on the agenda privately after concerns had been raised with him by rivals Coles and Woolworths, and which was then leaked to media.\nAldi has been expanding profitably in Australia, with plans to open chains in South Australia and Western Australia.\nAldi ­Australia chief executive Thomas Daunt's submission to the inquiry shows Aldi's total revenue was $3.14 billion in 2010, $3.52 billion in 2011, $4.16 billion in 2012 and reached just under $5 billion in 2013.\nAldi's pre-tax profits have also been on the rise, starting at $121 million in 2010, $140 million in 2011, $232 million in 2012 and hitting $261 million in 2013.\nBut the company has come under fire from critics, including Wesfarmers chief Richard Goyder, for using a limited-partnership structure – meaning it does not have to disclose its accounts to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Mr Goyder has previously urged regulators to take \"a good look at how much tax Aldi pays in this country\" .\nAldi in its submission said it had a \"very open and positive working relationship\" with the Australian Taxation Office, which had given it a low-risk tax rating. These ratings are used by the ATO to determine how aggressively it monitors a taxpayer.​", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/aldi-lifts-lid-on-its-profits-and-tax-20150712-giapnm.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/apple-google-microsoft-cop-tax-audit-20150410-1mgsma.html", "http://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=a5857f2a-e3b1-4dbf-9176-876a92c13f4d&subId=353760", "http://www.afr.com/business/retail/coles-and-woolies-fight-supermarket-wars-on-two-fronts-20150626-ghwn95", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/aldis-tax-needs-a-good-look-says-wesfarmers-chief-richard-goyder-20150622-ghu5x3.html"], "published": "2015-07-13T15:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T18:33:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
