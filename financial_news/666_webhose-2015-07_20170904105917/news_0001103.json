In its previous plans, outlined in 2013, the world's largest listed oil producer projected that its oil output would be almost flat through to 2017 with acceleration to growth of between 3 and 4 percent a year thereafter. \nThe newly published plans, announced at a company meeting presided over by its boss Igor Sechin in western Siberia, include both oil and gas production. \nRosneft said its emphasis on the development of key production assets reflected the macroeconomic situation, current risks and the tax regime. \nRussia, one of the world's major oil producers, plans to boost crude oil exports and cut overall output of refined products. The country cut oil and oil product exporting duty starting from Jan. 1 2015, but increased the mineral extraction tax. (Reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin.
