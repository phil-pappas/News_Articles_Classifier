After saying that, the Green Paper to look at new ways of saving for a pension is a great idea. The idea of cheap Pension Isa is appealing. \n“I pay 40 per cent tax on my earnings, but I’m not far over the current threshold of £42,385 so to raise it to £43,000 couple with a higher tax-free personal allowance will also put more cash in my wallet. Much of that will be eaten up by higher insurance premiums though.” PETER CORNS Single mum Angel Priest is pleased about a higher personal allowance but worried about tax credits \nWORKING SINGLE MUM, FOUR KIDS \nSINGLE mother Angel Priest, of Kettering, in Northamptonshire, has been raising her children, Aimee, 12, Dylan and Damon, nine, and six-year-old Amber, alone since she split from her husband four years ago. \nThe 34-year-old is pleased with plans to increase the personal allowance everyone can earn before tax to £11,000 from next April - a whole year earlier than originally planned. But from April next year she faces a four-year freeze in working tax credits. I will have to look at the small print but I hope people like me are not penalised for working Single mum Angel Priest \nMs Priest works between 20 and 30 hours a week as an Avon lady selling cosmetics and toiletries door-to-door, and although she can make £2,000 a month in the run-up to Christmas, it’s usually between £300 and £400 a month. \n“I will have to look at the small print but I hope people like me are not penalised for working,” she said. “If inflation rises then my finances will be squeezed in a tax credit freeze. I am hard-working and want to earn more money but no one likes the idea of running and just staying in the same place. \n“The prospect of any changes to child benefit was worrying, I had read that he may limit it to three children and that would have been a real blow, so I am very relieved it has not been changed.” SEAN DEMPSEY/McLELLAN Liz and Ian Storey are positive about the Budget \nWORKING COUPLE, NO KIDS \nLIZ Storey, 42, works for a not-for-profit organisation Ignite Business Enterprise which helps small companies set up, and her husband Ian, 44, works in financial services. \nThe couple, who have a joint income of around £100,000, have no children and live in a detached house in Great Leighs, Essex. \nMrs Storey said: “I’m really positive about the Budget. Back in March it seemed the Chancellor didn’t want to upset the apple cart in advance of the general election but this time it was much stronger. I am pleased with the increase in the tax-free personal allowance to £11,000 and a rise in the threshold at which the 40 per cent kicks in because every little helps.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T00:27:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
