Josh Robenstone by Marianna Papadakis and Katie Walsh Treasurer Joe Hockey will have to pay 85 per cent of his own legal costs in a defamation case against newspaper publisher Fairfax Media, leaving a shortfall of around $300,000 to cover his own lawyers' fees.\nThe Federal Court Justice Richard White ruled on Wednesday that Fairfax, publisher of The Australian Financial Review , should pay 15 per cent of Mr Hockey's legal costs.\nThe court ruled in June that Mr Hockey was defamed in a Sydney Morning Herald advertising poster and in two tweets by The Age that said \"Treasurer for Sale\".\nMr Hockey was awarded damages of $200,000. The judge ruled the articles were not defamatory.\nJustice White said his assessment of costs took into account Mr Hockey's limited success in his case.\nJustice White was critical of Mr Hockey's failure to focus his lawsuit, noting that had he narrowed it to the offending SMH poster and The Age tweets it possibly \"may not have involved a trial at all\".\n\"Put slightly differently, it was the ambit of the claims made by Mr Hockey, which defined and extended the battleground of the parties' contest,\" he said.\nMr Hockey's lawyers wanted Fairfax to pay all of the his legal costs and each side to pay their own costs for the Canberra Times . Alternatively, if the publications were to be assessed together, Fairfax should pay 90 to 95 per cent of Mr Hockey's costs.\n The result is also disappointing for Fairfax, which argued Mr Hockey should pay 60 per cent of its costs. Mr Hockey will not have to pay any of the publisher's costs.\nA Fairfax Media spokesman said: \"The costs judgment is a fair reflection of the outcome of the proceedings where Mr Hockey failed on all of the matters, which were the real core of his claim.\"\nMr Hockey said he did not regret taking the action.\n\"After nearly 20 years in public life I took this action to stand up to malicious people intent on vilifying Australians who choose to serve in public office to make their country a better place,\" Mr Hockey said.\nHe said the court found the SMH and The Age defamed him and that Fairfax Media acted with malice through the actions of its editor-in-chief, Darren Goodsir.\n\"Whilst the cost of this action has been considerable for me, my family and friends, it has been far greater for Fairfax Media,\" Mr Hockey said\nMr Hockey's submission for a permanent injunction to restrain Fairfax from re-publishing the imputations, was also rejected by Justice White.\nThis was on the basis of public interest in free speech and the \"undesirability of courts making themselves a form of gateway to be negotiated before the publication of material\".\nJustice White also found Mr Hockey's case of malice counted against him because he failed to retreat from allegations of malice against other staff beyond Mr Goodsir, the only individual found to have acted in spite.\nACA Lawyers principal Steven Lewis said the ruling reflected the minimal degree of success Mr Hockey achieved in the case and it was a warning to other prospective plaintiffs that defamation proceedings were fraught with danger.\n\"You can win the battle but lose the war on costs,\" Mr Lewis said.\n\"The cap on defamation awards [of $366,000] means it is often exceeded by the actual costs. You cannot recover unlimited damages but the cost of running a case will always increase and when you bring as many claims as Mr Hockey did, that's the risk.\"\nAssociate Professor at the University of Sydney David Rolph said costs in the Hockey case were different from usual defamation cases because of the mixed success of his claim compared to usual cases where costs were more straightforward.\n\"Defamation is often criticised because only the wealthy can bring claims as the cost and risks of litigation means ordinary people can't sue.\"\nSpeaking generally, Griffith University professor Mark Pearson said along with costs plaintiffs also had to weigh up the risk of further damage to their reputation in pursuing legal action.\n\"Everything comes out in a defamation case and normally there are few winners.\"\nCorrection: This article was first published stating Joe Hockey would have a $500,000 shortfall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:54:08.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
