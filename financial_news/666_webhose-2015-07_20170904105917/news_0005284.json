All this combined with its retro looks, and manual dials, I am sure the GX8 will satisfy the needs of high amateurs as well as Professionals\", says Hitesh Ojha, Deputy General Manager, Digital Imaging and Audio Video. \n\n1.The Dual I.S.(Image Stabilizer) â€œ Innovative Handshake Correction System\n\nThe LUMIX GX8 integrates Dual I.S.(Image Stabilizer)* to gain more powerful handshake correction. Conventionally, image stabilizer in the camera (Body I.S.) and the interchangeable lens(Lens I.S.) can be switched. However, with the new Dual I.S., both Body I.S. and Lens I.S. work at the same time to take maximum advantages of both stabilizer. With max.3.5x wider correction angle at wide end, you can get clear handheld shot even in low-lit situations where shutter speeds tends to be slower. Panasonic LUMIX G DSLM (Digital Single Lens Mirrorless) Cameras offers a wide variety of digital interchangeable lenses and most of them are going to comply with Dual I.S. in LUMIX GX8*.\n\nFor video recording, 5-Axis HYBRID O.I.S.(Optical Image Stabilizer Plus)*2 which has been fostered in the Panasonic's long-time professional video camera development, corrects complex movement for stable imagery. \n\n2. Unprecedentedly High Picture Quality in the History of LUMIX Cameras\n\nThe new 20.3-megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor excels both in response, sensitivity and dynamic range. Integrating superior noise reduction systems, DMC-GX8 enables shooting at max.ISO25600. Sensitivity, gradation performance, resolution and color reproduction are dramatically improved to achieve even higher picture quality. It is also capable of high speed burst shooting at 8 fps (AFS) / 6 fps (AFC) not to miss the fleeting photo opportunities.\n\n3.4K Capability Bringing the Evolution in Videography/Photography \n\nThe DMC-GX8 is capable of recording smooth, high-resolution QFHD 4K video in 3840x2160 at 30p (60Hz) / 25p (50Hz) or 24p in MP4. Taking advantage of 4K video recording performance, users can capture the fleeting photo opportunities at 30 fps in 8-megapixel equivalent resolution to save it as a 4K photo. It is easy to get 4K photos with three 4K Photo modes- 4K Burst Shooting, 4K Burst S/S (Start/Stop) and 4K Pre-burst.\n\n4. Stunning Mobility Supported by Mechanical Advancements\n\nThe DMC-GX8 boasts large, tiltable LVF with highest ever magnification ratio of approx.1.54x / 0.77x (35mm camera equiv.) in the history of LUMIX G digital cameras. It also features 2,360K-dot high resolution and 100% field of view. High-precision, high-speed dual OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) displays are adopted for both LVF and rear monitor, achieving high speed response with minimum time lag of less than 0.01 sec as well as 10,000:1 high contrast. \n\n5. The Top Level of AF Performance among Conventional DSLRs and Mirrorless Cameras\n\nA variety of extensive AF functions including Face/Eye Detection AF, Pinpoint AF, One-shot AF and advanced Low Light AF enhance usability to comply with wide-ranging shooting situations. \n\n6. Other features\n\nThanks to the connectivity of Wi-Fi with NFC(Near Field Communication), users can connect the camera to their smartphone / tablet to expand the flexibility in shooting/storing/sharing images. Packing the best-possible technologies for the camera to capture the subject in the most ideal way, the DMC-GX8 will surely satisfy the high amateur or even professional users. \n\nAbout Panasonic \nPanasonic Corporation is a worldwide leader in the development and engineering of electronic technologies and solutions for customers in residential, non-residential, mobility and personal applications.
