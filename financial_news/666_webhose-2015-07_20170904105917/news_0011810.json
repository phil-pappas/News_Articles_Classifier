Shadow Immigration Minister Richard Marles defended the government's recent Border Force Act. ABC Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Labor's immigration spokesman Richard Marles has refused to confirm whether his party will come into line with the coalition on asylum seeker boat turn-backs, after he was asked about it four times.\nMr Marles is set to take a policy on the issue to the Labor party national conference in Melbourne in less than three weeks time.\nThe questions follow statements by Labor frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon who said in late June he believed turn-backs were an important \"tool\" that would be part of future Labor policy.\n\"One of those tools currently is boat turn-backs. Personally I believe turn-backs will remain part of Labor policy,\" he said , sentiments Labor leader Bill Shorten then declined to rule out , signalling a possible policy shift on the issue.\nAppearing on the ABC's Q&A program on Monday night, Mr Marles refused to be drawn when questioned directly about the issue, instead repeating in less clear language that the \"journey\" to Australia would not be \"re-opened\" for people smugglers.\n\"A future Labor government will not re-open the journey between Java and Christmas Island,\" he simply responded.\nHe said he retained concerns about turn-back after refusing to say whether he would take a policy supporting turn-backs to the national conference another three times.\n\"We have articulated concerns about turn-backs and I retain those concerns,\" he said.\n Mr Marles said he did not want to pre-empt decisions made at the conference.\nHe said the Labor party had in the past supported boat turn-backs, and any government who kept the boats coming would be \"condemned by history\".\n\"We now know for a future...government to re-open this journey, which in the last term saw something like 1,200 people lose their life at sea. For anyone to do that, would see that government condemned by history,\" he said.\nMr Marles also faced a grilling from doctors in the audience, who asked about Labor's support for the passage of the controversial border force act.\nMr Marles was asked if and why under the act, contracted doctors and nurses could face a prison sentence of up to two years for speaking out about abuse of asylum seekers in detention centres.\n\"I do actually think the doctors have it wrong here,\" Mr Marles said, insisting their was protection and process for doctors to report abuse.", "external_links": ["http://www.canberratimes.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bill-shorten-edges-labor-towards-adopting-coalitions-boat-turnback-policy-20150629-gi0hog.html", "https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/senior-labor-figure-fitzgibbon-supports-turning-back-boats-20150628-ghzxi0.html"], "published": "2015-07-07T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:59:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
