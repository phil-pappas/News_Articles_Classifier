Today those in the market to purchase a home, or anything really, their first stop is often their favorite search engine. \nFor home builders, real estate companies, mortgage companies and financial institutions the importance of ensuring your brand is found online can literally make or break your business. The amount of research that is involved during the home buying process starts months or even years before the actual purchase of the home. If you're not creating content that answers prospective customers questions or providing them with resources before they've found a home - you're missing out on an amazing opportunity! \nImagine being the voice that provides helpful information and resources to prospective home buyers. The process is daunting for some, but those that are passionate - and trust me they are out there! - make sure you are helping your future customers in the form of digital assets. Some Home Builder brands have taken notice and have created amazing portals of information for prospective home buyers. But more non-builder brands are taking away the market by sending them to sites like Trulia or Homes.com to name a few. Why not send that traffic to your own site , where you can capture those buyers attentions and keep them interested in the future. \nHome builders should take notice. No matter what area of the U.S. you're looking to purchase in there are sure to be resources available from the nation's best companies. If you're not producing that valuable content you should - your competition is already three steps ahead of you. \nLocal Home Builders \nLocal home builders may often feel overshadowed by large brands and for good reason. Large brands come with large marketing dollars and more staff, not to mention more homes to sell. But don't lose hope! Local home builders who have seen success in recent years have one thing in common: Content Marketing . That's right, the top builders today are blogging and publishing content that rivals those big sites. What's better, that content actually turns into leads and is often evergreen continuing to drive traffic month over month or year over year. \nValuable brands that are local and commit to blogging can see as much as 6.9x more traffic organically than brands that don't according to Hubspot. What's more, is that these local companies are competing against the big builders and still succeeding! When these companies position themselves as experts they're garnering the attention of real estate agents and prospective buyers alike - both insane lead sources. \nA company like Homes by WestBay in the Tampa, FL area are local builders really capitalizing on content marketing. Their Tampa, FL photo and local home tours section on their site showcases examples of how you too can use content, images and existing assets in a digital form for content marketing. \nCustom Home Builders \nNot unlike local home builders, custom building developers across the U.S. can see success by implementing content marketing too! Custom home builders have a more niche audience, but that doesn't mean you can't utilize content marketing. Successful campaigns have been built around developing content that answers the long tail questions that buyers are asking, \"what is the difference between a spec home and custom home?\" or how about, \"what is the cost of building a spec home vs. a custom home?\". These are questions that you might be able to answer, but some you might not. And that's okay! At least make an attempt at answering the question and ask the reader to call for more information about pricing from an expert custom home builder. Either way, you're getting the traffic to your site - a win win! \nLarge Brands \nLarge brands of course can still capitalize on content marketing. The most common way is to re purpose existing assets and take content maybe from print or brochures and use it in a digital format, optimized for search engines or optimized for a social media focus too. Either way you're taking an existing asset and turning it into a marketable piece that could bring leads and of course traffic too. Large brands that are interested in starting a content marketing campaign should ideally look at a company that has a long track record of proving results and a company with history in the real estate marketing space. \nWhether you're a large brand, small brand, custom home builder or local builder there's one that that stands out: content marketing works.
