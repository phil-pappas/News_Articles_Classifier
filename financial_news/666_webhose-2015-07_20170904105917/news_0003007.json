In the March quarter, the spending rise was an even higher 16 per cent, boosted by the Chinese New Year, the Cricket World Cup and the AFC Asian Cup.\nStuart Neels, the group general manager of ATS Pacific, which serves inbound tourists from the United Kingdom, told the conference the average spend by tourists on packages had been increasing since 2012 as the value of the Australian dollar fell against the pound.\n\"We are starting to see our stars a bit more aligned in this part of the world, with the US dollar getting strong [against the pound] and not that we would wish it, but the Ebola outbreak in Africa having some impact on [British] travel to those destinations,\" he said.\nMr O'Sullivan said the most important factor that was helping to drive tourists from the US and the UK in bigger numbers was a rise in consumer confidence in those countries.\n\"If you feel safe in your job, you are more inclined to make a decision, our research says, for long-haul travel,\" he said. \"The first decision point that we see is consumer confidence. We have certainly seen, if you look at Japan, the shocks that market has been through in terms of their confidence, they just haven't been travelling.\"\nIn the meantime, Chinese travellers have been arriving in record numbers, with the Tourism & Transport Forum predicting the rolling annual rate could reach 1 million arrivals by the end of this year, placing it not far behind the New Zealand market.\n Tourism Australia regional general manager China Andrew Hogg said the focus was on increasing the number of higher-yielding independent travellers from China rather than on those in group packages. He said the Chinese New Year would remain the peak time of year for travel for the foreseeable future because it occurred during the first quarter, when Europe and North America had cold weather relative to Australia. Of the $6.4 billion spent by Chinese visitors in the 12 months to March, $3 billion was spent between January and March.\nBusiness events are also a focus, with Business Events Sydney having won a highly competitive international pitch for an incentive tour of 10,000 Amway delegates from China in 2017\nBarclays chief economist Kieran Davies has calculated tourism is now Australia's second largest export , behind iron ore, having overtaken coal as a result of the steep fall in the price of that commodity combined with a strong increase in tourism spending. He said if the trend continued, tourism could overtake iron ore to become Australia's biggest export earner.\nMr O'Sullivan said he believed there was a distinct possibility that could occur in the future, particularly because tourism was a more sustainable industry than mining.\n\"Experiences like going whale watching off the coast here, going oyster shucking, they are experiences that are going to be here long after the last bit of iron ore is mined out of the ground,\" he said. \"[Tourism] is an industry that is national, it provides jobs for both genders. I think it is a really good opportunity for the indigenous community as well to add value and jobs in their communities but celebrate their culture.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T07:10:38.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
