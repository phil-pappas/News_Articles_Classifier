The data puts the Federal Reserve a step closer to raising interest rates for the first time in a decade, analysts said. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices.\nBut the Treasury market soon “took a U-turn,” sending yields lower, said David Keeble, global head of interest rates strategy at Crédit Agricole.\nThe main reason for the reversal was the so-called end-of-month index extension taking place, Keeble said.\nIndex extension occurs because bond portfolios that track indexes need to be rebalanced at the end of the month. The rebalancing is done to reflect changes in the index due to the issuance of new bonds on one hand and coupon payments and redemptions on the other.\n“It looks like many investors were waiting for the economic data to come out to buy right afterward,” Keeble said.\nThe data showed the U.S. economy expanding at an annual 2.3% rate in the second quarter. New methods in how the government calculates the GDP showed that the U.S. economy actually grew 0.6% in the first quarter instead of contracting by 0.2%. Jobless claims also rose slightly , but still remained near the lowest level in decades.\nTreasury investors mainly focused on the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which increased at 1.8% annual rate, as it indicated that the data-dependent Fed could be closer to raising interest rates.\nThe Fed’s policy statement on Wednesday also kept the door open for a rate increase sometime in 2015.\nRate-hike expectations “are weighing on the front-end of the curve,” David Ader, head of government bond strategy at CRT Capital Group, said in a note. That is why the price of short-term Treasury notes fell on Thursday, pushing short-term yields higher.\nConversely, “lower commodity prices and easing inflation expectations support the long-bond,” Ader said. That is why long-term Treasury bond prices rose, pushing long-term yields lower.\nOn balance, the yield on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.30% declined 1.1 basis point to 2.268%, according to Tradeweb. The yield on the two-year note TMUBMUSD02Y, +2.78% gained 2.8 basis points to 0.731% and the yield on the 30-year bond TMUBMUSD30Y, -1.86% fell 3.3 basis points to 2.953%.\nIn Europe, government bond yields declined on Thursday, after mixed economic data pointed to subdued annual inflation and slow growth in the labor market. The yield on the benchmark German 10-year bund TMBMKDE-10Y, -9.04% fell 5.3 basis points to 0.616%.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:45:31.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
