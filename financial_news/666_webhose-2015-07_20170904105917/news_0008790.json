Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro The changes in mortgage risk weights and capital requirements will have a significant impact on bank capital requirements and profits on their home lending books.\nUntil now, the major banks and Macquarie have effectively been allowed to discount the size of a home loan because they have demonstrated they are advanced in managing risk when calculating how much equity they must allocate to a loan.\nAt an average risk weight of 16 per cent on a $1 million loan, they've been allowed to count the loan exposure as just $160,000 and must hold 8 per cent of capital against that amount (or $12,800).\nThe change in the risk weight to 25 per cent and the increased capital requirement to 10 per cent means that in the hypothetical $1 million loan example, the bank will have to hold $25,000 against a $1 million loan, almost double the initial amount.\nSo why might this make your home loan rate go up?\nWell, if the bank must now use twice as much equity to fund the loan, it can only make half the profit per dollar of equity. Put another way, for every $25,000 of equity the bank raises from shareholders it can now lend and earn interest on only $1 million compared to $1.9 million previously.\nNeed to double profit margin So for the bank to maintain the same returns per dollar of equity, it will need to almost double the profit margin on a home loan.\n Assuming the bank makes a 0.50 per cent profit (after all expenses) on $1 million loan, that would equate to a 39 per cent return on equity. To make the same return on equity on a $1 million loan, given it must use twice as much equity, the bank would need to increase its profit margin on the loan by almost 0.50 per cent.\nWhat does this mean? If the bank takes the view that it must protect its profits, then it will need to lift its mortgage rates by about half a percentage point, or reduce costs by the same amount. But its ability to do so depends on how competitive the lending environment is and whether it is prepared to risk losing market share if other lenders hold firm. So the bank may decide to maintain its current pricing and simply accept lower profits.\nThe motive behind these changes has been to level the playing fields among the big banks and the smaller lenders.\nBut regulators have also taken these measures to ensure the banks have more capital to protect themselves against a fall in house prices. As this example shows, it comes at a cost â€“ either households pay in the form of higher home loan rates or the bank shareholders pay in the form of lower profits. Most likely, we'll see a combination of both.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-07-24T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:11:52.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
