The move is part of the consumer products giant's effort to streamline secondary brands to better promote best-sellers like Gillette razors and Head & Shoulders shampoo. \nUS-listed Chinese companies like E-commerce giant Alibaba and Internet search company Baidu (Xetra: A0F5DE - news ) felt the effects of the upheaval in Chinese markets, swooning when Shanghai tumbled and rallying when equities in the home market went back up. \nWorries about China were also seen as driving weakness in Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) , which fell five straight sessions before rallying Friday. Apple has targeted China as a major market for its iPhone. \nEarnings season got underway with reports from aluminium producer Alcoa (NYSE: AA - news ) , PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP - news ) and others. \nNext (Other OTC: NXGPF - news ) week's calendar includes reports from General Electric, Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL - news ) and JPMorgan Chase (Swiss: JPM.SW - news ) and other giant banks. \nFederal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to appear before congressional panels for a pair of semi-annual hearings on Capitol Hill. Major data releases include retail sales and housing starts, both for June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T06:27:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
