As UK tabloid columnist Katie Hopkins tweeted : \"women work less and hence paid less. Deal with it.\"\nBut let's put Katie aside for a moment. We can celebrate the fact that views like hers are now on the fringe. There is bipartisan support in the UK for gender gap reporting, with the main criticism of Cameron's announcement being around the pace of change. Here in Australia, there is strong commitment from government and employers to both the principle and action of tackling workplace gender equality.\nThe next question that emerges around gender reporting is: can it make a difference? Does letting sunlight in actually bring about change?\nThe scope of reporting by companies in the UK remains to be determined. There will be important and complicated issues to nut out about which jobs are compared and how. However the UK's reporting regime shapes up, it will be different to gender reporting requirements in Australia.\nHere, organisations with over 100 employees report to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency on a range of gender equality indicators including the composition of their workforce, pay and measures to improve equality.\nOrganisations aren't compelled to calculate or publish their own gender pay gap, although we encourage it. But the information we collect helps us build a picture of what is happening within and across industries in terms of women's participation in the workforce.\n Here's what it tells us: we have an extremely gender-segregated workforce with women dominating in industries like health care, education and retail; men in construction, mining and IT.\nIn the section of the Australian workforce for which the Agency collects data – private sector organisations over 100 employees – there's an overall pay gap of 24.74 per cent for full-time employees in favour of men.\nThere are significant gender pay gaps across the board, even in industries where there are more women. Take legal services where 69.31 per cent of employees are women, but there is a pay gap of 35.57 per cent in favour of men. Ouch.\nThe data also shows us that representation of women falls steadily when moving up management levels. Women are 48.5 per cent of the workforce, but just 26.1 per cent of key management positions and 17.3 per cent of CEOs.\nEmployers also receive an industry benchmark report that allows them to check their own performance on gender equality against others in their industry. And they might want to do that: there's growing recognition that gender equality isn't just about warm inner glow, it's good for business: delivering higher productivity, better access to the best talent and healthier workplace culture.\nBut how do we get from data exposing the problem to fixing it? It's an important question to grapple with.\nData matters because it helps us articulate and understand the problem we face. It not only provides the evidence that workplace gender inequality is indeed a real thing, it can facilitate the shift from seeing it as a problem for 'society' to being a problem in our own workplaces. Gender inequality is like mist, difficult to see close up – but the data that speaks specifically to our own office block and building site or factory make it harder to pretend that gender discrimination is other people's problem. The very process of reporting encourages employers to stop every year and reflect on issues that aren't usually top of mind.\nFrom this year, the second year of reporting, employers and policy-makers will be able to compare performance on gender equality over time. Our world-leading workplace gender data collection will allow us to develop a picture of the critical issues confronting gender equality allowing for targeted education and advocacy. It allows us to take a problem that seems insurmountable and work out practical things employers can do to make a difference: like making quality flexible work more accessible for both women and men.\nSo I welcome moves in the UK to let some sunlight shine on British employers' performance on gender pay equity. The sunlight provided by data isn't an easy solution to tackling workplace gender inequality – unfortunately easy solutions are difficult to come by – but it's a necessary ingredient.\nLouise McSorley, is acting director of the Workplace Gender Equality Agency .", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33515629"], "published": "2015-07-21T11:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:05:47.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
