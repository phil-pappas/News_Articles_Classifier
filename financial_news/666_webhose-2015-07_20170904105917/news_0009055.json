Mr Collymore drew great applause when he agreed that this mind-set needs to change. \nThe session dwelt heavily on the need to see entrepreneurship as more than technology, the need to increase connectivity and the problems entrepreneurs go through when starting businesses. \nMr Chris Daniels, a vice president of product for Facebook said the three hurdles holding back people from making maximum use of the Internet are access, affordability and awareness. \n\"Connectivity is foundational to entrepreneurship,\" he said. \"When you show people how the Internet can help them, they will pay for it. They are already paying for voice and text.\" \nMr Larry Alder, a director of access development at Google advised entrepreneurs to seek as much benefit as they could from new trends in technology. \n\"When a wave such as the Internet comes, ride it all the way to the beach.\" \nHe gave a glimpse of future trends that Facebook and Google are working on to make broadband Internet available to mobile handsets.
