While getting a rebate may seem like a late Christmas present from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), it actually can be the result of some rather poor tax planning.\nA couple of recent polls have found that many Canadians who were expecting a refund this year planned to use it to either pay down debt or pay bills.\nAccording to CIBC, 58 per cent of Canadians expected a tax refund this year. Twenty one per cent planned to reduce their high-interest debt by making a credit card or loan payment, 19 per cent were either going to put it aside or hadn't decided, 18 per cent intended to pay for day to day expenses such as bills and groceries and 13 per cent planned to save or invest the money.\nAnother study by BMO Nesbitt Burns found that among the 97 per cent of Millennials who expected a tax refund 37 per cent planned to use the money to pay bills and/or reduce debt. Thirty three per cent planned to either save or invest the refund and 14 per cent planned to use it to pay down their mortgage.\n\"It is good to see that Canadians are committed to paying off their high-interest debt as quickly as possible, but our poll shows that Canadians still aren't putting enough time and effort into tax planning,\" says Jamie Golombek, Managing Director of Estate Planning with CIBC. \"Contrary to popular belief, getting a tax refund isn't really a windfall. After all, what you've essentially done is loan your hard-earned money to the government, interest free, for a year or more.\"\nA tax refund typically occurs when the amount of tax owing on your return is less than the amount of tax withheld from your income during the year, Golombek explains. Employment income is the most common type of income from which tax is deducted at source and therefore employees are most often the tax filers who get significant refunds each year.\nThere are two main ways employees can reduce their tax at source.\nThe first is by making sure that the credits your employer uses to calculate your payroll deductions are up to date. The TD1 personal tax credit return sets out the personal tax credits you intend to claim when filing your tax return and helps determine how much tax is deducted each pay period, Golombek explains.\nIf your personal tax credits such as the spouse or common law partner credit, the disability credit or credit for tuition have changed since you were hired you should re-submit the form so that taxes withheld at source can be adjusted for the tax credits beyond the basic personal exemption. You must submit both federal and provincial TD1 forms, which can be obtained on the CRA web site.\nYou also can apply to get your tax refund paid throughout the year on every pay cheque instead of waiting until after your return is filed by completing the T1213 request to reduce tax deductions at source form. On the form you indicate your regular RRSP contributions and other deductions and credits to be taken into account when your employer calculates the tax that will be withheld from your pay.\nThe form is sent to your local CRA tax office for approval and once it is approved the CRA will send you a letter of authority which you give to your employer allowing them to reduce your tax at source.\n\"It's important to consider your financial goals when deciding what to do with your tax refund,\" Golombek says. \"But it's even better to eliminate that tax refund altogether and use the taxes saved throughout the year to your benefit.\"\nTalbot Boggs is a Toronto-based business communications professional who has worked with national news organizations, magazines and corporations in the finance, retail, manufacturing and other industrial sectors.\nCopyright 2015 Talbot Boggs\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T17:07:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
