The documentation is not yet available on the FEC website. \nTrump's campaign says that he brought in $362 million in 2014. Moreover, it states that his net worth has jumped to more than $10 billion (when he initially announced his campaign in June, Trump claimed a net worth of $9.2 billion ; of course, the damage he's done to his brand since announcing his bid and trashing Mexicans may not be fully baked in).

The release lists 45 stocks the billionaire sold in January 2014, 40 of which \"went up in a relatively short period of time.\" Trump's alleged gain: $27 million. \nThe release also states that Trump has even more to make in the markets. It lists an unrealized gain of more than $22 million through investments with entities including Baron Funds , Oppenheimer , Angelo Gordon & Co. and Paulson & Co. \nUnrealized gains aside, five stocks have already made Trump more than $1 million each. Here they are: \n1. Bank of America - $6.74 Million \nBank of America appears to have been Trump's best stock bet. He claims to have made $6.74 million on the financial giant, of which he bought and sold 710,000 shares. Trump initially invested $4.98 million in the company (which comes out to about $7.00 per share) and sold when his holdings had reached $11.72 million (about $16.50 per share). \nBank of America reported second quarter earnings on Wednesday, beating analysts' expectations with earnings of 45 cents per share on revenue of $22.35 billion as opposed to analyst forecasts of earnings of 36 cents per share on revenue of $21.32. Perhaps Trump got out of the investment too early?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T18:36:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
