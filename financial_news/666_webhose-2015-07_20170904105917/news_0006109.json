The rout is deepening amid mounting speculation that US interest rates will climb this year , curbing the appeal of bullion because it does not pay interest, unlike other assets. At the same time, China bought less of the metal than analysts were expecting, and the dollar keeps getting stronger. \nCurrie originally told investors to sell gold in 2013 - well before the metal's current price collapse. \n“With the more positive outlook on the dollar, and with debasement risk starting to fade, the demand to use gold as a diversifying asset against the US dollar becomes less and less important,” said Currie. \n• Why is the gold price falling and where is it going next? \n“We think we are in a structural bear market, not only in gold, but across the commodity complex, as the individual commodity stories are reinforcing to one another, creating a negative feedback loop.\" \nCurrie isn’t alone in predicting more declines. ABN Amro Bank NV’s Georgette Boele and Robin Bhar of Societe Generale AG say bullion will approach $1,000 by December. The metal has led a retreat among raw materials, as the Bloomberg Commodity Index this week fell to a 13-year low. \nInvestors wary \nFollowing its tumble to a five-year low on Monday, investors remained wary of gold on Wednesday. It reversed Tuesday's rebound to trade down 0.7pc on the day to $1,090.95 per ounce. \n• Forget gold, the sugar price collapse is far more dramatic - and here's why \n\"We believe gold should range trade around current levels, but do not dismiss the possibility of further price falls, given the lack of safe-haven interest,\" Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) commodities analysts wrote in a note to clients. \n“Any rebound today is purely technical and would probably be just a ‘dead-cat bounce’,” added Howie Lee, an investment analyst at Phillip Futures Pte in Singapore. “The bleeding may stop in the meantime, but that doesn’t mean the wound has closed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T16:15:36.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
