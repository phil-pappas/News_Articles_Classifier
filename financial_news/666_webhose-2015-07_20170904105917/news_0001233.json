The social media network is far more popular than Facebook in former Soviet republics, where it has more than 100 million users. \nUnlike its US rival Facebook, VK did not have a picture sharing service, leading Russia's selfie enthusiasts to turn to Instagram. \n\"This is VK's first service for mobile phones that functions independently from the social network, while being closely integrated to it,\" VK operations director Andrei Rogozov said in a statement on Monday. \"We are creating a new global project that is not limited to the site's users.\" \nThe launch comes just over a year after Durov's departure from the VK group. The enigmatic founder resigned last year after an enduring conflict with Kremlin-linked shareholders. \nFollowing Durov's departure, VK came under the control of Russian Internet group Mail.ru.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T19:44:01.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
