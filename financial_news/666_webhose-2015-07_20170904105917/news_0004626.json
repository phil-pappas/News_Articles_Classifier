OPEC is assuming that demand will pick up in the second half of the year,\" he added. \nKyle Cooper at IAF Advisors said the WTI's market low so far this year -- $43.46 in March -- \"is the technical target and an area that seems very plausible.\" \nWTI has shed more than 21 percent since June 10, when it closed at $61.43. \n\"The supply and demand balance does not look supportive now that we have broken the $50 level and that the US driving season only has a few more weeks to go,\" Cooper said. \nThe analyst pointed to the economic slowdown in the China, the world's largest energy guzzler, while crude output in both the US and OPEC has remained at very high levels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T00:39:50.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
