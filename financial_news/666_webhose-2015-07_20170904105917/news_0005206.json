The Thomson Reuters study found that in 2010, materials companies' debts were 2.8 times their core profit. At end-2014 they were 5.3 times. For energy companies, indebtedness has risen from 1.1 to 4.4 times core profit. For industrials, from 2.5 to 4.2.\nLOW RETURNS\nGao Hong, investor relations principal at railway equipment maker Jinxi Axle Co, said that financial investments had helped compensate for difficult conditions in its core business as it continued to search for viable opportunities. The company has seen the ratio of its overall debt to core earnings (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) nearly triple to 10.25 between 2010 and 2014.\n\"Last year our core business wasn't great,\" Gao said. \"If we hadn't invested in CNR (China CNR Corp Ltd), our profit situation would have been worse.\"\nMuch of the new lending is going to China's notoriously inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as part of the government's fiscal stimulus.\n\"They are lending more to fund infrastructure projects, and some may be done by SOEs where leverage is increasing as a result,\" said Tao Wang, UBS head of China research.\n\"Prices are declining and revenue is slowing, and in this environment you cannot force too quick a deleverage - that would lead to a hard landing,\" said Wang.\nS&P expects China's companies to account for 40 percent of the world's new corporate lending in the period through 2019.\nBut quantity is not the only problem.\nGetting credit to the most efficient companies, where it has the most impact on the economy, would be easier if inefficient companies were allowed to fail, so markets can price debt effectively.\nPolicymakers have said they want market mechanisms to play a bigger role in credit pricing, but in practice have baulked at the consequences, effectively bailing out companies in trouble, as it did last year when state-backed Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology Co Ltd defaulted on a bond coupon payment.\nRapid debt growth, opacity of risk and pricing and very high debt to GDP are a hazardous combination, Standard & Poor's says.\nIt took an unprecedented series of measures to arrest the plunge in China's stock markets, which are worth just over $8 trillion and are a minority pursuit for the relatively wealthy.\nTackling corporate debt might make that seem like child's play.\n\"Managing the debt market is probably more dangerous than the stock market because the scale of the debt market is bigger, and without any high-profile default, the moral hazard is a significant issue,\" said David Cui, BofA Merrill Lynch analyst.
