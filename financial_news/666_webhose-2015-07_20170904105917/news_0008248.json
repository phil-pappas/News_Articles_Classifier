For all intent and purpose there were the same number of folks with pensions, however, the types of pensions that they have, has changed a fair amount. There are 20,868 less folks in Defined Benefit Pension Plans There are 6.428 more folks in Defined Contribution Plans There are 14,609 more folks in Hybrid Pension Plans, where Hybrid means, “ Other plans include plans having a hybrid, composite, defined benefit / defined contribution or other component. “ \nSo what does this really mean? I think the idea of the work related pension is changing (some might say becoming extinct, but maybe not just yet), and most folks (next generation after me) is going to have to take care of their own retirement savings. I was lucky enough to fall into a pension , but unless you work for the government (or a bank) you are unlikely to have a classic pension plan (private sector pension plans are down 0.2%). \nThis explains why you have some folks (like the Ontario government) that think that folks need to have more retirement savings, and they are going to impose it on you (with the proposed new Ontario Provincial Pension ), whether you want it or not. \nWhat is interesting is in the mid-90’s folks at Nortel wanted out of the Pension Plan (a defined benefit program at the time) because it was screwing up their ability to put money in their RRSPs (many thought they weren’t going to stay at Nortel their entire career (and they were right, in hindsight)). \nIs the idea of a company pension dead?
