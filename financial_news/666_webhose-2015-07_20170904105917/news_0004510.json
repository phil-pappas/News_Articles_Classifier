news ) , Brent North Sea crude for September delivery fell to $56.74 per barrel from $58.68 a week earlier for the August contract. \nOn the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) or light sweet crude for August dropped to $50.34 a barrel from $52.74 a barrel. \n-- Gold collapses -- \nPRECIOUS METALS: Gold dived to $1,131.20 per ounce on Friday, striking a level last witnessed on April 6, 2010, as rising US inflation cemented expectations of an interest rate hike and pushed the dollar higher. \nPlatinum slid to a six-year nadir at $999.95 and sister metal palladium forged a three-year low at $616.65. \nUS consumer prices rose broadly in June, bringing the annual inflation rate back into positive territory, official data showed. \nThe Labor Department said its consumer price index (CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) ) rose 0.3 percent in June, a notch below the 0.4 percent gain in May. \n\"The precious metal dropped to a new five-year low ... as renewed strength in the US dollar sent commodities lower across the board,\" said CMC Markets analyst Jasper Lawler. \nHe added: \"The US dollar was mostly stronger on Friday, supported by consumer price inflation that met expectations but supported the hawkish stance of Fed Chair Yellen in her two-day testimony to US lawmakers.\" \nIn testimony to Congress, Yellen stuck to the position of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting that a hike would come \"at some point this year\" if \"the economy evolves as we expect\". \nBy Friday on the London Bullion Market, the price of gold dropped to $1,132.80 an ounce from $1,159.30 a week earlier. \nSilver (Shenzhen: 300221.SZ - news ) fell to $15.01 an ounce from $15.45. \nOn the London Platinum and Palladium Market, platinum tumbled to $998 an ounce from $1,032. \nPalladium slumped to $621 an ounce from $655. \nBASE METALS: Prices mostly rallied as dealers mulled bright economic growth data in leading base metals consumer China, but gains were then impacted by the rising dollar. \n\"The upswing enjoyed by metal prices on the back of better than expected Chinese data was brought to a halt ... by the firmer US dollar,\" said Commerzbank (Xetra: CBK100 - news ) analysts in a research note to clients. \nChina's GDP expanded 7.0 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, official data showed Wednesday, beating expectations as central bank policy stimulus helped support the world's second-largest economy. \nThe gross domestic product figure announced by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) matched the 7.0 percent expansion in the first three months of this year, and exceeded the median forecast of 6.9 percent in an AFP survey of 14 economists. \nBy Friday on the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three months fell to $5,507 a tonne from $5,770.50 a week earlier. \nThree-month aluminium increased to $1,707.50 a tonne from $1,690.50. \nThree-month lead rose to $1,835 a tonne from $1,794.50. \nThree-month tin soared to $15,675 a tonne from $13,975. \nThree-month nickel climbed to $11,465 a tonne from $11,275. \nThree-month zinc advanced to $2,074 a tonne from $2,005.50. \n-- Cocoa sweetens -- \nCOCOA: Prices scored more four-year peaks, as the market was pushed higher by supply troubles in key producer Ghana. \n\"Worries about growing conditions in Ghana, the worlds' second largest producer supported cocoa,\" said Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen. \nPrices surged to £2,242 in London and $3,389 in New York -- both the highest points since March 2011. \nBy Friday on LIFFE, London's futures exchange, cocoa for delivery in September grew to £2,216 a tonne from £2,199 a week earlier. \nBy Friday on the ICE Futures US exchange, cocoa for September increased to $3,335 a tonne from $3,293 the previous week. \nSUGAR: Prices retreated, despite weather worries in major producers Brazil and Thailand that usually support the market. \n\"Despite continuing weather concerns -- rains in Brazil and dry weather in Thailand -- the market seems to have resumed its grind lower,\" said analysts at brokerage Sucden Financial. \nBy Friday on LIFFE, a tonne of white sugar for delivery in October slid to $357.40 compared with $358.60 one week earlier. \nOn ICE Futures US, unrefined sugar for October dropped to 11.94 US cents from 12.05 cents the previous week. \nCOFFEE: Prices touched a new 18-month trough at $1,669 per tonne in London, dented by the impact of the weak currency in Brazil. \n\"US dollar prices for Arabica coffee and raw sugar have long been suffering from the weakness of the currency of the most important producer country, Brazil,\" noted Commerzbank analysts. \nBy Friday on LIFFE, Robusta for September decreased to $1,674 a tonne from $1,732 one week earlier. \nOn ICE Futures US, Arabica for delivery in September rose to 127.40 US cents a pound from 126.80 cents the previous week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:14:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
