It is still very difficult but work is still in progress,\" said Dijsselbloem after nine hours of gruelling talks, adding that they would resume Sunday morning at 0900 GMT. \nMaltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat warned that Sunday \"will be a long day\" thanks to the \"inconclusive\" eurozone talks. \nFinnish Finance Minister Alexander Stubb was more upbeat, despite reports that Finland's parliament has decided it will not allow the government to accept any new bailout deal for Greece. \n\"We are making good progress,\" he said. \nEU Commissioner for economic affairs Pierre Moscovici, who has been among the most sympathetic to Greece's plight, said: \"I am always hopeful.\" \n- 'Can't trust promises' - \nThe eurozone was meant to give its verdict on leftist Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's new reform plan for a third bailout worth more than 80 billion euros ($89 billion), after creditor institutions said it was a positive step forward. \nThe proposals, including pension cuts and tax hikes, were approved by the Greek parliament in the early hours of Saturday despite opposition within Tsipras's ruling radical Syriza party. \nBut Germany's hardline Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble poured cold water on early optimism at the start of the talks, accusing Athens of repeatedly reneging on its commitments. \n\"Definitely we cannot trust promises,\" Schaeuble said. \"In the last months hope has been destroyed in an incredible way, even up to just a few hours ago.\" \nA European source said the German finance ministry had even drawn up an \"internal paper\" for Greece to leave the eurozone for five years if it fails to improve its bailout proposals, but added it was not distributed at the Eurogroup meeting. \nFinance Minister Michel Sapin of France, which has been Greece's biggest supporter in efforts to avoid a \"Grexit\", said he hoped the talks would \"go as far as possible to find a deal\". \nA source close to the negotiations said the \"climate is not easy\" and Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos was is in contact with Athens to see how to restore eurozone confidence in Greece. \n- 'Armageddon' - \nTsipras won the backing of 251 out of 300 deputies in the Greek parliament for his reform plans, even though they are similar to the ones that Greeks rejected in the referendum. \nAthens's creditors fear it will not keep its promises after two previous bailouts worth 240 billion euros merely added to a debt mountain, now worth nearly 180 percent of the country's GDP. \nGreece dived deeper into the mire when it became the first developed economy to default on a huge payment to the International Monetary Fund on June 30, the same day as its EU-IMF bailout expired. \nIn Greece, there is growing alarm at capital controls that have closed banks and rationed cash at ATMs for nearly two weeks. \nQueueing Saturday at a cash machine in Athens, Vassilis Papoutsoglou, 52, said: \"We still don't know what will happen tomorrow. Can we expect something better, or is it Armageddon?\" \nThe Greek government hoped the vote would give it a mandate to continue the talks with the creditors -- but it also revealed the depth of opposition to fresh austerity. \nThree senior government figures were among 10 MPs who abstained or voted against, and several others from the ruling leftist Syriza party stayed away, prompting commentators to predict a government shake-up. \nTsipras told parliament the plan was \"marginally better\" than the proposals put forward by the creditors last month and that Greeks would \"succeed not only in staying in Europe but in living as equal peers with dignity and pride\". \nEU President Donald Tusk has said Sunday's summit is a \"last chance\" for a deal. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) if that happens, at least eight parliaments will have to weigh in on a final accord, with Germany's Bundestag having to vote twice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T02:51:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
