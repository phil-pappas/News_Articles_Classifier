Dominic Lorrimer Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has shaken off accusations from Acting Treasurer Bruce Billson that he accepted \"slings\" or bribes during his time as head of the Australian Workers Union.\nMr Billson compared accusations made at the Royal Commission into Trade Union Corruption that the AWU accepted large payments from employers while negotiating lower pay or conditions for workers during Mr Shorten's leadership, to a 'dodgy' car sale.\n\"Imagine if you had a trusted mate going and buying a car for you, trying to get you a good deal, and then you find out your mate's getting a sling from the guy that's flogging the car. That just looks dodgy,\" Mr Billson said.\nMr Shorten hit back saying Mr Billson was \"pursuing a politics of smear\".\n\"He is completely wrong and, furthermore, we have just seen an $80 million taxpayer funded Tony Abbott royal commission to smear their opponents,\" he said.\nMr Shorten committed to \"move away\" from smear campaigns he was to gain power.\nAt the commission Mr Shorten said he did not believe there were deals between the union and employers involving 'bogus invoices', saying employer payments he was questioned on were for such activities as training and OH&S.\nHe was forced to admit, however, that he failed to declare up to $63,777 in payments until days before the hearing from labour hire company, Unibilt , that covered the wages of his former campaign director, Lance Wilson .\n Labor shadow ministers came out in vigorous defence of Mr Shorten on Friday.\nLabor industry spokesman Kim Carr likened the government's actions to that of a 'totalitarian regime'.\n\"We are turning a very dark corner here when it comes to the use of state power in an attempt to silence political opponents. This is a Government that's setting a shocking precedent,\" he said.\nShadow Minister for Infrastructure Anthony Albanese said Mr Shorten had a record as a trade union official he could be proud of.\n\"He answered every question that they had. He did it in a way that was forceful and defended his record that he's proud of, as a trade union official,\" Mr Albanese said.\nMr Albanese also questioned why Mr Shorten was being accused of being too moderate.\n\"People will look at the context here and what they'll see is criticism from Abbott Government ministers saying basically Bill Shorten was a part of doing deals between employers and employers for their common interest,' he said.\nHead of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kate Carnell, and former Liberal politician said there was a clear conflict of interest.\n\"It certainly appears to be [a conflict of interest],\" she said", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-07-10T11:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T06:49:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
