Securing the perimeter or a single device is no longer sufficient. Sophos Cloud Endpoint and Mobile products cover employees wherever they work and on whatever device they are using. \n\n\"Now, with the addition of a powerful web gateway Sophos Cloud provides a full suite of enterprise-grade security solutions designed for the mid-market.\"\n\nRob Westervelt, research manager at IDC, said: \"Sophos' unified defense vision and the benefits that the cloud managed offering gives to SMBs with limited IT resources, will be well received in the marketplace. Ease of use is also a primary focus for Sophos, and one that customers and partners both attest is well-received.\"\n\nWith the introduction of the new Sophos Cloud Web Gateway and the Sophos Web Appliance, IT managers can get great web security from Sophos whether they choose an appliance or cloud model for their business, said the statement.\n\nThe latest version of Sophos Web Appliance was recently released with a new proxy engine with up-to seven times the scanning performance on the same hardware and improved granular controls over features like chat, games and comments to manage the use of popular social media apps like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, it said.\n\nIn addition, it will now provide enhanced user reporting including snap-shot and detailed reports which show a chronological list of every website a user has visited over a day, week, month or longer, it added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:20:59.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
