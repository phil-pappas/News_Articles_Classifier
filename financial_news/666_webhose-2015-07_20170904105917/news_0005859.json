So the RJD has decided to use horse power to defeat the BJP's machine power,\" he said, referring to the 'raths'. \"Dozens of Tum-Tums will be engaged by our party for campaigning in each constituency.\" Elections to the 243-seat Bihar assembly will take place later this year. The Rashtriya Janata Dal leader said the horse carts were perfect for Bihar's \"dusty and rough roads. Tum-Tums will help us save money on petrol and diesel\". BJP president Amit Shah on Thursday launched the party's high-tech 'Parivartan Rath' campaign for the polls by flagging off 160 GPS-fitted 'raths' here. The 'raths' would show a video film in Hindi depicting the 15 years of \"misrule\" of Bihar by Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi.
