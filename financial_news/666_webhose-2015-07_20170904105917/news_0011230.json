Kansas can’t sell the 30-year debt for yields above 5 percent, according to state law. It may be running out of room: Similar bonds that Kansas sold in 2004 with insurance have traded less than a half-percentage point below that level.\nGreece’s standoff with creditors over austerity measures such as pension cuts is helping keep Kansas’s bond plan alive. The euro-area tension is holding down interest rates by stoking demand for Treasuries even as bets build that the Federal Reserve is getting closer to raising borrowing costs.\n“We have interest-rate risk until we can get to market,” MacMurray said in an interview. “It’s certainly possible we could get hit by higher rates.”\nKansas’s pension system, which covers 290,000 members in multiple funds, had two-thirds of the $24.8 billion it needed to pay promised benefits as of June 2014. Under Republican Governor Sam Brownback, the state opted for a controversial strategy to bolster the biggest of the plans, the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System, by borrowing and investing the proceeds with the hope of earning a higher return.\nTiming Hinge In January, a group of state and local-government officials warned against the practice. The Government Finance Officers Association called it “speculative” and said it may backfire if investments don’t pan out.\nThe approach hinges on market timing, according to a 2014 study by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. While pension bonds have been profitable because of stock gains since the recession, those sold in other periods, such as before the 2008 crash, lost money, the study found.\nPuerto Rico’s sale of about $3 billion of the debt in 2008 failed to strengthen its pension fund, according to a report from Janney Capital Markets in Philadelphia.\n“It’s usually a symptom of stressed financing when a city or state funds its pensions with long-term debt,” Alan Schankel, managing director at Janney, said in an interview. “There’s no assurance they will end up in a better place.”\n2004 Success Kansas’s 2004 bond issue has improved pension funding, according to the Public Employees Retirement System. The $500 million sale generated about $181 million of returns in excess of the borrowing cost as of Dec. 31.\nThe new debt would give KPERS about 66 percent of the assets for future benefits by year-end, up from 60.7 percent in March, according to legislative documents. It would cut the estimated shortfall to $6.28 billion from $7.26 billion.\nKansas limited its risk by adopting the interest-rate cap. Treasuries rallied Tuesday, pushing 30-year yields to the lowest since early June, as European officials met in Brussels for negotiations over a bailout of Greece. Yields, at about 3.04 percent Tuesday, will climb to 3.23 percent at year-end, according to the median forecast of 54 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\nThe 2004 Kansas debt traded at 4.76 percent Tuesday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Those bonds mature in 2034 and are backed by insurance, an advantage the new securities aren’t likely to have, said MacMurray.\nBrownback proposed the pension debt in January and also recommended shrinking the state’s pension contribution. The governor was responding to pressure on the state’s budget created in part by income-tax cuts that he championed.\nEileen Hawley, a spokeswoman for Brownback, didn’t respond to requests for comment via e-mail and phone. Ashley Murdie, a spokeswoman for Treasurer Ron Estes, declined to comment on the risk that interest rates could rise and block the debt sale.\n“Until the bonds are bid, we won’t know more,” Murdie said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T17:10:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
