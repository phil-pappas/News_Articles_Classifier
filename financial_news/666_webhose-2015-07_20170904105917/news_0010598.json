Monday 19th May 2014 AFR photo Louie Douvis Louie Douvis by Steve Johnson Investing is never easy. It's easy to say you need to be greedy when others are fearful. It is difficult to do so when there are genuine, rational reasons for fear. Likewise, we are told to be fearful when others are greedy. There are exceptions, such as the dot-com bubble of 15 years ago, but in general there is no flashing red light indicating when investors are being greedy. The current environment is a case in point.\nThe Bank of International Settlements' annual missive, released at the end of June, became famous after its pre-financial crisis warnings about the stresses building up in the global financial system. This year's version begins with a summary of the state of affairs: \"Globally, interest rates have been extraordinarily low for an exceptionally long time, in nominal and inflation-adjusted terms, against any benchmark. Such low rates are the most remarkable symptom of a broader malaise in the global economy: the economic expansion is unbalanced, debt burdens and financial risks are still too high, productivity growth too low, and the room for manoeuvre in macroeconomic policy too limited. The unthinkable risks becoming routine and being perceived as the new normal.\"\nThat's hardly a backdrop for a bout of irrational investor exuberance, is it?\nAsset prices around the world are extremely high relative to historic norms, though. Across all asset classes and most parts of the world, the returns on offer are measly. But most investors buying these assets are not doing so driven by greed, rather with a sense of reluctant resignation.\nTen years into the future, we will all be experts on whether 2015 was the right time to be fearful or not. As we sit here today, it's not straightforward. Are asset prices dangerously high, or are they simply a reflection of the interest rate environment?\nDangerous assumption Perhaps both. There's no doubt you can make a logical, rational case for equities and property relative to today's interest rates. The dangerous part is the assumption that those interest rates will stay at current levels. What just a few years ago would have been \"unthinkable\", in the words of the Bank of International Settlements, has become a \"routine\" assumption. Their concerns are worth quoting in full:\n\"For monetary policy, there is a need to fully appreciate the risks to financial and hence macroeconomic stability associated with current policies … a more balanced approach would mean attaching more weight than hitherto to the risks of normalising too late and too gradually. And, where easing is called for, the same should apply to the risks of easing too aggressively and persistently.\n \"Given where we are, normalisation is bound to be bumpy. Risk-taking in financial markets has gone on for too long. And the illusion that markets will remain liquid under stress has been too pervasive. But the likelihood of turbulence will increase further if current extraordinary conditions are spun out. The more one stretches an elastic band, the more violently it snaps back. Restoring more normal conditions will also be essential for facing the next recession, which will no doubt materialise at some point. Of what use is a gun with no bullets left?\"\nI don't like the bank's chances of influencing Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen and her compatriots around the world. It is not human nature to trade a short-term and known risk – derailing a fragile economic recovery – for a longer term and less identifiable risk – allowing financial imbalances to accrue. But the warnings are very pertinent for investors. Negative real interest rates are neither normal nor sustainable.\nMore pertinent than Greece \"Normal\" is itself only vaguely defined, but presumably it means positive real interest rates at the very least. A return to those, something like a 2 percentage point increase from current levels in the United States, represents a far bigger issue for financial markets than Greece defaulting on its debts or leaving the European Union.\nFrom Australian houses to German government bonds, a lot of today's asset prices assume interest rates will stay low for a very long time. Unwinding that assumption could cause a lot of financial pain.\nIt's not all doom and gloom. The 9 per cent retraction in the ASX All Ordinaries Index over the past few months leaves Australian equities looking reasonably priced, especially given interest rates in this country are more likely to fall than rise. In Japan, dramatic changes in corporate culture have the potential to deliver substantially improved equity returns in that country. But the opportunities to invest at attractive rates of return are few and far between.\nWhether or not you call it an interest rate bubble, we should all be treading carefully.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T09:01:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
