The Canadian oil and gas companies have also laid off thousands of workers in recent months, struggling due to slumping global oil prices.\nNexen said the spill was detected on Wednesday afternoon and covered approximately 16,000 square meters (4 acres) but was mostly contained within the pipeline's right of way, which includes muskeg. The Alberta Energy Regulator said it did not contaminate any water bodies.\nThe pipeline and connecting pad site have since been isolated, stopping the leak, and there were no injuries.\nThe 72,000 barrel-per-day Long Lake project is about 36 kilometers (22 miles) southeast of the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray.\nNexen senior communications adviser Kyle Glennie said the company was investigating the cause of the leak and did not know how long it would take to get the pipeline back in service. He was unable to comment on whether production at Long Lake would be affected.\nPeter Murchland, public affairs spokesman for the Alberta Energy Regulator, said investigators had been dispatched.\n\"They are undertaking a fuller assessment of the site and will initiate an investigation, and working with the company to ensure safety and environmental requirements are met,\" Murchland said.\nKeith Stewart, a climate and energy campaigner from Greenpeace Canada, said the spill was a stark reminder that Canada should focus more on improving renewable sources of energy, while Alberta needs to improve oversight.\n\"Any way you look at it, it's a massive spill,\" Stewart said. \"Why couldn't they turn this off?\" (Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Ken Wills )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T03:55:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
