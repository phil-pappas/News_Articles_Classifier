He was cheered as he appeared at the \"no\" rally. \nIn a rare move, 16 former armed forces leaders of Greece have signed a joint declaration calling on the Greek people to show \"calm and national unity\" ahead of the vote. \nThe letter said \"Greece is at a highly critical moment in its history that will require difficult and inevitably painful decisions \n\"All Greeks, united and above party political lines and divisions, must help with all means available to address this situation with calm and national unity.\" \nLeaders of eurozone nations have said a win for \"no\" would be a vote against Greece remaining in the eurozone while Mr Tsipras believes it would actually strengthen his negotiating hand. \nSky (Other OTC: BSYBF - news ) sources say a \"yes\" win would be expected to result in the resignation of the Syriza-led government and the formation of a national unity government. \nIt would be likely to make a quick rescue deal to prevent the prospect of a banking system collapse and exit from the single currency. \nThe head of the country's banking association said that Greek banks have a \"liquidity cushion\" of €1bn - but funds beyond Monday depend on the European Central Bank. \n\"Liquidity is assured until Monday, thereafter it will depend on the ECB decision,\" Louka Katseli said. \nThe figures at the heart of the country's financial crisis were earlier laid bare by the International Monetary Fund. \nThe organisation said Greece faces a huge financial hole regardless of the outcome of the referendum and would need some €50bn (£36bn) as well as a massive debt writedown. \nMore follows...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T22:07:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
