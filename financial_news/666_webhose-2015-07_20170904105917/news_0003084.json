Ma'am, you may begin. Katrina Rymill (VP - IR): Good afternoon and welcome to today's conference call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone some of the statements I will be making today are forward-looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those statements and may be affected by the risks we identified in today's press release and those identified in the filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-Q, filed on May 1, 2015. Equinix assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or comment on forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition, in light of regulations for disclosure, it is Equinix's policy not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. In addition, we'll provide non-GAAP measures on today's conference call. We provide a reconciliation of those measures, the most directly comparable GAAP measures and the list of the reasons why the Company uses these measures in today's press release on the Equinix IR page at www.Equinix.com. We would also like to remind you we post important information about Equinix on the IR page of our website. We encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information. With us today are Steve Smith, Equinix's CEO and President; Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Meyers, Chief Operating Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sales side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in an hour, we would like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on question to just one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steve Smith (CEO, President): Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This marks our 50th quarter of consecutive revenue growth. We delivered both revenue and adjusted EBITDA significantly above the top end of our guidance ranges, our global demand for interconnected data centers drove record net bookings and our second-best gross bookings. This momentum reflects our strategic position in the digital economy and the value of our global platform in addressing customer needs. Additionally, we are extremely well-positioned to capture a sizeable share of enterprise demand driven by a variety of factors, including the rapid adoption of Hybrid Cloud as the architecture of choice. As depicted on slide 3, revenues were $665.6, million up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 10% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $311.3 million for the quarter, up 2% over the prior quarter and up 13% year-over-year delivering a 47% margin. AFFO grew 18% year-over-year to $221.4 million. The benefits of operational discipline and a strategic approach to meeting customer demand continue to manifest in stable pricing, firm yields and one of the lowest churn quarters on record. We now have 6,300 customers around the globe including more than 100 of the Fortune 500. Over 4,000 Equinix employees support our operations, product development and the execution of our go-to-market strategy to offer the only global interconnection platform in the largest retail data center footprint worldwide. With 161,000 cross-connects and vibrant use of our internet and Cloud Exchange offers we sit at the crossroads of the internet where customers locate inside Equinix to innovate and accelerate their businesses. interconnection is 17% of our recurring revenue, making it a $400 million annual business, $400 million. The scope, scale, reach, and diversity of our platform remain without parallel. We are continuing to invest in systems, processes and people to ensure consistent service delivery on a global basis and manage the complexities associated with a massively scaled retail business rapidly approaching 20,000 customer deployments and generating over 0.5 million customer interactions each quarter. 1 of 13", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T17:53:06.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
