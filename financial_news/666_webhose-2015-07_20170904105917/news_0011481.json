The front-December contract had repeatedly bumped up against this resistance but finally broke through, presaging further price rises. \nPrice very briefly dropped back below the resistance level on Friday morning following a weak auction that cleared 5c below the market. However, as is often the case, previous resistance turned into support on the way down and the price rallied through Friday afternoon to finish the week at €7.75, a week-on-week gain of 13c. \nPrice Impact : with the August auction shutdown looming, it is possible we will see further price rises as already-reduced auction supply falls further. \nIt is unclear the extent to which recent price gains can be attributed to increased hedging activity ahead of the supply fall, and how much is due to speculators being relieved by a third Greek bailout. Market Stability Reserve (MSR) 18th September – EU Environment Minister endorsement The EU Commission releases the first post-2020 ETS Review \nThe European Commission (EC) released its proposal for the revision of the EU ETS on Wednesday. The review is deemed necessary to keep Europe on track to meet its aim of a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030 by extracting a 43% reduction from companies covered by the EU ETS. \nThe reduction of supply (both free allocations and auctions to achieve the 43% emissions reduction target) will lead to increased costs for all EU ETS participants. The week ahead \nBreaking and re-testing the technical level of €7.64 may prove to be a significant step towards the analysts’ longer-term higher price forecasts. Combined with July being a bullish month for carbon for the third year in a row and August seeing price gains every year since 2008, the odds are in favour of further price gains over the coming weeks. \nLouis Redshaw is a founder of Redshaw Advisors", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T20:17:54.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
