We are still discussing a location as we have to find an accessible place to work, near the ministries,\" a source close to the talks said on Friday. \nThe negotiating calendar is even tighter than the August 20 payment deadline as the final deal must be approved by lawmakers in Greece and a number of eurozone countries, a process which could easily take up well over a week. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Greece, creditors to begin bailout talks next week: govt source AFP \nGreece and its international creditors will begin talks on a new international bailout worth up to 86 billion euros â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T00:33:52.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
