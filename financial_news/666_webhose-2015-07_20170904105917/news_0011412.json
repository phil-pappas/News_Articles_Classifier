Rob Homer Share on twitter by James Eyers The big four banks and Macquarie will have to carry more capital against mortgages after the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority said on Monday the average \"risk weighting\" for home loans needs to rise from around 16 per cent to \"at least 25 per cent\".\nThe change will come into effect on July 1, 2016 - earlier than the market was expecting.\nAPRA's move, which will be welcomed by the regional banks, will require the big banks to fund their lending with billions of extra dollars of equity capital.\nAPRA said the higher average risk weighting - which the market was expecting - would be the equivalent of increasing minimum capital requirements for the major banks by approximately 80 basis points.\nThis would be around $11 billion across the big four banks. The amount of capital that will need to be raised by each bank will be different and will depend on the size and nature of their loan portfolios and settings of their internal risk models. Banks could also not raise new equity and let their capital ratio fall (given the capital ratio is defined as dollars of capital divided by risk weighted assets).\nMacquarie analyst Mike Wiblin said in a note to clients the additional capital will be able to be raised \"through a mixture of organic generation and partially underwritten dividend reinvestment plans\".\n\"Risk weights\" are determined by big banks themselves and allow them to reduce the amount of capital held against various assets to meet a given capital ratio.\nBecause equity is more expensive than debt, APRA's action could reduce bank returns on equity if the additional costs are not passed on. Banks could pass the costs to customers in the form of higher interest rates on loans, or lower deposit rates, or could also pass costs to shareholders in the form of lower dividends.\n Westpac told the Australian Securities Exchange on Monday morning that the cost of holding higher capital \"will inevitably by borne by customers and shareholders\".\nThe move comes after the financial system inquiry chaired by David Murray called for the average mortgage risk weightings to rise to between 25 per cent and 30 per cent. Mr Murray said this was important to level the playing field for smaller banks, which have to hold more capital against mortgages because they are not accredited to use the \"internal ratings-based\" (IRB) approach to credit risk used by the big banks and Macquarie.\nAPRA indicated the higher risk weights would also help reduce the risk to the financial system from housing. APRA said because mortgages were the biggest exposure for Australian banks, \"strengthening the capital adequacy requirement for residential mortgage exposures under the IRB approach will enhance the resilience of IRB-accredited [banks] and the broader financial system.\"\nMr Murray's interim report last year said \"the increase in housing debt and banks' more concentrated exposure to mortgages mean that housing has become a significant source of systemic risk\".\nBanks respond\nWestpac Banking Corp said the change would require a further $3 billion of capital to lift its CET1 to the top end of the bank's preferred range of 8.75 per cent to 9.25 per cent.\n\"While Westpac is well-placed to meet these changes, increased capital does come at a cost. The cost of holding higher capital will inevitably be borne by customers and shareholders,\" Westpac chief financial officer Peter King said.\nANZ Banking Group said it would need to allocate approximately $2.3 billion of additional capital to the Australian mortgage lending book. \"The impact to ANZ's capital position of approximately 55 basis points is largely as expected following the financial [system] inquiry and is manageable during the APRA transition timetable to 1 July 2016,\" ANZ said.\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia told the ASX the change would increase the amount of common equity tier 1 capital required for Australian residential mortgages by approximately 95 basis points from July next year. CBA chief financial officer, David Craig, said CBA had been \"working on a number of options for managing our capital over the coming year\" in expectation of the announcement and will provide \"more commentary\" at the bank's full year results August 12.\nMacquarie Group told the ASX the impact on its \"APRA Basel III capital surplus would be approximately $150 million (at 8.5 per cent RWAs), equivalent to a 20 basis point reduction in the bank group's CET1 ratio\" and would be accommodated from the existing capital surplus and retained earnings. It said a market update would be provided at its annual general meeting July 23.\nNational Australia Bank said the impact would be around 70 basis points based on its March capital ratios. The bank in May announced a $5.5 billion capital raising which was in part to provide a buffer for these regulatory changes and pushed the CET1 capital ratio to around 10 per cent. NAB said before the market opened on Monday the higher risk weightings \"is now likely to result in a pro forma CET1 ratio within NAB's target range\" of 8.75 per cent to 9.25 per cent.\nAPRA said in an announcement on its website the increased risk weights will apply to all Australian residential mortgages - but not lending to small businesses secured by residential mortgages.\nThe regulator also described the increase as an \"interim measure\" because it is not possible to finalise risk weightings until changes arising from a review by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision are completed at the end of the year. APRA said its changes are moving in the same direction as Basel.\nLast week, APRA responded to the first recommendation of the financial system inquiry, saying it agreed that banks needed to have capital that made them \"unquestionably strong\" but that this would not be measured purely on a relative basis.\nThe additional 80 basis points of equity capital required by the mortgage risk weight changes will form part of the 200 basis points of extra capital that APRA said would be required to put the banks comfortably in the top quartile of international peers based on capitalisation.\n\"To the extent that the major banks respond to the increase in IRB mortgage risk weights being announced today by increasing their actual capital levels to maintain their existing reported capital ratios, it will improve their position relative to international peers and contribute to closing the gap to the fourth quartile,\" APRA said on Monday.\nAPRA said the change would be implemented not be a change to its prudential standards but through an adjustment to the \"correlation factor\"\nWestpac's Mr King said notwithstanding the changes, the bank's Australian bank residential mortgage portfolios \"remain high quality\".\n\"As we outlined in our submission to the FSI, there is no strong evidence that increasing mortgage risk weights for banks using advanced IRB will provide further benefits for customers in an already competitive lending market,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://www.apra.gov.au/MediaReleases/Pages/15_19.aspx", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/eyersj"], "published": "2015-07-20T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T04:10:30.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
