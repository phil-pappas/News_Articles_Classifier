What's happening globally can't be totally ignored,\" said Naeimi. \nOn currency markets the dollar eased to 123.44 yen from 123.56 yen in New York, while the euro changed hands at $1.1073 and 136.78 yen against $1.1058 and 136.64 yen. \nOil prices continued to fall on worries about the global economy as well as a worldwide supply glut. \nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery slipped 14 cents to $47.84 a barrel and Brent crude for September gave up 13 cents to $53.17. \nGold fetched $1,097.75 an ounce compared with $1,091.80 late Tuesday. \nIn other markets: \n-- Taipei fell 0.22 percent, or 19.01 points, to 8,563.48. \nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. closed 1.12 percent higher at Tw$135.5 while Hon Hai Precision added 1.67 percent to Tw$91.5. \n-- Wellington shed 0.38 percent, or 22.39 points, to end at 5,870.77. \nAir New Zealand was up 1.34 percent at NZ$2.65 and Spark lifted 1.22 percent to NZ$2.90. \n-- Manila was flat, edging up 3.80 points to 7,482.83. \nPhilippine Long Distance Telephone was down 0.42 percent at 2,876 pesos, Metrobank gained 0.34 percent to 88.80 pesos and BDO Unibank (Other OTC: BDOUY - news ) added 0.91 percent to 99.50 pesos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T11:56:32.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
