The penthouse itself is understood to be 5,417 sq ft including the car parking spaces and servants quarters downstairs. This would make the sale price £37.9m. It has two floors, three bedroom suites, roof terrace and a cinema room. \nThe new block will be completed by 2016 and is next to Hyde Park and overlooks the Dorchester Hotel. It has underground parking and a luxury spa which is operated by the Harrods 24 hour concierge service. \n• In pictures: The £10m villa behind the Bond baddie underwater lair \n• Your own private island cheaper than the average London home \nThe last luxury apartment complex to spark a debate over the price of property in central London was Clarges Mayfair - built by the leading UK property group, British Land (LSE: BLND.L - news ) . \nThe average price per square foot achieved for the condiminium, which overlooks Green Park, exceeded the £5,000 mark and the penthouse was understood to have sold for close to £7,000 per square foot. However, it was was beated by the equivalent home in 77 Mayfair by a whisker. \nOnly last week an office-to-residential conversion on Mayfair's Upper Brook Street sold for £90m or around £4,285 per sq foot. It was proclaimed to be the \"deal of the year\", but was blown away by the price per square foot of the penthouse at 77 Mayfair. Apartments go for a premium over houses. \n\"Due to the proliferation of listed buildings in Mayfair, new build developments are a real rarity,\" said Richard Cutt, partner at Knight Frank. \nKnight Frank and Wetherell were joint agents on the sale.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T08:49:20.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
