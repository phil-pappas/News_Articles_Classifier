The bank was fined $10,000 by FINRA in December 2010 for equity trade reporting violations stemming from November 2008. \nLike most big banks, Barclays operates it own in-house electronic trading venue, known as a \"dark pool,\" where other brokers can send stock orders to be executed rather than sending them to a stock exchange where they might be charged higher fees and others may see the orders and bet against them. \nNew York's attorney general in June 2014 accused Barclays of fraud over how it operated within its dark pool, saying it misled investors to boost its own profits. Barclays has denied any wrongdoing and said that no investors have been harmed. \nSeparately, FINRA settled a case with a unit of UBS Group AG (Other OTC: OUBSF - news ) last week that opens that bank up to new scrutiny of its compliance supervision of its electronic trading platform over the next nine months. \nThe case stemmed from a follow-up examination from another FINRA case in which UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) paid $12 million in fines in 2011 and agreed to fix certain data reporting problems. In a follow-up examination two years later, the regulator found ongoing violations in which batches of trades entered electronically by UBS into a FINRA audit system were incomplete or inaccurate. \n(Reporting by John McCrank; Editing by Bill Rigby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T23:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T00:51:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
