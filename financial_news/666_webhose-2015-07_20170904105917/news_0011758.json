Max Mason-Hubers by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell The Salteri family-controlled Duncan Solutions parking management company is undertaking a strategic review, which could result in a $100 million sale.\nDuncan provides around 60 per cent of Australia's parking meters, although the lion's share of earnings are derived from the United States.\nOther shareholders include the Smorgon family and Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation.\nDuncan chairman and UBS consultant David Di Pilla sent a letter to all shareholders last week, which said the company had received a number of inbound enquiries. Duncan has engaged with parties regarding a potential sale but has not ruled out an initial public offering.\nDuncan is expected to garner significant private equity interest due to the company's stable cash flows and long-term clients, such as United States municipalities, states and tollroads.\nLogical strategic buyers would include Serco, Vinci, and Xerox. Redflex, an ASX-listed traffic systems developer, would be considered a listed comparable company in the case of an IPO.\nDuncan generated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of around $US8 million ($10.6 million) in fiscal year 2015, and this could be up to 50 per cent higher in fiscal 2016 due to strong growth in the US business.\nThe Salteri family has a 58 per cent stake in Duncan, while the Smorgon family and Commonwealth Super each own about 10 per cent of the parking and toll road infringement processing and collections company.\n Around 90 per cent of Duncan's business is in the US where it manages and processes parking citations, collects delinquent parking or tolling debts, manages on-street parking infrastructure and provides registered owner information.\nThe Salteri family was valued at $1.17 billion in BRW magazine's Rich Families edition in July last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:12:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
