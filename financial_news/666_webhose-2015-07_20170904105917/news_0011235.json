China's stock market dropped further on Wednesday as companies scrambled to have their shares suspended amid investor panic. More than 30 percent has been knocked off the value of Chinese shares since mid-June, with some investors fearing that the market's turmoil will destabilize the real economy. China is Brazil's top trading partner and a major purchaser of Latin American raw materials. Concern over Chinese economic growth tends to drive down the value of the region's currencies. Nearly every Latin American currency weakened, though moves were slight in the Mexican and Colombian pesos . Brazil's real dropped for the fourth straight day to trade at 3.23 per dollar in the mid-afternoon. Traders said Wednesday's decline was amplified by efforts to cut losses by exiting positions in the real in favor of the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, yields on Brazilian interest rate futures <0#DIJ:> dropped across the curve after data on Wednesday showed inflation rose less than expected in June. Brazil's Bovespa stock index erased the previous session's gains, driven lower by commodities exporters such a iron-ore miner Vale, which counts China as its biggest customer.
