HMC 2.42 % of defective torque converters; Land Rover of tire alignment problems; Mazda Motor Corp. 7261 -3.13 % of faulty engine valves; and Ford Motor Co. F -0.80 % of spark plug issues; as well as in dozens of other cases in recent years. \nAuto makers have used the bulletins for decades to alert dealers to potential problems with their cars and trucks. Plaintiffs’ lawyers increasingly deploy them in class actions, in support of claims auto makers knowingly sold defective products. \n“They basically tell us what the manufacturer knew and when they knew it,” said Joseph R. Santoli, a New Jersey lawyer who represents customers in a class action against BMW. “Unfortunately, buyers are not told about these problems ahead of time.” \nThe service bulletins have appeared in lawsuits for decades but are now commonplace, as plaintiffs’ lawyers have peeled away from personal injury work to focus on suits against auto makers, which are less expensive to pursue, lawyers said. \nAuto makers say the litigation hasn’t altered their practices. \nA spokeswoman for Jaguar Land Rover said, “We agree the plaintiff’s bar uses Technical Service Bulletins as a basis for class-action suits, but that does not change our practice to continue to provide clear technical guidance to our retailers.” The spokeswoman added that the tire-wear litigation was resolved in a settlement. \nBMW, Honda, Mazda and Ford didn’t respond to requests for comment. \nClass actions involving motor vehicles settle for more money, on average, than those involving other industries. A study of settlements from 2010 to 2013 by National Economic Research Associates found that the average automotive class action netted $247 million. The majority of cases that survive auto makers’ initial motion to dismiss end up settling, according to defense lawyers. \n‘ We don’t let litigation risk get in the way of vehicle quality, customer satisfaction or safety. ’ —a spokesman for General Motors \nThe increase in class action claims has followed more aggressive policing of the industry by prosecutors and regulators, industry experts said, including the continuing criminal investigation of General Motors Co. for an ignition-switch defect that has been linked to more than 100 deaths. The company is also facing private lawsuits. Two bulletins GM issued in 2005 and 2006 are central to the litigation, according to one of the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs. \n“We don’t let litigation risk get in the way of vehicle quality, customer satisfaction or safety,” said a spokesman for GM. “From our standpoint, we have to completely put that in the background. If it’s going to happen, it’s going to happen.” \nLast year, Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. TM -0.64 % agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle a U.S. criminal investigation into its disclosure of safety problems related to unintentional acceleration in some of its vehicles. \nToyota declined to comment for this article. \n“[Auto makers] are being monitored in a way they weren’t before by class lawyers and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,” said Sean Kane, president of Safety Research & Strategies Inc., a safety research firm that has been critical of GM and Toyota. \nAs a result, auto makers have shown more of a willingness to issue recalls in lieu of technical service bulletins, Mr. Kane said. Some 64 million vehicles were recalled in the U.S. in 2014, a record number, according to government data.
