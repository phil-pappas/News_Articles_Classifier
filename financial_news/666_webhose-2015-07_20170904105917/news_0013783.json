ADVERTISEMENT In a letter to be delivered to the White House Monday, the lawmakers say evolving trends surrounding employer retirement packages have put a financial squeeze on the nation's retirees. They want the president to fill the gap by expanding Social Security.\n\"As employers continue moving from a defined benefit model to a defined contribution model of retirement savings, it is critical that we fight to protect and expand Social Security –– the only guaranteed source of income in retirement,\" the lawmakers write. \nTheir campaign coincides with Monday's White House Conference on Aging, a once-in-a-decade event where administration officials will discuss specific policy prescriptions for the nation's seniors. \nThe Democrats want a Social Security expansion to be \"the number one retirement security recommendation\" put forth by the White House. \nThe Democrats cite polls indicating that such an expansion is both necessary –– \"more than half (53 percent) of today's working Americans are not expected to have sufficient resources upon retirement to maintain their standard of living,\" they write –– and enormously popular. \n\"This support crosses party lines: 90 percent of Democrats, 73 percent of Independents, and 73 percent of Republicans favor expanding Social Security,\" they write. \nThe letter is spearheaded by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee and a 2016 presidential contender, and Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.). They join Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and 68 other House Democrats in endorsing the letter. \nSenior advocates are also joining the fight. A host of liberal groups plan to deliver a petition –– 2 million signatures long –– to the Aging conference on Monday echoing the lawmakers' push for a Social Security expansion. The sponsoring groups include the AFL-CIO, the Campaign for America's Future, the National Organization for Women and Social Security Works. \nSocial Security has been a hot-and-cold issue between Obama and his liberal allies on Capitol Hill. The president infuriated many Democrats in 2013 when he unveiled a 2014 budget package that linked future cost-of-living increases in Social Security, among other federal programs, to the so-called chained consumer-price-index (CPI), which would reduce benefits over time. \nThe move was largely political: Obama had included the provision as an olive branch to Republicans, who have long-championed benefit cuts under Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid in the name of reducing spending and shrinking government. But the provision did nothing to bring GOP leaders to the budget negotiating table. \nAlthough Obama had emphasized that he would consider the chained-CPI provision only as part of a package deal that included tax hikes, many liberal Democrats were nonetheless outraged that he would open the door to cutting seniors benefits. \nSanders on Sunday, while describing Obama as a friend, said the president made a mistake in thinking Republicans were willing partners in legislative compromise. \n\"What he did after the election is what he said to the millions of people who were so excited about his campaign, he says, 'Hey, thank you very much for electing me; I will take it from here. I'll sit down with John Boehner. I will sit down with Mitch McConnell. I'll sit down with Republicans and I'm going to negotiate some fair compromises,'\" Sanders said on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" program. \n\"The truth is Republicans never wanted to negotiate. All they wanted to do was obstruct.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T08:38:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
