As part of the city's U.S. Bankruptcy Court-approved plan, that debt was due to be sold in the U.S. municipal market in a fixed-rate mode by May 9. The city obtained an extension to that deadline while awaiting final action on a Michigan bill aimed at boosting security for the bonds, as well as for the completion of a fiscal 2014 financial audit that has since been released.\nThe Michigan law places a specific statutory lien on Detroit income tax revenue pledged to pay off the debt. The city is hoping the stronger payment pledge on the bonds will result in investment grade ratings and lower interest rates that could save it as much as $30 million over the life of the issue.\nProceeds from the privately placed bonds were earmarked for retiring a prior $120 million Barclays loan to the city, to pay certain creditor claims from the bankruptcy and to finance city improvements.
