Reuters by Robin Wigglesworth When the producers of The Newsroom , the HBO drama, needed a device that allowed a fictional reporter to dig around a hostile takeover, there was only one candidate for the role.\n\"They finally got one for me, a Bloomberg terminal,\" the character says, salivating over the prospect of \"instantaneous access to all the financial information in the world\". Such is her fascination that she is even oblivious to the Boston marathon bombing that acts as the real-life backdrop to the episode.\nThe terminal may not look like a natural television starlet at first blush. The basic user system – the clunky keyboard, shrill text colours and black background of its blinking screens – are largely unchanged since its 1980s launch. Other products offer similar services for far less than its $US24,000 ($32,200) annual cost.\nYet none have managed to worm themselves quite so utterly into the fabric of finance. In 2010 the understanding fiancee of a BlackRock fund manager commissioned a wedding cake shaped like a Bloomberg terminal .\nEven high culture has acknowledged its status. Last week the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History started displaying the old Bloomberg keyboard of bond market legend Bill Gross as part of its American Enterprise exhibition.\nFor bankers, traders and money managers, these examples of the terminal's ubiquity are entirely unsurprising, with many admitting a near-addiction. \"I genuinely don't know how I'd manage without the terminal,\" says Matt Russell, a fund manager at M&G Investments in London. \"It's quite sad, really.\"\nThe dependence became vividly clear when Bloomberg terminals suffered a global outage lasting several hours earlier this year, paralysing parts of the financial system. Philip O'Sullivan, chief economist for Ireland at Investec, Tweeted at the time: \"Bloomberg being down has finally made me understand how teenagers feel when Facebook crashes.\"\nThe addiction has many facets and causes. The terminal in part is a potent sign of prestige on Wall Street. A personal Bloomberg terminal used to be a traditional perk when investment bankers were promoted to managing director, even though the actual data-crunching was done by lowly peons. But Michael Bloomberg's empire has taken calculated steps to ensure that people stay hooked on the terminal.\n One of the company's strategies has always been to amass every conceivable scrap of data or possible service onto the terminal. While Bloomberg runs a mammoth newswire to keep subscribers informed, the company has always allowed – even paid – for other news services to be streamed alongside its own (including the Financial Times ).\nThat way, users never have to leave the terminal's digital embrace. \"No matter how much you learn to do, you always feel that you're just scratching the surface of what the terminal is capable of,\" Mr Russell says.\nChat-room appeal To keep users hooked, an esoteric ecosystem has sprung up around the core data and news services, offering niche extras that bind the machine ever more tightly to the financial world.\nSome of the more popular are known only by the keystrokes users have to enter on the terminal to access the functions: DINE and FLY allow financiers to quickly check out local eateries and flights, the former vetted and reviewed by like-minded, price-insensitive colleagues and rivals. But POSH offers perhaps the most telling insight into the world of finance.\nThe function is a high-end classifieds site exclusive to Bloomberg terminal users, where bankers and hedge fund managers can buy and sell sports cars, condos or holiday homes in Gstaad. On a typical day recently, POSH advertised a $US2.75 million condo in New York's Chelsea neighbourhood, an apartment in Mallorca and a rare $US20,000 Rolex watch.\nYet Bloomberg's pioneering instant messaging and chat rooms, not data or news, are arguably the biggest drivers of its dominance. The bond market – where trading mostly happens discreetly between fund managers, brokers and banks, rather than on bourses – is particularly dependent on the Instant Bloomberg messaging function. But \"I'll IB you\" has become lingua franca across the financial world.\nThe dominance of Bloomberg chat is a significant \"economic moat\" for the company. Gabriel Sterne, head of global macro research at Oxford Economics, says the consultancy planned to rely on Thomson Reuters' similar but cheaper Eikon service, but was eventually forced to sign up for a Bloomberg terminal too.\n\"Most of the functionality is the same and the macro data is much better [on the Eikon]. But everyone loves IB, particularly on the buy side [institutional investors],\" he says. \"So if we want to have good, quick access to our existing and potential clients, it is very difficult not to go with Bloomberg.\"\nImpenetrable to outsiders Bloomberg works cunningly to keep its addicted users supplied even if they face a spell of unemployment, often offering the use of a terminal free of charge for three months, or even longer.\nStill, the terminal can seem impenetrable to people outside the financial industry, and its dominance bizarre. Some idiosyncrasies – such as the basic look and archaic but immutable user interface – are completely unfathomable to outsiders.\nFinanciers and bankers sheepishly put this down to the industry's conservatism: no one likes drastic changes to a system they have become dependent on, and prefer incremental tweaks. But for all its power and versatility, the terminal undeniably looks dated compared to newer, sleeker counterparts.\nMoreover, rival data providers such as Thomson Reuters and Dow Jones are attempting to chip away at its incumbent advantage in instant messaging. Even banks are unhappy about shelling out small fortunes for what some wags say is a glorified chat room, and are spooked by Bloomberg's dominance.\nMost of all, however, it is the terminal's expense that is increasingly problematic, at a time when the financial industry is still pruning costs as far as possible.\n\"They were the first and it's very sticky, but Bloomberg's rivals are putting together impressive alternatives, and Bloomberg's monthly price tag is quite high,\" notes John Brady, a salesman at Chicago brokerage RJ O'Brien.", "external_links": ["http://www.pinkcakebox.com/bloomberg-terminal-grooms-cake/", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-29/gross-s-terminal-keyboard-to-be-displayed-at-smithsonian"], "published": "2015-07-10T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:08:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
