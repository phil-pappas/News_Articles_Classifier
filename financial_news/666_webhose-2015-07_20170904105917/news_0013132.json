Imran is the editor of \"Kalom\", a vernacular daily that was owned by the Saradha Group till 2013 when it was bought by Kalom Welfare Association. Quizzed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) earlier too, Imran appeared at its office at the CGO complex here in response to a summons. \"We had summoned him for questioning in Saradha case,\" said a CBI officer. Launched as a magazine, \"Kalom\" was turned into a daily newspaper after the Saradha group bought it in 2011. The Enforcement Directorate which too is probing the case, had also interrogated him in August 2014 about his alleged financial transactions with the Saradha Group.
