The consortium includes US company Talos and Britain's Premier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) . \nSeven consortiums and 18 individual companies had qualified for the auction, but only nine participated in the end. \nUS giants ExxonMobil and Chevron, Anglo-Australian firm BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) , France's Total (Swiss: FP.SW - news ) and Russia's Lukoil decided to skip the shallow water projects. \n\"It's terrible. It's a failure,\" David Shields, a Mexico-based industry analyst and director of the magazine Energia a Debate, told AFP. \n\"It was the worst week because oil prices are very low and because of the (nuclear) deal\" between Iran and world powers on the eve of the auction, Shields said. \nAnalysts had warned that the auction could be affected by the nuclear deal because it will cause oil prices to slide further as sanctions on Iran's oil exports are dropped, adding 1.5 million barrels of crude per day in the market. \nMexico's government will now have to look ahead four more auctions that include more complex blocks such as deep-water oil fields and onshore drilling, and which are expected to draw more interest from industry giants. \n- Indian, Malaysian bids fail - \nThe government estimated that each block was worth $1.3 billion. Those not awarded on Wednesday will be offered again at later auctions. \nWhile nine of the blocks lacked bidders, three were not awarded because the offers fell short of government demands. \nIndia's OGNC Videsh was the sole bidder for two blocks, but its offers fell short of the minimum take that the government was seeking. \nA team comprising US firm Murphy Worldwide and Malaysia's Petronas made an offer of 35 percent for the fourth block, but it was under the government's demand of 40 percent. \nSierra's consortium outbid Italian giant ENI (NYSE: E - news ) and Norway's Statoil (Xetra: 675213 - news ) for one of the blocks off Tabasco state, offering the government 69 percent of the proceeds in a production-sharing deal. \nIt won another block off Veracruz by offering nearly 56 percent. \nMidway through the auction, when two of seven blocks had been awarded, National Hydrocarbon Commission president Juan Carlos Zepeda had struck a positive note, saying \"we like the results.\" \nOfficials were to address reporters again later Wednesday. \nThe underwhelming result adds to a bad week for Pena Nieto's administration following the embarrassing fallout of the weekend jailbreak of the country's most powerful drug lord, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, his second escape in 14 years. \n- Revive production - \nThe reform breaks the monopoly on drilling held by state-run firm Pemex since the industry's 1938 nationalization. \nWhile Pemex qualified for the auction, it sat out this time and could participate in future contests. \nPena Nieto hopes the reform will reverse years of declining production -- from 3.5 million barrels per day in 2004 to 2.3 million now -- and give a boost to the economy. \nOil auctions are a new thing for Mexico and officials wanted to make them the most transparent in the world. The event was shown on a live Internet broadcast. \nAnalysts say the government made an effort to create a transparent system to ease any concerns over the country's poor track record when it comes to corruption.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T23:06:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
