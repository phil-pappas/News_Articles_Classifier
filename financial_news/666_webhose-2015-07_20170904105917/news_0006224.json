(\"Citigroup\") announced today the applicable Reference Yield and Total Consideration for the previously announced cash tender offers (each, an \"Offer\" and, collectively, the \"Offers\") with respect to each series of Notes listed in the table below (the \"Notes\"). \nThe Offers are being made pursuant to the offer to purchase dated June 9, 2015 (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the \"Offer to Purchase\"), and the related letter of transmittal (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the \"Letter of Transmittal\") which set forth in more detail the terms and conditions of the Offers. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this announcement shall have the meaning given to them in the Offer to Purchase. \nThe Total Consideration and Tender Offer Consideration for each series of Notes were determined based on the relevant Reference Yield as of 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 23, 2015, in accordance with the terms set forth in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the relevant Fixed Spread and the relevant Reference U.S. Treasury Security as follows: \nThe Early Tender Date for the Offers has now passed. Because the aggregate principal amount of the 6.000% Subordinated Notes due 2033 tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date exceeded the applicable original Maximum Series Tender Cap, Citigroup will not accept for purchase any additional Notes of these series tendered after the Early Tender Date. All the Notes of these series that were validly tendered at or prior the Early Tender Date will be accepted for purchase on the Early Settlement Date. \nBecause the aggregate principal amount of the 6.125% Subordinated Notes due 2036 tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date did not exceed the Maximum Series Tender Cap, Citigroup will continue to accept for purchase Notes of this series up to the Maximum Series Tender Cap (subject to possible proration). All of the Notes of this series that were validly tendered at or prior the Early Tender Date will be accepted for purchase on the Early Settlement Date. Holders of this series of Notes that are validly tendered after the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase will receive the applicable Tender Offer Consideration, which is equal to the applicable Total Consideration minus the applicable Early Tender Premium. \nThe obligation of Citigroup to accept for purchase, and to pay the Tender Offer Consideration or the Total Consideration, as the case may be, for Notes validly tendered pursuant to the Offers is subject to, and conditional upon, the satisfaction or, where applicable, waiver of a number of conditions described in the Offer to Purchase and to proration. Citigroup reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to waive any one or more of the conditions at any time. \nCitigroup has retained its affiliate, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., to serve as the sole dealer manager for the Offers. Global Bondholder Services Corporation has been retained to serve as the depositary and information agent with respect to the Notes. \nFor additional information regarding the terms of the Offers, please contact Citigroup Global Markets Inc. at either (800) 558-3745 (toll free) or (212) 723-6106. Requests for documents and questions regarding the tender of Notes may be directed to Global Bondholder Services Corporation at (866) 470-4300 (toll free) or (212) 430-3774 (collect). \nThe Offer to Purchase and related Letter of Transmittal were first distributed to holders of Notes on June 9, 2015 and the related launch press release was published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange ( www.bourse.lu ) on June 9, 2015. Copies of the Offer to Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal may also be obtained at no charge from Global Bondholder Services Corporation. \nNone of Citigroup, its board of directors, the dealer manager, the depository or the information agent makes any recommendation as to whether any Holder of the Notes subject to the Offers should tender or refrain from tendering all or any portion of the principal amount of the Notes. \nThis press release is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation to buy any of these Notes nor is it a solicitation for acceptance of any of the Offers. Citigroup is making the Offers only by, and pursuant to the terms of, the Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal. The Offers are not being made to (nor will tenders of Notes be accepted from or on behalf of) holders of Notes in any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the securities, blue sky or other laws of such jurisdiction. This announcement must be read in conjunction with the Offer to Purchase and, where applicable, the related Letter of Transmittal. \nUnited Kingdom.
