There is also a further 296,292 square metres of potential withdrawal identified.\nIt says that in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, 47 per cent of the stock withdrawn from CBD and fringe markets is for a change of use to residential, with a further 26 per cent slated for a likely residential-hotel development and 7 per cent with pure hotel proposals.\nKnight Frank head of institutional sales for Australia, James Parry, said most of the office stock withdrawal activity was happening in the Sydney market.\n\"This is essentially because of the lack of development sites in the CBD and immediate surrounds. With much of the current residential development further out in the fringe, there is a push for future development to be more concentrated in the central areas,\" Mr Parry said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T22:26:35.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
