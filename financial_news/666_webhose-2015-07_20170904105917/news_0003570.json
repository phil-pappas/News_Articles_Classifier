Draghi said a vote early Thursday by the Greek parliament to enact reforms, and a pledge by its creditors over bridge financing, broke the negative spiral.\n“Things have changed now,” he said. “We had a series of news with the approval of the bridge-financing package, with the various votes in various parliaments, to begin with in the Greek parliament, which have now restored the conditions for a raise in Emergency Liquidity Assistance.”\nThe Governing Council increased the cap on ELA by 900 million euros ($980 million), Draghi said. The funds, provided by the Greek central bank with the ECB’s approval, had been capped at 88.6 billion euros since late June, when political talks on a bailout appeared to be collapsing.\nBridge Loan Now euro-area finance ministers have agreed in principle to extend a 7 billion-euro bridge loan to Greece to tide the country over until the start of a three-year aid package worth as much as 86 billion euros. The processes for parliamentary approvals around the region start immediately, with Germany, the largest creditor, voting on Friday.\nThe cash will allow Greece to meet the repayment on a 3.5 billion-euro bond held by the ECB that matures on Monday, and defuse the ticking time bomb of a default that would have required the ECB to cut off its bank aid, bringing on a financial collapse.\nThe unruly negotiations over more than five months created political rancor and the suggestion by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble on Thursday morning that “the better way” may be for Greece to leave the euro area temporarily. His boss, Chancellor Angela Merkel, risks a revolt by her Christian Democratic lawmakers when Germany’s parliament votes.\nImplementation Doubts “I’m not going to comment on politicians’ statements,” Draghi said. “I only know what’s our mandate, and our mandate is to act based on the assumption that Greece is and will be a member of the euro area.”\nChallenges remain for Greece in implementing its new austerity program. Thirty-eight members of the 149 lawmakers Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’ Syriza party refused to back the bill. Draghi said Greece must consistently apply the reform measures it has been handed in return for its bailout.\n“No matter whom you talk to, there are I’d say questions about the implementation will and capacity,” he said. “It will be really in the Greek government’s capacity to respond with policy decisions, with actions, that will dispel these doubts.”\nThe perceived risk in the financial markets that Greece would exit the euro area didn’t derail the region’s economic recovery, the ECB president added. Nevertheless, if risks arise that monetary conditions could worsen, the ECB stands ready to use its arsenal in response.\nCapital Controls “If any factors were to lead to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy, or if the outlook for price stability were to materially change, the Governing Council would respond to such a situation by using all the instruments available within its mandate,” he said. “Economic risks have been contained as a result our monetary policy.”\nInstead, the region’s economy continues to show signs of growth and even the potential for an investment pickup, Draghi said.\nThe ECB granting of more liquidity for Greek banks contrasts with an earlier proposal. Officials had suggested a continuing freeze on the cap, people familiar with the matter said. The Greek central bank had asked for an increase of 1.5 billion euros, the people said. A spokesman for the Greek central bank declined to comment.\nWhile officials “substantially accommodated” the Bank of Greece’s request for emergency liquidity, it was also “scaled to one week,” Draghi said. He also said it remains “hard to predict” when capital controls might be lifted.\n“If things continue in a positive way instead of downward as in recent days, we will have a phase during which the Bank of Greece and the ECB will work together to look at how they can meet the demands of the Greek economy,” he said.\nThe increase in funding helps to begin the process of normalizing conditions in the banking system, where lenders have been shut for more than two weeks and customers are barred from withdrawing more than 60 euros a day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T22:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T18:13:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
