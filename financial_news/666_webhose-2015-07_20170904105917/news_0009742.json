But analysts said it was unclear why exactly it had performed so well. Saudi Arabian companies usually post short earnings notices before publishing detailed financial reports days later.\nSaudi International Petrochemical Co (Sipchem) tumbled 8.9 percent to 29.20 riyals in the heaviest trade since early May after announcing its quarterly profit had fallen 55 percent to 110.1 million riyals ($29.4 million). Analysts surveyed by Reuters had expected 133.3 million riyals.\nThe stock broke technical support at 31.00 riyals, its lows since mid-May, triggering a bearish right triangle pointing down to the March and April lows around 26.00 riyals.\nNational Industrialization Co (Tasnee) dropped 3.3 percent, having swung to a net loss for the second quarter. Analysts had forecast a profit.\nUAE, EGYPT\nMost Other Gulf markets suffered smaller losses, having closed earlier in the day when oil had slipped just a little from Sunday's close.\nDubai's index inched down 0.1 percent as heavyweight lenders Dubai Islamic Bank and Emirates NBD rose 0.8 percent and 1.4 percent respectively, offsetting losses in most other stocks.\nAlso, engineering firm Drake & Scull rose 0.1 percent after saying it had won a 218 million dirham ($59.4 million) contract from an educational institution in Kuwait.\nAbu Dhabi's bourse slipped 0.2 percent. First Gulf Bank, down 0.7 percent, was the main drag. The UAE's third largest lender by assets posted an 8 percent rise in second-quarter net profit on Sunday, which was in line with analysts' estimates.\nQatar's index was almost flat, with an equal split between gainers and losers. Mobile phone operator Ooredoo fell 1.0 percent after its Kuwaiti subsidiary reported a 30 percent decline in quarterly profit. The Kuwaiti unit's shares fell 3.4 percent.\nEgypt's bourse fell 1.5 percent with most stocks in the red. The Cairo index had surged as much as 8.1 percent this month as it rebounded from a one-year low hit on July 9, so some investors may be booking profits now.\nAlso, Pioneers Holding said on Monday it was seeking an initial share offer by its affiliated real estate developer Rooya worth at least 1 billion Egyptian pounds ($128 million) this quarter. This could temporarily drain liquidity from the market.\nMONDAY'S HIGHLIGHTS\nSAUDI ARABIA\n* The index dropped 2.4 percent to 9,080 points.\nDUBAI\n* The index slipped 0.1 percent to 4,146 points.\nABU DHABI\n* The index edged down 0.2 percent to 4,873 points.\nQATAR\n* The index inched up 0.04 percent to 11,914 points.\nEGYPT\n* The index slid 1.5 percent to 7,888 points.\nKUWAIT\n* The index slipped 0.4 percent to 6,260 points.\nOMAN\n* The index edged down 0.2 percent to 6,568 points.\nBAHRAIN\n* The index inched up 0.04 percent to 1,338 points.
