The most difficult decision being made by people seeking bail, is knowing who to trust. ABC Bail Bonds President Jonathan Yellin wants Philadelphians to enjoy this weekend’s Fourth of July holiday, but warns everyone to be safe and obey the law. \"Anybody who needs a bail bondsman in Philadelphia should Call ABC first…get out fast.”\n“Over the Fourth of July holiday period in Philadelphia, we see an increase in alcohol-related assault charges and of course, there will be a spike in DUI arrests due to the increased police presence,” says Yellin. “We hope people don’t need us but we have Philadelphia bail bonds agents available 24 hours a day for no extra cost.”\nSometimes the P.P.D. has an increased presence during the Fourth of July holiday. In Pennsylvania drinking and driving remains a top safety issue. In 2013, alcohol-related crashes decreased to 11,041 from 11,956 alcohol-related crashes in 2012, but it is still way too many. In 2013, alcohol-related deaths were 32% of the total traffic deaths, nearly the same as in 2010, 2011 and 2012.\nIf the worst does happen and people find themselves arrested in Philadelphia, ABC Bail Bonds in Philly says that all is not lost. \"There are ways we can get you out of jail, even outside of regular business hours. We have agents available in Philadelphia 24 hours a day and we provide the fastest release the jail will allow. We also offer easy payment plans,” says Yellin.\nSome tips to know about Bail Bonds :\nThe Number to ABC Bail Bonds in Philadelphia: It is not good enough to have the number in a cell phone. The police will take the phone upon arrest in Philadelphia County. \"You will be able to make your call once you are in the holding tank and there is no phone book. Our number is: (215) ABC-BAIL or (215) 222-2245.\"\nStash Cash: Most ATMs have a per-day limit on what people can withdraw. \"If you don’t want to be stuck inside until the bank re-opens, leave extra cash for bail with someone you can trust, who will bring it to our office and co-sign your bond,\" says Yellin. This will allow the fastest jail release available after the booking process.\nBe Ready to Provide Name, Birth Date, Phone Number and Jail Location: The bail bondsman will get more information later, but that is what is needed to start the process.\n\"What you should know is that even if there isn’t a judge available, there are things we can do to post the bond on your behalf. Despite what people may believe, in most cases, there is no need to wait in jail until after the holiday passes. ABC Bail Bonds is open 24/7, 365 days a year and helps thousands of people get out day and night,\" says Yellin.\n“The main thing is, if they have valid identification, their jail location and a method of payment, and cosigners we can probably take care of the rest,” said Yellin, who will have his team of bail bonds agents on duty during the Fourth of July holiday.\nABC Bail Bonds is a licensed bail bonds company in Pennsylvania with locations and agents all over the state.
