Jesse Marlow Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Tony Abbott has washed his hands of media law reform, prompting accusations from Nine Network chief executive David Gyngell that the Prime Minister's stated support for free markets and business was being applied selectively.\nAnd Fairfax Media, which publishes The Australian Financial Review , has demanded the competition watchdog scrutinise Foxtel's proposed purchase of 15 per cent of Ten Network , saying it has enabled News Corp to circumvent the two-out-of-three rule that supposedly limits the number of media platforms a company can own in a single market.\nUnder pressure from segments of the media and his rural and regional MPs to re-think his refusal to overturn obsolete media ownership laws and deregulate the market, the Prime Minister said he would act only if there was a consensus among all big players, something that is unlikely.\n\"The trouble with media reform is that all too often there's a question of picking one business interest against another business interest,\" he said.\n\"That's why I would urge all of those who would like to see change here to sit down and hammer out something which is good for everyone, hammer out something that has something for everyone, and once that's done obviously the government is prepared to look at it.\"\nAfter being lobbied by Seven West Media's Kerry Stokes and News Corp, Mr Abbott blocked Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull's attempt to abolish the audience reach rule that would have enabled mergers and acquisitions to help struggling regional broadcasters survive, and he blocked abolishing the two-out-of-three rule.\nThe legislation was introduced before the development of the internet or pay TV.\nFailure to deliver Mr Gyngell said the government had been elected as a free-market government and its failure to deliver much-needed media reforms was inconsistent with that.\n\"This government was voted as free market and pro business. At the moment they seem to be selective,\" he told The Australian Financial Review.\nFollowing Prime Media Group chairman John Hartigan's criticism of Mr Abbott's \"bloody-minded captain's pick to look after two media mates\", Fairfax Media chief executive Greg Hywood said he was \"extremely sympathetic\" to the regional broadcaster's plight but stressed Fairfax was not under any pressure because of the existing regulation.\nBut he wanted the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to examine Foxtel's proposed purchase of 15 per cent of Ten Network. Mr Hywood said the proposed purchase meant News Corp, which owns 50 per cent of Foxtel, had \"essentially gamed\" the system.\nFairfax would be making a submission to the competition regulator, he said.\n\"This must be an issue for the ACCC because the market has been distorted by the actions of a couple of media moguls.\"\n\"News Corp and its family interests have woven together a mix of their publishing assets, their interests in Ten, Foxtel, Presto and radio … they have gamed the government. It's supposed to be two out of three and it's more like five out of five.\nBad old days \"The market should determine investments in the media industry in this country. This is not the 1970s. We shouldn't be going back to the bad old days where media moguls, in a few telephone calls, divided the country up for their own self interest.\"\nThe two out of three rule means that no entity can control more than two out of newspapers, free-to-air TV and radio. The other rule the regional networks, Nine Network and Fairfax would like removed is the reach rule, which prevents TV licence holders broadcasting to more than 75 per cent of the population.\n\"This is not an issue of financial need for Fairfax Media,\" Mr Hywood said. \"We are in a very strong financial position. We have transformed publishing, we have significant growth vehicles, including Domain, and we are net cash. But we and all media companies should have optionality – not be restrained by out-of-date legislation.\"\nMr Hywood said it was not true that Fairfax had an interest in buying into free-to-air television. \"That is not our strategy,\" he said.\nSources said the most contentious aspects of the proposed deal, which the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has said it will review by September, are Foxtel and Ten's plans to combine their sales force and bid jointly for NRL and AFL broadcast rights. Ten's advertising sales will be run by Foxtel-Fox Sports venture Multi Channel Network, in which Ten will become a 25 per cent shareholder.\nACCC submissions are due by the end of July.\nAustralian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) must also approve the deal.\nMore job losses The implication for WIN Corporation, Prime and Southern Cross of retaining the rules are more job losses and further cutting back of local news and other content.\nThis has got the regional and rural Coalition MPs up in arms.\nMr Abbott was conscious of the problem but offered no assistance in the form of deregulation or anything else.\n\"I'm determined to ensure that we get a fair go for regional Australia,\" he said.\n\"I'm very conscious of the fact that under the licences which media proprietors operate under, local content, including local news, is very important.\n\"I would certainly expect to see a continued strong local content and local news from regional media providers.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-02T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:16:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
