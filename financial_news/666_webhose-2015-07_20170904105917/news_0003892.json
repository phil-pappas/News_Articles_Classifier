Many firms are still reeling from financial losses from the shutdown. \nKaesong is a key earner for the cash-strapped North. The hard currency wages are kept by the state, which passes on a fraction -- in local currency -- to the workers. \nCross-border tensions have remained high this year due to a series of North Korean ballistic missile tests, nuclear threats and annual US-South Korean military exercise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T05:29:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
