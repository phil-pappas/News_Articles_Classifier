Anchor tenants of Macquarie Park are large multinational corporations – 12 of the top 100 companies in the world by market capitalisation are located in Macquarie Park.\nJLL has conducted detailed monitoring of the Macquarie Park office market for over 15 years. The size of office stock has increased from 135,800 sqm in 2000 to 708,000 sqm in the first quarter of 2015. New development activity has been demand-led and Macquarie Park has accounted for a high proportion of Sydney's underlying demand growth with net absorption of 307,500 square metres recorded between 2004 and 2014. To put the net absorption result in context – Macquarie Park has recorded stronger net absorption than the Brisbane CBD (202,800 sqm) and Perth CBD (209,500 sqm) over the same time period.\nThe workforce catchment for Macquarie Park will expand through strong population growth. NSW Government Department of Planning & Environment divides its strategy for metropolitan Sydney into six sub-regions. The City of Ryde is located in the North sub-region, while the West Central sub-region would also form part of the workforce catchment for businesses located in Macquarie Park. The combined population growth of these two sub-regions is projected to be stronger than metropolitan Sydney – increasing by an average of 1.9 per cent per annum between 2016 and 2026. By 2026, the NSW Department of Planning & Environment projects 44.3 per cent of metropolitan Sydney's population will reside in the North and West central sub-regions. If we supplement the workforce catchment of Macquarie Park with the Local Government Areas west of the City of Sydney in the Central sub-region, the catchment of Macquarie Park increases to over 50 per cent of metropolitan Sydney's resident population by 2026.\nNew infrastructure will further improve the accessibility of Macquarie Park. Sydney Metro is Australia's largest public transport infrastructure project. Sydney Metro Northwest (formerly the North West Rail Link) is the first stage of Sydney Metro and is scheduled to open in the first half of 2019. The Sydney Metro Northwest will be integrated with the existing Macquarie Park and North Ryde train stations. New public transport infrastructure improves the accessibility of Macquarie Park, making it a more attractive and accessible destination for workers and future residents.\nAdvertisement Macquarie Park is intrinsically linked to growth sectors of the Australian economy and will benefit from the organic expansion of the existing tenant base and new entrants into the precinct. Furthermore, population growth and new infrastructure increases the workforce catchment and accessibility of Macquarie Park, while the development of strategic relationships between the university and anchor tenants will further entrench multinational corporations in the precinct.\nCommercial property investors are attracted by long-term growth potential and infrastructure. As Macquarie Park gains further scale and liquidity, it will be re-rated by investors as an investment destination.\nAndrew Ballantyne is the head of strategic research for Australia at JLL.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T07:43:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
