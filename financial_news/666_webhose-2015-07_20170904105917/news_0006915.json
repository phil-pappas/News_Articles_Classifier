Infrastructure and social services also deteriorated during that period and no time should be wasted to ensure that these start working again. \nThere is no prize for guessing that poverty eradication is the ultimate goal, and this can only be achieved if the general populace is empowered and partakes in the mainstream activities of the domestic economy. \nWhile foreign investment is key for any economic growth across the globe, it must be said from the outset that strong internal policy programmes and full exploitation of the country's resources will be key. \nAnd monitoring, evaluation and control will thus play a fundamental role in ensuring that the key deliverables are met, especially, in light of the myriad of constraints the country faces, including financial limitations.
