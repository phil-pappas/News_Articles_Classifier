It happens.\nSo for many, many years the company has held a $7 million mortgage over 17 hectares of beachfront property at Nadi Bay, a handy stone's throw from the town's international airport runway.\nAdvertisement And we mean a feeble stone's throw.\nAt least Ganke​ was across the detail on the loan.\nIt just happens that the property's owner was the Nadi Bay Beach Corporation (NBBC), an entity controlled by Ganke​ and Evelyn Goh , who was the company secretary for Southern Cross.\nGanke​ has been trying to offload the property since the 1970s with ads in the Sydney Morning Herald in 1979 offering \"beachfront estate villa sites\" starting from $16,900.\nThe Southern Cross board reported this week that it has received around $6 million from the sale of the Fijian property.\nIt also revealed for the first time that Southern Cross was a \"minority passive shareholder\" in NBBC.\nNot that this stopped the company from putting the squeeze on NBBC.\n\"Following a default by Nadi Bay, Southern Cross appointed receivers and managers to the property subject to the mortgage,\" the company reported.\nWhile a sales process by receivers failed, Southern Cross said it was introduced to a Fijian property developer called Wailoaloa Developments.\nAs part of the agree sale, Southern Cross will retain an indirect 49 per cent stake in the property through Wailoaloa Developments.\nNo Affinity Investors in child care group, Affinity Education, have certainly learnt not to underestimate the team at its suitor, G8 Education.\nThe duo running the G8 show – chairman Jenny Hutson , and managing director Chris Scott – managed to stitch up a 20 per cent stake in Affinity before their fellow investors had so much as a sniff of a bid.\nHutson's work has not always drawn accolades.\nThe Hutson founded Wellington Capital has had a colourful run as the manager of an investment disaster called the Premium Income Fund.\nIn November last year, the High Court dismissed an appeal by Wellington Capital against a court decision that found it had acted improperly in its managerial role.\nWellington had handballed more than $90 million worth of PIF assets to a company called ARL, which was then acquired by PIF. Wellington then tried to issue these ARL shares to PIF unit holders.\n\"This decision once again validates ASIC's concerns with Wellington's conduct,\" said ASIC commissioner Greg Tanzer​ .\nIn 2011, Hutson was implicated in a bizarre scheme that involving hired actors to ensure Wellington did not get removed as PIF's manager.\nAn affidavit alleged Hutson was involved in an orchestrated attempt to subvert the outcome of a meeting of PIF investors, by signing up a rent-a-crowd of as many as 200 people to temporarily become PIF investors and vote in her favour.\nASIC gave up investigating the matter in 2013.\nDivine territory As the aspiring operator of \"religious shrines and ancillary activities\" in China, Mazu Alliance probably has more trouble than most listed stocks when it comes to separating the mundane from the divine.\nThe ASX sleeper – it has been suspended for years – has run into trouble with its prospectus and needed to clarify a few things this week.\nUnder the heading Restated Financial Statements, Mazu​ said it had previously \"recognised and disclosed\" land usage rights in China as \"property\" on the basis that \"such land in China is synonymous with with freehold land\".\nSomeone – we're looking at you ASIC – obviously decided otherwise.\n\"The [Mazu] board has noted the very recent preferences expressed by Australian regulators and as such, has now adopted the alternative recognition of asset as an intangible asset,\" the company said in its ASX release.\nMazu​ said the relevant accounts will be restated in the near future as it seeks to lift the stop order from ASIC on its recent prospectus.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T04:51:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
