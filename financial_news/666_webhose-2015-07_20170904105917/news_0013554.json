Warner Music Group Corp last month agreed to pay more than $4.2 million to hundreds of interns, following even larger settlements by Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal, Cond√© Nast and Viacom Inc. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has never addressed the difference between unpaid interns and paid employees, but in a 1947 case it said a railroad did not have to pay brakemen trainees because they did not take on the duties of regular workers. \nThe cases are Glatt v. Fox Searchlight Pictures Inc and Wang v. Hearst Corp, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 13-4478 and 13-4480. \n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by Chris Reese) Company Legal & Law Matters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T19:37:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
