It was at $1.1044 in Tokyo trade, ticking up from $1.0963 soon after early results of the bailout reforms vote were out. \nShinya Harui, currency analyst at Nomura Securities in Tokyo, said the common currency was holding up as investors \"assess the spill-over risks in case of a Greek exit from the eurozone\", adding: \"I personally think the chance (of the Greek exit) is very high, at around 70-80 percent.\" \nRegional bourses sagged in the aftermath of the vote, led by Hong Kong and Tokyo which were down 3.17 percent and 1.58 percent respectively by lunchtime Monday as investors retreated while they watch Greece's creditors plan their next move. \n- No 'rupture' - \nIn a televised address after the referendum, Tsipras insisted the vote did not mean a break with Europe. He has emphasised that euro membership is meant to be \"irreversible\", with no legal avenue to boot a country out. \n\"This is not an mandate of rupture with Europe, but a mandate that bolsters our negotiating strength to achieve a viable deal,\" he said. \nTsipras said the creditors -- the ECB, the EC and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) -- would now finally have to talk about restructuring the massive, 240-billion-euro ($267 billion) debt Greece owes them. \n\"This time, the debt will be on the negotiating table,\" he said. \nThousands of people in Athens gathered to celebrate the \"No\" vote Sunday night, punching the air, kissing and cheering. \n\"Spain, and then Portugal, should follow this path. We're for a Europe of the people,\" said Giorgos, 25, brushing off concerns the result could see the debt-laden country plunge further into the financial mire. \nBut the mood of jubilation was not shared by all \"No\" voters, with some saying they had been confronted with an impossible choice. \n\"A 'No' victory doesn't mean there's any more hope for Greece than before,\" said Nika Spenzes, 33 and unemployed. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) \"Yes\" voters were ambivalent about their camp's apparent defeat. \nParis, a 41-year-old dentist, said she was resigned rather than sad because, with the dire state of Greece's finances and Tsipras in power, there was \"no real hope either way\". \nGreece's conservative opposition chief Antonis Samaras announced his resignation as the early results of the referendum became clear Sunday. His New Democracy party had campaigned for a \"Yes\" result in the referendum. \n- On the brink - \nGreece is teetering on the brink of financial collapse. If it does not receive cash and loans soon from European institutions, it could be forced to resort to government IOUs or a return to the drachma to keep its economy running. \nLast Tuesday, the country defaulted on a 1.5-billion-euro repayment to the IMF, becoming the first developed country to fall into arrears to the institution. As a result, it is cut off from further IMF financing until it settles the amount. \nThe same day, the last bailout for Greece ran out, despite Tsipras's appeals for it to be extended until the referendum was over. \nGreece was officially declared in default on Friday by the European Financial Stability Facility, which holds 144.6 billion euros ($160 billion) of Greek loans. \nGreek banks are now reportedly almost illiquid after a run by panicked customers in the lead-up to the referendum, which Tsipras abruptly called on June 27 to break an impasse with the creditors. \nA weeklong closure of the banks and capital controls that included restricting daily ATM withdrawals to just 60 euros ($67) and blocking money transfers abroad slowed the outflow. \nBut if the ECB does not inject emergency euros into Greece's banks in the next one or two days, more businesses will go belly up and ordinary Greeks will suffer. \nGovernment spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis said late Sunday that the Bank of Greece was asking for the ECB to provide money under its Emergency Liquidity Assistance mechanism.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T08:48:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
