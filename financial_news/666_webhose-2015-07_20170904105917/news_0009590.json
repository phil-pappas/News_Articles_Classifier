Photo: Getty Images\nAfter falling 8.5 per cent on Monday, China's sharemarket whip-sawed its way to a less startling 1.7 per cent fall on Tuesday, but don't get stuck on the numbers.\nChina's sharemarket is not only immature – as a percentage of the economy it is less than half the weight of western sharemarkets, and retail investors still dominate – it is also stage-managed by Beijing, which sees it as an instrument of longer term economic planning.\nIntervention is not something cooked up by Beijing in response to the share price dive that began in the middle of June. It is a given, has been since the '90s when China's sharemarket started developing, and will be for years to come.\nThe questions as always are: does Beijing know what it is doing with its intervention, and are the results it is getting changing its longer term plans?\nThe Chinese government intervened last year to pump the market up. Interest rates were cut, banks were allowed to lend more, and retail investor access to margin loan accounts was dramatically expanded.\nIt did this in part because wanted to offset slowing growth in other sectors including the housing market and hold economic growth at 7 per cent, the rate of expansion that has been regarded for decades as minimum required to absorb the massive demand for jobs that urban migration in China creates.\nBeijing also saw an expanding, prosperous equity market as a key to the deleveraging of the economy, however. Floats of state-owned enterprises that were in effect debt for equity swaps with sharemarket investors were a key part of the plan.\nBeijing pumped the market up too aggressively, and share prices were unsustainably high by mid-June. The selloff that followed threatened economic growth in the short term, and also threatened Beijing's plans to use the sharemarket as a deleveraging platform: privatisation plans were, for example, suspended.\nBeijing's intervention earlier this month stopped the rout – but it also fuelled a 20 per cent rally that pushed shares into bubble territory again.\nThe latest selloff was primed on Friday last week when a local news service, Caixin, reported that the rally was reaching a point where support could be withdrawn. Preliminary data on company purchasing activity that was released on Friday was also weaker than expected.\nMonday's 8.5 per cent slump saw China's market regulator promise again on Tuesday morning to stabilise the share market and prevent \"systemic risk. The sharemarket gyrated wildly but did not repeat Monday's big price dive – but Beijing still has a short term problem and a longer term problem to address.\nIt is capable of responding to day to day selling pressure if it continues, by buying shares, instructing broking firms to do the same, and changing trading rules in ways that lock sellers out.\nThe two selling waves and the rally that came between them have only returned prices to where they were in March, however, and Goldman Sachs says in a report on Monday's selloff that small and medium sized companies are still being valued at a too-high 28 times expected earnings.\nMany observers have concluded that the sharemarket fall should not itself cause cause serious economic damage. China's domestic sharemarket is priced in the local currency and closed to foreign investors. It is dominated by private Chinese investors who are funded by a mix of savings and debt that is not a life-threateningly large part of China's overall debt load, and is not yet a crucial source of equity funding for Chinese companies.\nChinese share valuations do, however, need fall further to deflate the bubble that developed ahead of selloff, and re-base the market in a way that keeps it intact as a contributor to economic growth and an engine for the deleveraging of China's corporate sector.\nBeijing needs to support the market to prevent a catastrophic slump, but also lead it down to its \"right weight\" valuation. Its success or failure cannot yet be judged, and the problem it faces is to an extent circular.\nRenewed investor confidence depends for example not only on the restoration of share price value, but on overall economic growth. That in turn depends not only on how much traction Beijing gets with the fiscal and monetary stimulus it was rolling out when the sharemarket downturn hit, but on how much economic dislocation the sharemarket's retreat creates. It's a difficult balancing act: China's sharemarket roller coaster isn't over.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T06:56:32.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
