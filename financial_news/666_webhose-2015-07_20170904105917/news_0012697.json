Certainly yes, for I have two university degrees. But we probably need to be careful in what kind of education we invest in because not every university degree is useful. \nIt hurts to see parents toiling and kids reading books to blindness only to be told that the only job available after graduation is being a nanny in the Middle East for US$250 a month. \nWe have heard some terrible stories coming out of Middle East of Africans that are tortured and sexually abused by their Arab masters and coming back home worse off than they had left. \nBut would you rather be a nanny in Saudi Arabia or stay home in East Africa, jobless but with your shiny degree certificate tucked away somewhere in the drawer? \nIt's a catch 22 situation that requires policy makers to rethink our University Education system just like Sam Kebongo suggested in his commentary yesterday. \nBecause although a university graduate working as a nanny is such a depressing thing, employers claim most graduates are unemployable because of the low quality of college training out there. \nToday's university degree might be prestigious but a vocational college diploma may have more employment value on the job market. \nInstead of sending graduates of business administration to be house-maids in Middle East, how about colleges introduced a specialized bachelor's degree in house-keeping?
