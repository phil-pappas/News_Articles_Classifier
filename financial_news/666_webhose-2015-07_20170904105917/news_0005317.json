FirstGroup (LSE: FGP.L - news ) , which is convening for its annual shareholder meeting, and Carillion (Other OTC: CIOIF - news ) are both due to make quarterly statements. Firstgroup has an opportunity to update the market after an uneasy fortnight when it lost out on an extended deal for its South West Trains franchise and was hit by a downgrade from UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) on valuation grounds. Investors are expecting good things from Carillion , as the support services company's shares were up 2% on Monday. Broker Numis said the company remained at the cheaper end of the sector range and expected the first-half statement to largely be a reiteration of May's annual general meeting statement, when management pointed to over 90% of revenue vsibility for the current year. \nRecruiter Michael Page also reports, with Numis's Steven Woolf anticipating another strong trading performance. \nONS will release its latest estimate for the cost of living at 09:30. \n\"We expect weak inflation to persist and the year-on-year measure to old around 0% in June and over the summer as we expect weakness in core prices to persist. However, we stress the high level of uncertainty around this forecast as volatile components and seasonality could cause some surprises,\" economists at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) wrote to clients in a research note dated 10 July. \nIn parallel, the latest figures for the level of consumer price will be forthcoming in Germany, Italy and Spain. \nThe ZEW institute is also scheduled to release its latest reading for its economic confidence index for Germany. \nStateside, investors will be waiting on the most figures for the country's retail sales and the latest update to the Federal Reserve bank of Atlanta (BSE: ATLANTA.BO - news ) 's GDPNow model. \nCalendar: Tuesday 14 July UK ECONOMIC ANNOUNCEMENTS BRC Sales Monitor (00:01) Consumer Price Index (09:30) Producer Price Index (09:30) Retail Price Index (09:30) INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ANNOUNCEMENTS Business Inventories (US) (15:00) Consumer Price Index (GER) (07:00) Industrial Production (EU) (10:00) Manufacturing Inventories (US) (15:00) Retail Sales (US) (13:30) Retail Sales Inventories (US) (15:00) ZEW Survey (EU) (10:00) ZEW Survey (GER) (10:00) FINALS Begbies Traynor Group IMSS Carillion, FirstGroup, ITE Group (LSE: ITE.L - news ) TRADING ANNOUNCEMENTS DotDigital Group (LSE: DOTD.L - news ) , Michael Page International (LSE: MPI.L - news ) EGMS NewRiver Retail Limited (LSE: NRR.L - news ) AGMS Aberdeen Japan Investment Trust , Brown (N.)
