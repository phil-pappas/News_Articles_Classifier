The increase in the minimum support prices for grains has also been modest.\n\nOn the monetary transmission, it said lenders have been slow to pass the cumulative 0.75 per cent cut by the RBI this calendar year.\n\n\"With systemic liquidity likely to tighten post the onset of the busy season for credit offtake in the third quarter, an upfronting of the next rate cut to August 4 policy may, to an extent, support a quicker transmission of monetary easing to bank lending rates,\" it said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:28:04.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
