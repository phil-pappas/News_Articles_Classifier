Wal-Mart said it would also offer its own deals day , in response to Amazon’s Prime Day event on Wednesday.\nMunster said he believes Wal-Mart’s reaction comes from a position of weakness, and is a sign of desperation. Especially considering Wal-Mart’s stock WMT, -0.12% has lost 14% so far this year, while Amazon shares AMZN, +1.27% have soared 55% to a fresh record on Friday.\n“Wal-Mart’s attempt to create a competitive offering to Amazon shows the power Amazon is exerting as it gains loyalty and takes share from traditional retailers,” Munster wrote in a note to clients. “We think Wal-Mart’s response to Amazon indicates it is grasping for anything to attack Amazon.”\nThis is highlighted by the social media buzz surrounding Amazon’s Prime Day, while Wal-Mart’s deals day went mostly unnoticed.\nTwitter data indicates Prime Day far outstrips Wal-Mart deals Tweet Content Tweets on July 15 Tospy Sentiment Score Prime Day tweets 98,600 66 Wal-Mart deals tweets 726 56 Sources: Piper Jaffray Web Analytics, Topsy, Spredfast data Although Munster acknowledged that many tweets about Prime Day were negative, as they poked fun at some of the products on sale , he reckons that is better than being ignored.\nTo make matters worse, Walmart.com Chief Executive Fernando Madeira took a swing at Amazon in a blog post earlier this week, but missed the target.\n“We’ve heard some retailers are charging $100 to get access to a sale. But the idea of asking customers to pay extra in order to save money just doesn’t add up for us,” Madeira wrote .\nMunster said that was a “strange statement” for two reasons:\n• Prime Day included a free trial of the Amazon Prime service, so you didn’t need $100 to get access to the sale.\n• Wal-Mart owns Sam’s Club, a membership-based warehouse retailer focused on providing lower prices.\n“Aside from a seemingly counterintuitive message to consumers, we believe this highlights the level of concern Wal-Mart and other retailers have towards Amazon,” Munster said.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://blog.walmart.com/20150713/why-every-day-is-low-price-day-at-walmart"], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:40:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
