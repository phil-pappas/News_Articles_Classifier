Getty Images The default represents a failure of Greece and eurozone creditors led by Germany to agree to a series of economic reforms known as austerity measures that would have unlocked a critical €7.2 billion tranche of rescue funds, which also expired at midnight.\nThe tranche was the last of €240 billion in financial aid made available to Greece by its three bailout monitors, the IMF, the European Central Bank and the European Commission since the global financial crisis.\nIn a sign of the mistrust between Greece and its creditors, Athens will not be given the traditional 30-day grace period afforded to other nations who missed payments.\nIMF head Christine Lagarde has previously said she will notify her Executive Board \"promptly\" if Greece missed the June 30 deadline.\n We want to remain in EZ. We are not \"guests\" in Europe. Greece is in the heart of Europe. @ErtSocial #Greece\n— Alexis Tsipras (@tsipras_eu) June 29, 2015 Despite the inability of both side to agree on the austerity measures - which included tax hikes, pension cuts and tighter budget targets - negotiations between Athens and its creditors are likely to continue for many months.\nEurozone finance ministers, who discussed the the latest Athens proposal plan in a conference call on Tuesday, will examine it on another teleconference at 5pm Brussels time Wednesday. Their comments suggested they were open to compromise, though stuck by opposition to debt relief and demands for economic reform.\nThere is speculation Greek Prime minister Alexis Tsipras would be willing to suspend plans for the referendum in return for securing some form of debt relief from its paymasters. Eurozone powers have argued debt relief should only be discussed once the austerity measures are agreed.\nGreek debt stands at 180 per cent of GDP, meaning some form of debt relief - which could include a write off of some borrowings or lower interest rates - is necessary to allow Greece to restore its budget.\n\"From the first moment, we made clear that the decision to hold a referendum is not the end but the continuation of negotiations for better terms for the Greek people,\" said a Greek government statement.\nThe 18 other eurozone member have criticised Mr Tsipras for backing a 'No' vote, warning Greek voters the snap ballot represents a choice between keeping the euro and reverting to the drachma.\nHowever, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told lawmakers in Berlin that Greece would stay in the euro for the time being even if Greek voters reject austerity in the referendum.\nMr Tsipras said on Greek television on Monday night that the vote was not a referendum on Greece's membership in the EU but a decision about the austerity measures.\nShould the ECB decide today to pull the plug, Greek banks will not be able to open after their mandated bank holiday which ends on July 7.\nOn the second day of capital controls, the stress is beginning to show among Greeks, who are limited to 60 euros a day of withdrawals under an order issued at 3am on Monday. The union for National Bank of Greece workers appealed for a police presence in the next three days at branches open for the payment of pensions.\n\"This week is going to be very psychologically tense, very emotional,\" said Othon Anastasakis, a professor of European politics at the University of Oxford. \"There are going to be various arguments from both sides.\"\nWith Bloomberg\nNow read why there's still hope for Greece.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ErtSocial", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/tsipras_eu/status/615617755811827712"], "published": "2015-07-01T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T10:03:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
