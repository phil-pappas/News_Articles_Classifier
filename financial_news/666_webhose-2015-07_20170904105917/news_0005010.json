Standard Life 'with profits' policies: Are you one of 65,000 people owed up to £139,000? STANDARD Life is in the midst of a huge hunt to find more than 65,000 people that are owed cash or shares by the company. PUBLISHED: 17:35, Mon, Jul 13, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:42, Mon, Jul 13, 2015 GETTY Thousands of people are entitled to money or shares from Standard Life \nThe savings and investment giant demutualised in 2006, which left around 2.4million policyholders with an entitlement to cash or shares. But around 600,000 people have never claimed the shares they were due and another 5,000 didn't come forward for the cash they were owed. Now there is just a year left for these people to make a claim. Those who held a 'with-profits policy' with the Standard Life Assurance Company that started before March 2004 and was in force in October 2005 may be eligible.The company estimates the average unclaimed value is about £1,270 but that the largest claim could be up to around £139,000 - dependent upon the share price. The entitlements are now held in an 'Unclaimed Assets Trust' and the last date for claims is 9 July 2016.In October last year Standard Life tasked Capita Asset Services to undertake a tracing programme and anyone who receives communication from the firm is urged not to ignore it.Paul McKenna, deputy group company secretary, said: “We’ve been working hard to trace those with a valid claim and have united more than 235,000 people with their unclaimed assets. \"With a year to go, our efforts are continuing and we would urge anyone who receives a communication from our Registrars, Capita Asset Services, to respond to it before time runs out.\"•Anyone making a valid claim can contact Capita Asset Services on 0345 608 1478 Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T11:59:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
