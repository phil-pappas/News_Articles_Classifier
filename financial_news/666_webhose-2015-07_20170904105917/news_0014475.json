The government could provide more capital to the banks if needed. \n\"We have a robust recapitalisation plan in place,\" he said. \nThe finance ministry also issued a statement saying state-run banks have capital requirements of 1.8 trillion rupees ($28 billion) until 2018/19. \nState-run banks have amassed bad loans at a faster pace than their privately owned peers, raising concerns about their ability to meet tougher global regulatory capital requirements. \nWhile there will be relief at the moves to recapitalise India's banks, U.R. Bhatt, managing director at investment firm Dalton Capital in Mumbai, said there would be some disappointment that the capital infusion was not bigger. \n\"Most of these public sector banks are not even able to grow their balance sheet because of lack of capital... to grow their way out of trouble they need capital,\" Bhatt said. \nCredit rating agency Fitch said earlier this month the capital needs of state-run banks are likely to increase substantially each year until 2018/19. \nLast month Morgan Stanley said the government would need to inject $15 billion across all state banks \"urgently\" to achieve a common equity tier 1 ratio of around 10 percent. \nIt was not immediately clear where the extra money would come. Sinha said higher tax collections and savings from the fall in international crude oil prices put the government in a \"comfortable position\" to meet the fiscal deficit target. \nThe government has a budgeted fiscal deficit target of 3.9 percent of the gross domestic product this fiscal year. Its original spending target was 17.77 trillion rupees ($277 billion). \n($1 = 64.1400 rupees)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:25:11.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
