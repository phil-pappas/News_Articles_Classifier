Sharp is highly dependent on short-term borrowings, and the average maturity of its debt is short. \n\"Therefore, we consider the potential need for massive refinancing a negative factor and incorporate this into our ratings.\" \nIn May Sharp announced it was cutting 10 percent of its 49,000-strong workforce worldwide as part of a turnaround plan intended to keep it afloat after posting a bigger-than-expected $1.86 billion annual loss. \nThe embattled Aquos-brand maker said it would sell the building that houses its Osaka headquarters to raise cash, roll out unspecified pay cuts, and launch a drastic capital reduction plan to wipe away huge losses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T17:16:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
