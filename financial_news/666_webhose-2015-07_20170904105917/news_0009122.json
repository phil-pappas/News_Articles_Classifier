Minneapolis, MN\nPowerObjects, a professional services firm 100% focused on providing service, support, education, and add-ons for Microsoft Dynamics CRM , recently released PowerCalendar , a PowerPack add-on that allows for unparalleled ease of scheduling, filtering, and appointment creation in one unified calendar within Dynamics CRM.\nUsers are able to schedule or change meetings for anyone in their system just by viewing one calendar and seeing what CRM activities they have scheduled or completed for that day. Activities on PowerCalendar can be sorted by either day, week, or month. Appointments can be easily moved or changed within PowerCalendar, making it much easier for users to view upcoming or past activities on a calendar compared to viewing them in a list in out-of-the-box CRM.\nPowerCalendar allows the user to use CRM’s teams to see tasks and appointments by group. The user can further filter their calendar by appointment type—such as a task, meeting, or phone call—allowing users to quickly access the information they need and get a full understanding of what each team member has scheduled or already completed.\n“PowerCalendar is a seamless solution to the problem of keeping track of the happenings of teams throughout CRM. By organizing activities in a calendar view for users to access, PowerCalendar makes it easy to see what each user is doing within CRM through a quick glance at the calendar,” says Dean Jones, CEO of PowerObjects. “It’s a big help for any Dynamics CRM user who struggles with grasping the bigger picture of the activities each user is working on or has completed within CRM.”\nPowerCalendar is one of twenty-three add-ons that PowerObjects has developed to enhance Microsoft Dynamics CRM functionality. Simple to install and easy to use, PowerCalendar is available for a free thirty-day trial and can be downloaded from the PowerObjects website.\nAbout PowerObjects\nThe team at PowerObjects has worked hard to become the recognized leader in delivering Microsoft Dynamics CRM solutions through unparalleled offerings of service, support, education, and add-ons.
