I was told I would have to pause it for a minimum of two months, as per my contract, but I believe that not being able to do so during a month when I cannot physically use it is unfair. In addition, my monthly membership has recently jumped from £38 to £45.\nCitizens Advice advises that if the cost of membership goes up dramatically, consumers should be able to cancel their membership without charge. As things stand, Bannatyne’s is going to take July’s payment from me on the first of that month as a cancellation fee (still during Ramadan) and my contract will officially end on 31 July.\nThe gym told me the same thing last year, but I didn’t bother to pursue it as I was still a new member during Ramadan 2014. (I had joined in March that year.) This seems not only unfair but also potentially discriminatory towards a religious belief and month. Z E-T, Totteridge, London\nOn these pages we have exposed the difficulties consumers have faced as a result of inflexible gym contracts – including those who are injured, ill or made redundant – or those, like you, wanting to take a break on religious grounds. In March 2013 the Office of Fair Trading ordered three of the UK’s biggest gym chains, including Bannantyne’s, to make their contracts simpler for this reason. We have since had a noticeable downturn in complaints.\nThe effects of fasting during Ramadan mean that many Muslims decide to reduce physical exercise or, as in your case, stop using the facilities altogether. Different gym chains have different approaches to this, so it is important to check before joining. Bannantyne’s allow you to suspend your membership for between two and six months, but this was not acceptable to you. The company has about 200,000 members, including a large number of Muslims who, presumably, do not suspend their membership.\nWe put your case to Bannantyne’s but it refused to back down. A spokesperson said: “We believe our terms and conditions are fair and equitable to all our members, including the many Muslim members who continue to use the facilities during Ramadan.”\nAs far as the increased cost is concerned, we gather that in certain clubs members were told that towels were no longer going to be free, so a more expensive membership fee was introduced for people wanting to use club towels rather than bring their own. This should have been better communicated to you.\nClearly, membership of Bannatyne’s has not offered you the flexibility you wanted, and you might want to consider cheaper, local authority gyms or a pay-as-you-go arrangement.\nWe welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
