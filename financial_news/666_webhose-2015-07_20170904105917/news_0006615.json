The company said Wednesday that it had lined up $143 million of loans through its platform in the second quarter, a 55 percent increase from the first three months of the year. The growth was helped by selling a portfolio of debt to an investment firm.\n“The company is successfully executing on its strategy of diversifying its funding sources,” Mark Palmer, an analyst with BTIG, said in a research note Thursday.\nOnDeck is one of many new companies that seek to use technology to extend credit more efficiently. It went public in December at an initial price of $20 a share. It has come under pressure this year as more companies compete for borrowers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T18:47:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
