The group tries to gauge what decision Mr Stevens and his team might make on interest rates every month. \nIt expects the cash rate to remain at a record low of two per cent on Tuesday. \nAbbott government frontbencher Scott Morrison says events in Greece are a warning of what can happen if you don't get your house in order. He noted Greece's debt didn't get to 100 per cent of GDP overnight, rather it was through unsustainable polices. \nHe said Greece had been aware of its financial problems surrounding an ageing population since the 1980s, and while it had undertaken significant reforms in recent years he believed it was too little, too late. \nIt is a \"distant\" warning for Australians, the social services minister told Network Ten on Sunday. \n\"We're seeing pictures of pensioners today in Greece crying, sitting on the streets, just in absolute despair. Well, I don't want to see that happen to future pensioners in Australia.\" \nThat is why the Australian government is seeking to raise the pension age to 70 in 2035 to ensure the pension is there in the future. \nFormer NSW Labor treasurer Michael Costa says drawing analogies between Greece and Australia is \"overblown\". He described the Greek ballot as \"dishonest\". \n\"The top of the ballot paper has `no' and the bottom has `yes',\" he told Network Ten. \"In between is text that is indecipherable and badly translated. It's a stitch-up.\" \nHe said Greece needed more, not less austerity in terms of structural reform.
