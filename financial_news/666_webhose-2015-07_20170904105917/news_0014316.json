Bloomberg Share on twitter by Karen Maley Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is headed for a bruising confrontation with the country's creditors after Greek voters delivered a crashing \"no\" vote at Sunday's referendum.\nGreek voters delivered a larger than expected victory for the Tsipras government which ran an aggressive campaign urging Greeks to vote \"no\" against the reforms and budget cuts that Greece's creditors have demanded in exchange for fresh financial aid.\nTsipras argued that a \"no\" vote would force Greece's creditors – the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and the European Central Bank – to soften their demands for sales tax hikes and pension cuts.\nAnd with 85 per cent of votes counted, it appears that Greek voters took heed of Tsipras's argument, with the \"no\" vote officially predicted to win 61.5 per cent.\nGreek finance minister Yannis Varoufakis said that following this \"brave 'no' vote, we will call on our partners to find common ground\".\nBut the success of the Greek strategy will depend on the stance that Berlin adopts.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has insisted that the eurozone only works if member countries abide by the rules, and that striking a deal at any price with Greece would weaken the region.\nIn contrast, French President Francois Holland has been pushing for euro zone countries to be more accommodating to Greece, warning last week that failing to reach a deal with Greece could push the region into a \"period of turmoil\".\n EU leaders to meet So far, however, Merkel's view has dominated within the euro zone. And deputy German chancellor Sigmar Gabriel offered little hope that Berlin has softened its position, saying that the Greek voters had \"torn down the last bridges on which Greece and Europe could have moved towards a compromise\".\n\"With the rejection of the rules of the euro zone ... negotiations about a program worth billions are barely conceivable,\" he told Tagesspiegel newspaper.\nAfter Sunday's decisive \"no\" vote, Merkel and Hollande will meet tonight in Paris to discuss what response they should make to Greece.\nThis should leave markets on tenterhooks today as investors look for signs as to how Greece's creditors – who had been hoping that a \"yes\" vote might force the resignation of the radical leftist Syriza government – respond to its surprise victory.\nThe country's dire economic situation was highlighted by IMF analysis released last week which estimated that the country needs more than €60 billion ($88.5 billion) in fresh financial assistance over the next three years.\nThe IMF also called on Europe to give the country \"comprehensive\" debt relief by extending the maturity of the country's debts, a position that Paris has advocating for the past several weeks.\nJuly 20, a new deadline Greece, which last week missed the deadline to make a €1.6 billion payment to the IMF, is under huge pressure to secure financing before a €3.5 billion debt falls due to the European Central Bank on July 20.\nIf Athens defaults on that debt, it would make it very difficult for the ECB to continue accepting Greek government bonds as collateral for its loans, and it could decide to withdraw the close to €90 billion in emergency funding it has provided to Greek banks.\nIn order to reopen banks, Athens would be forced to print its own currency, setting the country up for a 'Grexit' – or exit from the euro zone.\nGreece's central bank has already asked the ECB to lift the ceiling on the amount of emergency funding that can be provided to the Greek banks. This emergency liquidity is critical to allow the country's banks – which have been closed for more than a week – to continue operating.\nGreece's central bank has reportedly also called in bank executives to discuss reducing the limit for daily withdrawals from ATMs from €60 to €20.\nThe ECB's board is expected to hold a conference call later today to decide on whether to provide more support for Greece's embattled banks.\nThe ECB may also decide to escalate its purchases of the bonds of other peripheral countries – such as Portugal and Spain – if markets have an extreme adverse reaction to the referendum result.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-07-06T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T04:07:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
