However, the larger 2014 monthly surplus was heavily influenced by a timing quirk that had moved June benefit payments into May last year because June 1 fell on a Saturday.\nFor the current budget year, the government is running a deficit of $US313.4 billion, a 14.3 per cent reduction from the imbalance over the first nine months of the previous budget year. The Congressional Budget Office is forecasting that the deficit for the entire budget year will be $US486 billion, about the same as last year. But some private analysts believe the CBO estimate is too pessimistic. Economists at Barclays Research said the June results support their projection that this year's deficit will decline to $US425 billion. So far this year, government receipts total $US2.45 trillion, 8.3 per cent higher than the first nine months of the 2014 budget year. Government outlays total $US2.76 trillion through June, 5.1 per cent higher than the previous year. The federal government's budget year begins on October 1 and ends on September 31. The 2014 deficit was down from $US680.2 billion in 2013. Before then, the US had recorded four straight years of annual deficits topping $US1 trillion. That reflected the impact of a severe financial crisis and the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Those huge deficits drove the national debt higher. It currently stands at $US18.1 trillion, right below the current debt limit. Since March, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has been making a series of moves to keep the government operating without going over the current limit while appealing to Congress to raise the borrowing limit. Private economists have estimated that Lew can continue operating this way until October or November when the government faces the prospect of an unprecedented default on the national debt if the debt limit is not raised.
