In contrast, US gold for August delivery settled up one per cent at $US1,096.40 an ounce on short-covering after data late Friday showed that US speculators had turned bearish on Comex gold for the first time in at least a decade in the week ended July 21. \"The market is recouping some of its losses,\" said Eli Tesfaye, senior market strategist for brokerage RJO Futures in Chicago. The Federal Reserve will hold a two-day meeting this week where policymakers are likely to send more signals pointing to a rate rise later in the year as the US economy strengthens. \"The most likely outcome is that Fed rhetoric will emphasise that the US economy is on track for a rate hike(s) this year,\" Mizuho Bank said in a note. \"It's people being cautious ahead of tomorrow, not knowing whether the Fed is going to talk about (a rate hike in) September or December,\" said George Gero, precious metals strategist for RBC Capital Markets in New York, referring to the US market's strength. Bullion lost more than three per cent last week after a sudden, sharp rout across New York and Shanghai markets sparked further selling, sinking prices to $US1,077 on Friday, their lowest since February 2010. The drop in gold came despite the US dollar staying on the back foot, falling 0.8 per cent against a basket of currencies after a drop in US stocks and bond yields. Holdings of the world's biggest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Trust, also fell for a seventh day on Friday to 21.87 million ounces, the lowest since September 2008. In other precious metals, spot palladium fell 1.9 per cent to $US610.50 an ounce and platinum lost 0.2 per cent to $US980.25. Silver was down 0.6 per cent at $US14.56.
