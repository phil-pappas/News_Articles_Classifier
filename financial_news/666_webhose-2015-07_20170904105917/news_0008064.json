The yield on the two-year TMUBMUSD02Y, -1.72% note fell 1.6 basis point to 0.682% on Friday but rose 1.3 basis point over the week. The yield on the 30-year bond TMUBMUSD30Y, -0.22% declined two basis points to 2.959% on Friday and 12.1 basis points over the week.\nA flattening yield curve has been another theme throughout the week, with long maturities leading the move, as 30-year yields crossed below 2.960%—the lowest point since early June.\nWhen the yield curve flattens, it means that the spread, or yield differential, between long-term and short-term Treasury bonds is decreasing.\nThe falling long-term yields are mainly due to the disinflationary effect of the commodity slump, because long-term yields are most sensitive to inflation whereas short-term yields are more sensitive to Fed rate-hike expectations, said Ilya Feygin, managing director at WallachBeth Capital.\nRead: How the commodity crisis has divided bond investors\nLower commodities also affect the dollar, which the Federal Reserve has stated is one of its main concerns ahead of the first interest-rate increase in nearly a decade.\n“Lower commodities strengthen the dollar and a stronger dollar keeps the Fed away,” Feygin said.\nIn Europe, government bonds were also rallying Friday, after investors received slightly weaker-than-expected readings in eurozone manufacturing and services data. Market watchers were also following the Greek debt situation, where the debt-burdened country and its creditors were set to open talks Friday to complete a bailout deal.\nWhile stock markets in Europe rose slightly , yields were 3.5 to 8.5 basis points lower across the eurozone. The yield on the benchmark German 10-year bund TMBMKDE-10Y, -7.43% fell 5.7 basis points to 0.650%.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQqQIwAGoVChMIqeqB9-_zxgIVixo-Ch2TKQBb&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketwatch.com%2Fstory%2Feuropean-stocks-advance-but-weekly-losses-still-in-sight-2015-07-24&ei=wj2yVamBHIu1-AGT04DYBQ&usg=AFQjCNE7AoGcmlB_bNzsV_buXKxRiqJmag&sig2=dtQqvPCBK4UcCvtqRTk_9A&bvm=bv.98476267,d.cWw"], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T00:57:07.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
