You can disconnect from work and recharge your batteries. You get to spend the money you work so hard for on something that will bring you fulfillment and happiness.\nVacations are great, but taking out a loan to pay for them isn’t.\nAccording to Catherine Golladay, vice president of participant services at Charles Schwab, “At Schwab Retirement Plan Services, we often see instances of participants taking 401(k) loans increase during the summer months. Moreover, data shows that one of the reasons people have taken a loan from their 401(k) is to pay for a vacation.”\nTo put this mistake in perspective, consider this: A vacation is one or two weeks long, and a 401(k) loan is generally set up to be paid back over five years. This strategy sounds like a short-term vacation turning into a long-term debt.\n“These people have the wrong idea,” Golladay says. “Even though a 401(k) loan can seem like a quick cash fix, it carries long-term consequences, and therefore should only be used as a last resort to address a true and critical need.”\nLoans are fairly common among 401(k) participants. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute , at the end of 2013, 21% of participants who were eligible for 401(k) loans had unpaid loans from their 401(k) accounts.\nHowever, there are definite downsides to 401(k) loans. Golladay explains three of them:\n“For one, while a traditional 401(k) is funded with pretax dollars, a 401(k) loan is repaid with after-tax dollars,” she says. “Second, if you leave your job and are unable to repay the loan in full, the outstanding balance is treated like a withdrawal, triggering a tax bill and likely a 10% penalty on top of the tax.”\n“One of the biggest advantages a 401(k) plan offers is the ability for your investments to potentially compound and grow over time,” she adds. “If you take funds out of it prematurely, you diminish the benefit of compounding. Don’t punish your future self by borrowing against your retirement.”\nPage 1 / 2 Continue ", "external_links": ["http://www.ebri.org/publications/ib/index.cfm?fa=ibDisp&content_id=5472", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonforb.es%2F1Mt8Sal&text=Vacations%20are%20great%2C%20but%20taking%20out%20a%20loan%20to%20pay%20for%20them%20isn%E2%80%99t.%20%23retirement%20%23summervacation"], "published": "2015-07-28T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T23:00:12.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
