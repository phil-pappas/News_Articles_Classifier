So we support the idea of a sensible change of opening hours,\" he said. \nAsda CEO Andy Clarke said a rule change was \"common sense\". \nMarks & Spencer (Other OTC: MAKSF - news ) , Britain's biggest clothing retailer which also sells upmarket food, also welcomed Osborne's proposal, as did shopping centre landlord Hammerson, saying the plans would boost job numbers and the economy. \nHowever, Sainsbury's said it regarded the current set-up as \"a sensible British compromise\" which works for both customers and employees. \"Inevitably the competitive landscape would lead to us opening our superstores for longer on a Sunday,\" it said. \nMarket leader Tesco withheld its judgement, pending a study of Osborne's proposal. \n\"We understand there are strong views on either side of the debate over further liberalisation of Sunday trading. Such a decision is of course a matter for government, striking the right balance between this extra flexibility and the growing number of ways there are for customers to shop already,\" it said. \nThe plan was criticised by bodies for small business. \nIndustry lobby group the NFRN said the changes would cause chaos for consumers and damage the independent retail trade, while The Association of Convenience Stores said research showed fewer than one in 10 people wanted to see the rules abandoned.
