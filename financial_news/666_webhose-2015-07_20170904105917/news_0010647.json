Santa Rosa, CA (PRWEB) July 09, 2015\nRobert Tavelli, founder and CEO of Tavelli Company, Inc., and Tavco Credit Services, today announced two key additions to the firm’s executive management team.\nDan Steinman is the company’s new General Manager. With more than 32 years of experience in all aspects of debt collection, Dan is an expert when it comes to medical, dental and commercial accounts receivable recovery. His extensive experience includes responsibility for collection strategies involving sales, marketing, recruiting and compliance awareness, along with the development and training of personnel and the introduction of new technology. He is a former president of the California Association of Collectors where he held several assignments.\n“Dan’s responsibilities include developing and implementing companywide policies and procedures designed to grow the company,” said Robert Tavelli. “I’m pleased to have someone with Dan’s track record of success and experience helping to manage our expanding business as we focus on the needs of the medical and dental industry.”\nPrior to coming with Tavelli, Dan held senior management positions with Dolphin Data Systems, Fidelity Creditor Service, and G.C. Services. He also launched two consulting groups focusing on providing practical business solutions to collection agencies seeking improved operations and profitability.\n“Tavelli is unique in its ability to achieve outstanding results while maintaining customer loyalty,” Steinman said. “The company has a well-deserved reputation for fairness and consideration in reaching amicable agreements with those who have fallen behind in their payments leading to fewer complaints. I’m proud to be part of an organization with a ‘heart’ that values and respects people, while also producing higher than average collection results for its clients in the process. My goal is to continue building a culture consistent with a customer-oriented environment. ”\nIan Tavelli has been named Chief Financial Officer. He is the son of the founder and the former operations manager of this family-owned collection agency where he initially designed and managed the company budget and oversaw operations. Ian returned to Tavelli Company after serving as Assistant Vice President and Loan Officer in charge of business development at North Valley Bank prior to the bank’s merger with Tri Counties Bank where he served as a Relationship Manager. He earned a Bachelor’s degree in Global Business/Finance at Arizona State University in 2010.\n“My background includes banking analytics, cash flow and strategic growth,” Ian said. “At Tavelli Company I have a major financial role as we ramp up operations with new staff members with increased emphasis on the healthcare sector. This is important at a time when the Affordable Care Act and rising out-of-pocket expenses due to higher deductibles and co-pays are creating cash-flow problems for hospitals, group practices as well as their clients. I also plan to enhance the company’s involvement in the community as a member of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society’s Executive Leadership Committee for the North Bay Light the Night Walk, and as a board member of the Luther Burbank Santa Rosa Rose Parade.”\nUnder the new management structure, Robert addresses sales, client relations and overall corporate matters, Dan manages day-to-day operations and Ian is the company controller and community relations liaison for the firm.\n“Together the three of us comprise the core executive team,” Robert Tavelli said. “All of our employees use a personable, problem-solving approach that puts a human face on our business. We don’t work through auto-dialers, so we eliminate the frustration and confusion as we help customers facilitate account resolution matters. When you call us, you get a live person, not an answering machine. At the end of the day, our employees are happy, have a low turnover rate, and earn bonuses as they meet and exceed expectations – and our clients are happy, too.”\nTavelli Company, Inc. and Tavco Credit Services are located at 3700 Montgomery Drive, Santa Rosa, California.
