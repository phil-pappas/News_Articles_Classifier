This is not the sort of thing dad would be thrilled with.\"\nExport credit agencies and 19 commercial banks agreed to a $US7.2 billion financing package last year to fund the project in Western Australia's Pilbara . It was the biggest financing package of its kind in the world. The iron ore price has since deteriorated.\nThe construction of the Roy Hill mine, rail and port project, which is nearing completion, fulfils a long-held family ambition to own and operate a mine; although the ABC program notes Mr Hancock was involved in asbestos mining operations for some years.\nMrs Rinehart, whose wealth has been largely derived from royalties linked to Pilbara ore deposits secured by Mr Hancock, said her father gave his life to the dream of building a project.\n\"He was always trying to do that little bit more to go from just being a royalty person to a part owner. He just kept working through his adult life to try to build up towards being able to be an owner-operator,\" she said. \"That's the way he wished to spend his life. A lot of people would not choose it but that's the life he chose.\"\n Mrs Rinehart recalled her father's enthusiasm for exploration and his night-time flights in his flimsy Auster plane.\n\"He'd get so excited with his exploring and finding more discoveries that he'd sometimes let the time get away from him and so we'd hear 'mmm' going around the station homestead,\" Mrs Rinehart said. \"It meant dad was coming back, it was dark. So we already had tins along both sides of the airstrip for these events and we'd, mother and I, would have to go round and light up the kerosene that was in the tins so dad would be able to see to land.\"\nThe first of the two-part ABC series on the country's richest person focuses heavily on Mrs Rinehart's family recollections, and the impending fulfilment of the iron ore dream to run a mine.\nBut litigation waged by her two eldest children is casting a shadow over her achievements â€“ and even over the ownership of the Roy Hill ore deposits.\nIn May, Mrs Rinehart's two eldest children, John Hancock and Bianca Rinehart, successfully stripped control of a $4 billion-plus family trust away from their mother.\nAmong the claims in separate Federal Court proceedings, the two eldest children allege that Lang Hancock left exploration leases over the Roy Hill ore to his grandchildren, not his daughter.\nFor reasons unknown, the exploration applications were rejected by the relevant West Australian department. Instead of reapplying for the potentially lucrative iron ore tenements on behalf of the children, Mrs Rinehart allegedly lodged applications over the same ground through the family company she controlled, Hancock Prospecting.\nThe claims will be defended.\nIn a preview of the second Australian Story episode, Mrs Rinehart is Quote: d as saying: \"I really felt when we'd got our first mine up and happening the family should be happy.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/barrett_ink", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/111791755610985370077"], "published": "2015-07-06T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T22:06:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
