EurActiv France reports .\nThe Asian markets suffered overnight between Tuesday 7 and Wednesday 8 July, following a European summit that compounded fears of a complete economic collapse in Greece. The Nikkei index dropped by almost 4% and the euro fell heavily against the dollar. Raw materials are also in decline, and the price of crude oil fell by 2% to $56.20 a barrel.\nOnly bitcoin, an electronic currency, is offering some form of refuge. Many Greeks have decided to convert their assets into bitcoins, especially since the arrival of bitcoin ATMs in Athens.\nWhile the value of the virtual currency is on the rise, it is still far below its all-time high point. After peaking at $1,100 in January 2014, the exchange rate crashed to below $200 one year later. One bitcoin is currently worth $267.\nThe currency is increasingly attractive in Greece as it offers much-needed access to cash, while the banks continue to ration withdrawals to €60 per person per day.\n>>Read: Some Greeks look at bitcoin as alternative currency\nElectronic currencies have never been so popular. 120,000 bitcoin transactions were carried out in just one day in June, a ten-fold increase on four years ago. Some of the virtual currency's exchange platforms, like Coinbase, have taken advantage of the surge to raise their transaction fees.\nGrexit strategy on standby\nMembers of the eurozone convened in Brussels on Tuesday (7 July), and gave themselves until this weekend to agree on an emergency aid plan to avert the economic collapse of Greece and keep the country in the single currency.\nBut for the first time, Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission, admitted that he was prepared for the worst. \"We are ready with a detailed Grexit plan.\"\nThe veteran politician added that he hoped it would not come to that, but that he was powerless if the Greek government refused to respond to its European partners' demands.\nFrench central bank fears “chaos”\nChristian Noyer, the governor of the Banque de France, the French central bank, told Europe 1 on Wednesday that the ECB could not go on supporting Greece indefinitely.\n>>Read: Paris puts Bitcoin on EU agenda\n\"With no agreement on a reform programme in Greece, the European Central Bank (ECB) will be unable to keep supporting the Greek banks,\" Christian Noyer said.\n\"The Greek economy is on the edge of catastrophe. A deal absolutely must be found on Sunday because it will be too late after that and the consequences will be serious,\" he added. “I fear that if there is no agreement by Sunday it would spell the collapse of the Greek economy and chaos in the country.”", "external_links": ["http://www.euractiv.fr/sections/euro-finances/le-risque-de-grexit-fait-degringoler-les-marches-lexception-du-bitcoin-316109"], "published": "2015-07-08T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T18:54:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
