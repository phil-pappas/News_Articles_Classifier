It is his earliest known work. by Jane O'Sullivan The earliest known work by colonial painter John Campbell is set to go under the hammer for the first time at Deutscher and Hackett's Fine Art sale in Sydney on August 26.\nThe oil painting View of Launceston is from 1881, and predates the next known work of Campbell's by eight years.\nShortly after it was painted, and when he was still living in Tasmania, Campbell raffled View of Launceston to raise money. It was won by a Ringarooma hotel owner and has remained largely out of sight since then, passing by descent and private sale to its current owner in Adelaide, who was unaware of its rarity. The work has never been exhibited or published.\nLater in his life, the Scottish-born painter moved to Perth and became one of the most important West Australian painters of the late-19th and early-20th century. Today he is best known for his scenes of the city, particularly its breweries, and his subjects sit in stark contrast to the popular bush scenes that fuelled the nationalism of the day.\nCampbell's work is not often seen at auction View of Launceston has been given an estimate of $100,000 to $150,000. The highest price paid for his work to date was in 2005, when his 1909 painting View of Perth fetched $96,600 including a buyer's premium of 15 per cent with McKenzies Auctioneers.\nBy coincidence, another of Campbell's works, a watercolour of the Swan Brewery from 1903, has also been consigned to the Deutscher and Hackett sale by a different vendor. It carries an estimate of $25,000 to $35,000.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T09:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T16:36:10.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
