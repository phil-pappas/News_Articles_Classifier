Or what it’s like to work for one of the biggest food giants in the world?” user OrchidHibiscus wrote.\nOne Redditor asked: “Can you confirm the validity of the ‘Secret Menu’?”\nBehemoth ... the Land, Sea and Air burger, created from a Big Mac, a Filet-o-Fish and a McChicken all at once.

Picture: HackThe Menu Source: Supplied\n“You can order from the ‘Secret Menu’,” the manager confirmed. “Just like with any of our sandwiches, you can add, remove or change ingredients by special request. These are called ‘grill orders’.”\nShe said that staff at the chain may not know every one of the secret inventions by name, but if described they could be made as special orders, providing the customer is willing to pay for the additional ingredients.\nThe so-called secret menu is not an invention of McDonald’s but suggested items can be found at HackTheMenu.com — a site devoted to “unofficial and unadvertised selections that fast food chains will make when ordered but that do not exist on their regular menus”.\n“The creators of the McDonalds secret menu are those that dared to dream,” the site claims, explaining that the creative ingredient combinations have been popularised by word of mouth and the internet.\nA big appetite ... the McGangBang is a McChicken Sandwich placed directly inside a McDouble burger, buns and all. Picture: HackTheMenu Source: Supplied\nAmong the items is the Land, Sea and Air burger: a gigantic serving created from a Big Mac, a Filet-o-Fish and a McChicken all at once. The fish and chicken fillets are then incorporated into the Big Mac, including as many patties as desired, too.\nOther suggestions include the McGangBang (a McChicken Sandwich placed directly inside a McDouble burger, buns and all); the Pie McFlurry (an apple pie blended in a McFlurry ice cream dessert) and the Neapolitan Shake (strawberry, chocolate and vanilla all in the same cup).\nIn a statement to Mashable , the fast food retailer distanced themselves from the secret menu, but confirmed that customers request modifications to their orders.\n“We do not have a secret menu at McDonald’s UK. That’s because we love the food that we serve in our restaurants and we don’t want to keep it a secret from our customers,” a spokesperson said.\nCustomers can ask for changes, however. “Any requests for extra items or changes to our products are considered at the restaurant manager’s discretion and any additional items may be charged for.”\n Manager confirms Macca’s ‘secret menu’", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/22/1227451/666252-b803f27e-2fad-11e5-8b6b-ddbc289c2b0a.jpg", "http://hackthemenu.com/mcdonalds/secret-menu/", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/manager-confirms-mcdonalds-secret-menu-during-reddit-ama/story-fneuz8wn-1227451666278", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/22/1227451/666622-b3af8684-2fad-11e5-8b6b-ddbc289c2b0a.jpg", "https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3dmf9b/iama_mcdonalds_manager_ama/", "http://mashable.com/2015/07/20/mcdonalds-secret-menu-ama/", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/22/1227451/666224-bbb27094-2fad-11e5-8b6b-ddbc289c2b0a.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-22T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T17:45:21.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
