In the petition, one Sudhir Yadav has prayed before the apex court for exemplary punishment to the concerned officers who has flouted the Supreme Court directions for not making Aadhaar number mandatory for availing benefits from the government. Yadav said, \"Despite the clear orders of the Supreme Court, the Modi Government has announced a new service, which is totally Aadhaar-based and even if anybody wants to create an account on that website digitallocker.gov.in that person has to provide Aadhaar number that is clearly violation of Supreme Court order.\" While launching the Digital India week, Prime Minister Modi had announced the Digital Locker service for all citizens to store valuable documents online. However, only those who have procured an Aadhaar number can access it. \"Due to this act of Government, the right of equality is under threat as people who have not enrolled for Aadhaar cannot access the website of Digital Locker even if they are citizens of India and they contribute in the society,\" Yadav alleged in the petition. Karnataka High Court's former judge K S Puttaswamy had moved the Court in 2012 contending that the entire Aadhaar scheme was unconstitutional as the biometric data collected under it was an incursion and transgression of individual privacy. The apex court is likely to hear the matter concerning and illegality of 12-digit biometric Aadhaar number on 21 July 2015. Earlier in March 2015, a bench of Justice J Chelameswar, Justice SA Bobde and Justice C Nagappan reiterated it was incumbent upon the central government to ensure that the states complied with the Supreme Court's order of not making Aadhaar mandatory for availing social benefits under various schemes. The apex court by its 23 September 2013 order, had said \"no person should suffer for not getting the Aadhaar in spite of the fact that some authorities had issued a circular making it mandatory and when any person applies to get the Aadhaar voluntarily, it may be checked whether that person is entitled for it under the law and it should not be given to any illegal immigrant.\" More in Moneylife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T13:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T13:44:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
