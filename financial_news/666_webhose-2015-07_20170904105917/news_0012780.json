Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rowan Dean \"And you can join the conversation by following the twitter hashtag at the bottom of your screen. But our first question tonight relates to the vexed and controversial issue of whether or not Israel is a proto-fascist, racist, totalitarian state that should never have been allowed to exist in the first place. With us in the audience we have Otto Adolf Eichmann, a reformed and rehabilitated Obersturmbannf端hrer. Otto, you spent your retirement years being mercilessly hounded by the Israeli government until you were illegally kidnapped from Brazil by sinister agents acting, I believe, on behalf of the Zionist entity, and on top of which you were twice deprived of your basic human rights, firstly by being flown illegally to Tel Aviv where you had to suffer the ignominy of a so-called fair trial and then of course by being hung. Otto, what is your perspective on Israel? Should a Jewish state even be allowed to exist? Or did the entire world make a huge mistake, in your opinion, by creating a phony and entirely illegitimate state out of what was clearly the once proud, historic and noble State of Palestine?\"\n\"Ja.\"\n\"Thank you Otto, and now moving on, because I think we've given that topic more than enough time for tonight, I'd like to discuss the vexed and controversial issue of climate change and the way the Abbott government is threatening the entire eco-system of the Great Barrier Reef and indeed the survival of the entire human race due to its disgraceful slandering of the lucrative renewable energy industry courtesy of Tony Abbott's extraordinarily defamatory attack on the visual appeal of windmills. And I'll take a question from the audience on this topic. Um, the gentleman with the grey beard and the dark glasses, I believe you have a question for the panel?\"\n\"Thank you, yes. Several years ago the highly respected and incredibly visionary Australian of the Year, Professor Flannery, warned that global warming would lead to catastrophic climate change which of course we are seeing now all around us, just as I predicted. Is it not the case that I, er, I mean Professor Flannery was completely correct in every single one of his predictions and that he should immediately be reinstated as National Climate Change Commissioner on three days a week with my full salary, plus compensation, plus inflation, plus super?\"\n\"Thank you, Tim. I'll take that as a very astute and pertinent comment because we're running out of time and we've more than covered that topic tonight. But I'd just like to address another issue in which we are seeing the Abbott government floundering to the point of chaotic dysfunction with reports of cabinet ministers literally gouging out each others' eyeballs and that of course is the vexed and highly controversial issue of marriage equality, or gay marriage as some people prefer to offensively label this hugely popular and emotional cause. I'll take a question from a random member of the audience. The woman at the back in the blue dress with the, er, neatly trimmed black beard. Yes, you sir, er, I mean ma'am, er...\"\n\"Thank you sweetie. I think we should all be able to marry whoever we want to so long as we love each other and I think Mr Abbott is actually suppressing his true feelings because of his repressive upbringing, I mean, he used to wear a frock didn't he?\"\n\"Well, I'll take that as a comment but I'm afraid we won't have time to go to the panel on that one because we've got a lot more to cover tonight, particularly the vexed and controversial issues currently arising out of the so-called Royal Commission into Trade Union Corruption which is, of course, nothing more than a vicious Abbott government attack upon the basic human right to join whichever trade union Bill Shorten wants you to whether you agree to it or not. I'll go to the audience on this one. The gentleman there in the yellow vest with the knuckle-dusters and the large wrench. You have a question for the panel, I believe?\"\n\"Get nicked.\"\n \"OK, well, I'll take that as a comment, but before we go I'd like to take a question on the vexed and controversial issue of impartiality at the ABC and whether or not the panel agrees that the Abbott government is engaged in a vicious political attack not only on the national broadcaster, but on all progressive and fair-minded Australians that can only be described as cultural genocide and our question tonight comes from a random member of the audience who is a well-respected pubic servant who has devoted her entire career to compassionately improving the basic human rights of the entire nation.
