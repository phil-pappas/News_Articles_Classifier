Stay Focused. 0 SHARES July 29, 2015 Startups 0 \nOne of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned in running a business is to stay laser-focused on the end goal. \nWe entrepreneurs tend to become easily distracted. We follow every shiny object or promising idea that crosses our path in hopes it will lead us to great success. But what we seem to forget is the very reason why we went into business in the first place, which is to make clients happy, solve problems, and (for me) in the tech world, build cool things . We must never lose sight of the reasons why we started a business. \nWhatever it is that drives you, whether it’s a startup or an established business, here are a few things to keep in perspective as you make way through the journey of entrepreneurship. Be a legacy that your clients will remember. Is your word more coveted than your signature to your clients? When you are in a predicament that is out of your hands, figure out how to weather the storm and shelter your clients as much as you can. The one thing I’ve learned here is that no matter how much change a business endures, when you are loyal to your clients and always keep their best interests at heart, they will undoubtedly remain loyal to you. Invest more into your team, and less in yourself. Are you hiring seasoned and devoted talent? Some of the most successful companies have taken enormous risks by investing in greatly talented individuals before being financially sound. Hiring the right people to be the pillars of your business is the difference between failure and success. Hire people smarter than you that can build a phenomenal product to solve a serious problem, because mediocrity is not an option when it comes to the reputation of your business. Don’t try to solve the world’s problems. Just solve one. Are you trying to solve the world’s problems? If you find yourself answering “yes”, then you have undoubtedly set yourself up for failure, my friend. The key is to be a SME (Subject Matter Expert). Positioning yourself as someone who has the highest level of expertise in your specific field will help to ensure that those who are seeking the assistance of an expert WILL find you. If unable to explain what you do in a few simple words, you are just another company that sells a commodity item, and will get lost in the noise of commonality. Stop making the same mistakes. Failure when applying a new strategy is better than failure from making the same mistakes time and time again. My favorite quote from Albert Einstein is “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results”. Don’t expect to get new and improved results if you don’t alter anything about your process in the quest to get them. \nFor our team at Indigo Interactive, the transition to get here was not an easy one. Despite all of the bumps along the way, staying intensely focused on our end goal is what got us to where we are today and is what will continue to power us through the years to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T10:14:38.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
