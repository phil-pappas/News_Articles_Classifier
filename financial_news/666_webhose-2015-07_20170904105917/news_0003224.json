Dividends hit record high for London investors By Marion Dakers | Telegraph – 6 hours ago 3.76 -0.02 \nFTSE 350 firms paid out £28.3bn in ordinary dividends in the three months to the end of June \nLarge companies paid out £28.3bn in ordinary dividends during the second quarter of the year, sharing the benefits of the cheaper pound against the dollar with a 12.7pc bigger windfall for investors compared to last year. \nThe fall of the pound against the dollar has intensified the effect of the rising payments, boosting dividends by £800m according to estimates from Capita Asset Services. The jump goes some way to the currency translation pain experienced by investors in global firms in 2014. \nExcluding the effects of special dividend payments, the three months to the end of June were the most lucrative for dividend income in Capita (LSE: CPI.L - news ) 's figures, which stretch back to 2007. \nHSBC was the biggest payer in the FTSE 350 during the quarter, benefiting from foreign exchange movements that took its dividend up 21pc in sterling terms to £2.9bn. \nFinancial services dividends overall were up 33pc on a year ago to £10.1bn, extending the sector’s lead as the most prolific dividend payer. Lloyds’ long-awaited return to payments added £535m to the total, while Barclays (Swiss: BARC.SW - news ) flattered the figures by handing out £642m during the quarter, later than its traditional dividend payment. \nThe total windfall for investors this year is unlikely to match the £94.7bn seen in 2014, when Vodafone issued a record-breaking £15.9bn special dividend to reward investors after selling its stake in Verizon (NYSE: VZ - news ) . \nThe payment policies could also be affected in future by the Chancellor’s surprise move to replace the dividend tax credit with a £5,000 tax-free allowance on dividend income from 2016. The Treasury has estimated that 15pc of investors will see their tax bill rise as a result. \n“The changes announced in the Budget also give pause for thought next year, bringing benefit to many small-scale investors, yet impacting higher rate tax payers and those with larger portfolios,” said Justin Cooper, chief executive of shareholder solutions at Capita. \nSome sectors pared back their dividends in the last three months, including utilities, where Centrica (LSE: CNA.L - news ) cut its payment to shore up its credit rating in the face of falling power bills. \nThe researchers estimated a dividend yield of 4.1pc for the FTSE 100 and 2.9pc for mid-cap stocks in 2015, while acknowledging the volatility in some equities, particularly during the Greek crisis, that could alter the figures. Ordinary dividends are expected to reach £87.2bn for the year. \n“The outlook has been improving, but it’s not all plain sailing. The continuing Greek crisis has the potential to hamper companies more exposed to the Eurozone, while the pressure on the supermarket sector will be felt more keenly next quarter, with Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) and Sainsbury to pay out £1bn less to investors,” said Mr Cooper.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T09:46:29.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
