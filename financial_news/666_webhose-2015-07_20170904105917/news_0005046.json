The institute pointed to weakness in the automotive, construction and heavy-machinery sectors, which together account for nearly 80 per cent of domestic demand for steel. Latin America's largest economy grew a mere 0.1 per cent in 2014 and is forecast to contract by at least 1.2 per cent this year amid projected inflation of nine per cent. In the face of the Brazilian economic slump, steelmakers have eliminated 11,200 contractor positions, idled production facilities and suspended planned investment on the order of $US2.1 billion ($A2.84 billion), the institute said.
