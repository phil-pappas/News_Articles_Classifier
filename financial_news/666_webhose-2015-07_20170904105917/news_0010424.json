Kate Geraghty by Jacob Greber Joanna Mather Acting Treasurer Bruce Billson has rejected a Productivity Commission call to review superannuation and pensions, while an expert adviser to the Henry review said the agency's proposals were exactly what was needed.\nMr Billson described the commission's suggestion in a report published on Tuesday as a \"useful contribution to the tax white paper process, but that's it\".\nThe comments are likely to be disappointing for the independent commission, which argues against making piecemeal changes to the retirement system, given its complexity.\nJohn Piggott, a member of the Henry tax review and now director of the ARC Centre of Excellence in Population Ageing Research at the University of NSW, backed the commission's ideas to review and possibly lift the age at which people can access their super.\n\"If you really want to cut super tax concessions, the best possible way of doing it is to raise the access age, because this would encourage people to work longer and pay taxes for longer,\" he told a conference in Sydney.\n\"It will also mean they are better provided for in their retirement because they accumulate more.\n\"If you go back to the Henry review, I think you'll find some remarks about the link between the superannuation access age and the pension access age and an increasing gap between those two ages … you would hope that, at the very least, they would stay in lockstep.\"\nThe Productivity Commission has also indicated there is no overriding urgency for governments to change the superannuation rules ahead of a more considered response that takes in the views of those who are affected.\n Labor opposed to changes Commissioner Karen Chester told The Australian Financial Review that any review of retirement policy must be holistic and \"informed by considered and extensive community consultation\".\n\"The human circumstances of older Australians are very diverse,\" she said. Any other approach would be \"less than ideal\".\nThe commission forecast that delaying the age at which people can access super, also known as the preservation age, would see the budget boosted by $7 billion a year by the middle of the century, with savers increasing their lump sums by more than 10 per cent.\nOpposition treasury spokesman Chris Bowen challenged Prime Minister Tony Abbott to rule out any change to the preservation age, given the Coalition's pledge to make no changes to superannuation.\n\"This is people's money, and making them wait longer to access it would be a retrograde step – and not one that would find support, I would suggest, from people who are concerned primarily about the future of their retirement incomes,\" Mr Bowen said.\n\"We know Joe Hockey has hinted at this in the past ; we would call on the government to rule out doing this in the future.\"\nWith the pension age rising to 67 years next decade and potentially 70 years thereafter, many retirement experts are calling for a commensurate increase in the preservation age to remove the temptation to spend down savings to qualify for the aged pension.\nLabor opposes further increases in the access age, arguing that many people are forced to stop work before the pension age – something Tuesday's Productivity Commission report reinforced.\nMr Billson reiterated the government's view that it has no plans to make any unexpected or adverse changes to super before the next election.\nHe said Labor's approach to super was to treat it as an option to \"break glass in case of budget emergency\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T14:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T19:11:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
