Why would you want to provide taxpayers with any sense of how to plan before the year actually ends? Crazy talk, I know.\nBut this year, crazy must be on the agenda because it’s just midyear and the Senate is already making noise about a tax extender package. By comparison, in 2014 , the Senate waited until just over two weeks left in the calendar year to pass a bill that extended certain tax provisions through December 31, 2014 (retroactive to January 1, 2014). At the time, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) referred to the bill as “quite literally the best we could do.”\nSen. Hatch is clearly hoping to do a little better this time, announcing , together with Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), that the Senate Finance Committee will begin markup on a tax extenders bill on Tuesday, July 21.\nSen.

Hatch said, about the (cough) head start, “This markup will give the committee a timely opportunity to act on extending a number of expired provisions in the tax code that help families, individuals and small businesses.” He went on to note that “we need to advance a package as soon as possible. This package is a result of strong bipartisan work, and I look forward to working with the full committee to ensure members are able to work their will and examine these provisions carefully.\nHis colleague, Sen. Wyden, agreed saying, “We need to extend these tax provisions now in order to provide greater certainty and predictability for middle class families and businesses alike.”\nIt all sounds really great, right?\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.finance.senate.gov/newsroom/chairman/release/?id=af2552d3-b2a7-4aee-8a98-2eb76111d97d", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/12d2ba21988a4991b1ab7d932bdad7b0/640x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "published": "2015-07-19T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T19:59:40.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
