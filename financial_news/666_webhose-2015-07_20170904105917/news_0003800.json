IndexIQ is launching a trio of ETFs that split the difference, said the fund provider's CEO Adam Patti . \n\"We've found that the 50% hedged solution is the optimal solution because it provides 80% of your volatility reduction of the fully hedged solution and more consistent returns over time,\" Patti said. \nIndexIQ, which is a subsidiary of New York Life Company and works in partnership with its MainStay brand, today announced the launch of three new ETFs: IQ 50 Percent Hedged FTSE International ETF ( HFXI ) , IQ 50 Percent Hedged FTSE Europe ETF ( HFXE ) , and IQ 50 Percent Hedged FTSE Japan ETF ( HFXJ ) . \nPrior to this launch, investors were generally left with two choices in getting exposure to international equity ETFs, either go 100% currency hedged or completely unhedged. Both options require investors to make an implicit call on the future direction of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies. Patti said IndexIQ's new ETFs take a neutral approach, while saving investors the time and costs of mixing and matching. \nMust Read: Warren Buffett's Top 10 Dividend Stocks \nOf course, if an investor wants to make a market call on the direction of the yen or Euro, they can do that as well while holding the 50% hedged ETF as a core position. \n\"If you have a strong view on currencies, either bullish or bearish, you can have your core taken care of instead of having to manage two positions on a monthly basis,\" said Patti, adding that 50% hedged solution \"takes the market timing element completely out of it\" for investors.
