It’s all very well getting a 5 per cent dividend, but if you lose 10 per cent of your capital it defeats the purpose.”\nTodman warns that shopping around and chopping and changing banks won’t always be worth the effort. “If you have got $10,000 and can get an extra 0.15 per cent, it’s $15 a year.\n“Ask your bank at the time what is their best rate, and what is the term of that best rate, and see whether that suits you.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/find-the-sweet-spot-for-term-deposits/story-e6frfmcr-1227427066420?sv=9f22296c56bd23100d45bb3d369eba7a", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=The+sweet+spot+for+term+deposits&c=RECORD+low+interest+rates+may+have+trimmed+the+amount+you+can+earn+on+term+deposits%2C+but+experts+warn+simply+rolling+over+your+investment+can+be+the+worst+thing+you+can+do.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/find-the-sweet-spot-for-term-deposits/story-e6frfmcr-1227427066420?sv=9f22296c56bd23100d45bb3d369eba7a", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/find-the-sweet-spot-for-term-deposits/story-e6frfmcr-1227427066420?sv=9f22296c56bd23100d45bb3d369eba7a&title=The+sweet+spot+for+term+deposits", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/find-the-sweet-spot-for-term-deposits/story-e6frfmcr-1227427066420?sv=9f22296c56bd23100d45bb3d369eba7a&h=The+sweet+spot+for+term+deposits", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/find-the-sweet-spot-for-term-deposits/story-e6frfmcr-1227427066420?sv=9f22296c56bd23100d45bb3d369eba7a", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/find-the-sweet-spot-for-term-deposits/story-e6frfmcr-1227427066420?sv=9f22296c56bd23100d45bb3d369eba7a&title=The+sweet+spot+for+term+deposits"], "published": "2015-07-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T01:22:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
