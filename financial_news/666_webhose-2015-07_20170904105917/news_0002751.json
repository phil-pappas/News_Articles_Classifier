European stocks slump on China, US technology woes AFP â€“ 15 minutes ago View Photo \n\nEuropean shares sank Wednesday, with the mining sector hit by renewed concern over China and after disappointing earnings figures from US technology giants Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) , Yahoo (NasdaqGS: YHOO - news ) and Microsoft (NasdaqGS: MSFT - news ) . \nLondon's benchmark FTSE 100 index dropped 1.50 percent to stand at 6,667.21 points in afternoon deals, with mining companies hit hard by stubborn worries over Chinese demand. \nFrankfurt's DAX 30 shed 0.93 percent compared with Tuesday's close to 11,496.55 points and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.41 percent to 5,085.83 points. \nIn foreign exchange, the euro slid to $1.0902 from $1.0942 late in New York on Tuesday, as dealers awaited a second Greek parliamentary vote on its vast reforms-for-cash bailout deal. \nLondon's mining sector faced fierce selling pressure, with sentiment dented by sliding metal prices. \nAnglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) was down 5.6 percent to 813.50 pence and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) slid 4.8 percent to 1,192 pence. \n\"The London market has been hit hardest by the mining sector, which is taking its cues from the financial turbulence in China,\" said analyst David Madden at trading firm IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) . \n\"The wheels are starting to come off in China, and if Beijing is having trouble keeping its stock market in check, it does not inspire confidence in its position as the biggest importer of minerals in the world.\" \nLondon-listed ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) , whose microchip designs are used to help power Apple's iPads, saw its share price dive 5.1 percent to 986.50 pence on the Apple results, despite an upbeat outlook and dividend hike from the British chipmaker. \n\"Chipmaker ARM Holdings issued an optimistic outlook for the second half, and it also rewarded shareholders with a healthy boost to its dividend, but the move in Apple in after-hours trading led the stock lower,\" Madden added. \nOvernight, Apple posted a 38 percent jump in quarterly net profit, but its shares slid as analysts had expected more, while revenue forecasts weighed. \nThe US tech giant's profit soared to $10.7 billion on surging iPhone sales in the quarter that ended on June 27, from $7.7 billion a year earlier. \nMicrosoft meanwhile announced a net loss of $3.19 billion in the past quarter, blaming a hefty writedown on the smartphone business it acquired from Nokia. \nElsewhere in the sector, Yahoo revealed it had swung to a loss of $22 million in the second quarter, but revenues grew as the Internet pioneer refocused its efforts on mobile and other growing sectors. \nThat sent Wall Street down at the opening bell. \nFive minutes into trade, the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index had fallen 0.91 percent to 5,160.86 points. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.27 percent to 17,871.66, while the broad-based S&P 500 fell 0.32 percent to 2,112.44. \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in Apple plunged 5.9 percent in opening trading, Microsoft's stock dropped 2.3 percent, while Yahoo fell 1.9 percent. \n- Tech earnings disappoint - \n\"UK and European equities have followed the wider global market lower after both new and old technology results disappointed,\" said Rebecca O'Keeffe, investment head at broker Interactive Investor. \n\"Since Google's performance last week, expectations had been running high that the sector would provide the momentum for further equity market growth. \n\"However, with Apple, Microsoft and Yahoo all failing to meet investor expectations, the outlook has paled amid concerns that prices in the sector have overshot.\" \nAsian markets mostly retreated following the negative lead from Wall Street, where sentiment was also hit by poor earnings news from IBM (NYSE: IBM - news ) and United Technologies. \nElsewhere, the British pound edged higher after the Bank of England (BoE (Shenzhen: 000725.SZ - news ) ) said its nine-member monetary policy committee had voted unanimously earlier this month to hold interest rates. \nBoE governor Mark Carney had indicated last week that Britain's record-low 0.50 percent lending rate could start to rise at the turn of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T17:35:41.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
