For people who didn't save enough to keep themselves in their lifestyle after retirement , they provide a valuable tool for closing the gap between needs and income. But are they for everyone? And what do you need to know before you leap into one? We spoke to leading experts in the financial world to find out what you need to know to get the most out of a reverse mortgage without being taken advantage of. \nHow a Reverse Mortgage Works \nLeslie Bocskor, managing partner at Electrum Partners in Las Vegas, explains that reverse mortgages are more or less exactly what they sound like. \"Instead of making payments, you take money out of the equity of your home,\" he said. The amount you owe on the home increases on a weekly basis, based on interest rates. \"It's an end-of-life financial instrument,\" he explains. \"The lender has to say how long this person will be alive. Are we going to lend them money and be forced to evict them later? That's obviously not what they want.\" More Headlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T21:54:46.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
