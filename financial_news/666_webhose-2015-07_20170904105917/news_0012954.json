By exiting Braskem, Petrobras could resolve the problem of selling naphtha to a client in which the company has a significant financial interest, the newspaper added. \nAccording to Valor, other divestitures could include selling exploration units in Africa, which are owned jointly with Grupo BTG Pactual SA's merchant banking unit, and refining and distribution businesses in Argentina. \nBraskem, which is the largest Latin American producer of resins, is controlled by engineering conglomerate Odebrecht SA. Petrobras declined to comment on the Valor report. \nPetrobras wants to improve corporate governance practices, including revamping the way tax liabilities are accounted, Valor said. As per request of Chief Executive Officer Aldemir Bendine and his team, such liabilities will have to be provisioned against the balance sheet, the newspaper added. \nThe report comes as Petrobras trimmed capital spending for the next five years by about 41 percent, a move that investors said was an admission that expansion plans imposed on it by more than 12 years of Workers' Party governments were unrealistic. The company is increasingly relying on cost reductions to improve operational performance. \nPetrobras is also stepping up assets sales to raise funds to finance capital spending and reduce debt. \n($1 = $3.1496 Brazilian reais) \n(Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama) \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T19:42:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
