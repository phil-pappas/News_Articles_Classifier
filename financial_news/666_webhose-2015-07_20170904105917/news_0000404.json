Charles Williams II, president of the Michigan Chapter of the National Action Network and pastor of King Solomon Baptist Church in Detroit. \nGeneral Motors, whose Chevrolet brand is sponsoring Kid Rock's summer tour, today sent the Free Press a statement confirming the meeting Thursday. \n\"We have been in touch with Reverend Williams, and representatives from Chevrolet will be meeting with him later this week to better understand his concerns. We need to let some open and constructive dialogue occur as a first step, and we'll go from there,\" according to the statement. \nMembers of the action network, a branch of the national organization founded by Al Sharpton, appeared outside the Detroit Historical Museum earlier this month calling on Kid Rock to distance himself from the battle flag that represented the South in the Civil War and has been associated with racial hatred. Last week, the issue became more heated. \nFox News Channel's Megyn Kelly, wrapping up a segment about Rock and the Confederate flag, passed along his message: \n\"Please tell the people protesting that they can kiss my ...,\" Rock said, according to Kelly. \nBut the automaker on Friday reiterated its support for Rock, who has been criticized by some for his use of the controversial flag through the years. A Chevrolet spokesman said Friday that the automaker stands behind the statement it issued Monday after a Detroit protest by NAN, a New York-based group founded by the Rev. Al Sharpton. \nProtests of rocker Kid Rock are nothing new.

Wrapping up a segment about Rock and the Confederate flag, Kelly passed along his message. \nRock's spokesman told the Free Press that the remark came from a personal conversation between Rock and the Fox host. 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1MsnUuO TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T02:01:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
