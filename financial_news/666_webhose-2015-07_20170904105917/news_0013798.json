It sold at Colliers International Winter Portfolio Auction for $3.4 million, signalling a continuing interest in inner-city development opportunities.\nThe asset, bought by a local developer, sits alongside a host of hotel and commercial assets, including the Quest World Square Apartments, Meriton Serviced Apartments and the 19-floor commercial tower, Roden Cutler House.\nAbout 20 parties registered interest, according to the selling agents Matt Pontey and Jordan Lee, of Colliers International, and Tim Fox, of PropertyFox.\nAdvertisement Blocks of older flats that can be upgraded are also in demand, with the latest offering being a block of eight units at 297 Ernest Street, Neutral Bay across from the Cammeray Golf Course Club.\nAgent to the deal, Mark Hilder, head of investment sales for LJ Hooker Commercial Sydney, said commercial buyers have been buying residential in blocks of units.\nMr Hilder, who with Warren Duncan, managing director of LJ Hooker Commercial, has sold three large blocks of units in the past four months in Centennial Park, Randwick and Kensington for between $4.4 million to $7.3 million, said instead of buying individual residential properties, commercial investors have started snapping up residential blocks of units for their future development opportunity.\nThe buyers of the three blocks were local and international investors.\n\"There is a low supply of freehold blocks of units and the demand has been incredible due to their appeal to both commercial and residential buyers,\" he said.\n\"Adding to the demand is the ability for overseas buyers to purchase an entire block of units because it is seen as a commercial purchase.\"\nIn another trend, private home owners in Sydney's south-west are also taking advantage of the strong demand for residential development sites, by joining forces with their neighbours to sell their houses as one lot to developers for higher returns.\nRecent sales of residential development sites in the area by JLL's Ari Danas and Michael Ajaka have seen home owners employ this technique to benefit from the demand.\nMr Danas and Mr Ajaka sold a 2947-square-metre site to a local developer for $10 million at 754-774 Canterbury Road, Belmore. It was comprised of six adjacent, separate houses.\nMr Danas, JLL's director, sales and investments NSW, said Sydney home owners were becoming increasingly savvy and recognising the potential benefits of selling together.\n\"Home owners are realising that the demand for residential development sites means their land is a very attractive proposition to the interested party,\" Mr Danas said.\nMr Ajaka, JLL's director, metro sales and investments, said he expected demand for residential development sites to spread even further west to suburbs including Roselands and Lakemba due to new zoning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T07:39:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
