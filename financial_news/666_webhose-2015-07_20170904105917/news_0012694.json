Bloomberg Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey The $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation is seeking advice on whether an Abbott government ban on investing in technologies such as wind and rooftop solar panels is against the law.\nThe government-owned company signalled its legal concerns on Monday in response to a change to its investment rules proposed by Treasurer Joe Hockey and Assistant Treasurer Mathias Cormann, which was revealed over the weekend.\nThe corporation's board said it was focused on its duty under legislation \"to facilitate increased flows of finance into the clean energy sector\".\nJohn Grimes, chief executive of the Australian Solar Council, said he understood the CEFC was concerned about the ban on \"mature technologies\" in the new investment rules. He said on some readings almost all technologies which the CEFC invested in could be considered \"mature\". For instance it would be almost impossible under the change to invest in energy efficiency projects, which are a core part of the CEFC's legislative mandate.\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott and his ministers emphasised on Monday they wanted the CEFC abolished but given Parliament would not allow that, they said the organisation should focus on investing in \"new, innovative and emerging technologies\".\nAny project using established technology should be financed by the private sector, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said.\n\"If the Clean Energy Finance Corporation continues to be in place, then rather than to compete with the private sector in relation to mature technologies, wind for example, investing in existing wind farm projects is not what the Clean Energy Finance Corporation was originally set up for,\" he said.\nOpposition environment spokesman Mark Butler said the government had misunderstood the purpose of the CEFC. \"What the Clean Energy Finance Corporation was set up to do is not to support emerging technologies. That's the job of the renewable energy agency ARENA,\" he said.\n \"What it's set up to do is to nurture the development of a mature lending culture in Australian banks. The CEFC ... partners with banks, it partners with companies like Origin Energy to set up financial products that will allow the renewable energy industry, including wind and rooftop solar, to continue to flourish in this country.\"\nCEFC helps with purchase: Origin A spokesman for Origin Energy, which received a $100 million grant from the CEFC this month to install rooftop solar panels, said the CEFC helped consumers overcome the difficulty of borrowing from banks.\n\"One remaining obstacle for solar has been the cost of paying for the system upfront,\" he said. \"This financing helps provide solar systems for more Australians, especially those that may not own their property or are not able to fund the purchase of a system.\"\nBrett Himbury, the chief executive of IFM investors, said there was a benefit for organisations such as his in that the government's attacks on wind farms mean there would be fewer built and that would drive up the price of existing assets.\nIFM is trying to sell its stake in Pacific Hydro, not because of any concerns about wind energy, but because energy markets globally are not proving a good investment for infrastructure funds.\nTony Wood, energy policy director of the Grattan Institute, said he agreed with the government that it had been stupid for the CEFC to refinance existing wind farms, but the CEFC had not invested in these types of projects for some time.\n\"This does seem like a needless provocation, particularly since the CEFC had been moving in the direction of the new directive anyway.\"\nHe said it was strange that the government should specify which technologies the CEFC should invest in, and said this should be left up to the CEFC board.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-13T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T10:58:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
