Therefore, the increases do refer to across-the-board pay increases. \nBÃ¤rbel Kirchner, consulting general manager of the CIF, further clarified: \"The minimum wage increases will only become effective as from the date of promulgation. Naturally, employers are not restricted and if they wish they can adjust the minimum wages immediately. It is totally within their discretion.\" \nChanges also include an adjustment of the service allowance from 144 hours to 150 hours, once the collective agreement is promulgated. Thus, every worker will be paid equal to 150 hours of his/her wage, which will be part of the remuneration in December. This allowance will be calculated pro-rata for each fully worked month that the employee was in service during that specific year. \nThe anticipated increase is higher than in the previous years, which then was 9 percent for 2012/2013 and 9.5 percent for 2013/2014. With the simultaneous adjustment to the service allowance, and taking into consideration the inflation rate, minimum wages effectively will increase in real terms. \nUntil the new collective agreement is promulgated, which allows the extension of the agreement to the industry at large, Government Gazette No 5372 dated 24 December 2013 remains enforceable to every company operating in the industry. \nRelated", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T05:05:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
