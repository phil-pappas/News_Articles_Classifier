'I came off a good finish (a tie for 14th) in the US Women's Open and I'm feeling confident right now.' \nSalas' playing partner Saturday was Lexi Thompson who posted a three-under 68 and shares second place with Kris Tamulis (67) at 12-under. \nBrittany Lincicome South Korean Ryu So-Yeon and Caroline Masson of Germany all shot six-under 65 to move into a tie for fourth at 10-under-par 203. \nThey were joined there by Korean-American rookie Alison Lee (70) Gerina Piller (69) and Katie Burnett (66). \nWorld number one Park highlights a group of four players in a tie for 10th. She posted a five-under 66 to end three rounds on 204 at the Blythefield Country Club. \nSalas' lone USLPGA Tour win came at the 2014 Kingsmill Championship. Three months ago she felt she needed a change so she hired a new coach and revamped her swing. \n'Everything is coming together' said Salas. \nSalas started quickly in round three with a birdie on the par-five first hole. She parred the second then posted back-to-back birdies on Nos. 3 and 4. She capped the front nine with another birdie on the par-four ninth. \nShe caught fire again on the back nine with a birdie run that carried her through the par-three 14 par-four 15 and par-four 16. \nThompson bounced back from her only bogey of the day on No. 17 with a two-foot birdie putt on the last hole to shoot 68. \nTamulis who hails from Michigan was at even par for her round through nine holes before carding four birdies on the back nine. She is excited about having an opportunity to win in front of family and friends. \n'It would be a dream to win in my home state' Tamulis said. 'I played all my junior golf here. People have been coming up to me all week saying they saw me when I was this big.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T13:37:15.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
