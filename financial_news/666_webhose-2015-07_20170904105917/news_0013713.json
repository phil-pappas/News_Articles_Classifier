(MarketWatch) —Visitors to this city once celebrated for its stockyards often make a point of feasting at a local steakhouse. Also on their checklist: driving past the home of billionaire businessman Warren Buffett—also known as the Oracle of Omaha.\nBut a number of tourists are putting a different Omaha experience on their sightseeing itinerary, touted as the truly relaxing and romantic way to experience this Midwestern metropolis. They take a ride aboard a replica of a Venetian gondola.\nAt the Heartland of America Park’s 15-acre lake, entrepreneur Steven Anderson and crew welcome passengers to their 32-foot craft, which boasts many true-to-Venice details, including the distinctive curved ornament, known as a “ferro,” affixed to the bow. For $35, couples can get a 30-minute private cruise that gives them time to glide past a fountain, take in cityscape views and maybe hear the gondolier croon a tune or two.\nIf love is really in the air, marriage proposals are a possibility: Anderson counts about 150 instances of someone popping the question aboard his boat since he set up shop 13 years ago. There hasn’t been a rejection to date—at least as far as he can tell.\n“Someone might change their mind once we get on land,” said Anderson, 62 years old.\nHe is hardly alone in efforts to spread the romance of the gondola. In recent years, gondoliers in dozens of U.S. cities have established operations, promising passengers they can experience the best of Italy minus the jet lag.\nIn Stillwater, Minn., John Kerschbaum, a canoe guide-turned-gondolier, cruises the St. Croix River on a boat he purchased in Venice for $20,000-plus. His “Gondola Elegante” package—at $295—comes with a five-course meal and one-hour ride. For such occasions, Kerschbaum sports a costume modeled after 16th-century Venetian garb. Otherwise, most American gondoliers, including Kerschbaum, wear the traditional Venetian boatman’s outfit of a striped shirt and straw hat.\nWhere to find the nearest gondolier\nIn Providence, R.I., Matthew Haynes, a schoolteacher who parlayed his skills rowing crew in college into a second career as a gondolier, travels two rivers for a steady stream of passengers. Haynes is another stickler for authenticity—two of his three gondolas were built in Italy—but bends the rules a bit. He has taken to introducing himself as “Marcello” to passengers.\n“Nobody wants a gondolier named Matthew,” he said.\nIn addition to smaller-scale gondoliers are major operators—most notably, The Venetian resort in Las Vegas, which employs 50-plus gondoliers, who keep a fleet of 18 boats running along two man-made canals (one indoors, one outdoors). Among the Venetian’s main requirements for would-be boatmen? They must pass a singing audition and a “jump test” that involves jumping into the resort’s often brisk waters. They take passengers on at least 100,000 cruises a year.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?q=select+col1+from+1rUVWKX-DkxzfHCZqenxPkNRZ2O_MI6lCPc3XZQKp&viz=MAP&h=false&lat=38.118675078646284&lng=-96.6649969&t=1&z=5&l=col1&y=2&tmplt=2&hml=ONE_COL_LAT_LNG"], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T05:13:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
