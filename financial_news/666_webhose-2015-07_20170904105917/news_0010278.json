The data was compiled by Markit, the London-based index company. \nAny PMI reading below 50 indicates contraction in the sector and today's flash estimate is typically based on approximately 85%–90% of total PMI survey responses each month. \nIn Tokyo, the flash Japanese manufacturing PMI survey was sponsored by Nikkei, which agreed on Thursday to acquire the Financial Times. \nAmy Brownbill, economist at Markit , which compiled the Japan survey, said: “Operating conditions in the Japanese manufacturing sector improved in July. Production rose at the quickest rate since February, while new order growth was the second-strongest this year so far. Subsequently, employment rose at the fastest rate since December 2014 and buying activity growth resumed. \n\"Meanwhile, reports of the falling yen against the dollar led to greater cost pressures, as input price inflation was the strongest in three months. That said, the rate of inflation remained weak in the context of historical data.\" \nRelated Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T10:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T09:58:55.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
