There are already trees growing there,\" he noted. \nThe siltation, which is said to have first been noticed in 2005, has already rendered 14 square kilometres of the minable lake's surface inoperable. \n\"Siltation has been affecting the formation of trona, which naturally regenerates with volcanic activities over a period of about five years to be mined as soda ash now the section we can mine has slowly been shrinking as a result of deposited soils settling and mixing with the trona as it forms,\" said the firm's geologist, George Otiende, during a visit of the lake on Monday. \nAccording to him the soils, are being deposited at the rate of 8000 tonnes per hour during flash floods. \nHe said the soils were emanating from Suswa and Nairagie Enkare in Narok County, about 100 kilometres away. \nDust blows in a whirlwind on a portion of Lake Magadi that has been undergoing siltation over time.
