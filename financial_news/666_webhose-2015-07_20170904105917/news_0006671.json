Cognizant to this, the government of Ethiopia has been striving to replace the traditional rule driven and highly bureaucratic public administration by effective and responsive civil service that is capable of facilitating and implementing developmental programmes. \nFurther, the government has embarked on civil service reform programme which is comprehensive, indigenous and sensitive for global realities, by providing various capacity building programmes to boost the capacity of the civil service and improve execution capacity and good governance. \nSo far, various tools are being introduced to make the necessary adjustments to the way in which civil services are organized and operated, in order to respond, on a sustainable basis, to changing needs and the demands of the public at large. These adjustments is expected to lead to better service delivery. \nIn the early 1990s, the government launched Structural Adjustment programme consisting Civil Service Reform Programme (CSRP) as one of the components. \nThe phased reform measures have been taken by the government, and the first phase of the reform (1991-1996) focused on the restructure of government institutions and retrenchment programme. The second phase of CSRP was launched in 1996. The five sub-programmes pronged programme includes: the top management system, expenditure management and control, the Human Resource management, Service Delivery and Ethics. The sub programmes were further split into a number of projects. \nThere were six projects under the umbrella of Service Delivery Sub-Programme: development of service delivery policy, grievance handling directives, award system in the civil service, methods integration of related public service, and preparation of technical directives for improving civil service delivery and service delivery standard directives. However, the implementation status of the aforementioned sub-programmes, as evaluated in 2001 (in the Capacity Building Strategy paper) by the government, was below the expectation. The outcome is attributed to many factors like too much focus on technical aspects, rather than changing attitude of the workforce, impulsive start of implementation, and lack of committed political leadership. \nFollowing the consolidation of power, the Government also acknowledged the deep institutional constraints on basic functions such as policy-making, service delivery, and regulation. Core public management systems at the federal and regional levels were hampered by outdated civil service legislation and working systems; the absence of a medium-term planning and budgeting framework; ineffective financial and personnel management controls; inadequate civil service wages and inappropriate grading systems; poor capacity for strategic and cabinet-level decision-making; and insufficient focus on modern managerial approaches to service delivery. \nIn 1994, a task force was commissioned to conduct a diagnostic overview. The primary phase of diagnosis and taking stock of the problems facing the civil service ended in February, 1996, with the identification of weaknesses in the ways the civil service managed its financial and human resources, delivered services to the public, strategic priorities and performances and monitoring and evaluation of top management. \nFollowing the identification of problems, efforts were made to reform the system by providing, among other things, training to civil servants at federal and regional levels. \nIn recognition of these constraints, the Government embarked on a comprehensive Civil Service Reform Programme (CSRP) in 1996, marking the second reform phase. Indicative of Ethiopia's \"first generation\" capacity building efforts, the CSRP sought to build a fair, transparent, efficient, effective, and ethical civil service primarily by creating enabling legislation, developing operating systems, and training staff in five key areas: (i) Expenditure Control and Management, (ii) Human Resource Management, (iii) Service Delivery, (iv) Top Management Systems, and (v) Ethics. \nSuccessful efforts (for example, budgeting, planning, and accounting reforms) at the federal level were intended to provide prototypes for regional authorities. Among other things, the development of new legislation (for example, a financial management proclamation, a civil service law, a code of ethics, complaints-handling procedures, and a service delivery policy) as well as operating systems for budgeting, procurement, and some aspects of personnel management such as salary surveys and records management. \nHowever, due to various problems including lack of capacity, only limited successes were made in bringing about improvements in performance and service delivery, effective policy formulation, programme and project execution as well as in tackling other problems of the civil service in general. The problems are much more serious in regions such as Afar, Benshangul-Gumuz, Gambela and Somalia, where civil service performance and public service delivery are at a rudimentary stage. The problem is aggravated by weak civil service structures and human and institutional capacities. \nThe most recent reform phase began in September 2001, with the launch of the Public Sector Capacity Building Support Programme (PSCAP), which also revived the CSRP. The Government has moved quickly to prepare the CSRP for its \"full implementation\" across all regions and levels of government. Pilot studies and special programmes on performance and service delivery improvements in selected Ministries, Agencies, and Bureaus have been initiated. These include; the establishment of focal points responsible for reform implementation across tiers of government; a series of workshops undertaken to sensitize the political leadership and civil servants across the country; and the launch of a \"special programme\" of Performance and Service Delivery Improvement Policy (PSIP) in priority Ministries, Agencies, and Bureaus designed to deepen the implementation of performance management. PSIP, along with other reform programme areas, have promoted Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) as a key management initiative, particularly in those ministries that interface directly with the private sector. \nCivil service reform also goes hand in hand with decentralization in the delivery of public services upon which the Government has embarked on since 2003. In this context, reform of the civil service is the process of modifying rules and incentives to obtain a more efficient and dedicated civil service in a newly decentralized environment. \nIt should be known that the civil service reform sub-programme (CSRP) is an integral part of a broader programme of multi-faceted reforms intended to build and strengthen public sector capacity for the attainment of the Government's socio-economic development goals and objectives. The overall objective of the CSRP is to enhance the capacity of the civil service so that it will be effective, efficient, transparent, accountable, ethical, performance oriented, and that it promotes good governance, provides client-oriented service delivery and is supportive of the Government's social and economic development policies and private sector development; with the Ethiopian public being the most important beneficiary of the programme. \nImplementation of the CSRP is now in full gear in the context of the country's National Capacity Building Programme whose aim is to develop human and institutional capacity at all levels of government and in all sectors of the economy. Positive results have been attained and the Government is encouraged to intensify implementation of the CSRP for attaining the objectives of sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Its critical importance in this respect has been echoed widely in several policy papers, including the SDPRP. \nIndeed, there is a strong commitment in the Ethiopian Civil Service sector to provide high quality and efficient service to customers. Most importantly, civil servants shoulder greater responsibilities. With no doubt, the effective implementation of government policies and strategies is highly dependent on the courage and passion of the civil servants. Service delivery that is customer centred and fee of corrupt practices would be hallmark to high socio-economic development and a route to the Ethiopian Civil Service take-off to new height.
