Bond yields rose a touch but not at an alarming rate.\" \nMr Kunnen said the Fed's language suggested tightening would occur later this year. \n\"The Fed is just setting the ground for a very modest rate hike in September or December and the markets are getting ready for that,\" he said. \nAt 0830 AEST on Thursday, the September 2015 10-year bond futures contract was trading at 97.150 (implying a yield of 2.850 per cent), down from 97.170 (2.830 per cent) on Wednesday. \nThe September 2015 three-year bond futures contract was at 98.060 (1.940 per cent), down from 98.100 (1.900 per cent). \nKEY MOVEMENTS: \n* CGS 5.5pct Jan 2018, 1.861%, unchanged from Wednesday \n* CGS 4.25pct April 2026, 2.877%, unchanged \nSydney Futures Exchange prices: \n* September 2015 bill futures, 97.910, from 97.920 \n* December 2015 bill futures, 97.960, from 97.980 \n(*Closes taken at 1630 AEST previous local session) \nSource: IRESS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T01:52:25.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
