It has accepted about 41 percent of them. \nHowever, it has limited removals to its European websites, such as Google.de in Germany or Google.fr in France, arguing that over 95 percent of searches made from Europe are done through local versions of Google. \nIn a blog post on Thursday, the U.S. company said it believed no one country should have the authority to control what content someone in a second country can access. \n\"We've worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten ruling thoughtfully and comprehensively in Europe, and we’ll continue to do so,\" wrote Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel. \"But as a matter of principle, therefore, we respectfully disagree with the CNIL’s assertion of global authority on this issue and we have asked the CNIL to withdraw its formal notice.\" \nThe CNIL said it would look into Google's appeal and decide whether to accept it in two months. \nIn case of a rejection Google may face fines, albeit small compared with the company's turnover. \n\"We have taken note of Google's arguments which are mostly of a political nature. The CNIL, on the other hand, has relied on a strictly legal reasoning,\" said a spokeswoman. \nGoogle warned that applying the right to be forgotten globally would trigger a \"race to the bottom\" where \"the Internet would only be as free as the world's least free place\". \nIts stance was upheld in February by a group of experts appointed by the company to guide it on how to apply the landmark ruling. \n\"Global de-listing remains too controversial without an international agreement,\" said Luciano Floridi, a professor at Oxford University who was on the panel advising Google. \nHowever, European regulators and some legal experts think Google ought to apply the ruling globally as it is too easy to circumvent it by switching from one version of Google to another. \n(Editing by David Holmes and Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T10:17:27.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
