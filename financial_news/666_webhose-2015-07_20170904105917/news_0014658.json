He also hit out at Eurogroup leaders who had warned Sunday's referendum could effectively be a vote on whether Greece stays in the eurozone . He said, \"'No' does not mean rupture with Europe but a return to a Europe with values.\" \nCurrently, the fate of Greece in the eurozone hangs in the balance. As my colleague Mike Bird remarked, contradictory polls are showing that any result is possible in Greece's upcoming referendum. However, what the Greeks would be voting Voting \"No\" would mean Greece rejects proposals from its creditors, which would include austerity and reforms. It would also likely lead to Greece leaving the Euro. A \"Yes\" vote would mean the nation accepted the bailout conditions. \nHowever, whichever way Greece votes, the proposals from European authorities and the International Monetary Fund expired when Greece defaulted on its payments on the June 30 deadline. \n\nMy colleague Mike Bird, who is in Athens at the moment, spoke to Greek politician Harry Theoharis and he said that Grexit will \"100%\" happen if \"No\" wins on Sunday. \nUntil 2014 he was in charge of tax collection in Greece , and trying to reform the country's revenue-raising system. Now, he's a politician, and has represented the centrist To Potami party since the January 2015 election.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T09:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T09:49:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
