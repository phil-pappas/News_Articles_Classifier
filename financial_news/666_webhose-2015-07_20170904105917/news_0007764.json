An elevator bank was shut down so she could ride up alone, and then she was styled in a private area of the salon. Other customers didn’t get a glimpse. Hillary was later seen with a new feathered hairdo.”\nClinton regularly sees salon owner John Barrett, who charges regular mortals $600 for a cut and blow-dry. Hair color can cost an extra $600.\nIt is not known how much, or if, Clinton paid for the haircut, and her reps didn’t respond to requests for comment. But Clinton’s attachment to her hairstylists is well documented.\nThe “Santa” recently referenced in her emails is Santa Nikkels, the proprietor of Santa’s Salon in Chappaqua.\nAnd let’s not forget that her husband, Bill Clinton, was famously caught up in a 1993 controversy known as “Hairgate” when he got a $200 haircut on Air Force One as it was idling for an hour at LAX, shutting down two runways and diverting numerous flights.\nThis report first appeared on NYPost.com\nMore from MarketWatch: 10 things your hair salon won’t tell you Dentists, vets, and bikini waxers now make house calls 5 times it’s more expensive to be a woman", "external_links": ["http://pagesix.com/2015/07/28/hillary-clintons-600-haircut-puts-bergdorf-on-lockdown/?_ga=1.131841551.1099858918.1434370124"], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T23:05:00.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
