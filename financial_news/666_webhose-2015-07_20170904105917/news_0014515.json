A 2013 World Economic Forum paper concluded that improving developing countries' supply chains could lift global GDP (gross domestic product) by five per cent. And such growth will benefit women within these economies as well as men. \nSecond, focusing on women-owned suppliers rewards women as asset-owners, rather than simply as employees. This is critical because women's lack of assets is a key source of global gender inequality: women currently produce 50 per cent of food and contribute 66 per cent of labour but own only one to two per cent of property. \nA growing wave of research on inequality - including French economist Thomas Piketty's 2013 book Capital in the twenty-first century - has concluded that inequality of asset ownership, or wealth inequality, is as important to overall economic inequality as income inequality. [2] So in addition to campaigns centred on income inequality - a traditional focus for gender equality activists - structuring campaigns around asset ownership could bring new benefits for women. \nThird, supplier diversity can drive corporate profits, increasing the size of the economic pie in addition to expanding women's share of it. \nThe telecoms business AT&T, which spends US$2 billion on women-owned suppliers a year, says these suppliers are directly responsible for US$26 billion of its annual revenue . And a McKinsey survey of executives found a third attributed profit growth to supplier diversity in emerging markets, not least because women-owned suppliers can help firms make the products female consumers want. \nWorking with women-owned suppliers is not without challenges . [3] Women-owned companies can face barriers to accessing the finance to expand businesses, may lack the formal accounting expertise to comply with multinationals' auditing systems and might lack a marketing presence, making them hard to find. \nThis calls for companies committed to supply diversity to invest in developing women-owned supply chains - through training for example - in addition to purchasing from them. For example, the energy giant Exxon-Mobil's philanthropic foundation has trained Nigerian women who want to join global supply chains , and Exxon-Mobil has launched official procurement contracts with two companies that took part. \nSo while the 1,000 signatories to the Women's empowerment principles is a milestone, there's still a long way to go. Perhaps the seventh principle on transparency, which requires signatories to measure and report publicly on their gender equality progress, could provide a valuable blueprint of best practices for other firms to follow. \nMaha Rafi Atal is a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, where she is researching the political effects of multinational firms acting as public service providers in the developing world.
