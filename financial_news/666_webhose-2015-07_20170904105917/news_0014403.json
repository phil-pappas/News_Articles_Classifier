Markit’s closely watched purchasing managers’ index fell to 51.4 in June, its weakest reading since April 2013 and down from 51.9 registered in May. Economists at Reuters had expected it to hit 52.5. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion. The slump in manufacturing output is now likely to place the onus for economic growth on the sevice sector – the traditional powerhouse of the British economy. • Stronger construction sector boosts UK economy • The EU's dwindling importance to UK trade in three charts “With manufacturing still in a growth funk, the UK economy will be even more reliant on other sectors, such as services, to deliver solid growth,” said Rob Dobson, a senior economist at Markit. “It is also disappointing that, for a nation now steeped in rebalancing rhetoric, it seems as if domestic consumer-driven expansions remain the norm.” The figures also “suggested that the industrial side of the economy is playing no role in the economic recovery at the moment” said Vicky Redwood, chief economist at Capital Economics. Ms Redwood said average output over the last three months will show manufacturing is likely to contract in the second quarter of the year. Growth was only a meagre 0.1pc in the first three months of the year. “Looking ahead, the outlook for exports is unlikely to improve soon, given the rise in the pound and uncertainty in Europe,” Ms Redwood said. \"But at least domestic demand for manufactured goods should be supported by rising real wages and increasing business investment.\" • BoE raises concerns about impact of Greek crisis on the UK Despite the green shoots of recovery being felt in the eurozone, the Greek crisis has contributed to weaker export demand and a stronger pound, said Howard Archer of IHS Global He said: “Sterling’s strength against the euro is seemingly constraining UK manufacturers’ ability to capitalize on recently improved domestic demand in the eurozone.\" In better news, the survey of manufacturers revealed employers in the sector took on staff at the fastest rate in three months during June, adding Britain’s bumper rate of job creation. Manufacturing data from Europe showed Greece continued to be the bloc's laggard with the country's factories suffering their worst quarter in two years. Greece’s PMI reading dropped to 46.9 in June from 48 in May – its 10th month of contraction. The beleaguered economy, which became the first developed nation to default to the International Monetary Fund this week, fell back into recession at the start of the year. Across the eurozone as a whole, manufacturers registered a growth in output to 52.5 in June from 52.2 in May. “In an otherwise broad-based upturn, Greece remained the outlier,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.
