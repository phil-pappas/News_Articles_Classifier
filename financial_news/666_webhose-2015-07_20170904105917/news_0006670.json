There are various timing components associated with the LE and CD, which requires the Creditor to work with multiple parties, including Title Closers, Closing Attorneys and Real Estate Agents to obtain the information they don’t normally have access to in order to maintain their compliance with the TRID requirements as the Consumer(s) must receive the CD 3 business days before closing.\nThe Cognops Plan B Portal operates independently from other loan origination software systems, the user types directly into screens that look just like the LE and CD or they can import their loan data directly from their loan origination system via MISMO XML file version 2.6 or later. Exports the amended MISMO XML file back to the loan origination system.\nThe Cognops Plan B Portal collaborates electronically with settlement agents for their required data inputs for the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure via simple email invitation. Settlement agent does not need any extra software. Settlement agent offered inputs can then be compared-accepted-rejected by the lender throughout the closing process with the decision(s) sent back electronically to the settlement agent.\n1. Invite settlement agent to a mutual, intuitive workspace.\n2. No initial setup required by the invitee.\n3. Settlement agent can upload data and files from their system.\n4. The creditor is in control and accepts or rejects changes.\n5. Settlement agent notified when creditor accepts or rejects changes.\n6. The workspace remains open until creditor closes it.\n7. Creditor can submit or enter data to its LOS system to generate CD.\n8. Log showing all changes for all related parties to the transaction, including Creditor, Closing Agent and Real Estate Agents.\n9. No long term contracts.\nThe Plan B Portal delivers the integrated disclosures electronically in full compliance with all applicable E-SIGN Act requirements. The normal email delivery of the disclosures without borrower prior consent is not compliant. This e-delivery method can shorten the disclosure delivery periods by 3 business days.
