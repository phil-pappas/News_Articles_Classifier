The national MNP service facilitates customers to carry their existing mobile number from one telecom circle to another across India and choose the operator of their choice. The service provider said it is applicable to all pre-paid and post-paid customers. \"MNP service allows the customers to carry their existing number across India and also choose the operator of their choice. Vodafone has benefited from the intra-circle MNP that was rolled out in 2011 and we look forward to a similar response this time,\" Vivek Mathur, chief commercial officer, Vodafone India said. Vodafone India has a pan-India base of over 184 million customers serviced through a network of over 130,000 sites, of which over 35,000 are 3G sites.
