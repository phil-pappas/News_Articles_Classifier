Chairman John McFarlane, 68, who took over as acting CEO, said the bank has become “cumbersome and bureaucratic” under Jenkins’s leadership.\nWill Bowen, a spokesman at Barclays in London, declined to comment on the departure. Officials at WorldPay didn’t immediately respond to calls seeking comment. Sky News reported the departure earlier, saying Rake will replace John Allan as chairman of WorldPay in September.\nBarclays Shares At Barclays, McFarlane told staff last week that he aims to double the share price over the next three years, or four years at most, according to people familiar. The lender may only appoint a new CEO early next year, the people said.\nWorldPay, which is owned by Advent International Corp. and Bain Capital, is preparing a 6 billion-pound ($9.4 billion) IPO, according to Sky News. The owners may also decide to sell the payment processing group to other private-equity firms or a bank instead of selling shares, according to the reports.\nRake, who is also chairman of BT Group Plc, joined Barclays in 2008 after a 30 year career at KPMG, according to the bank’s website. He was named senior independent director in 2011 and deputy chairman a year later. He is also president of the Confederation of British Industry.\nThe shares were little changed at 276.30 pence at 9:54 a.m. in London. They increased every day since Jenkins was ousted a week ago, bringing gains to about 13 percent this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T12:21:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
