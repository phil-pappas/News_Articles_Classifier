Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle Ladies and gentlemen, comrades: introducing Bill Shorten.\nIn case you the voters, nay, you the Labor Party delegates, don't actually know who he is, the ALP introduced its federal leader at its national conference on Friday with the usual build up of introductory speakers and video packaging showing Bill, friend of the worker, family man, etc, etc.\nYes, this happens at every modern political rally. But there is a particular problem with Bill Shorten. Voters either have no idea who he is or what he stands for, or don't believe he stands for anything at all. Cartoonists have long played with his soft impact on voters' views, with First Dog on the Moon making a specialty of never quite landing his name.\nAlternatively, voters have formed a very negative view based on his role as a key figure in the toppling of two Labor prime ministers, and fuelled in recent weeks by the royal commission into trade unions. Commissioner Dyson Heydon observed that he might be seen as an \"evasive\" witness.\nJulia Gillard famously and disastrously declared in the 2010 election campaign that voters would see \"the real Julia\", and told the 2011 ALP Conference that \"we are us\". But at least voters had had a chance to form some view of her when she was the party's deputy leader.\nFor better or worse, voters thought they had a handle on Kevin – and Mark and Kim and Simon. But not Bill.\nThat's why there is double angst involved in this weekend's national conference for Australia's oldest political party.\nUnder real threat on the left from the Greens, and having had more than a generation of its rising parliamentary talent wiped out by the debacle between 2010 and 2013, it is meeting in Melbourne trying to find its soul, as well as its leader in the rubble of the last decade.\n Friend of the worker Just as Gillard always seemed most comfortable talking about education, Shorten seems most comfortable in his persona as the friend of the worker in trying to explain what drives him and his political beliefs.\nHis role as the face of the Beaconsfield mine disaster featured a lot in the conference videos, in the photos and in the rhetoric.\n\"I will never forget when I heard they had found Larry Knight's body,\" Shorten said in his opening address. \"How the experts wanted to halt the search so the coroner could have a protected site. And how I heard the hard-rock miners say, with steel in their voice: 'This isn't a recovery – this is a rescue. Until we know different, there are men down there who are still alive.'\"\nThat is, of course, what Labor wants to believe about its own fortunes: that it is a real prospect to do the unthinkable and wipe Tony Abbott and his government out of office after just one term.\nIt clings for comfort to the knowledge of its poll lead on a two-party preferred basis, even as it slinks out of sight behind the Coalition on national security issues.\nYet it went into this conference with the leaden weight of Shorten's collapsing standing with voters making the prospect of pulling off a victory after just one parliamentary term seem fanciful, whatever the Prime Minister's own strained relationship with voters.\nJust as there were repeated mentions of Beaconsfield for Shorten, the party faithful were repeatedly reminded that Queensland and Victoria showed that the impossible could happen.\nBut what do the power plays and the contentious issues on the agenda at the conference actually tell us about the party that would form government if it actually was successful at the next election?\nIt is hard to escape the conclusion that the issues that will frame this conference in history deal with the past more than the future, and are more focused on electoral prospects than party philosophy.\nTough on boats The question of what happens to the party's asylum-seeker policy is the most conspicuous example of this.\nRisking the ire of the Left, the message Shorten wants to get out there via all the talk about boat turnbacks is that Labor is also tough on asylum seekers. The Opposition Leader tried to make a virtue of being frank about the fact Labor's policy in government had not worked, a frankness that showed how he wants to give Shorten-led Labor some space to differentiate itself from Rudd and Gillard Labor on this issue.\nAs immigration spokesman Richard Marles told a rowdy forum at the conference on Friday, if Labor doesn't shift policy, it would be consumed by it. More asylum seekers will die, he said, and Labor would be \"condemned by history\".\nLabor can only try to reframe the debate if it makes it difficult for the Coalition to continue to remind voters of the Labor record on boat arrivals.\nNot that it is likely to work. The Coalition's bloody political response to Labor's capitulation on boat turnbacks was not to welcome the change but to continue with the attack, questioning whether the Opposition was really serious.\nBut having dealt with the totemistic issue of boat turnbacks, Labor is hoping it has given itself room for some product differentiation on issues that do cause disquiet, not just in its own base and parts of the broader community but also those voters that it risks losing to the Greens on this issue.\nThese are the uncomfortable questions about the growing secrecy of our border operations, the creeping militarisation of security with the new Border Force, and the unresolved but largely undiscussed issues of a regional solution to refugees. Just what is happening to asylum seekers now stranded on Manus Island with little prospect of resettlement in Papua New Guinea, and to the whole unreality of the \"Cambodian\" solution?\nAfter all, Labor is attempting to align itself with the Coalition's policy on boat turnbacks despite no one knowing how the policy is being conducted.\nSimilarly, Shorten's tactics on climate change are trying to make a virtue of comparison with past debacles. Let's face it, the international climate change debate has moved beyond the 2010 divide of having an emissions trading system or not having an emissions trading system.\nThe United States and China have moved to regulatory models. The surge in the global renewable energy industry, the speed of its technological innovation and its collapsing prices have also changed the discussion.\nBut having lost two leaders and so much moral authority by dumping an ETS, Shorten's Labor feels it has little choice but to try to make a virtue of sticking with one. At a retail electoral level, it knows it will take a thrashing on this from the government charging that it has revived a carbon price. The policy reality, however, is likely to be a much less ambitious, much more industry-specific scheme than the behemoth that was proposed six years ago. The politics, it is hoped, are that the leader who is not seen to stand for anything, and who has been prepared to assassinate two leaders, will be seen to stand for a core Labor belief.\nNo fundamental shift Shorten in reality didn't have much choice in confronting these issues at this conference. And despite the howls of outrage in recent days, the likelihood of a change in policy on boat turnbacks and on renewable energy have been telegraphed for months.\nThe underlying message of both the asylum seeker and climate change issues, therefore, is that neither represent an indication of any fundamental shift to the Right or the Left by the Labor Party, despite all the talk about changing factional numbers on the floor of the conference.\nThis is a party struggling to dig itself out of a hole any way it can, while trying to keep some modicum of philosophical respectability.\nThere have been some wins for the Left: a \"Buffett tax\" to ensure high-income earners pay a minimum of 35 per cent tax and some wins for the unions: a pledge to review the China free trade agreement's labour provisions.\nShorten asserted, without great conviction, that Labor \"understands fiscal responsibility\".\n\"We are prepared to make hard choices and back fair savings,\" he said, though without really outlining anything to back an assertion that most voters do not share, while asserting federal Labor would not raise the GST.\nThe one place Bill Shorten did not go on Friday was national security, a concession to the grip the Coalition holds on this issue.\nShorten's credibility within the party he leads will ultimately depend on how he performs in the detailed debates on asylum-seeker policy, climate change and party rule changes over the weekend.\nHe has nothing to lose and a considerable amount to gain. Labor will be looking for some reassurance that all the brave talk about returning from the wilderness of opposition after just one term is not just a wild fantasy.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/latingle", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/labor_meeting_hype/index.html", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-24T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T05:08:43.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
