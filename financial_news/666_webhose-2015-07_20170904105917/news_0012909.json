I. du Pont ( DD - Get Report ) . \nTake a look at the chart. INTC Year to Date Price Returns data by YCharts \nNot only are all three companies trading at or near their 52-week lows, their respective stock valuations (price to earnings) are cheap compared to their industry peers and when paired with the S&P 500 ( SPX ) index, which is valued at a P/E of 21. \nWhen combined, their respective analyst 12-month price targets suggest gains of more than 16%. Also, all three companies pay annual dividend yields that are higher than the market standard rate of 2%. If that's not value, I don't know what is. Let's take a look at the merits of each one, staring with Intel. \nMust Read: 10 Stocks Billionaire John Paulson Loves \nWith shares at $30.56, down almost 16% in 2015, Intel has seen better days. The struggles of the world's largest semiconductor company can be tied to its dependency on slumping personal computer sales. But at just 13 times earnings, it's tough to ignore how cheap INTC has become, especially when Intel is becoming less dependent on PCs.Revenue from its PC-related business still accounts for 50% of its annual sales. But that's down 30 percentage points from where the company was only three years ago. Intel, which just picked off chip rival Altera ( ALTR ) , has made the Internet-of-Things (IoT) its primary focus. Altera's strong IoT capabilities augments Intel's deal last year for Basis Science, a company that specializes in wearable devices for health and wellness applications. \nSo while gloomy prospect of PCs may be a reason to shy away, Intel is clearing pathways for better days in the future. This explains why the stock still has a consensus buy rating and an average analyst 12-month price target of $36, suggesting 17% gains from current levels of around $30. Combined with its 24-cent quarterly dividend, yielding 3.13% annually, that's excellent value. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T04:13:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
