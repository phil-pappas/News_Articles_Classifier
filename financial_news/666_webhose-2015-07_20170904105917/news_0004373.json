Reuters Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett Tony Abbott and his Canadian counterpart Stephen Harper form a mutual admiration society. They are two conservative leaders who share remarkably similar personal and political instincts.\nWhether it's their views on climate change, their stern rhetoric on the evils of terrorism, their belief in smaller government, their claim to sensible economic management or their distrust of many popular causes, the political lines of both leaders could be interchangeable.\nNeither leader is personally popular with voters. They are regarded as too ideological and not particularly appealing personalities. Their combative manner attracts a particularly vitriolic assessment of their characters from their many political critics.\nHarper is even more suspicious of left-wing media bias than Abbott. He no longer holds regular prime ministerial press conferences, for example, preferring to largely ignore the media in general with a few select exceptions. Unlike Abbott, he has got away with this approach relatively successfully, confident in his ability to consistently control messaging.\nBut one big difference between the two men is that Harper will be attempting his fourth term as Prime Minister when he goes to the polls this October, having first been elected as head of a minority government in 2006. He's come a long way from when he visited John Howard in 2005 as then Canadian opposition leader interested in political tips from an Australian prime minister he deeply admired.\nAnd that means Abbott will be watching the Canadian campaign and the election results with even greater interest. Australia's federal election campaign will feature eerily similar themes and claims from both governments on national and economic security. It's also another reason why Liberal party federal director Brian Loughnane has just been in Canada talking to the Conservative Party.\nRe-election uncertain Not that Harper's re-election is assured. The Canadian economy, dragged down by the plunge in the price of oil, is showing even more wear and tear than Australia's. National growth went slightly backwards in the first quarter of the year thanks to the slump in key resource states that formerly powered the economy.But Canada's dominant export market remains its neighbour, the United States, and it has a diversified manufacturing and service economy benefiting from the fall in the Canadian dollar. So just like NSW, some other large states like Ontario and Quebec are doing relatively well.\n In contrast with the Australian conservative experience, Harper does have the advantage of having delivered on much of what he promised in terms of cutting spending and taxes while getting the budget deficit back under control. Promising a balanced budget this year for the first time in seven years earns him grudging respect if not an improvement in his personal ratings\nThe achievement is despite slashed revenue due to oil, big deficit spending during the global financial crisis, a reduction in corporate taxes to 15 per cent and personal income taxes to a maximum of 29 per cent. Although the provincial governments add their own taxes of around 10 per cent to 12 per cent, Canada likes to boast its overall business tax costs are now 46 per cent lower than the US.\nIn part, success in reducing spending is due to a Senate with more limited powers to reject bills and where the Prime Minister appoints senators. But the need to balance the budget has also become part of the Canadian national psyche, shared by the parties of the left. This sense of budget conviction developed after the economic malaise that accompanied long decades of deficits in the 1980s and 1990s. It's now part of standard operating procedure and principle.\nHarper concentrated more on freezing spending and avoiding most new commitments rather than the more dramatic option of announcing the abolition or radical cuts in big spending programs. The Abbott government too is adopting a much more subdued approach to spending cuts after the spectacular implosion of its first budget. It's now relying more on unlikely and optimistic assumptions on growth as the future saviour.\nBut the Australian states' heavy reliance on Commonwealth funding, given their own inability to raise income taxes, means blame for cuts inevitably reverberate more in Canberra than it does in Ottawa. Witness the argument from the states over a $80 billion boost to health and education funding from 2018. That's even though Labor, who promised the extra funds, never explained where the additional money would come from.\nHarper's opposition Harper actually has two parties of the left to beat. One is the more centrist Liberals led by Justin Trudeau, son of Pierre, probably Canada's most famous prime minister. He initially looked to have a similar political flair but has faded and Conservative Party ads declare him \"just not ready\", to some effect. A much more left-wing New Democratic Party is now the main opposition party, opposed to much of the Harper government's foreign policy and anti-terrorist legislation. The response to that from Harper is as equally predictable as Abbott's would be if Labor gave him the opening.\nHarper's other survival weapon is the first past the post voting system. With the left of centre parties splitting that vote, it increases Harper's chances of winning a majority. But no one is willing to predict an outcome after the NDP provincial party stunned all Canada by winning government in resource rich Alberta, a conservative stronghold and Harper's home base.\nThe upcoming poll is another reason why Canada is causing Australia grief in the TPP negotiations â€“ rejecting changes to the strong protectionism of its dairy industry. At the very least, the Harper government wants to delay any commitment on this until after the October 19 election, despite the risks of postponing any agreement. That would make Andrew Robb much less a fan of Stephen Harper than Tony Abbott is.\nJennifer Hewett was in Canada to attend the Australia Canada Economic Leadership Forum.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-07-14T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:04:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
