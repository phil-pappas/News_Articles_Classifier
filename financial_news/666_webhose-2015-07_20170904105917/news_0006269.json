Trimming reception costs is one of the best ways for a couple to save money, while still finding a number of ways to ensure a well-put-together event. Here's a few ideas: \nCut down on guests . This is one of the best ways to avoid breaking the bank; caterers and banquet halls usually charge per-person-can you limit the guest list to 20 of your nearest and dearest? You don't have to invite everybody you meet or just know casually. \nInstead of band, hire a DJ -Music is another way to effectively cut down costs. DJs are far less expensive that live bands; but if you're insistent on using a live band, try to find a local area band that will offer a hometown discount. \nA buffet-style meal will be cheaper than a traditional sit-down (which are always more expensive). And besides, a buffet usually offers more menu options, which benefits larger receptions with guests of various tastes. \nAvoid reception halls, if possible -Hosting the reception at a private residence (or your place) is another great way to save a lot of money. This works particularly well if you're having just a few guests for a small-scale wedding. \nConsidering a package deal ? These are usually all-inclusive, typically including: the wedding cost, reception cost and possibly even the honeymoon (most common for destination weddings, but careful searching may be able to uncover a hometown package deal). \nHidden Wedding Expenses \nDid you know that taxes can add up quickly when paying for a wedding? Depending on where you live, state and local taxes can exceed 9 percent in the U.S. Before signing any vendor deals, try to get the price, plus the sales tax written into the contract; failing to do so may leave you unpleasantly surprised! \nOvertime fees for reception hall staff and additional vendors are usually written into contracts, but sometimes unplanned or unexpected things can happen, such as heavy traffic or other delays. Try to set aside some extra money for overtime, so that your wallet or credit card isn't unpleasantly surprised! \nGratuities or \" tips \" can also be a hefty expense (some reception halls have staff gratuities written into their estimates, which still can be as high as 25 percent). But even if gratuities are already accounted for, there's still tips for additional vendors on the wedding day to be factored into the expenses (for example, the florist, photographer, the band or DJ, makeup artist and hairstylist, among others). \nSources: \"Easy ways to trim costs on your wedding reception\"-2013 Bridal Planner-The Vindicator and \"hidden expenses that can sink your wedding budget\" by Metro Creative Services-2015 Bridal Planner-The Vindicator", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T23:54:11.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
