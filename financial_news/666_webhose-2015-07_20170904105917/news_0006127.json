If you take housing, rent is really causing the high rise in inflation. For rent alone we are seeing an inflation rate of 66.6 percent as compared to last year which was around 15.5 percent,' Dr. Nyarko said. \nAccording to her, tenants in most cities would pay more for rent than they did last year because of the drastic increase in inflation. \nTenants at Abeka Lapaz and Adentan now pay GH¢180 for single room self-contained which used to be GH¢150. \nWhile those occupying two-bedroom self contained are now paying GH¢250 compared to GH¢200 last year. \nTenants at Spintex Road are paying between GH¢250 and GH¢350 for single room self-contained depending on the type of building. \nThe situation at Dansoman is slightly different, with tenants paying between GH¢500 and GH¢600 for the two bedroom house and GH¢180 for single room self-contained. \nBy Nii Ogbamey Tetteh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T12:33:07.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
