Photo: Louie Douvis\nThe Australian dollar pushed back above US73¢ on Tuesday as traders took heart from a rebound in China's sharemarkets and firmer iron ore prices.\nIn late local trade, the Aussie was fetching US73.18¢, compared with US72.99¢ at the same time on Monday.\nHowever, the local unit had earlier brushed a new six-year intraday low of US72.57¢, just before China's sharemarkets opened for the first time since Monday's 8.5 per cent plunge in the main Shanghai Composite index.\nTuesday's pre-session dip was mirrored in Australia's ASX200 index, but equities and the currency recovered as trading in Shanghai opened.\nAfter an initial 5 per cent slide, government measures helped drive the Shanghai Composite back up , taking with it Australian shares and the currency.\nCurrency trader cues also came from the price of iron ore, Australia's biggest export, which was marked up on Monday night almost 2 per cent, after a week of declines.\nDespite Tuesday's recovery, concerns about China and its demand for Australian resources continue to weigh on the Aussie, which has lost ground against most major currencies in recent weeks.\nThis includes against the euro, which has recuperated since the resolution of Greece's debt negotiations. Late on Tuesday it was buying $1.51, compared with about $1.46 12 days ago.\nThe euro was also buying just under $US1.11, up from $US1.08 a week ago.\nBK Asset Management managing director of foreign exchange strategy Kathy Lien attributes the common currency's rise to a combination of improved economic data in the euro zone, the return of previously risk-averse funds, progress on Greece's long-term survival and shifts in expectations about how soon and how quickly the US Federal Reserve will lift interest rates.\nHowever, she questions the rally's durability.\n\"The euro against the greenback is still in a long-term down trend, but sentiment is shifting as investors find new reasons to buy euros,\" she wrote on Tuesday.\n\"Whether the rally lasts remains to be seen, but knowing how challenging the Greek debt negotiations will be going forward, we view the rally with caution and believe that it should lose momentum on the $US1.12 handle.\nThe Aussie has also weakened against the Japanese yen, which has become a safe-haven investment during recent market tumult. The local unit on Monday was buying just under ¥90, among its lowest levels this year.\n\"The inability of [this trade] to bounce in recent weeks is telling, and underscores the fact that the Australian dollar is looking increasingly vulnerable to deterioration in sentiment,\" says Australia and New Zealand Banking group currency strategist Daniel Been in a note on Tuesday.\n\"We think that the Australian dollar-Japanese yen trade is becoming an increasingly important driver of the Aussie, as Japanese real money and insurance accounts remain one of the largest remaining long positions in the market – and we believe this positioning could come under some pressure in the near term,\" Mr Been said.\nCommodity prices, too, had become increasingly important to the Aussie's level, he said.\n\"As the Australian dollar approaches fair value, it can be the case that the sensitivity of the Aussie to fundamentals becomes heightened.\"\nMs Lien agrees.\n\"The down trend remains intact and further losses are likely given the move in commodities and the vulnerability of China's economy,\" she said.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/beijing-scrambles-to-calm-markets-as-shares-gyrate-20150728-gim8cy.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/china-stocks-fall-as-economic-rout-fears-return-20150727-gilirg.html"], "published": "2015-07-28T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T14:47:13.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
