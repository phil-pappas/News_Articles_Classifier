The Seville-based company’s 7 percent notes sold in April fell 5.4 cents to a record 82.6 cents.\nAbengoa said it was bringing bond guarantees into line because the discrepancy was allowing credit-default swaps traders to distort the cost of insuring its debt. The company is seeking to reassure investors after roiling markets last year by reclassifying some of its high-yield notes as non-recourse, making bondholders lose trust in their corporate guarantee.\n“The company announced measures to stop certain behavior it sees as anomalous,” said Ivan San Felix, a Madrid-based equity analyst at Renta 4 Banco SA. “Rather than calming investors, the market is now punishing the company. It’s more an issue with the market’s view of the company than with internal company issues.”\nDefault Swaps Credit-default swaps insuring 10 million euros of Abengoa’s debt for five years surged to 3.25 million euros upfront and 500,000 euros annually today, the highest since November, according to CMA. That’s up from 1.77 million euros in advance at the start of the month and signals a 75 percent probability of default.\nThere were 2,011 swaps contracts covering $860 million of Abengoa’s debt as of July 17, according to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. The company’s shares fell as much as 19 percent to 2 euros, the lowest since Jan. 5.\n“You can understand why Abengoa is concerned about their credit-default swap levels,” though it’s unusual for a company to try so directly to influence trading, said Robert Baltzer, an Edinburgh-based investment manager at Baillie Gifford & Co., which oversees about 115 billion pounds ($178 billion). “They need continual access to bond markets and that’s one of the factors that determines the price of funding. They need credit-default swap spreads to be lower.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T14:07:01.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
