This latest initiative, exclusively for consultants and contractors, is tailor-made to provide electricity connections of up to 150KW within 10 days.\n\nThe move supports the directives of the wise leadership of the UAE to make the UAE one of the best countries in the world. This is done by achieving the UAE Vision 2021, and Dubai Plan 2021 to make Dubai a smart and sustainable city to achieve the happiness and prosperity of citizens and residents.\n\n\"Our vision and continuous successes are inspired by the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. Our aim is to rank the UAE in first place for acquiring electricity connections. However, our ultimate goal goes beyond achieving top positions. It expands to include achieving happiness firstly for getting electricity. We aim to go beyond that to ensure the happiness and satisfaction of our consultants and contractors with our services. DEWA has achieved several successes, including the ranking of the UAE, represented by DEWA, for the second consecutive year as fourth in the world and first in the Middle East and North Africa for getting electricity, according to the Doing Business Report 2015 of the World Bank,\" said Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, MD and CEO of DEWA.\n\n\"Al Namoos affirms DEWA's strategy and vision to be a sustainable innovative world-class utility by enhancing cooperation with consultants and contractors. We undertake several initiatives to ensure continuous improvement and implement measures to facilitate and speed up access to electricity and water services in accordance with global best practices, thus boosting the level of operational excellence for all our partners and stakeholders,\" added Al Tayer.\n\nDEWA has introduced several improvements for getting electricity. These include reducing the procedures to two phases instead of three, and reducing the duration from 35 days to 10. The first phase takes only 8 days now and includes the application for electricity connection through low-voltage cable. The second phase has been shortened to two days, which involves verifying the quality and integrity of the connections and power supply through meters to be recorded on the first electricity bill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T22:57:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
