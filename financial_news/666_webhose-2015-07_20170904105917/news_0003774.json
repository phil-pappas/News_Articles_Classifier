That was in line with the $3.58 billion average of 11 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company lowered the forecast for its Alcon eye-care unit, and raised the guidance for its Sandoz generics business. \nCurrency fluctuations stripped 0.9 percentage points from the profit margin, undermining Chief Executive Officer Joe Jimenez’s efforts to increase profitability after wrapping up a $30 billion reshaping of the company. The company in March completed offloading its slow-growing animal health business and acquired GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s portfolio of cancer drugs. \nNovartis reiterated its full-year forecast for core operating income to grow by a high-single digit percentage and sales to expand at a mid-single digit rate, excluding currency fluctuations. \nShares of Novartis have gained 32 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 14 percent advance for Switzerland’s benchmark SMI Index. \nNet sales in the pharmaceutical division fell 4 percent to $7.8 billion in U.S. dollar terms, and rose 6 percent when excluding currency fluctuations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T08:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:48:25.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
