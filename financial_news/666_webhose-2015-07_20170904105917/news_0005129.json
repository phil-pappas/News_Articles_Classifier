Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell The Australian dollar rose a cent overnight after a sell-off of the recently stronger US dollar.\nTraders took profits as they grappled with a lack of fresh US economic data.\nThe Australian dollar climbed to US74.50¢ overnight, according to Bloomberg data, after the greenback experienced its first drop in five days against the euro.\nThe US dollar was driven down by a lack of fresh economic data that had traders consolidating there position in preparation for an increasingly likely US Federal Reserve interest rates hike in September.\n\"The sell-off in the US dollar today caught many traders by surprise,\" BX Asset management managing director of foreign exchange strategy Kathy Lien said in a research note.\n\"No US economic reports were released but that did not stop the greenback from losing over 1 per cent of its value versus the euro and New Zealand dollars.\"\nThe Australian dollar could experience further significant changes on Wednesday with June inflation to be released and a speech by Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stephens in the early afternoon.\n\"This corrective bounce could run to US74.90¢ today, but much will depend on the direction of any surprises from the CPI release or Stevens,\" Westpac economist Imre Speizer said.\n The Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish second-quarter consumer price index on Wednesday at 1130.\nIt is tipped to come in around 0.8 per cent according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. This is significantly higher than 2015's first quarter result of 0.2 per cent.\nAnalysts are anticipating the key inflation driver will be fuel prices, which have jumped by 14 per cent in the last quarter. Utilities and food are expected to remain steady.\nThe key movements in the Australian dollar's value are likely to be connected to fluctuating market expectations as to when the US Federal Reserve will begin to raise interest rates after eight years of effectively negative rates.\nData compiled by Bloomberg indicates most of the market is anticipating a December rate rise, with a 69 per cent chance, up 4 per cent from last month. Meanwhile, just 33 per cent anticipate a September increase.\nRaising rates is expected to shift the Australian dollar up as the US dollar slides. Western Union Business Solutions analyst Joe Manimbo said this combined with incoming summer holidays was driving people to cash out of the high greenback.\n\"We're finally seeing some profit-taking catch up with the dollar, which isn't surprising given its robust gains,\" said Mr Manimbo told Bloomberg. \"A lot of people have headed to the beaches and have pared back on meaningful currency positions.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711", "https://twitter.com/rosepowell"], "published": "2015-07-22T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:03:48.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
