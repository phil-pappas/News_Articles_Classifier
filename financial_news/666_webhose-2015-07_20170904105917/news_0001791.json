Contrary to popular belief, people who spend more hours doing paid work show higher general health, HILDA finds. Share on twitter by Misa Han The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, a longitudinal study, shows some common qualities of people who earn more, have higher net wealth, are healthy and in a happy relationship.\nLeave home by 24 The optimal age for moving out of home is 21 to 24 if you want higher income and wealth later in life. When looking at the data for 35 to 54 year olds, men and women who moved out after they turned 25 were $20,779 and $95,676 worse off in terms of their net wealth than those who moved out when they were 21 to 24.\nMen and women who moved out when they were 18 to 20 were also worse off by $99,834 and $25,768 in terms of their net wealth.\nThe report says: \"Negative effects on income and wealth associated with moving out of home before the age of 18 are particularly large. Relative to moving out at age 21 to 24, there are also negative effects of moving out at age 18 to 20 or age 25 and over for income and/or wealth.\"\nBut based on the latest statistics the future does not look very promising. The HILDA survey confirms anecdotal evidence that they are more likely to hang around into their 20s than before , with more than half of 18 to 29 year old sons and four in ten 18 year old daughters still living with their parents.\nPut a ring on it Married people are less likely to break up. The study shows de facto marriages are more prone to breakups.\n After four years, 74 per cent of de facto couples are still together compared with over 90 per cent of married couples.\nAnd while the study shows the longer you have been in a marriage or a de facto relationship, the more likely you are to break up , there is an upside. \"In general, the longer the relationship, the lower the likelihood it will end in any given year. This is reflected in the slope of the survival function tending to decrease as relationship duration increases,\" the report says.\nAgree how to raise the kids The study shows having different views on marriage and children to your partner is associated with a higher probability of separation in legal marriages.\nMeanwhile, having traditional views on marriage and children are associated with lower probability of separation.\nBe agreeable Being agreeable and emotionally stable will increase your partner's satisfaction in the relationship.\nIf you're a man in a heterosexual relationship, being conscientious will increase the woman's satisfaction. But if you're a woman, being open to experience will decrease the man's satisfaction.\nLook for a new job People who change jobs will get up to 25 per cent pay rise over five years, compared to up to 15 per cent pay rise for those who did not change jobs.\nWork longer hours Contrary to popular belief, people who spend more hours doing paid work show higher general health. Assuming we measure health on a scale of 0 (unhealthy) to 100 (healthy), men who spent 51 hours or more per week on paid work added 3.6 to their general health measure and women, 3.0 points.\nIn comparison, men spent 15 hours or less on paid work only gained 1.4 to their health score and women, 1.3.\nOn the other hand, male retirees lost their health score by 2.1 and female retirees, 1.6.\nHave that beer Good news for drinkers: consuming up to 28 standard drinks will actually increase the general health score by up to 1.6 points on a 0 to 100 scale. It is only when you hit the 29th standard drink your general health will start to suffer.\nLive with a partner, if you're a man The survey shows living with a partner increases men's general health, but not women's. But living with a partner and a dependent child increases women's general health, but not mens.\nBe born first, if you're a man There are more benefits to being the eldest child than avoiding hand-me-downs, particularly if you are male. When looking at the data for 35 to 54 year olds, the male eldest child's net wealth was higher by around $81,196 compared to the average, while the female eldest child's net wealth was higher by around $11,326. The male eldest child also earned $2036 more than the average, while the female eldest child earned $1248 more.\nBe gay, if you're a woman The data shows sexuality has bearing on income. The 2012 data suggests gay or bisexual men earn an average of $1006 a week, compared to their heterosexual counterparts who earn $1265 a week. But lesbian or bisexual women earn $778 a week on average, which is more than their heterosexual counterparts' average weekly wage of $676.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/adult_children_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-15T09:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T07:05:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
