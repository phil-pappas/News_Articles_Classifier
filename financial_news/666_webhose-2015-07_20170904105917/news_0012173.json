I therefore took the initiative to train the youth to enable them start income generating projects,\" he said. \nMore than 68,000 residents last year faced starvation, forcing them to migrate with their animals to Uganda in search of pasture and water. \nLomunokol said he was looking for a permanent solution to the persistent drought in the region. \n\"When drought hits this region, most of the activities are affected. For example, children are forced to drop out of school, cases of malnutrition rise, animals and residents also die,\" he said. \nChronic malnutrition rate in West Pokot county currently stands at 43 per cent. \n\"Every year, I am forced to lead a delegation from my constituency to Uganda to persuade them to allow us graze our animals there. Since most of the functions have been devolved, I want to ensure that residents access most of the services at their homes,\" he said. \nLomunokol said in the past, his constituency was majorly affected by cattle rustling which greatly affected development in the region. \n\"For the last five years, we have been enjoying peace in this region and that's why we as elected leaders are using available resources to help transform the lives of residents,\" he said. \nThe MP said he wants to ensure more than 1,000 former cattle rustlers engage in income generating activities. \n\"Many of the youth have now ventured into bee keeping, goat rearing, sand harvesting, poultry keeping and farming,\" he said. \nNpareng Loliakau from Kanyerus, one of the beneficiaries, said Kacheliba has the same climatic conditions as Yatta yet they have enough food. \n\"Yatta is dry like Kacheliba; I am amazed to see people here engage in various farming methods that enable them to have sufficient food. There is nothing meaningful that we gained from the raids yet we lost many people. I want to venture into goat rearing and poultry farming and shun the outdated practice. In the coming years investors will be willing to invest in this region,\" he said. \nChristian Impact Mission director Titus Masika urged the warriors to paddock their farms and start water harvesting. \n\"We cannot engage in meaningful agriculture if we don't have sufficient water. We need to dig up our own water pans to help store water,\" he said. \nMasika said the big problem facing pastoralists is over-dependence on relief food. \n\"Pastoral communities should change their mindsets and start investing in alternative ways that will ensure they have sufficient food,\" he said. \nHe said by pastoralists using the little available water in their regions, cases of cattle rustling and insecurity will be a thing of the past. \nHe said the communities have fertile arable land and if all stakeholders can pull resources together and educate the residents on how to conserve water, the regions can produce enough food even for export. \nMasika gave an example of Makutano village in Machakos county, which for many years depended on relief food but after residents were educated on how to conserve water, the area has enough food. \n\"Every week we export more than 15 tonnes of French beans and bullet chilly from the village,\" he said. \nHe said marginalised counties have the potential to penetrate international markets since they can plant off season and fetch good money. \n\"When you conserve water, you can plant any time when demand is high and supply is low. Farmers should stop depending on rain-fed agriculture in order to realise huge profits. \n\"The youth should also form groups if they want to realise huge profits from agriculture. You cannot be rich alone; you need to walk with others to be able to penetrate international markets,\" he said.
