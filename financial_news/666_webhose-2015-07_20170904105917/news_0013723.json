Morgan Stanley is on the other side of the deal. Both banks could potentially reap more than $100 million in deal fees, depending on how the transaction is structured. \nTypically banks earn between 1% and 2% on big deals. But, a deal as huge as ACE's $28 billion buy sometimes command lower percentages. The stocks of both Chubb and ACE rose in trading Wednesday morning. \nIt comes in a year where boutique banks have continued to take more money from big investment banks. It also comes as M&A could potentially top all-time highs set in 2007.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T16:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T18:03:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
