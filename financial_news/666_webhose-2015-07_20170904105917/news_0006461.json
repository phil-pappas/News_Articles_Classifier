As Brian Kelly, founder of ThePointsGuy.com , points out: “Airlines loyalties are to their shareholders” — so they will do “what the market will bear” in pursuit of additional monies.\nAnd the market, at least thus far, has borne their attempts to cram more people into an already tight space. “Consumers are myopically focused on price” says Kelly -- even, often, if that means less comfort. (Look no further than Spirit Airlines — one of the worst-rated U.S. airlines according to TripAdvisor Flights and one that has little leg room and few comforts — is also one of America’s most profitable.)\nHere are five of the things that airlines have recently done that may make us far less comfy midair.\nShrinking — and eliminating — bathrooms\nOne of the latest moves is making bathrooms -- which already are tough for larger passengers to fit comfortably in -- even smaller. Boeing, which supplies jets for major airlines, recently announced it is going to shrink the size of the bathrooms on its 777-300ER jet (this is the largest of the 777 family and can seat nearly 400 people) to make room for 14 more seats. Airbus, another major supplier of jets to airlines, will begin rolling out planes (its A320 model) with a smaller bathroom in 2016, in an attempt to make more spaces for luggage.\nWhat’s more, while we don’t know of any airlines that have eliminated bathrooms entirely — though Ryanair threatened to charge customers for the bathroom — airlines have, in many cases, reduced the number of restrooms, says Jami Counter, the senior advisor of TripAdvisor Flights. “There used to be three bathrooms in coach, now it’s [sometimes] down to two,” he says. “What ends up happening is that after the first hour or two of the flight, there’s a near constant line for the bathroom, so if you’re sitting in the last row or two there’s someone standing near you constantly.”\nGetty Images Spirit Airlines check-in. Seats that can’t recline\nSome people think it’s rude to recline your seat even if you can — others think that if a seat can recline, it’s their right to recline it. (This debate got so heated on one flight from Newark to Denver — a passenger put a “Knee Defender” to prevent another passenger from reclining and she allegedly retaliated by dousing him in water — that the pilot had to divert the plane.) But some passengers simply have no choice: their seats won’t recline at all. Indeed, both Allegiant Air and Spirit now both have seats that won’t recline. This move is less about cramming passengers in than it is about reducing costs, says Counter. Non-reclining seats are lighter, which cuts fuel costs, and less likely to break; they’re also uncomfortable, he adds.\nShutterstock See ya, first class.
