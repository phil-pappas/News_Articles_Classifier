TALK ABOUT IT Start by having a frank conversation about money – how much they'll have to spend, how often they'll get it and what they'll be responsible for paying. \nIt's important to be candid about personal finances, so discuss everything relevant you can think of – including the cost of getting it wrong. While a university education is about learning far more than can be taught in any classroom, the last thing you want your kids to learn about first-hand are the horrors of debt, poor credit history or even payday loans. \nInstead, you want them to firmly grasp their finances and free them from the burden of worrying about money. More than 80% of students admitted to having money worries on their mind while at university, according to last year's National Student Money Survey by SavetheStudent.org. Of them, 46% admitted that it affected their studies and 58% said it had an impact on their eating habits. \nSo show your child how to budget as this will help them resist the temptation to celebrate with a big blow-out when their loan cash comes in. \nCharlotte Burns, editor of Studentmoneysaver.co.uk, says: \"You need to go through their income (such as their student loan, grants and any savings), then take off their essential outgoings (tuition fees, rent, bills, travel and food) and show them what is left (which probably won't be much) for clothes and socialising. \n\"If you can get them to understand just how little money they have to play with before they get hold of their overdraft and the loan goes into the account, they won't blindly get through their money in a few weeks.\" 2. GET APPY There's a vast array of clever, and free, money-related apps available to download, which are perfect for your tech-mad offspring. We're sure they'll already be familiar with the likes of free instant message and chat apps WhatsApp and Skype that let them talk and text for free but they're just the tip of the money-saving iceberg. \nApps such as mySuperList let them input their grocery list to find out which supermarket is selling items cheapest and Splitwise works out how much each diner owes towards the bill when eating out. And don't forget to make sure they download a banking app – most of which come with the ability to transfer money easily and securely as well as letting them check their balance any time of day or night. \nSome paid-for apps can prove very worthwhile too, such as the £1.99 parking app Nosey Parker that rounds up all locally available free car parking. \n3. EXTRA HELP If money is tight, then there is extra help at hand. Ruth Bushi, editor at Savethestudent.org, says that many students miss out because they don't know what help exists: \"It's worth reviewing what extra cash is available each year from student finance to bursaries, grants and scholarships. There's a lot of assistance that goes unclaimed because people don't know it's there.\" Your child may be eligible for a tuition fee loan, maintenance loan, maintenance grant or special support loan, as part of the government's student finance services. \nThe student finance calculator is a good place to start (Gov.uk/student-finance-calculator) as it helps you estimate based on your family's household income. \nNearly all universities and colleges offer bursaries and scholarships – extra money to help with the cost of further education. These are paid annually by individual universities and colleges and are in addition to any student loan or grant – plus your child won't have to pay them back. \nThe application criteria vary between institutions but it's often linked to family income or academic success. Local government and non-profit organisations can also offer bursaries, often linked to course selection. For instance, the Care Council for Wales offers a £2,500 annual bursary for social work students who ordinarily reside in Wales. \n4. COUNCIL TAX DISCOUNTS In almost all cases, full-time students do not need to pay council tax. While those living in university halls of residence don't have to worry about this at all, those living in privately run accommodation will need to apply for an exemption certificate, which they can do online at Gov.uk/apply-for-council-tax-discount. \nIt becomes tricky if they live with someone who isn't a full-time student, as this means the property will not be exempt from council tax. However, whoever is liable to pay the bill might qualify for a discount. \n5. TV LICENCE You need a TV licence to watch or record live TV programmes – that is, while they are being broadcast – whether you're watching on a TV, computer, laptop, tablet or mobile – and students aren't exempt. \nIf they live in halls of residence or a house that specifies each bedroom as a separately occupied location, then they will need their own TV licence. If it's just one address then they can split the cost of the licence. \nStudents can avoid paying the £145.50 entirely if they stick to just watching catch-up TV, such as BBC's iPlayer or 4oD rather than viewing programmes live. \nIf they do purchase a TV licence at the start of the academic year and then decide to move back home for the duration of the summer holidays, they can claim a discount for the remaining three months, currently worth £36. \nStudents can apply for their refund at Tvlicensing.co.uk/students or over the phone on 0300 790 6113. \n6. FEEL THE HEAT Despite some tenancy contracts stating otherwise, landlords and letting management agencies cannot stop tenants from switching energy suppliers. If living in private accommodation, your child and their housemates should shop around by using comparison sites to find the best deals. \nIt's unlikely that they'll have any previous bills to use for comparison but they could ask the landlord to get an estimate from the previous tenants, as well as details of the current supplier. What they should really focus on is finding the cheapest unit cost per kilowatt hour (kWh) available. \nThe very cheapest deals on the market are generally fixed-rate deals for a minimum of one or two years. While these might not be suitable if your child doesn't know where or with whom they'll be living one year to the next, some deals can be 'ported' when customers move home. However, there can still be significant savings to be made by switching, even if the move isn't to the very cheapest fixed-rate deal. \n7. LOOK FOR SECONDHAND BOOKS While each term's reading list may very well include the latest editions of a particular professor's book, past editions change hands for a lot less money and the updated sections can usually be photocopied from the university library's copy of the new release. \nInstead, of shelling out for every brand new book, encourage your child to check out the student union shop and their department's notice board for pre-owned copies that sell for a fraction of their original price. They can also scour eBay or Amazon to pick up copies from previous students from other universities. \nCourseSmart.co.uk will loan you an e-version of a textbook for 360 days for up to 50% less than buying the text new. \n8. DON'T FORGET ABOUT DISCOUNTS Remind your offspring to always ask for a student discount when they buy anything. Most retails will give discounts, of up to 25%, for those with a student card. Studentmoneysaver.co.uk and Savethestudent.org list all the latest discounts. And if you're thinking about getting your child a parting gift before they head to uni, then you might want to consider buying them an NUS Extra card – it costs just £12 and gets them discounts online and in store for a year with more than 160 retailers. \n9. HOME INSURANCE Getting cover for a student house or shared accommodation can be tricky and expensive. This is because insurers view insuring a person, not a house, as higher risk. \nHowever, there are some ways around it, as Chloe French, spokesperson for Direct Line home insurance, says: \"Parents should check to see if their existing home insurance policy will cover their children's contents when away at university before they invest in additional, potentially unnecessary cover. If not, they should see if they can add the cover on to their existing policy or weigh up the difference in cost between buying standalone student cover versus switching to an insurer that will include cover for their child's contents, too\". \nFor example, Direct Line provides cover under its standard home insurance policy while students are in full-time education, as long as they reside at their parents' address during term breaks. The maximum level of cover provided is £5,000. There is a single item limit of £2,000 for any one valuable. \nIt's worth calling up your insurer to notify them of the items and checking that they are covered fully. \nIf they live in shared accommodation, then they'll need to be vigilant about locking their doors as they won't be covered for theft unless entry is forced. \n10. STUDENT RAILCARD A 16-25 Railcard is valid for full-time students of any age and cuts a third off the cost of travelling by train. Cards cost £30 a year, or £70 for three years, and can be bought from rail stations or Railcard.co.uk. Santander currently gives new 123 Student Current Account holders who pay in £500 a term a four-year railcard, worth £100, as a freebie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T01:35:43.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
