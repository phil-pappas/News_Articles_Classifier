Glen McCurtayne Share on twitter by Sue Mitchell Grocery wholesaler Metcash has been accused of organising a supplier campaign to oppose Coles' $100 million acquisition of independent supermarket chain SupaBarn.\nCanberra baker Mick Gubas received a call earlier this month from Metcash who asked him to join a group of SupaBarn suppliers who feared they would go out of business if the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission approved the deal.\nMr Gubas, who has been supplying Supabarn and IGA stores with sourdough bread for four years, wasn't the slightest bit interested.\n\"If it [the deal] went through it would be a benefit to my business, not a threat – we have been trying to get into Coles to sell bread,\" the former restaurateur told Fairfax Media. \"There's an opportunity for us to expand our business and get into other stores.\"\n\"When I said I wasn't interested he said 'you're no good to me' and hung up,\" said Mr Gubas, who deals directly with IGA store owners and Supabarn rather than Metcash. \"They didn't threaten to drop us but I thought there might be repercussions if they end up being childish about it.\"\nMr Gubas' experience highlights the depth of feeling in Canberra about the controversial acquisition, which will see Coles take control of one of the largest independent supermarket chains in the ACT and NSW.\nColes plans to buy nine Supabarn stores: four in the ACT, two in Sydney's inner west, two in Sydney's south and one under construction in the outskirts of Canberra.\nColes already has 10 existing or proposed supermarkets in the ACT, all of which are within five kilometres from the Supabarn stores, and has 14 stores within a 5km radius of the Supabarn stores at Five Dock, Annandale, Sutherland and Sans Souci in Sydney.\n Market investigation launched The ACCC has launched an investigation into the affect on competition in the retail and wholesale grocery markets and will hold a public forum in Canberra on Monday before making a decision in September.\nMetcash denied that it had organised a supplier campaign to raise concerns about the deal but a spokesman said a small number of suppliers unique to SupaBarn had raised concerns with Metcash that they would no longer be able to sell their products if Coles took over the chain.\nMetcash has lodged a confidential submission with the ACCC highlighting \"numerous competition concerns that arise from the proposed acquisition,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We remain happy to work with the ACCC and other parties to ensure the best possible outcome,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe ACT Government has previously welcomed the acquisition, saying the 100 extra jobs created by the deal would benefit the community.\nHowever, independent supermarkets led by the Master Grocers Association have called on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to block the deal, saying the ACT grocery market was already dominated by Coles and Woolworths.\n\"This is not about our members, SupaBarn, they're brilliant business people and they have made a massive contribution to the independent supermarket sector and set incredible benchmarks, \" said Masters Grocers Association chief executive Jos de Bruin.\n\"But we are very concerned that Coles in particular in this instance is gaining unprecedented market power in a market like Canberra, which is already massively dominated by Coles and Woolworths,\" Mr de Bruin said, adding that Coles and Woolworths accounted for 90 per cent of the full-line grocery market in the ACT.\n\"If this goes through it will be forever Coles and there will be less choice for consumers and less retail diversity.\"\nMr Gubas says some of his customers have complained about Coles \"taking over the world\" but he believes the deal could be good for suppliers.\n\"It looks pretty positive,\" said Mr Gubas, who started out making sourdough to supply his Canberra restaurants. Sales had doubled since he started supplying supermarkets, although his company, Autolyse, went briefly into voluntary administration this year after opening a bakery in Sydney.\n\"Coles is keen to use local suppliers in their business model – that's the way they're marketing themselves at the moment – I think it's a golden opportunity,\" he said.\n\"Our bread sells out so they'd be cutting off their nose to spite their face if they did drop us.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/suemitchellafr"], "published": "2015-07-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:13:55.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
