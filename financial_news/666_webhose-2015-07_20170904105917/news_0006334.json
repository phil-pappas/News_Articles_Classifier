Tampa, Florida (PRWEB) July 16, 2015\nA self-directed IRA gives plan owners total control over their retirement funds and decisions, allowing them to invest in what they know best—within the realm of their own comfort zones. Unlike traditional retirement accounts, self-directed plans allow many different types of alternative investments, such as real estate, to be held as assets. Advanta IRA Services often provides educational events that explain how these accounts can build wealth for retirement using unique assets outside the realm of the typical stock, bond, or mutual fund.\nSince retirement plans offer tax-free or tax-deferred income-building potential—the income derived from real estate in an IRA grows in that tax-sheltered plan. “Real estate investors who use self-directed IRAs to acquire assets avoid the tax implications incurred from personally purchasing or selling real estate and preserve more capital within the IRA to reinvest,” says Jack Callahan, managing partner of Advanta IRA Services in Florida and also of Advanta IRA Administration in Georgia.\nThe retirement plan administrator is offering this complimentary event on July 21 to teach investors how real estate works in self-directed IRAs. Individuals interested in real estate investing are invited to attend.\nEvent: Webinar – Invest in Real Estate without Paying Taxes\nDate: July 21, 2015\nTime: 12:00 pm-1:00 pm\nRegistration: Contact Larissa Greene before 5:00 p.m. (EST) on July 20 at lgreene(at)advantairagroup(dot)com or by phone at (800) 425-0653 ext. 1140.\nAbout Advanta IRA\nAdvanta IRA Services, located in Largo, Florida, has been in operation for over ten years, providing administrative service to owners of self-directed IRAs across the nation.
