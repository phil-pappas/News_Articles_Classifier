More Female breadwinners, China's meltdown and HMRC's latest crackdown \nMarkit compared the dividend tax change with a rise in the top rate of income tax in 2010, which prompted some 73 companies now in the FTSE All-Share to bring forward dividend payments, 57 to pay out second interim dividends and another 14 to make exceptional payments ahead of that increase. \nHousebuilders, insurers and investment trusts are especially likely to pay special dividends before April 2016, thanks to their strong balance sheets and cash flow, the analysts said. \nThe reforms abolish the dividend tax credit and introduce a dividend tax allowance of £5,000 a year, while bringing in new rates for each taxpayer band. The Treasury expects to gain £2.5bn in extra tax revenues in 2015-16 from the changes, then to lose £890m in the 2016-17 financial year; after that, it expects between £1bn and £2bn in extra revenues each year. \nPeople who own and manage companies will be among those most affected by the changes, according to PwC, the consultancy. \nCompanies with high levels of “insider” holdings, where management want to avoid higher tax rates, are among those likely to accelerate payments, along with companies that have a high concentration of investors with big holdings, Markit said. \n“It’s likely that investors with substantial shareholdings in listed companies will place pressure on management to distribute cash in advance of the new rates taking effect,” the company said. \nThe FTSE 100 companies with the highest insider ownership are Fresnillo, Antofagasta and Royal Bank of Scotland; the latter is 62 per cent owned by the government. Sports Direct, Associated British Foods and Schroders also have more than 50 per cent “insider” ownership. \nOil and gas, basic resources and banking are unlikely to pay out special dividends this time, as they are suffering the impact of low commodities prices and tougher banking regulation, the report said. \nIn 2010, companies such as WPP, Ashmore, Domino’s Pizza and Moneysupermarket brought their dividend timetable forward; Ted Baker and Monks Investment Trust were among those paying second interim dividends, while Hargreaves Lansdown, Moneysupermarket and Fidessa paid out special distributions. \nAbout 700,000 taxpayers are set to face tax rises as a result of the dividend tax reforms, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. \nThey will increase the bills of a 40p taxpayer who receives more than £21,667 of dividends a year and a basic rate taxpayer receiving more than £5,000 of dividends, the think-tank said. \nThe Treasury said the changes would leave 85 per cent of those who receive dividends unaffected or better off. Dividends from investments held within a tax wrapper, such as a pension or individual savings account, are unaffected. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
