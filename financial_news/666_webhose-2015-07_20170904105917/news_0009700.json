If they were a single country, they’d be the largest national economy on earth with $21.9 trillion in output last year.\nChinese metro economies enjoyed the fastest GDP per capita growth.\nBut it’s not all about Asia. Cities such as Portland, San Jose, Seattle and others all outpaced national growth averages in 2014.\n“Cities are where the region’s most significant developments—China’s continued liberalization and economic expansion, the rise of Southeast Asia, and the technology-led growth occurring in North America—all come to ground,” the report’s authors wrote. “These dynamics—along with the recent push among national governments to cement trans-Pacific ties—offer the potential for a new era of shared growth and prosperity among cities in the Asia-Pacific region.”\n©2015 Bloomberg News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T12:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T06:45:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
