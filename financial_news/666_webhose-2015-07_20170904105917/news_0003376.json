This should allow us to complete formal joint venture agreements and begin financing discussions with a view to securing a debt and equity funding package that could see construction commencing in 2016.\n\n“The countdown is now well and truly on for the financing and development of Watershed which has the potential to be a company-maker generating very attractive returns for our shareholders and joint venture partners alike.”\n\nWatershed Tungsten Project \n\nThe Watershed Tungsten Project is a fully permitted mid-sized project with an Ore Reserves of 21.3 million tonnes at 0.15% WO3. \n\nIt also has potential for resource growth with mineralisation remaining open along strike and at depth meaning an extension to the current mine life is also likely.\n\nA recent review of the Definitive Feasibility Study has concluded that savings in the pre-production capital costs will be realised due to extremely competitive market conditions for developers of projects:\n\n- Most of the large scale natural resource projects of recent years have finished or are winding down resulting in significant surplus capacity amongst mining and construction contractors;\n- This in turn has led to a reduction in demand for mining and plant equipment with a large amount of surplus and second-hand equipment in the market adding pressure on new equipment vendors; and\n- Continued reductions in construction and mine site jobs has improved labour availability and led to a reduction in wage rates.\n\nBesides the reduction in forecast pre-production capital expenditure to A143 million cash costs for the first 3 years are extremely competitive at US124/mtu while life of mine cash costs at US148/mtu are also attractive against average site cash costs of around US165/mtu for a typical Chinese operation producing a 65% WO3 concentrate in 2013.\n\nAnalysis \n\nThe JOGMEC tender process establishes a clear and firm timeline for Vital Metals to advance the Watershed Tungsten Project and achieve its goal of becoming a top global tungsten producer.\n\nSecuring the long-term Japanese customer will fast track development of the project by helping secure key debt funding and possibly offtake tungsten production.\n\nThis includes attractive Japanese funding on a 70:30 debt:equity ratio.\n\nLong-term outlook for tungsten is positive with global usage continuing to grow year on year at around 5% while the European Union has recently voted on a measure will lead to a significant reduction in the use of material that’s illegally mined and sourced.\n\n\nProactive Investors Australia is the market leader in producing news articles and research reports on ASX emerging companies with distribution in Australia UK North America and Hong Kong / China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T13:25:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
