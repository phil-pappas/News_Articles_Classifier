In our western economy we typically try to purchase assets as frugally as possible and sell them subsequently for as much as we can in the open market. Generally speaking we try to obtain TOP DOLLAR for each item we sell. In the buying and selling of real estate our homes rank up there as one of the most important transactions we will ever make financially and emotionally. Some of us may even purchase and sell several residences over the course of our lifetime. In addition many people buy and sell houses as commodities making them into income-producing investments and businesses. \nWhile some people manage their transactions on their own most of us are ill-equipped to do so. It is for this reason that this book was written. The guidance of the CelebrityExperts® in this book will likely be eye-opening for those who may wish to sell or purchase real estate - and avoid any errors these experts encountered and discussed. It is for this reason we would not normally ask a doctor to represent us in a court of law nor an attorney to perform surgery on us. \nThe CelebrityExperts® who have written this book discuss their areas of expertise and mentor you on them. They have both the experience and certifications to back up their presentations. In this day and age it is only prudent to use the expertise of an experienced professional - one who can guide you through the maze of real estate transactions - in order to obtain the TOP DOLLAR for your property. \nAfter such a successful release Shawn Culhane will be recognized by an organization that honors authors from many of the leading independent best-seller lists.\nClick to order a copy of Top Dollar\nA portion of the royalties earned from Top Dollar will be given to Entrepreneur’s International Foundation a not for profit organization dedicated to creating unique launch campaigns to raise money and awareness for charitable causes. \nMore About Shawn Culhane: \nShawn’s honors and awards are representative of his hard work integrity and level of success in helping his clients buy and sell homes.
