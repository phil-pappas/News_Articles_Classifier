They include SIC’s head office, 10 regional offices, the SIC Financial Services and some properties in Accra. \nIvory Finance is going after SIC’s assets after a 19 million Ghana cedis credit guarantee it issued to ITAL construction for building some affordable houses went bad. \nAfter months of legal battles to stop payments, the debts has hit about 234 million Ghana cedis. \nHowever some officials of SIC have told Joy Business they delayed in paying the debts because it thought the deal is fraudulent.
