The ECB and the Bulgarian central bank declined to comment.\nEastern Europe is at risk of tremors from Greece via ties ranging from trade to finance, with lenders from the debt-ridden country owning almost a third of banking assets in Bulgaria. The possibility of Greece abandoning the euro after shutting banks and imposing capital controls has left eastern European currencies among this week’s worst emerging-market performers.\n“The threat of ‘Grexit’ has understandably cast a dark cloud over the outlook,” for the region, London-based Capital Economics said last week in a note. “Ties with Greece are sizable in a few places, including Bulgaria and Romania.”\nBulgaria and its banks have been a main focus of concern for European Union officials looking at potential fallout from the Greek crisis in the region, according to people familiar with their thinking. The yield on euro-denominated Bulgarian government debt due 2024 has jumped 25 basis points this week to 2.61 percent.\nRegional Anchor This isn’t the first time the ECB performed a role as an anchor to smaller EU countries around the euro area. For example, at the height of the global financial crisis in October 2008, the institution loaned as much as 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) to Hungary’s central bank.\nWhile Bulgaria’s lev is pegged to the euro, Romania’s leu has weakened 0.7 percent against the common currency this week. Talks between Romania’s government and the EU over a precautionary loan broke down last month, heightening the danger from Greece as an existing facility expires in September.\nWith developments in Athens also jeopardizing the euro-area economy, eastern Europe’s biggest trading partner, Poland’s zloty has lost 0.5 percent and Hungary’s forint 0.6 percent.\nThe four largest Greek lenders all have units in Bulgaria and Romania.
