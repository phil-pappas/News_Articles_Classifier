Because it is. Share on twitter by John Davidson I'm thinking of doing a travelling exhibition of my travel expenses. They are such a work of art, I'm sure the best galleries in the world will be falling over each other to show them off.\nThe best thing about this plan is that it will be self-fuelling, a perpetual-motion machine of travel expense art. All my Paris expense reports can go into the New York exhibition, which in turn can go into the Montreal exhibition, and so on and so forth until I have circled the globe and have an SD card positively brimming with the world's best photographs of the receipts from all the world's best hotels, restaurants and bars.\nOf course, I will have to carry with me Panasonic's new DMC-CM1 camera-phone/phone-camera, which is both the source of my brilliant idea and the tool with which I will accomplish it. But that won't be a burden. If I were travelling, even if it weren't for such a noble artistic endeavour, and if I could carry only one gadget with me, the DMC-CM1 camera-phone/phone-camera would get serious consideration. It's that good.\nAs you can see, I'm having a bit of an each-way bet about how to describe the thing. The DMC-CM1 is either a tiny, 20-megapixel camera with phone built in, or it's the most massive phone you've ever seen, one capable of taking photographs of a quality you've never seen from a phone. And I mean, never.\nWe reviewed the DMC-CM1 by carrying it around for a week, at times along with a Samsung Galaxy S6, an iPhone 6 and an LG G4, the three phones we regard as having the best cameras.\nTo give you an idea of how much bigger the Panasonic is, the Galaxy S is 7mm thick, and 9mm thick where the lens pokes out. The iPhone is roughly the same. the CM1, in contrast, is 15mm thick, 21mm thick at the lens, and a whopping 25mm thick at the lens when the camera is turned on.\nYes, the lens on the CM1 pops out when you use it, just like a real camera. That's because this thing is a real camera. It's the first phone ever to have a 1-inch image sensor on it, the sort of sensor you can find on other real cameras such as Sony's RX100 camera. The size of a sensor makes a huge difference to both the quality and the aesthetics of a photo, and the 1-inch sensor, while not my favourite size (I prefer full frame, but try fitting that on a phone!), has the advantage of being roughly seven times bigger than the sensor on the iPhone 6 and roughly five times bigger than the sensors on the Galaxy S6 and the G4.\nSee the difference And that difference shows in the photographs.\nAs you might guess from the fact it takes 20 megapixel photos (as opposed to the 8 or 12 megapixels you get from other high-end camera phones), images from the CM1 have far more detail in them than any phone camera we've ever reviewed. We do standard studio tests with every camera we review; that includes photographing some newsprint from a given distance. On most phone cameras, including the Galaxy S6 and the iPhone 6, that print isn't even legible, let alone sharp. On some phone cameras, such as the LG G4 and some of Sony's Xperia phones, the print is just legible, but still not sharp. On the CM1 it's perfectly legible, except at the very edges of the image where the sharpness drops off a little. Real cameras take photos like that, not phones.\nBut there's far more to it than just sharpness. Noise levels are much lower and better controlled than any phone camera we've reviewed, and even where noise is easily visible at very high (by phone standards) light sensitivities such as ISO 3200, it's that pleasant, film-like noise with no ugly colours in it. Past ISO 3200, the noise is getting severe, and at ISO 25600 colours are washing out and drifting, but just think about that for a moment: this phone has a limit of, say, ISO 3200 for usable photos. Most phones max out at a tiny fraction of that sensitivity.\nAll of which means the CM1 takes photos that are better than any phone we've ever seen, up there with compact cameras. Not to mention, it's got the full suite of camera modes, and serious camera features such manual focus peaking, exposure bracketing and spot metering. There's even a nice ring around the lens you can devote to setting, say, the ISO. Apart from the absence of a viewfinder (something you would never expect to find on a phone, not even a camera-phone/phone-camera like this one), it's a very camera-like experience.\nNow, as the proud owner of a full-frame camera, the main thing I do with phone cameras is use them to take photos of receipts, which I can easily upload into my employer's expense system. So I have to admit the CM1 would be a tad wasted on me. You'd have to be a fairly keen phone photographer to carry around a phone this large just for its photos.\nEither that, or you'd have to a lot of expenses. This phone takes great photos of receipts. Even in low light, in the back of a cab where none of my other phones could photograph receipts, the CM1 took brilliant, perfectly legible receipt photos.\nTrust me, the photos I have taken of receipts this past week are a work of art. If my exhibition comes to your town, you won't even need to trust me. You will be able to see for yourself.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DLLabs"], "published": "2015-07-27T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:11:57.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
