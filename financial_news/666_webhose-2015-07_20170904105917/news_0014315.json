Nic Walker Share on twitter by Misa Han In the past two months alone, Oz Hair owner Elio Nappa has had about 10 people knocking on his door applying for apprenticeships. He turned down all of them.\n\"When I was young, it was easier to find a job because people were giving me a go. Now it's very hard to give people a go.\"\nHe said the recent changes to apprenticeship pay are a burden on his business. Since January this year, employers had to pay for apprentices' course fees, which cost about $2000, plus textbooks.\nOn top of that, hair salons have to pay apprentices hired after January 2014 at a higher rate if they are 21 years old or older.\nNappa has about 60 staff members working across four hair salons in QVB in Sydney's CBD, Westfield Miranda, Ashfield Mall and Westfield Hurstville.\nAll the shopping centres require him to open the stores seven days a week, including one late night on Thursday. This means he has to pay 33 per cent penalty loading on Saturday and double time on Sunday, which takes the hairdresser's hourly wage up to $60.\n\"We've got no power to close on Sunday because the shopping centres will kick you out,\" Mr Nappa said.\n\"The problem with us is that we are tradespeople but we have to work in a retail environment.\"\n Hard to pass cost to customers He said it's very hard to pass on the cost to customers, so instead he employs less staff and takes the pressure on margins.\nHe welcomed the proposal to make the pay and conditions simpler for smaller businesses, but he reckoned this should apply to businesses with less than 100 employees.\nHe wants the pay and working conditions simplified so law-abiding business such as Oz Hair can have a competitive advantage.\n\"You have to be a scientist to work out [the conditions]. It makes it unfair because a lot of other hair salons don't play by the rules.\"\nHair and Beauty Australia, the peak industry organisation representing 1200 businesses and 7000 staff, told the Productivity Commission the number of people employed in the industry is shrinking, largely because of high labour costs including higher apprentice wage rates, which were intended to encourage more people to the industry but in reality made it more unaffordable for employers.\nThe organisation's chief executive Christina Arciuli said Australia was no longer a society in which people did not work weekends, and penalty rates needed to recognise that.\n\"Our industry specifically is unique, as such; where we are a trade qualification labour force operating in a retail environment, often seven days a week, and nights,\" she said in a submission.\n\"To think that a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday is worth 133 per cent to 250 per cent more than a weekday pay rate in a trade/retail environment is outdated and â€¦ stopping employment opportunities.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan"], "published": "2015-07-05T10:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T08:58:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
