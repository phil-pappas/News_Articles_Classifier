There have been 54 reports of broken seams but no reports of injuries, the CPSC said. \nThe recalled float is a round ring that fastens around a baby's neck. Otteroo is printed on the top of the float. They were sold on Otteroo.com, Amazon.com and Zulily.com between January 2014 and July 2014 for about $35. \nCustomers should stop using the float and contact Otteroo for a refund, the CPSC said. \nOtteroo can be reached at 415-236-5388 or online at http://www.otterroo.com for more information. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T01:21:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
