The NFL has played regular-season games at London’s Wembley Stadium since 2007 and has played three games a year there since 2014.\nThis just continues the NFL’s largely one-sided love affair. The league’s Jacksonville Jaguars have sacrificed one home game a year to London since 2012 and will finish their four-game commitment this year. Jaguars owner Shad Khan, who also owns English soccer team Fulham, has said he’d like to continue his team’s London deal with the league. That’s because playing in London helps his cash-strapped franchise and is now a prerequisite for hosting the Super Bowl .\nNFL owners also want to play regular-season games in Mexico, Brazil and Germany, but all of this ignores the fact that the NFL — and American football in general — is horrible at maintaining an international presence. It once backed the World League of American Football (later NFL Europe or NFL Europa), but basically abandoned franchises in Amsterdam, Cologne, Berlin, Hamburg, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt when Commissioner Roger Goodell and the owners shuttered the league in 2007 after losing $30 million a season. The Buffalo Bills embarked on their Toronto Series of games in Canada in 2008, but brought it to a close last year amid dwindling attendance and a failed Toronto bid for the Bills.\nIn fact, Goodell and company may have harpooned their best international effort back in 2005, when they dropped their American Bowl series. For nearly 20 years, the American Bowl brought preseason games to England, Sweden, Japan, Germany, Spain, Mexico, Ireland and Australia. It followed a similar model to European leagues, which send club teams around the world to play friendly exhibitions. Goodell and the owners killed it because it didn’t involve regular-season games, but it should have been more patient.\nLegendary quarterback Fran Tarkenton taps his favorite QBs of all time (0:34) The Hall of Famer weighs in on the best to ever play the position.\nThe English Premier League has regularly taken part in similar friendlies and has watched the audience for its Championship Sunday matches here in the U.S. grow to nearly 2 million on NBC. Not exactly football numbers, but a better showing than competing Major League Baseball games . In the U.K., American football is still just the seventh most-watched sport and trails well behind soccer, rugby and cricket. By comparison, Super Bowl coverage on England’s Channel Four peaked at 1.2 million viewers.\nThat’s yet another problem. At its peak, the Super Bowl is seen in roughly 160 million homes worldwide. That’s great, until you see that a regular-season match between Chelsea and Manchester United reaches an audience nearly six times that size. Oh, and that’s in a league that doesn’t have three teams threatening to leave for bigger cities . The NFL has niche appeal globally, which really hits home when you consider that the World Cup final drew 14 times the Super Bowl’s audience in the U.K. while drawing about a billion viewers worldwide.\nIf the NFL were the National Basketball Association, it could live with that. The NBA has watched basketball grow through leagues around the world, and talent has filtered into a slew of foreign-born stars. Even Major League Baseball has seen the rewards of its international efforts through stars from Asia and the Caribbean, even if the World Series of Baseball is somewhat of a bust. The NFL doesn’t want to be a part of any sports landscape it’s in. It wants to dominate. It wants to impose its will and make the richest cities in the world clamor for its franchises, as happens with Formula One races or golf and tennis championships.\nThe NFL isn’t the world’s game and its Super Bowl winner isn’t a world championship in any sense of the word. On the global stage, the NFL is a three-liter bottle of cola or an oversized SUV: exciting for its novelty, but ultimately an American export that’s impractical overseas.\nJason Notte is a freelance writer based in Portland, Ore.
