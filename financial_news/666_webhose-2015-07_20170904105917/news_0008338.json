Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey ​Prime Minister Tony Abbott has dismissed concerns of one of his MPs over the government's latest assault on wind farms and said there would be \"more than enough\" renewable energy under the legislated target.\nAs part of its ongoing war against wind-generated energy, the Abbott government recently instructed the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, a government-funded loan facility, to stop investing in wind and rooftop solar.\nCoalition MP Sarah Henderson, who holds the Victorian marginal seat of Corangamite which has a wind energy industry, wrote to Mr Abbott urging him to reconsider the directive.\nHe declined to do so on Monday and launched an attack on Labor leader Bill Shorten's pledge to the weekend's ALP National Conference to set a goal of 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030, should he win the election.\nMr Abbott called it \"bizarre\" and \"a massive and unnecessary commitment\" and said the target of 23 per cent of renewable energy by 2020 was \"more than enough\".\nLabor's renewable energy pledge, to be augmented by a low-cost emissions trading scheme, has ensured climate change policy would be once more front and centre of the next federal election.\nTax or not a tax But the Coalition's strategy to attack Labor's plans for an emissions trading scheme as a tax, have been muddied after Malcolm Turnbull said all mechanisms to lower carbon emissions came at a cost and could be effectively labelled a tax.\n \"Whether it is a regulation, whether it is a Renewable Energy Target, whether it is an ETS, whether it is a carbon tax, a fixed price, all of those … can be seen as a cost on the business of generating energy, therefore, a cost on households purchasing energy, and therefore in that sense, a tax,\" he said.\nThe Coalition supports the Renewable Energy Target and elements of its Direct Action climate policy involved regulation.\nMr Abbott, who just last week called for an end to scare campaigns and for mature policy discussions, said Labor's ETS really stood for \"Electricity Tax Scam\" while the 50 per cent renewable energy target would \"mean a massive bill \" of $60 billion for consumers. This figure was an estimate of the capital cost of the expanded target, not the consumer cost published by News Corp.\nLabor is yet to detail how it would achieve such a target but industry figures say it could be through a combination of renewable energy certificates, emissions regulations, wind auctions and other mechanisms.\nIn a bid to avoid the same trap which ensnared Julia Gillard, Mr Shorten told the Labor conference an ETS is not a tax and he would not allow the government to categorise it as such. The defence took a hit on Sunday when shadow minister Joel Fitzgibbon told a television interview he could call it a tax if he liked.\nNo carbon tax from Labor Opposition leader Bill Shorten repeated on Monday that \"Labor will not be introducing a carbon tax at all\".\nMr Shorten indicated Labor had yet to work out how it would achieve such a renewable energy target but said it would require political bi-partisanship, given it was unlikely one party would government for 15 years straight.\n\"We've given ourselves 15 years and one thing I know is that sooner or later, the once great Liberal Party of Menzies and Malcolm Fraser and indeed others who believe in action on climate, will restore and become far less extreme right-wing and come back to the mainstream when Abbott is no longer their leader,\" he said.\n\"So what we recognise is that for some of the policies, our goal of 50 per cent renewable energy, we need a Liberal Party equally committed to the future, equally committed to taking real action.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-27T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:47:59.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
