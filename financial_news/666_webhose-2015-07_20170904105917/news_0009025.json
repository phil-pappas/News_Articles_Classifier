And judging by the second quarter results of several major American companies, Chinese consumers are more than holding their own. As a result, investors should buy the shares of Ctrip.com ( CTRP - Get Report ) , and Qunar Cayman Islands ( QUNR - Get Report ) , two online travel agencies that are the Chinese counterparts of Priceline ( PCLN ) and Expedia ( EXPE ) . The shares of Ctrip.com and Qunar have dropped sharply in recent months, but both companies should benefit from the continued strength of Chinese consumers, making the stocks attractive following their declines. \nApple ( AAPL ) reported that its China revenue more than doubled last quarter to $13.2 billion, versus just $6 billion during the same period a year earlier. Starbucks ( SBUX ) said that the comparative sales of its China Asia Pacific region, which includes China and Japan, surged 11% last quarter, while its comps within China rose by an even greater amount. \nThe number of vehicles sold on a wholesale basis by General Motors ' ( GM ) Chinese joint ventures increased just 1.5% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier . But the automaker sold a record 1.7 million vehicles in China in the first half of the year, and its sales of SUVs have surged 83% in 2015, helping its margins to rise in 2015 versus 2014. GM expects industrywide auto sales in China to rise by low- to mid-single-digit percentages this year. Meanwhile, a couple of companies that have faced strong headwinds in China showed some signs of progress last quarter. The profit of Las Vegas Sands ' ( LVS ) China unit exceeded expectations , and the China comparative sales of Yum! Brands ( YUM ) fell 10% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier . However, that was an improvement over the 12% year-over-year decline that Yum experienced in the first quarter. Moreover, the fast food conglomerate, which is still feeling the effects of a 2014 food safety scandal , said that it expects its China business to deliver strong results in the second half of 2015. \nOf course, the outlook for Chinese consumers isn't totally sanguine. GM said it was seeing volatility in the country following the steep decline of its stock market, and the company called the environment in China \"difficult.\" And McDonald's ( MCD ) struggled in the Asian country last quarter . Still, given what Apple, Starbucks, and GM have told us about the their sales in China, it's hard to believe that the country's economy is \"stalling out\" or that its \"downturn could now throw Asian manufacturing into reverse,\" as commentators have recently suggested.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T22:48:43.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
