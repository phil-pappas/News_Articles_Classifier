The civil flight simulator is used for training pilots of civil aircraft. It is used for new pilots to undergo initial training and existing pilots to undergo recurrent training at regular intervals (every six months) to retain their qualification.\nTechnavio's analysts forecast the global civil aerospace simulation and training market to grow at a CAGR of 3.96% during the period 2014-2019.\nGet More Details on this Report and a Full Table of Contents at \nThe report analyst commented \"High-fidelity simulation systems closely duplicate the real world and help pilots to prepare for any situation. Earlier multi-monitor systems were used in the simulator to train pilots. However the introduction of collimated displays and the cobra-curved display flight simulator has changed the market focus. Thus there is a major shift from multi-monitor systems to high-fidelity displays.\"\nAccording to the report the use of virtual training methods is growing rapidly as airborne operations are generally 10 times the cost of simulator operations. The cost associated with airborne training is increasing because of rising fuel prices across the world. Hence airlines are facing difficulties in providing airborne training to pilots and shifting toward simulator-based training because of its greater cost-effectiveness.\nFurther the report states that one of the challenges is the high cost of FFS.\nThe key players in the Global Civil Aerospace Simulation and Training Market are CAE L3 Link FlightSafety International AXIS Flight Training and Rockwell Collins while other prominent vendors include Lokheed Martin Thales Training Frasca and Indra Sistemas\nThe study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.\nAbout Fast Market Research\nFast Market Research is a leading distributor of market research and business information.
