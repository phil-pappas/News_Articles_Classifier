Written by: James Hickman 07/28/15 - 9:24 AM EDT \nNEW YORK (TheStreet) -- For all the talk of consumer sentiment , retail sales and other measures of consumption, it is income and employment that drive economic growth. Personal consumption is simply the final transaction in the economic value chain. It is an effect of economic growth, not the cause. \nIn the absence of new jobs or higher real incomes, consumers cannot increase spending without drawing on savings or borrowing -- both unsustainable sources of consumption. The real driver of growth in jobs and wages is private-sector capital spending, also known as capital expenditures or capex. \nGrowth in capex appears robust -- up 9% per year -- if you look at it since the bottom of the financial crisis. But this masks the reality that compounded growth has been slightly more than 2% since the precrisis peak. That's anemic by long-term historical standards.

This is cash that is not being invested into growing businesses. Employment has recovered to slightly more than its precrisis peak, roughly in line with capital spending (see chart 1). \nU.S. Capital Spending and Employment \n\nBut prepeak jobs levels occurred seven and a half years ago. Capital spending and jobs have caught back up to precrisis levels, but the labor force under normal participation rates (accounting for the retirement of baby boomers) increased by 9.4 million during that time. An enormous amount of slack remains in the U.S. labor force . About 7.8 million jobs are needed to reach full employment (see chart below). But companies are on track for lower capital spending in 2015. \nU.S. Employment and Normalized Labor Force History", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T17:07:33.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
