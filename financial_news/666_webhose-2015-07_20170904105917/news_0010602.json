Dominic Lorrimer Share on twitter by Perry Williams Kevin Bertoli has watched with a sense of horror at China's spectacular sharemarket implosion in the past month.\nAs the fund manager charged with Sydney-based PM Capital's Asian equities portfolio, he was gobsmacked by the Chinese government's panicked response as markets started to fall after heavy selling by millions of retail investors.\nChina's two benchmark indices have been in freefall, with the Shanghai Composite down by a quarter since its June peak and the Shenzhen slumping a remarkable 35 per cent since its high in June. Collectively $3.4 trillion in equity value has been wiped from the markets, reflecting the boom-bust cycle.\nBeijing responded last week to try to restore confidence to battered sharemarket investors.\nMeasures included suspending more than half the stocks on mainland Chinese markets , freezing new floats, having the central bank provide liquidity for margin lending and forcing the country's main stockbrokers to create a 120 billion yuan market stabilisation fund.\nFor Bertoli the panic and wild fluctuations that have caused such massive volatility – the Shanghai sharemarket remains up nearly 90 per cent over the past 12 months – have been building for several years.\n\"The government's actions to me were concerning because it was clear they were trying to stimulate the equity market some time ago by deleveraging their balance sheet and getting consumers in a more positive frame of mind,\" he says. \"Now you come to today and it's clear the government is behind the curve – they are trying to catch up to where the market is.\"\nBiggest two-day gain Shanghai recovered on Thursday and Friday to post its biggest two-day gain since the global financial crisis.\nBut Bertoli says the fallout from the government's interference in the market has vindicated PM Capital's decision not to follow other Australians such as Platinum Asset Management and AMP and invest directly in China A shares, which are listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges.\nInstead, PM Capital prefers to invest in Chinese stocks that hold listings in the more stable Hong Kong market, known as China's H-shares.\n\"People can argue it's a positive thing the government is propping up the market in China but do you want to be an investor where the government is manipulating the market day to day? There's none of the safeguards you would normally expect, so for us Hong Kong is the smarter choice,\" Bertoli says.\nWhile the regulatory setting might be safer, there has also been a level of contagion that has flown through to Asia's financial capital and beyond.\nBertoli points to the volatility that has hit some of PM's China stocks, listed in either Hong Kong or New York. These include Chinese search giant Baidu, financial services firm HSBC, instant noodle maker Tingyi, Beijing Airport and energy logistics firm Sinopec Kanton, whose share prices halved in the past week.\nBuying opportunities Bertoli says the sharp price moves have created buying opportunities, given in his view the fundamentals of the China growth story remain intact. PM increased its holdings in HSBC, Baidu and Sinopec Kantons in the past few weeks, confident they remain strong businesses that can handle structural changes in the Chinese economy.\n\"If I look at Sinopec Kantons falling 50 per cent in a week, to me their share price is not acting with underlying fundamentals,\" he says. \"So we see an opportunity there. The focus remains very much on trying to pick great businesses and take advantage of short-term cyclical sentiment.\"\nBertoli's eye for a bargain has led to some impressive returns for his investors. Under his watch, the PM Capital Asian Companies Fund has returned 234.8 per cent since it was created in July 2008, compared with the MSCI's index of Asia shares outside Japan, which is up 79.3 per cent over the same period.\nPM creates different strategies for its investments, which are spread across global, Asian and Australian equities plus fixed income.\nWhile the global fund, created by PM founder Paul Moore, focuses on housing exposed investments including banks , the Asian fund was created to capture investor demand for exposure to domestic consumption stocks that had historically been overlooked in favour of fixed-asset investment or technology plays.\n\"We saw a great opportunity to tap into that consumption story and invest in the sort of core business you'd buy in Europe, the US and Australia.\"\nBertoli grew up in Waikerie, a small South Australian citrus and vineyard town home to just a few thousand people. With his parents running a viticulture business, his initial interest in the world of finance came from watching how a home business worked.\nInterested in the mechanics \"I wasn't necessarily a kid that sat there at 5.55 and waited for the BHP and Rio stock prices to come up on the TV screen but I was definitely interested in the mechanics of how a business operated,\" he says. \"And I think that's the great thing about this industry and this business particularly. You're like a watch maker – looking at how pieces of a watch fit together, but we're just doing it on a corporate level.\"\nBertoli remembers hearing of Moore in 2004. The head of PM Capital was one of the largest shareholders in the Burswood casino in Western Australia and held out for some time against PBL chairman James Packer for a better takeover price from the now gaming tycoon.\nThe takeover battle piqued Bertoli's interest. He applied for a job at PM several years later, in 2006, once his studies had concluded, and has worked there ever since.\n\"When I joined PM said Asia was something they really wanted to focus on, so I was given that opportunity to go out and make that area my own.\"\nBertoli has maintained his focus on consumption-led stocks and in a nod to the Burswood investment also likes gaming stocks, including those with exposure to Macau. Despite recent volatility in the region, he sees the Asian fund as a long-term offering.\n\"Asia is a market we want to have an allocation to over the next 10, 15 or 20 years. Obviously markets across the region get caught up in the news flow around China. But we're not running around pulling our hair out. We remain very comfortable with the businesses we're invested in.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/perrybwilliams"], "published": "2015-07-12T14:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T14:50:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
