Photo: Reuters\nGoldman Sachs Group reported its smallest quarterly profit in nearly four years on Thursday as it set aside more than $1 billion to cover potential mortgage settlements, and nervous investors pulled back from bond trading.\nThe bank set aside $US1.45 billion for mortgage-related legal costs and regulatory matters, five times as much as in the second quarter last year.\nGoldman is among the banks targeted by a federal-state working group to go after misconduct in the pooling and sale of mortgage securities in the run-up to the financial crisis.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co has already agreed to settle for $US13 billion, Bank of America Corp for $US16.65 billion and Citigroup for $US7 billion.\nAdvertisement Goldman and arch rival Morgan Stanley, which reports results on Monday, are next in line for potential settlements, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\"That's one significant ... legacy item that we look forward to getting behind us,\" Goldman's chief financial officer, Harvey Schwartz, said on a conference call on Thursday.\nThe Wall Street bank's shares were down 1.3 per cent at $US210.16 in afternoon trading, even though the earnings - when excluding the provision - exceeded the average analyst estimate.\nAs with its competitors, Goldman's trading business - long a strength for the bank - came under pressure as worries about Greece and China made investors reluctant to trade.\nNet revenue from trading fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities (FICC) fell 28 per cent to $US1.60 billion.\nIn comparison, JPMorgan's FICC revenue fell 10 per cent during the period on an adjusted basis, while Bank of America's fell 9.3 per cent.\nThe business, which once contributed about 40 per cent of Goldman's revenue, has been under pressure since the financial crisis as new rules discourage banks from trading off their own balance sheet and regulators demand that banks boost capital.\nOther banks have shifted away from trading to focus on less-volatile businesses like wealth management, but Goldman executives have stressed the bank's commitment to trading.\nStill, the business accounted for only about 18 per cent of revenue in the quarter.\n\"Obviously the news around Greece has been very positive in the last couple of days so hopefully some of the trends are behind us,\" Schwartz said.\nGoldman's investment banking revenue, which includes advising on deals and underwriting debt and stock offerings, rose 13 per cent to $US2.02 billion, helped by higher fees.\nGoldman ranked No. 1 in global mergers and acquisitions as well as in equity underwriting in the first half of 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nThe bank's net profit attributable to shareholders more than halved to $US916 million, or $US1.98 per share, in the three months to June 30, from $US1.95 billion, or $US4.10 per share, a year earlier. The surprisingly large provision reduced earnings by $US2.77 per share, the bank said.\nExcluding the provision, Goldman would have earned $US4.75 per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $US3.89 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nRevenue fell nearly 1 per cent to $US9.07 billion.\n\"Sometimes you expect them to do better just because they have such a strong brand,\" said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer at First American Trust, which has $US1.1 billion under management. \"I guess you can't do that every time.\"\nGoldman's results contrasted to those of Citigroup, which reported its highest quarterly profit in eight years on Thursday as legal expenses plunged and restructuring and cost cuts paid off.\nThe bank's operating expenses rose 16 per cent to $US7.34 billion, while total non-compensation expenses rose 48 per cent to $US3.53 billion.\nCompensation and benefit costs fell 3 per cent to $US3.81 billion, representing 42 percent of revenue. That compared with 43 per cent in the year-earlier quarter. However, staff numbers increased 8 per cent to 34,900.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:33:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
