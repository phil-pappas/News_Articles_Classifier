Another is to encourage women to advocate for themselves.\nAlthough in the past seven years women's awareness of heart disease has improved from 20 to 36 per cent, achieving behavioural change is a long-haul matter, says Doyle.\nIn comparable western countries women's awareness is around 50 per cent.\nThe first step for women is to recognise risk factors, but nine in ten women with high cholesterol are unaware of it. And two in every three with high blood pressure don't know it.\nNext is to recognise symptoms. There's a confounding issue here because heart disease in women appears in more subtle and diffuse ways.\nJust look at Leonie Fryar's story to see how hard recognition can be.\nMost women don't know about non-chest-pain symptoms such as jaw, shoulder, neck and back pain.\nThey also don't know about other symptoms easily interpreted as non-cardiac such as nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, indigestion, dizziness and fatigue.\nAs a consequence, when they experience them, they don't act as quickly as men who are more likely to have conventional symptoms such as crushing chest pain behind the breastbone or a tight band around the chest.\nWhile 52 per cent of men are likely to react to symptoms by seeking medical attention, the figure for women is 39 per cent. Women, however, are more likely to tell a friend or a family member.\nWhen women finally get to hospital, they hit speed bumps. While men are usually fast tracked, women wait longer and diagnosis is often delayed.\n\"Some of this is about the way women present and the way they describe their symptoms which are often atypical,\" Doyle says.\nFollowing diagnosis, women face further bumps.\n\"We know what happens after this but we don't know why. Not having enough evidence is one the biggest problems for us in trying to change practice,\" she says.\nResearch into the \"time to treatment\" of women presenting with heart attacks shows gender as an independent determinant of delay in diagnosis and treatment.\nThere is some evidence that diagnostic procedures may not demonstrate the same sensitivity in female heart disease.\nIn Australian hospitals women have fewer procedures such as coronary angiography which uses dye and x-rays to show the insides of the coronary arteries.\nOne study showed while 24 in every 100 women had this, the number for men was 30.\nWhile stents are given in 16 per 100 hospitalisations for women, for men it's 22.\nAnd men get almost double the bypass procedures. On every measure, it seems women are disadvantaged.\n\"The total healthcare expenditure on women with heart disease is less than half of that spent on men, \" says Doyle.\n\"Even when you allow for the greater number of men hospitalised, 20 per cent more is spent per person on men per hospital stay.\"\nAnd the bias reaches into rehabilitation with a recent survey showing women are less likely to be referred to cardiac rehabilitation and less likely to complete the program when enrolled.\nThis gender disparity is reflected in the death rate. Each year 36,000 men and 19,000 women are admitted to hospital after a heart attack.\nBut despite the difference in admission numbers, each year almost the same number – 4,541 men and 4,070 women – die from their heart attack.\n\"The story of women and heart disease is complex and there are many gaps in our understanding, \" says Doyle.\nShe notes a disparity in clinical trials too, where males are the predominant participants. Even preclinical research on cells and animals shows a male preference.\nWhile the participation of women is complicated by hormonal fluctuations and child bearing, an attempt is now under way to promote female participation, particularly in cardiovascular research, in the United States.\nDiane Fatkin​, professor at Sydney's Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, says there are biological and behavioural gender differences in coronary heart disease.\nThe differences only began to be recognised in the past decade.\nShe says as most clinical trials for heart attack risk factors and management were done in men, it wasn't until people starting looking at the outcome in women that they realised there was a disparity.\nThe biological disparities occur because, in general, men tend to have more severe disease, typically with major blockages in one or more of the large arteries supplying the heart muscle.\nWomen, often have more diffuse disease that affects the smaller vessels which may include not only atherosclerotic​ plaques but other changes such as spasm, tears, or thickening of the blood vessel walls.\nFatkin says trials are traditionally conducted on men because it is considered methodologically efficient as they apparently have more severe disease.\n\"The data is now telling us women do worse with coronary heart disease but it begs the 'behavioural' question,\" she says.\n\"If all things were equal and women presented to hospital and were treated with revascularisation with the same time duration as men, it would be interesting to see if there were differences in the salvage of myocardium [heart muscle]. I don't recall seeing any data like that.\"\nShe says if a woman is having a heart attack, a diagnosis will eventually be made, but in the acute phase delay can be critical.\nFailure to recognise the symptoms and doing other investigations can mean delay which can mean more damage to heart muscle.\nAfterwards, although men and women receive the same advice regarding rehabilitation, she says women are less likely to take the six weeks because of family and other responsibilities.\nThese same responsibilities often impact on the time on the time women allocate to improving their lifestyle in order to prevent a second heart event.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110990585086401178539/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/jillmargo1"], "published": "2015-07-28T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T23:02:50.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
