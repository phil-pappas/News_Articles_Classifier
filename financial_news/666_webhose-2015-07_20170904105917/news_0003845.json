Billionaire James Packer descends on Las Vegas for one of the biggest party nights of the year.\nLas Vegas is an extremely competitive market and we don't underestimate the competition in any way.\nTodd Nisbet, Crown executive vice-president The once reclusive gaming tycoon has hired a floor at the exclusive Mirage Villas, and is celebrating Independence Day with a high-profile entourage including new girlfriend Mariah Carey and Hollywood film producer Brett Ratner.\nFrom the Mirage rooftop deck, Packer can glimpse an empty 14-hectare lot where he hopes to make his mark on the world's most famous gambling strip. It is here he wants to build a new luxury resort, dubbed Alon Las Vegas, scheduled to open in 2018.\nSin City is unfinished business for Packer.\n\"You can't be in the gaming industry and not have a special reverence for Las Vegas – that's where it all began,\" Packer said last year.\nVegas is one part of a bulging pipeline of casino projects around the world that could stretch over $13 billion that also features massive Asian and Australian projects.\nSo large are the plans that the next few years will go a long way to defining the 47-year-old Packer, the half owner and chairman of Crown Resorts, and his success as a global casino operator.\nIt will take some doing, nowhere more so than in Vegas. Building a new casino here remains a risky bet for Australia's fourth richest man.\n\"No one is building resorts from the ground up in Vegas at the moment,\" says John Restrepo, principal with Las Vegas consultancy RCG Economics.\n\"That's where the risk takers like Packer are making the biggest leap. They will essentially be the canaries in the coal mine. If these things go well the Nevada resorts might jump in, but if they struggle all bets are off.\"\nAll up Packer could spend $US10 billion on casinos by the end of this decade, according to one estimate from Deutsche Bank. Others tip the total spend at more than $13 billion.\nWell before then there are some key milestones looming. A new casino will soon open in the world's largest gaming hub, Macau, while Crown will discover by the end of the month whether a $2 billion bid to run the Queen's Wharf complex in Brisbane is successful.\nThen there's Crown Sydney, at Barangaroo, whose roulette wheels are set to spin from late 2019.\nBut first he must replenish his reputation in Vegas.\nWhat happens in Vegas Packer has been badly burnt in the US. Two casino investments there, worth $2 billion and funded by selling Packer's stake in Channel Nine, his father's great love, were flops.\nMade just before the global financial crisis struck, they crippled cash flow and dented Packer's ambition to make Crown a global entertainment brand.\nPacker's wealth halved to a reported $3 billion in 2009 from $6.1 billion the previous year as the recession hit. Crown reported a net loss of $409 million for the first half of 2009 following massive write-downs on its North American punt.\nThe half-built Vegas Fontaine­bleau Resort, which still sits abandoned, remains a warning that in a city with 25 major casinos and dozens of smaller gambling venues, only the best will survive.\nJames Packer learnt a hard lesson with his first roll of the dice in Las Vegas. Photo: Rob Homer\nWhile bruising his reputation as a deal maker, Packer managed to regroup and slowly rebuild his wealth following the debacle.\nMuch of that has been down to the strong performance of the Melco-Crown joint venture in Macau, where companies in the last decade managed to make back their return on investment in just 18 months. But Packer also has Ratner to thank for his burgeoning clout in Hollywood entertainment circles.\nPacker and Ratner first met through Miami developer Jeffrey Soffer, Elle Macpherson's husband, who was Packer's business partner on the doomed Fontainebleau casino.\nThey became good friends, eventually forming RatPac in 2013 and sealing a lucrative financing deal with Warner Brothers covering the production of 75 movies over four years.\nSix years on, Packer has returned to the famous neon-lit casino strip cashed up and ready to take on some of the industry's biggest names.\nFinal puzzle piece If he gets it right, Vegas will represent the final jigsaw piece in Packer's plans to create a global gaming operator spanning from Melbourne to London's Mayfair via Manila and Macau.\nCrown paid $US280 million last year for the former site of the New Frontier casino, where a 21-year-old Elvis Presley made his Las Vegas debut in 1956.\nPrevious owners of the casino included billionaire Howard Hughes and Detroit mobsters.\nPacker intends to transform the dusty lot into Alon Las Vegas, one of four new casinos Crown could deliver by the end of the decade. Its existing portfolio includes Melbourne, Perth, London, Manila and two in Macau.\nThe timing and rationale this time around appears more sound.\nPart of the attraction of Vegas within the Crown camp is the prospect of being able to lure Asian high-rollers through his casino with the bells and whistles of private jets and six-star hotel rooms to keep them at the tables for a few days.\nPacker understands just how lucrative it could be for Crown's ambitions in Las Vegas if it is able to broaden its share of the Asian VIP market.\nVIP gaming is the fastest growing segment in the global gaming market, with UBS estimating global gaming revenue could reach $4400 billion by 2020.\nMacau holds a 75 per cent share of the global VIP gambling market, according to a report from another investment bank, Morgan Stanley.\nLas Vegas accounts for just 5 per cent of global VIPs, with Australia capturing only around 3 per cent\nRival across the road Across the road from the future Alon site sits Wynn Resorts, the gaming complex run by Vegas kingpin Steve Wynn, whose success Packer hopes to emulate.\nAfter announcing plans last year to build the Vegas casino by 2018, Packer has steadily been raiding Wynn's top executives as he looks to challenge the US businessman with an 1100-room integrated resort that could cost the gaming magnate more than $US4 billion.\nAfter snaring the executive who used to run Wynn's Vegas operations, Andrew Pascal, Packer has now reportedly lured the most successful US nightclub operator as part of his team.\nPacker is thought to have met with music promoter Jesse Waits during his July visit to the strip and lured him to the Alon complex with the offer of a broader entertainment role.\nWaits built the XS and Tryst club scene into one of the strip's most popular and profitable venues by securing exclusive residencies with DJs including Avicii, David Guetta, Diplo and Skrillex.\nBut it's his relationships with the Hollywood celebrity set that may have piqued Packer's interest.\nWaits' twin brother Cy used to date Paris Hilton; while Waits himself regularly poses on his Instagram account, describing a recent snap with Justin Beiber, Diplo and Kaskade at XS as his \"dream team\".\nAnother former Wynn executive and now a leading member of Packer's camp is Todd Nisbet, Crown's executive vice-president, strategy and development, who made his name by building Wynn's Bellagio and Wynn Resorts projects on the strip.\nCrown's James Packer with Todd Nisbet. Photo: Louise Kennerley\nWhile the gaming company is causing headlines with its aggressive poaching of some of the best talent in Vegas, Nisbet was reluctant to trumpet some of its early scalps.\n\"We have an executive team in Las Vegas who have worked for some of the most successful companies in the gaming industry and they understand the Las Vegas market,\" Nisbet says.\n\"That being said Las Vegas is an extremely competitive market and we don't underestimate the competition in any way.\"\nVegas remains a risky bet, even for a gambling man.\nAustralia looms large After shedding the media assets his father Kerry had turned into a multibillion-dollar empire, Packer has arrived at a critical juncture as he attempts to build Crown casinos in Sydney and Brisbane while also juggling new ventures in the world's two largest gaming hubs, Las Vegas and Macau.\nThe monopoly markets of its Melbourne casino, Australia's largest, on the banks of the Yarra River and Perth's Burswood casino continue to generate strong cash flow.\nAnd his partnership in Macau and the Philippines with Asian gaming tycoon Lawrence Ho, the son of Macau casino magnate Stanley Ho, has delivered blockbuster returns in the last decade.\nBut it's his bulging $US10 billion pipeline of projects that is dividing investors.\nThat's led some to question whether he may be stretching himself too far given poor consumer sentiment in Macau, the high upfront costs of building new casinos, and uncertainty over the level of returns.\nWhile sources close to the company have suggested it would be no bad thing if it wasn't successful with its Queen's Wharf bid, Crown maintains it has ample capacity to execute all of its planned projects.\n\"We have a manageable pipeline of projects at home and overseas and realistic construction timelines,\" Nisbet told BusinessDay.\n\"I am confident we can meet the high levels of quality and finishes that define the Crown Resorts brand.\"\nThe near-term momentum around Crown's fortunes will hinge on the success of its bid for the Queen's Wharf complex in Brisbane and the reception to its new Studio City casino in Macau.\nCrown has pitted itself against arch rival and incumbent operator Echo Entertainment in a bid to gain a second casino licence in the Queensland capital.\nCrown has partnered with Chinese state-owned developer Greenland Holdings for its bid, while Echo created a joint venture with Hong Kong-based Far East Consortium and Chinese conglomerate Chow Tai Fook to build the proposed casino, hotel and residential project.\nIn 2013 the two foes locked horns. The battleground was Sydney, where Packer waged a successful campaign to end Echo's Sydney monopoly with a hotel and high-roller casino at the harbourfront location of Barangaroo.\nThe win came two decades after Kerry Packer missed out on the original Sydney casino licence and means Echo, from 2019, will lose its position as the incumbent monopoly casino licence holder in NSW.\nIf Vegas is the missing piece in Packer's international puzzle, Crown Sydney was the glaring omission in his Australian portfolio.\nThe addition of Sydney from late 2019 gives Packer the ability to offer a network of Australian casinos to VIP gamblers, who often like to move every second night to a new property.\nThere's similar logic at play with its bid for the Queen's Wharf casino.\nAlthough it may lack the buzz of Melbourne or Sydney, it would give Packer an unrivalled offering for high-end Asian gamblers.\nWith strict probity conditions put in place by the Queensland government, there's been few public announcements by either side, with a decision due by the end of this month.\nGiven Echo has held the existing licence for the best part of 20 years, it's tipped as the frontrunner to win the new concession.\nInvestment broker CLSA said it expected Echo to win the contest, noting existing Queensland pub and club operators supported its bid, given a Crown win would result in 1500 new rival poker machines opening in the state.\nYet sources close to both camps insist it remains an even race particularly given the last-minute sweeteners Crown has included in its bid.\nCrown is thought to have approved an increased financial offering to the government, along with a buyback of poker machines from pubs and clubs in the state to work inside the cap on machines in Queensland.\nWhile Packer remains an outsider on Queen's Wharf, the launch of another $2 billion project in Macau, Studio City, shows the importance of the former Portuguese colony to Packer's ambition.\nThe VIP segment remains critical to the fortunes of any casino operator in Macau, but given the crackdown on big spenders it's tough going right now.\nThe absence of high-end gamblers removed $US1 billion from Melco Crown's VIP revenue in 2014 and it could slump by a further $US600 million this year.\nMacau moves As Macau tries to refashion itself as a family-friendly holiday destination, increasingly the mass market is also driving revenues.\nThe minimum bet in Macau can be up to $US250 a chip – more than five times as much as their peers in markets like Las Vegas or Singapore.\nAnd it's this mass market growth that analysts expect Melco Crown to tap for Studio City.\nThe new resort, tipped to open in October, is being developed as part of the Melco Crown joint venture from which Crown derives nearly 40 per cent of its earnings.\nYet the timing could barely be worse.\nBeijing's efforts to rein in fraudulent activity and illegal cash flowing across the border have hammered gambling activities in Macau, the only region in China where its citizens can legally gamble.\nThe figures make for sobering reading. Gross gaming revenue in June fell 36.2 per cent to 17.4 billion patacas ($2.8 billion), marking a 13th straight month of declines and the lowest level of revenues since 2010.\nCrown shares have endured a torrid run in the last 12 months, down 14 per cent and pulling the company's value below the $10 billion mark. Investors have been fretting over the slowdown in Macau which has outweighed the momentum generated from growth at its Melbourne and Perth casinos.\nMelco Crown, 34 per cent owned by Crown, has seen its value plunge by a third over the same period.\nCrown's main Australian rival and owner of Sydney's The Star casino, Echo Entertainment, has surged 52 per cent in the last year.\nStill Packer has already more than made his money back on Crown's existing Altira and City of Dreams casinos in Macau.\nCLSA's Hong Kong analyst Simon Zhang estimates Melco Crown's City of Dreams resort generated an impressive 50 per cent return on investment in 2013, in line with other flagship projects in Macau.\nStudio City remains a more difficult proposition. CLSA expects the investment return to be around 15 to 20 per cent.\nThat's still ahead of the odds by international standards, but a fair drop from the heady heights of five years ago when tourist numbers into Macau from China were growing at 25 per cent a year.\nOthers paint a more negative picture.\nMorgan Stanley argues the economics of the Studio City project are shaky given the resort is in effect adding extra cost in a declining market.\nThe investment bank estimates Studio City requires $US1.6 billion in annual gaming revenues to break even on a net profit basis.\nThe answer will partly hinge on Packer's bet that punters will take to not only the gaming floor but also a \"family-friendly\" entertainment offering.\nThe Studio City resort will have Warner Brothers-themed rides, a Batman flight simulator and Asia's highest ferris wheel, set between two art deco hotel towers.\nMelco Crown has been heavily promoting the entertainment mix of Studio City in Shanghai and Beijing, leading one expert to predict they might be on to a winner.\n\"We believe Studio City is the right product that suits the government agenda,\" said Zhang. \"We believe both the product type and timing of Studio City are right.\"\nFollow us on Twitter @BusinessDay More business, finance and economic news", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/PACKER2.jpg", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/PACKER4.jpg", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/PACKER3.jpg", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/PACKER1.jpg", "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/z/z/3/5/5/image.imgtype.articleLeadwide.620x349.png/1437122830952.jpg", "https://twitter.com/businessday"], "published": "2015-07-18T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:22:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
