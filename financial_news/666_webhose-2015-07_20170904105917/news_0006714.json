I just came from Tripoli yesterday. There is no violence in Tripoli.” \nIt is a bracing start to an interview about the usually reserved world of sovereign wealth funds. But AbdulMagid Breish is no ordinary fund manager, and his situation is unusually complicated. \nIn a country riven by civil war and rival governments, the Libyan Investment Authority is itself torn by competing factions . Mr Breish has an office in Tripoli where he says he is chairman of LIA, while another man, Hassan Bouhadi, runs another LIA head office from Malta , also claiming to be chairman. \nThat Maltese office was set up when Mr Bouhadi fled violence in the capital something Mr Breish denies is a problem any more. \nIt is a bitter personal dispute in the midst of a far, far wider conflict across the country. But the stakes are high, as LIA has assets totalling an estimated $67bn, funds which come from Libya’s oil wealth and are intended to be invested to aid the future prosperity of a deeply distressed nation. \nMr Breish was appointed to head the sovereign wealth fund in 2013, and says he won the job by promising the Prime Minister he could use his 35 years in banking across the Arab world to reform a corrupt institution. \nHowever, under a law designed to keep former Gaddafi cronies from public office, Mr Breish was removed placed under investigation and stepped down in 2014. \n“I did not agree with that, and I appealed to the higher court in Tripoli. The court took about 11 months, and said no, this law does not apply to Mr Breish,” he says, speaking from his lawyers’ offices in the City of London (LSE: CIN.L - news ) . “So procedurally, I go back to my position. I was appointed and I had just stepped aside until the court looked into it.” \nIn the meantime a temporary chairman was appointed, and then in October 2014 the board of trustees of LIA appointed Mr Bouhadi to the job. \nFollowing the court ruling, Mr Breish said he should be reappointed to the post. But Mr Bouhadi, who has the backing of the board of trustees and the internationally recognised government in Tobruck, disagreed. \nThe Maltese office argues there are several holes in Mr Breish’s argument, that the court ruling is mistaken, and that it is based on a law that has in any case been repealed. \nMr Breish claims the court order must stand and that LIA has a duty to enforce it. \nThe result is deadlock at the top of an organisation which is supposed to help manage tens of billions of dollars for the good of Libya’s war-torn population. \nThe sovereign wealth fund was set up in 2006 under Colonel Gaddafi to manage Libya's oil wealth (Credit: EPA) \nRoughly half of LIA’s assets are in cash, equities and other relatively liquid securities. However, of those, 80pc are subject to sanctions from the Western world freezing them and preventing active management. \nMuch of the remaining assets are in the form of around 550 businesses set up by LIA, from hotels in Egypt, to joint ventures in Zimbabwe. Mr Breish says he wants to sell or shut the inefficient firms and keep those with potential to make good returns. \nBut he can do little while LIA is divided and the government in Tobruk backs the rival chairman. \nSimilarly, Mr Breish speaks fondly of a plan from 2013 and 2014 to reform LIA into a more modern organisation. \n“I don’t think Libya has the capability to manage in-house a sovereign wealth fund like the Norwegians or the Kuwaitis. We are probably five or ten years away from that,” he says. “We will start the way they started, by outsourcing the funds to professional managers, and then your people can be trained and get into the business so we can start managing it.” \nHis plan even extends to building a substantial London office. \n“If you want the right type of skills to do the documents and the fine print, you need the law firms next to you, the specialists to do the research on who are the best of breed [fund managers], and the technology… all of that is in the City,” he says, using jargon reminiscent of the consultants LIA hired to work on the restructuring. \nBut there is little chance of managing any structural reforms when there is such deadlock. The small London office is closed because of the dispute, with LIA’s UK staff currently working from home. \nInstead, Mr Breish is largely reduced to fighting legal actions in an attempt to win back money he says foreign finance firms snaffled by taking advantage of incompetent Libyan officials. \nThe most high profile cases involve Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) and Societe Generale (Paris: FR0000130809 - news ) , both of whom deny any wrongdoing and are fighting the claims, with Goldman arguing LIA did have experienced bankers on its side. \nMr Breish is determined that he will fight a host of cases with claims totalling $5bn tooth and nail. \n“I have always said we will spare no effort to pursue these cases. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) when people said there was a slim chance that I might make a comeback, or that the country was in civil war and anarchy everyone would forget about it… no chance,” he says. “We have set aside enough money from day one to pursue these cases to the very end. It is a matter of principle, it is no longer a matter of lost money or lost opportunities. It doesn’t matter how much it costs. We have laid out enough money for this to keep it going for years to come.” \nThat has to be his main focus for now, as there is no resolution in sight to the deadlock with Mr Bouhadi to allow him to carry out most of his other plans. \nMr Breish hopes a unity government could be formed by competing factions in the coming months, which could resolve his dispute at LIA. He thinks it could be formed in the coming months, and make a decision on a new board of trustees who could decide on the chairman towards the end of the year. \nHowever there is no guarantee that a government will be formed. And in any case, his appointment in 2013 came with a fixed three-year term so regardless of the court order in his favour, there is no certainty of his reappointment. \nCould he really be the undisputed chairman this time next year? \n“I don’t know. It is the responsibility of the next Prime Minister,” he admits. But Mr Breish clearly has no intention of stepping aside before then.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T11:19:32.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
