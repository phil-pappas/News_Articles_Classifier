The company held meetings with hundreds of people and encouraged illiterate citizens to sign away their land rights when community support groups were staying home for risk of contagion. At this time GVL almost doubled the size of its plantation. \nThis behavior hasn't discouraged the world's major banks from offering their services. The report said Standard Chartered, HSBC, and Citibank alone hold shares in GVL's parent company - Golden Agri-Resources (GAR) - worth nearly US$1.5 billion. \n\"The case of GVL risks becoming the first chapter of a longer narrative of dispossession and abuse. Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf has made agriculture a central pillar of the country's development strategy, making repeated - yet so far unfulfilled - public assurances that palm oil will lift poverty in rural areas. In response to early protests at GVL's plantation she called those who spoke out against the company \"unpatriotic\" as they risked discouraging future investors,\" the global watchdog indicated. \nTherefore, Global Witness is calling on the Liberian government to investigate acts of violence, pass a law recognising that rural communities own their land, and regulate the country's agriculture sector to bring an end to the impunity enjoyed by plantation companies. \nAccording to the report released 23 July 2015, GVL has bought the rights to convert 2,600 km2 of southeast Liberia into an oil palm estate - an area the size of London and Barcelona combined. Its contract is valid for up to 98 years, affecting some 41,000 people. This is the first time its parent company GAR has expanded outside its home country Indonesia, where it has an appalling track record for human rights abuses, land grabbing, and environmental devastation. \n\"Liberia is rolling out the red carpet to a company that has swindled communities, forcibly grabbed land and chain-sawed its way through rainforests in Asia,\" said Global Witness campaign leader Jonathan Gant. \n\"With the company's first foray into Africa, at the peak of the continent's deadliest Ebola epidemic, it is has manipulated villagers into signing away the lands they depend on. This will affect at least five generations of families who will likely never see their land returned to them,\" Gant narrated. \nGlobal Witness also disclosed that public meetings where landowners were encouraged to hand over their land to GVL were watched over by powerful local officials, and in at least one case armed police. Global Witness says it has also documented several accounts of violent assaults and arbitrary arrests of those who voiced their concerns, events in which the company claims it played no part. \nThe international rights group observed that the benefits offered by GVL to communities in return have been negligible. It said that those willing to work for the company are promised access to free medical support and schools, and that for non-employees, the most tangible negotiated benefits Global Witness could find evidence of were six toilets. \n\"Palm oil risks becoming Liberia's snake oil. Just as con men in the United States sold fake snake oil as medicine, pretending it had magical healing qualities, palm oil developers are selling Liberians what may turn out to be false promises of a better future. They are tricking communities into giving up the land they rely on for food and livelihoods and giving them very little, if anything, in return,\" said Gant. \nTen percent of Liberia is now earmarked for agricultural plantations - an area three times the size of Beijing. This rapid expansion is taking place in a legal vacuum. However, GW found that there are no laws in Liberia to govern how agriculture companies should be awarded contracts, how they should operate, or how they will be held to account. \n\"It is unacceptable to view the well-being of tens of thousands of people as inferior to an investment contract,\" said Gant. \"Development is not development if it involves robbing the country's poorest citizens of their land. If Liberians are to benefit from palm oil they must be free to choose for or against it, and have the information and support they need to negotiate on their own terms. Until that time, the government should stop Golden Veroleum from expanding onto new land, and set a precedent for the other foreign companies poised to cash in on Liberia's vast natural wealth.\" \nThe group uncovered suspicious payments by GVL to local elites suggested that they are getting a better deal. \nGlobal Witness said between August and October 2014, when the Ebola outbreak was at its peak, GVL signed MOUs covering 134 km2 of community land. Prior to the outbreak the company had signed MOUs covering 166 km2. Between April and December 2014, GVL used bulldozers to expand its plantation over 54 km2. In the three years prior to this, GVL had only cleared a total of 58 km2. GVL has stated that its activities in 2014 were part of its long-term plan. \nAccording to GAR's shareholder listings, Standard Chartered holds US$ 710 million in GAR stock, HSBC holds US$ 409 million, and Citibank holds US$ 358 million - together almost one third of the company's shares. Representatives of HSBC and Citibank state that these shares are held \"in custody\" for other ultimate (beneficial) shareholders.
