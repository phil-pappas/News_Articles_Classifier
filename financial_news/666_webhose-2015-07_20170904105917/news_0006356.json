Association of British Insurers (ABI) said nearly a quarter of a million payments in April and May were from pension pots. \nIn the same period £1.3bn was put in to buying almost 22,000 regular income products, with more than 50% of this going into income drawdown products rather than annuities. \nIn 2012, when annuity sales were at their peak, more than 90% of the total value of sales was annuities. Less than 10% of total sales were income drawdown sales. \nRetirees who were table to take out cash lump sum payments under the new open market option (OMO) rules withdrew more than £1bn in 65,000 cash withdrawals. \nA fall in individual annuity sales of roughly half compared to 2012 was, analysts said, considerably better than had been feared. \nABI director of long terms savings policy Yvonne Braun said the data highlighted an increase in the number of people putting money into income drawdown products that can take advantage of the new freedoms. \n\"The data shows people with smaller pots tend to be cashing them out while those with larger pots tend to be buying a regular income product. \n\"We are just three months into the biggest overhaul in pensions for a generation which was introduced in only one year, so some issues remain that need to be worked through, in particular around financial advice,\" Braun said in a statement. \nA circa-50% decline in individual annuity sales compared to 2012 view is \"considerably better than many of the doom-mongers had predicted\", said analyst Barrie Cornes at Panmure Gordon. \nHe felt the data would bode very well for the likes of Partnership Assurance and Just Retirement (LSE: JRG.L - news ) , which are likely to additionally benefit from what in effect will be a significant hike in the number of people taking the OMO.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:22:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
