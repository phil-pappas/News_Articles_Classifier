(Photo: Business Wire) All of Hilton’s more than 4,350 managed, franchised, owned and leased hotels and timeshare properties, as well as offices, were eligible to develop and submit a project for consideration. This year, 420 teams developed applications to support local projects that provide unique engagement opportunities for local teams and creative approaches to address social and environmental challenges. These projects align with the company’s four focus areas: creating opportunities for individuals to reach their full potential; strengthening local communities; celebrating cultures and the positive impact of travel; and living sustainably through the measurement, analysis and improvement of the use of natural resources. “Our teams in more than 4,000 communities around the world are proud to contribute local ideas and solutions to global challenges,” said Jennifer Silberman, vice president of corporate responsibility for Hilton Worldwide. “The Travel with Purpose Action Grants program provides a vehicle for our hotels and offices to work with local community organizations and develop approaches that make the best use of hotel and community resources. Our teams are invested in their communities’ success and communities need businesses that are committed to making a positive impact. We see it as a win-win opportunity for everyone.” Leveraging a network of more than 1,100 community and sustainability hotel champions around the world, teams worked together to research and develop projects that would benefit the local community and drive business objectives. The scope of winning projects includes reducing food waste to help fight hunger; educating young people on water conservation; building composting and greenhouse facilities to support hotel micros gardens; delivering life skills and entrepreneurial training for underserved women; and creating mentorship programs for young people entering the hospitality industry. 2015 Travel with Purpose Action Grant Recipients", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T01:15:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
