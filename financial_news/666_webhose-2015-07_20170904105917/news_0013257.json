We will not sit still and allow this to happen.\" \nMine supporters tout its expected benefits, including about 3,700 jobs and $60 billion in economic impacts. \nProject spokeswoman Jennifer Russo said the company was committed to involving tribal members and has reached out to \"open the lines of communication and work cooperatively to address the issues.\" \nThe battle lines were set in December when President Barack Obama approved the exchange of 2,400 acres (970 hectares) deemed sacred to Native Americans and precious to environmentalists. \nThe exchange was tucked into a defense spending bill and supported by members of Arizona's delegation including former Republican presidential contender John McCain, who called the bi-partisan bill a \"game-changer\" for the area. \nHe also said in a statement last month that no tribal land or land designated as sacred by the U.S. Interior Department was involved and that the legislation includes key concessions to address opponents' concerns. \nOrganizers said plans call for the caravan to stop at Native American reservations nationwide, adding to its ranks along the way. The goal is for 1,000 people to descend on the lawn in front of the U.S. Capitol on July 21, Rambler said. \n\"We're the first Americans, and our voices need to be heard and they will be heard,\" she said.
