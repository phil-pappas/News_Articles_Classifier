Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nA plan to send up to 1 million live cattle to China is unlikely to offset the dramatic reduction in Indonesian exports, industry participants predict.\nAgriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce signed off on key protocols this week to open up China to the live cattle trade.\nIt came after Indonesia, which accounts for about 56 per cent of Australia's $1.3 billion live export market, said it would only take 50,000 head of cattle in the next three months, down from 250,000 for the same period in 2014.\nThis has left Northern Territory farmers scrambling to find a market for 150,000 cattle. But the Chinese deal may not be the answer.\nWhile the China agreement has the potential to more than double Australia's live export market – injecting up to another $2 billion a year into the economy – industry participants said it could take years to establish.\n\"This isn't something we are looking to put big numbers on boats tomorrow. It's going to be a long, slow build,\" said Alison Penfold, the chief executive of the Australian Livestock Exporters Council.\n\"But we are certainly ambitious for this to be a long-term, sustainable trade, and who knows where that could take us.\"\nMs Penfold said Australian exporters need to establish commercial relationships with Chinese customers, as well as ensure animal welfare was maintained from paddock to slaughterhouse.\nShe also said China would most likely to seek to import cattle ready for slaughter, as opposed to Indonesia, which buys younger and lighter animals to fatten up.\n\"The China market, for a variety of reasons, is more likely to be a slaughter market in the short term at least.\"\nElders International general manager Cameron Hall said sending 1 million head of cattle to China was an admirable but long-term goal.\n\"It's not achievable in the short term,\" he said.\nAlthough Indonesia slashed its import quota, Mr Hall said there was a \"very tight supply situation for livestock around the country\". This means the 150,000 cattle that were destined for Indonesia will find another market, particularly as global beef prices remain high.\nIt also means it will take time for Australian beef producers to increase supply.\nNevertheless, Mr Hall said the first shipments to China could begin within months. He said Elders has been in talks with Chinese customers and investigating local supply chains, including abattoirs, for several months.\n\"We have been impressed with the quality of infrastructure … and are confident the trade will commence in a compliant and capable manner quite quickly.\n\"A lot of the facilities are mechanised and quite new, of Western and European design.\"\nMr Hall said the agreement could also offer dairy farmers additional income after global milk prices fell to a six-year low.\n\"The long-term dairy outlook is still strong despite the immediate market pressures.\n\"However, what you could see is the opportunity to value-add to young dairy bull calves, male calves … which might otherwise be sold as bobby veal. You could see the growing out of those animals.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T15:12:20.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
