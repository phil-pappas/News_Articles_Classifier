They include firms such as Danone (Paris: FR0000120644 - news ) , Airbus and LVMH. \nFrench manufacturer PSA Peugeot Citroen, which quit Iran, its second-largest market, in early 2012, is discussing a renewed partnership with IranKhodro. \nPSA said that the nuclear agreement \"should allow significant progress in ongoing discussions\". \nGermany's BDI industry federation believes exports to Iran could rise four-fold to more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) in the medium-term, up from 2.4 billion in 2014, thanks to the need to modernise industry, especially the oil sector. \nItalian exports -- which stood at 1.15 billion euros before the sanctions, led by machine tool sales -- could reach four billion euros in 2018, according to estimates from export credit company Sace quoted in the Italian press. \n- 'Bloated bureaucracy' - \nFor major companies a priority is for Iran to be reconnected to the global network of SWIFT banking transactions to enable companies present in Iran to transfer funds directly to and from that country. \nOne area in need of urgent investment is the creaking oil sector. \nIran, which has the world's fourth-biggest oil reserves, has seen its production fall to less than three million barrels per day (bpd) since 2012. \nIts oil exports have roughly halved to about 1.3 million bpd, from 2.5 million bpd in 2011. \nIran also has the world's largest reserves of gas and was the number four producer last year. \n\"Our priority is to develop our oil and gas fields using domestic and foreign potential,\" Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said. \nHe said his country wanted to \"accelerate\" the development of the petrochemical industry, but experts said foreign energy companies face numerous hurdles. \n\"Although the deal will present foreign oil and gas companies in particular with a broad range of opportunities, the operating environment in a post-sanctions Iran will almost certainly remain challenging,\" said Torbjorn Soltvedt, an analyst with Verisk Maplecroft. \n\"While Iran has committed to improving the fiscal terms offered to oil and gas companies, the country's petroleum bureaucracy remains bloated and inefficient.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T08:08:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
