Luckily, your credit card may be able to ease your woes. \nSome cards offer a great perk called price protection, which means that if you find out that the price of item you bought with your card has fallen within a certain time frame (usually 60 to 90 days), you could get refunded for the difference. \nIt's a good idea to read the fine print carefully to see if your card excludes certain types of purchases, such as Internet purchases, cars, jewelry, personalized items and antiques. You'll typically also have to file a claim and include copies of the original merchant receipt as well as the ad showing that the item you purchased is now sold at a lower price. \nExtended warranty \nAre you in the market for a new watch, electronic device or appliance? Although your salesperson might try to convince you to fork over more cash for an extended warranty , you might already have that extra protection without even realizing it. \nAfter the manufacturer's warranty expires on a product, many credit cards will extend your warranty protection, usually for up to a year. That means that if your new TV dies a day after the manufacturer's warranty ends, you'll be covered. \nReturn protection \nHave you ever tried to return an item to a store, only to be told that the window to take it back has expired? If it happens again, your credit card may be able to help you out. \nSome cards offer what's called return protection, which means that if you try to return an item to a store within a certain time frame (usually within 60 to 90 days of purchase) and the merchant refuses to take it back, your credit card issuer may give you a refund. Be sure to read your card's benefits statement closely for details on exclusions and restrictions, as well as instructions on how to file a claim. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T16:19:20.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
