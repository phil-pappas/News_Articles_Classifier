Nic Walker Share on twitter by James Thomson Veteran investor Kerr Neilson has questioned the Chinese government's \"apparent lack of poise\" during the recent sharemarket crash and admits he is still grappling with when to dive back into the market.\nMr Neilson, chief executive of Platinum Asset Management, said in a market update to investors that the government might have exacerbated the selling that has seen the Shanghai market fall 30 per cent from its peak over recent weeks.\n\"The disturbing feature is the government's apparent loss of poise,\" Mr Neilson said. \"Several measures have been rolled out in quick succession, including the suspension of IPOs, easier margin regulations and direct market intervention.\n\"By providing support to parts of the market, the government may have unwittingly encouraged investors to liquidate while there is a propping buyer.\"\nHowever, Mr Neilson said the market remains about 14 per cent higher than at the start of the year \"and above our portfolio entry levels\" suggesting Platinum is still in front on its Chinese investments.\n\"We take comfort from the business economics surrounding our holdings, which have noticeably outperformed in this sell-off,\" Mr Neilson told investors.\nOn Monday, China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index gained for the third straight day, rising 2.4 per cent to close at 3970. The Shenzhen Composite Index was up 4.8 per cent and the ChiNext, a board for high-tech firms and start-ups, finished the day 5.8 per cent higher.\nIn a positive for Australia's market and economy, Mr Neilson also said Platinum's house view was that the Chinese sharemarket crash was unlikely to damage the country's growth prospects in a \"meaningful\" way and emphasised that Platinum had already taken a conservative view of Chinese growth.\n \"We had already factored in a weaker economy (more like 4 per cent to 5 per cent growth than the targeted 7 per cent per cent) and a sharp rise in non-performing bank loans. None of these outcomes seem likely to surprise sophisticated investors.\"\nLike many investors still positive about Chinese growth, Mr Neilson admitted that the firm is still grappling with the question of whether this is a dip worth buying. For the moment, he remains cautious.\n\"The question we face today is when to add to positions. Around our earlier entry levels would be ideal, but we can see concerns being raised as to how this rout may cause damage to an economy grappling with economic change.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mrjthomson"], "published": "2015-07-14T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T05:09:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
