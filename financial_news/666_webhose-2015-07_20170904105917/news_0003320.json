CHRIS BJORNBERG by Jill Margo A new study has raised concern about mixing two commonly used medications.\nIt has uncovered a link between antidepressants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and bleeding in the brain.\nPublished in the British Medical Journal , the study showed the risk of a bleed was elevated within 30 days of taking both drugs simultaneously.\nIt suggested the risk may be considerably higher in those treated for longer.\nAlthough both antidepressants and NSAIDs raise the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, they have not previously been linked to intracranial bleeding when used alone.\nNow this large South Korean study has shown cause for concern, particularly because conditions requiring NSAIDs and antidepressants commonly co-exist.\nThis retrospective study was designed to define the risk when these two drug classes were used together.\nIt looked at more than four million people and found the combination was associated with a substantially increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage, compared with antidepressant treatment alone.\n Risk is expressed in different ways. This study found the combination increased the risk of a bleed by 60 per cent.\nExpressed as an absolute risk, it showed a patient was at 0.05 risk in the first 30 days of combined treatment.\nMen, it seemed, were at higher risk than women.\nAn editorial in the BMJ said this study had important implications for prescribing, particularly in the elderly and in the socially disadvantaged.\nBut it noted the results may not necessarily apply to all races, because of ethnic variations in the metabolism of the two medicines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:04:24.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
