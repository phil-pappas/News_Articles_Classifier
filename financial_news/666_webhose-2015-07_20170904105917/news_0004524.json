Every investor, even an investor from Mars, when they come to earth, they will be coming because there are resources to be exploited. And when you come to invest, it is because you want to attract value, you want to earn profit,\" he said \n\"We are hoping that the Chinese government can facilitate for Chinese investors to come and invest, we are hoping that the Chinese government can also put resources available to investors to come and invest in Zambia,\" he added. \nThe minister further called for the promotion of joint ventures between Zambian and Chinese investor. \nXinhua", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T16:27:48.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
