In his days as a worker in the civil service of a state, honesty was not as rare a quality as it is now. \nWork ethic \nBesides this honesty, people had a strong work ethic. And given the low remuneration for their efforts-something that hasn't changed- it didn't surprise many who were closely watching when the standards and quality of the individuals manning key positions in the civil service dropped. \nThe politicization of the recruitment process of the civil service endured, and appointments into key positions were not earned by merit , but came out of familiarity with top officials. Hence the standards began to drop like flowers in evenings. \nMy father, an incurable optimist, encouraged me to join the civil service, despite my desire to follow a different path. His reasons were simple: there were no better jobs out there, and if things were to change for the better in this country, then why not start with leaders of tomorrow? So I obliged. \nRigid system \nThe journey as a civil servant has been tough and challenging. I have seen several loopholes in the decades old system. For instance, the use of precolonial filing systems and the inability of those in authority to allow the adoption of new technology to enhance service delivery. However, contributions from a middle level administrator will hardly yield any fruit. \n'Give it a few more years, you will be in charge and in a better position to make decisions or at least make suggestions to the ruling class', says my father. \nRecently, based on the dwindling oil revenues of the federal government of Nigeria, the allocations to state government have been halved; one of the things many people have interpreted as coping mechanisms by the overstretched government. \nWhile these efforts have been applauded in several fronts, they have left many state governments- and some federal government parastatals- in big trouble, because of their inability to pay the salaries of their workers. \nForesight \nStates like Lagos and Rivers state, with huge returns on their internally generated revenue, have been able to cope without this federal allocation. But what happens to states like Osun, which chiefly depend on the federal allocation to pay the salaries of their workers and carry out developmental projects, is sickening. \nDue to a lack of foresight by the government of Osun state, civil servants have had to endure several months without their salaries, with clamouring all over the country for federal government intervention to help save these people. In a country where there is a government, this should not happen. \nIn Ogun State, where the governor struggles to pay the salary at the end of every second month, workers have felt the pinch. I should know, as I am one of them. We are expected to have no other source of income outside our jobs, but the salary itself is so small that you can barely survive a month on it. \nIf we, who still have hope that our governor will find a way to scrape the salary out of somewhere can feel like this, how do you think the civil servants in Osun state are feeling right now? They have not been paid for the past seven months; seven whole months! Can you imagine the injustice? \nIt's only fair \nThis is unjust, unfair and heartless as far as I am concerned. I believe it is time for the federal government to intervene. The situation of civil servants in Osun State should not be allowed to remain as it is. Especially since Governor Rauf Aregbesola has said that the situation is beyond him. President Muhammadu Buhari should help look into how he can help them, probably by offering a bailout package, civil servants should not have to beg for the salaries they worked for. \nBased on the prevaling inflationary trend in the country, the upward review of the minimum wage should be revisited too, even if most state governments are yet to start paying the 18000 naira agreed minimum wage of January 2011. \nif the approved minimum wage is calculated in the state budget allocation that they receive, they should be made to pay it. If our politicians can collect so much money for what they do, then why not civil servants too? \nWaza is proud to feature as part of its content local bloggers who have a knack for expressing their unique perspectives, independent thoughts and engaging stories.
