The deal would extract better terms for the creditors than a previous version that has failed to gather enough support, the people said.\nCaesars has tried for months to line up enough senior creditors to win approval of a proposal to cut lower-ranking debt, allow the parent to retain a stake in the operating unit and halt related lawsuits against its private-equity owners, Apollo Global Management LLC and TPG Capital.\nRepresentatives for Paulson, Canyon, TPG and Las Vegas-based Caesars declined to comment. A spokesman for Apollo didn’t immediately respond to telephone and e-mail requests seeking comment while a representative for Soros didn’t immediately return messages after business hours.\nThe negotiations are happening while the company and its private-equity sponsors continue confidential talks with a group of higher-ranked, first-lien bondholders to amend the restructuring support agreement to which they had previously agreed, said two of the people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T07:43:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
