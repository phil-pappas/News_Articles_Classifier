The sovereign , financial and corporate notes sold since 2013 are now trading as low as 40 cents on the euro, the data show.\nLosses are set to worsen as Greece’s political and economic crisis deepens. A “no” vote in Sunday’s referendum on European bailout proposals may force the government to default on its debt and exit the euro, while a “yes” vote followed by a resignation of and Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis could hinder legislative action needed to unlock international funds.\n“There’s no certainty on what will happen next week no matter which way the people vote,” said George Satlas, a fund manager at Eurobank Asset Management in Athens, which manages more than 4 billion euros. “In 2013 and 2014, bond yields in Greece were more attractive than anywhere else in Europe and international investors thought that the situation was stable. Nobody was expecting a resurgence of political risk.”\nPimco held 355 million euros of the new Greek bonds at the end of March, while Carmignac had 662 million euros as of May 29 and BlackRock Inc. had 207 million euros at the end of June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nJennifer Spivey, a spokeswoman for Pimco in London, declined to comment on the fund’s Greek holdings. A spokesman for Carmignac in London said that the nation’s debt represents 0.86 percent of the fund’s 58 billion euros under management. An official at BlackRock in London wasn’t immediately able to comment on its holdings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T18:04:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
