The proposed Bond Guarantee Corporation of India , which will have a net worth of around Rs 5,000 crore, is envisaged as a non-government entity with a 51% stake for the private sector. For a fee, it will underwrite bonds issued by both public and private sector companies in order to enhance their ratings to attract investments from insurers and pension funds that are mandated to park funds only in toptier paper. A senior government official aware of the matter told ETthat the finance ministry has prepared a blueprint for setting up the company backed by government support. The finance ministry is also looking to rope in the Asian Development Bank as a partner. \"The capital structure of the proposed firm will have 25% paid-up equity capital, of which government will hold less than 48% stake,\" the official said. The company will raise about half the capital through subordinate debt and the rest will be in the form of callable capital , which the government will provide as and when required. \"Callable capital will act as protection for the guarantees issued by this firm in the unlikely event that it is not able to meet its obligations,\" he said. The subordinate debt will mostly be raised through public financial institutions and at concessional rates. Both the government and the central bank have repeatedly expressed the need to deepen and widen the corporate bond market, which is dwarfed by public borrowing. As of March 2013, the corporate debt market accounted for 5.4% of the country's gross domestic product ( GDP ). The proposed firm will initially offer credit-enhancement products, under which partial guarantee support will be provided to boost ratings of longterm bonds. \"Since most of the expenses of this firm will be administrative in nature, it will be able to offer the guarantees at a lower fee, which will be a win-win situation, as the cost of borrowing for the bond issuing firm will come down,\" said another finance ministry official. A lower-rated bond yields higher interest rates.The government will elect the chairman of the proposed company, which will have representation on the board through other partners. State-run infrastructure financing firm IIFCL already offers such credit enhancement and is close to signing agreements worth around Rs 2,000 crore. \"The very purpose of credit enhancement is that infrastructure bonds should get an investor. This kind of initiative will help in supporting the nascent debt market in the country,\" said former IIFCL chairman SK Goel. Infrastructure projects currently do not have direct access to bond markets because investors primarily look for high-quality paper, experts said. \"Bonds issued by infrastructure projects are not able to meet that criteria even after they begin operations as their credit profile is still below the threshold that investors look for,\" said Pawan Agarwal, chief analytical officer, Crisil Ratings. \"In such a scenario, credit enhancement will bridge that gap. But not everyone's convinced setting up a private sector firm backed by government financing is the right approach. \"The proposed structure is ultimately backed by government through callable capital,\" said another official involved in the discussions. \"So, the private players will mostly benefit on their limited investments but in the event of non-viability, it will be mostly the government's burden.\" ET View Get Bonds to Fire A Bond Guarantee fund for private sector bonds is a good idea, which will help flow greater long-term insurance and pension savings to the private sector, helping in turn develop the moribund corporate bond market. Private bonds that are just below the AA rated threshold demanded by many investors can step up to that level through the credit enhancement facilitated by the bond guarantee fund. The government involvement can give it the pedigree needed to get it going. However, caution is called for in how the fund is structured in terms of its long term viability. It must have adequate capital and prudent exposure limits for it to make an impact in the market.
