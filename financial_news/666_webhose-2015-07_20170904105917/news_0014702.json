REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson … \nBy Barani Krishnan \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose slightly on Thursday after tame U.S. jobs and economic data signalled the Federal Reserve might be less hasty to raise interest rates and as a surge in gasoline futures drove expectations for more crude demand. \nBut with the Greek debt crisis unresolved and Iran nuclear talks ongoing, coupled with Friday's U.S. Independence Day holiday making for a longer-than-usual weekend, some caution prevailed, limiting the rally. \nAlso hampering the advance was the latest data on the U.S. oil rig count from Baker Hughes. The firm said the number of rigs drilling for oil rose by 12 this week, the first rise since December. \n\"The momentum for crude is being washed out by the rig count number showing the first rise this year, after the weaker than expected jobs report had pushed crude up on the expectation that maybe the Federal Reserve would delay raising interest rates,\" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. \nThe dollar slipped against the euro after U.S. jobs growth slowed in June and factory orders fell in May, tempering expectations for a September rate hike. A softer dollar makes oil, denominated in the greenback, more affordable to users of the euro. \nBrent crude rose 30 cents to $62.31 a barrel by 1:12 p.m. EDT (1712 GMT), recovering part of Wednesday's 2.5 percent drop. \nU.S. crude, also known as WTI, was up 21 cents to $57.17 a barrel. It tumbled 4 percent in the previous session, the most since April, after a surprise inventory build last week. \n\"It's natural for the market to be up given yesterday's thwacking and the weakness in the dollar,\" said Matt Smith, director of commodities research at ClipperData, an energy markets database in Houston. \n\"But we are likely to trade with some nervousness, ahead of the long weekend and while we wait developments on Greece and Iran.\" \nGasoline, also known as RBOB, rose 1.7 percent. Ultra-low sulfur diesel rose 0.5 percent. \"Cracks\", or refining margins for these, rose too, pulling along crude prices on expectations of more U.S. summer driving demand. \n\"RBOB is very strong this morning. Brent and WTI are going for the ride,\" said Scott Shelton, a commodities specialist in Durham, North Carolina, for broker ICAP. \n(Additional reporting by Robert Gibbons in New York, Karolin Schaps in London and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T21:09:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
