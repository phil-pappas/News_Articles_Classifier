With the number of over-85s set to double by 2030, we know there’s a huge challenge ahead as our population ages. We know too that, as the Lords’ report on ageing put it, the government and society are “woefully under-prepared” . Yet still politicians seem reluctant to face up to the impact this significant demographic change will have on everything from health and social care services, to pensions provision, employment practices and housing stock.\nA panel of experts and an engaged audience at a Guardian event discussed what the government should do to prepare for an ageing population. The lack of effective debate on the issue during the election campaign was down to politicians being afraid to confront some of the difficult choices ahead, the event heard. “All political parties are running scared of the pensioner vote – pensioners do vote so you do what they want you to do,” said crossbench peer Lord Bichard, chair of the Social Care Institute for Excellence .\nLabour peer and broadcaster Lady Joan Bakewell said: “The most important thing is to think long-term and political parties don’t do that. What we see is short-termism which militates against the long-term plans we need for people in their 40s who are going to be in their 90s one day.”\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Panellists Ryan Bourne (left) and Lord Bichard.

They included making it easier for older people to continue to work when they wanted to and so maintain their independence for longer. For Bourne, this might involve changes to employment law to make it more attractive for employers to take on older employers who might be seen as a risker proposition.\nThe experience of the older generation could also be better tapped into by encouraging more volunteering, particularly in designing and monitoring services. “We have lost the knack of realising the potential of local communities and we have lost energy and potential as a result,” said Bichard. “You can’t maintain quality in residential home by visiting once a year,” he added. “If we had more ‘younger older people’ involved in visiting as volunteers we would have fewer problems.”\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Halima Khan: ‘There is a technology divide, but that is changing.’ Photograph: Thomas Langridge /Guardian Other ways to meet the challenges ahead include a better use of technology. Halima Khan, director of the innovation lab at innovation charity Nesta , said: “There is a technology divide, but that is changing. Let’s help those who don’t want to engage with technology but let’s do more to develop its potential for the future.”\nShe added that there was a huge amount we could learn from other countries in better addressing the needs of the older population, such as co-housing schemes popular in some European countries where younger people and older people live in a community to provide mutual support. “We do need more investment but also better investment in models which are not necessarily the models we have now,” she said.\nBakewell said she had put forward the idea of a commissioner for older people, to bring together policies affecting older people across different parts of government. “I do think it would help with joined-up thinking,” she said. “Older people are affected by housing, transport, health, education – what we need is something which joins up government departments.” She also called for work to be done on creating a better career pathway for care workers and encouraging young people to work in care.\nBeyond specific initiatives, there was much support at the event for a wider change in the way society views and treats older people. Bichard pointed to ageist attitudes which he claimed were still far too prevalent. “Too many people too often treat older people as if they are just always in need of care and support rather than a resource in community,” he said. “Government can take the lead on this – I want to see more older people not just listened to but used in co-production of services.”\nKhan said categorising older people as one homogenous group was not helpful – and even the language around ageing and older people could “shut doors and close ears”. What was needed, she suggested, was not just traditional policy initiatives, but a change in norms and behaviour. “We need to think of this like a social movement like feminism or the civil rights movement,” she said.\nTreating older people as one group means we fail to make the distinction between those struggling with poverty, isolation and inadequate care and those who are not. Bakewell said there was a perception that older people, many of whom had better pensions and better access to housing than the younger generations would, had had it quite good. But she warned that in the face of the challenges to come, it would be dangerous to pit the generations against each other. Instead, we needed “good and binding” relationships within communities. “We can’t wait for the politicians – we are going to have to help each other,” she said. “We need a groundswell.”\nThe future may be challenging, but as participants at the event stressed, it’s time to act – or as Bakewell put it, to move from outrage to action. “Outrage is just the start – we really have to engage.”\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The ageing population panel.
