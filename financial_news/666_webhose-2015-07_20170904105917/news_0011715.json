The study looked at numerous factors including, cash on hand, balanced budgets, long-term liabilities, and pensions. According to the study, Vermont scores well on pensions and total debt, but not as well with the other criteria.\nThe Shumlin administration is downplaying the results.\n\"This ranking you speak of, I mean there are business climate rankings all over the place. We just also scored 4 in the most entrepreneurial state, and 5 on new business startups, so pick your ranking that you want to look at,\" said Pat Moulton, Vt. Commerce Secretary.\nAccording to this study, New Hampshire scores better than Vermont coming in at 20th in the country. New York, on the other hand, does worse, ranking 46th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T04:24:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
