Arctic drilling support vessel heading to Oregon for repair Shell says ship carrying key Arctic drilling response gear will head to West Coast for repair By Dan Joling, Associated Press | Associated Press – 20 minutes ago Recommend 57.45 -0.24 \nANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A Royal Dutch Shell PLC ship carrying required blowout response equipment for Arctic offshore drilling will be sent to a West Coast shipyard for repairs. \nShell spokesman Curtis Smith says the 380-foot icebreaker Fennica (FEN'-i-cah) will transit from Dutch Harbor, Alaska, to Portland, Oregon, for repairs. \nSmith says the company's 2015 drilling schedule should not be interrupted. \nThe hull of the Fennica was gashed July 3 by an uncharted object as it departed for the Chukchi (chuk-CHEE') Sea off Alaska's northwest coast. \nThe Fennica's primary mission for Shell is carrying a capping stack, which could be lowered onto a wellhead to stop a blowout. \nSmith says Shell drill rigs can begin top-hole work and the Fennica will not be needed until August. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Related Headlines Greece reaches new deal with creditors AAP \nGreece has finally clinched a bailout deal with its European creditors that, if implemented, will secure its place … Terms \nQuotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.
