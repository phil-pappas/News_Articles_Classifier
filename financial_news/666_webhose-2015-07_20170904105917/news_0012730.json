PUBLISHED: 16:33, Tue, Jun 30, 2015 | UPDATED: 16:54, Tue, Jun 30, 2015 PA Wire Households in Bolton have missed out on insurance savings \nThe northern town has seen the typical price of a policy increase to £119, a hike of £10 since last year, according to analysis of millions of quotes by comparison website MoneySupermarket.com. However, homeowners in Bolton can take some comfort from the fact their policies are by far from the most expensive in the country. Households in Harrow typically bear the brunt of the most costly home insurance with average policy costs of £182, found the analysis. The cheapest home insurance is bagged by home owners in Norwich, where a policy typically costs £101. Overall, the price of home cover is at a five-year low after falling by an average £44 since 2010 to £116. But experts at MoneySupermarket warned that only policyholders who shop around for quotes every year will reap the benefit of falling prices.Insurers hike premiums for loyal customers if they simply accept their renewal quote each year. Kevin Pratt, insurance expert at MoneySuperMarket.com, said: “Anyone who has never switched, and just auto-renews their home insurance policy every year, could be in line for significant savings. \"Insurers use their best prices to grab the attention of new customers, so it’s essential to take advantage of this and make yourself ‘new’ by shopping around each year before renewal.\"Price falls are thanks to falling burglary rates and the fairly mild winter, which meant fewer claims for flooding and storm damage. Mr Pratt added: \"Increased competition in the market is also driving prices down, so now is the time for people to take control and shop around for a better deal.\"No matter where you live there it is always worth checking to see if there is money to be saved by switching providers.\" Top 10 cheapest places in UK for home insurance 1.
