The Tamil Nadu government has to pay the sum to an 18-year-old girl who lost her vision at birth due to medical negligence at a government-run hospital. The girl, who is now 18 years old, was born prematurely at the government hospital in Chennai’s Egmore. She was discharged from the hospital without a retinopathy test, a must for premature infants. By the time the family discovered the lapse, the girl had lost her vision. The girl’s father then approached the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (NCDRC) which awarded Rs5 lakh. Unhappy with the compensation, the family approached the apex court. The Tamil Nadu government, too, had challenged the order of the Forum. The Supreme Court dismissed the state government’s appeal and directed it to pay the higher compensation.
