The watchdog has reiterated in a statement that it has been frequently publishing warnings against the activities of certain entities offering binary options and forex in the country without authorization. \nIn addition to the forex and binary operators the regulator has added a list of known boiler room scams. Those are normally associated with investment fraud and are companies that are looking for clients and soliciting them to commit financial resources for investing. \nThe list of companies which can be found below is not complete according to the FSMA. With several warnings issued in the past against unregulated entities the Belgian watchdog has taken a decisive decision to put all the illegally operating firms under the radar into a single group. \nThe service providers would have to obtain a regulatory license in Belgium either through a direct application with the FSMA or passporting through an existing financial services license from another country within the European Union. \nAll firms which are willing to legally operate in the country also have to submit a prospectus for approval by the FSMA. The procedure is obligatory for all companies which are offering investment instruments to the residents and citizens of Belgium. \nThe regulator also highlights that not a single binary options company is currently covering all the regulatory requirements for Belgium. \nWhat follows is the full list provided by the FSMA of binary options and forex brokers which have been identified by the regulator to be operating in the country without proper authorization. Marked with a single asterisk are the binary options and forex brokers, boiler rooms scams are marked with two asterisks. Got a news tip?
