But many criticise the third arrow as lacking teeth as Abe struggles to deregulate the job market and open up heavily protected sectors such as agriculture.\nThe IMF urged Japan to launch a new round of reforms to lift labour supply and open up its agricultural and service sectors.\nWhile welcoming the government's new medium-term fiscal consolidation plan, it called on policymakers to use \"realistic economic assumptions\" in laying out a plan to cut the country's huge debt pile.\nThe blueprint of Japan's fiscal strategy for the coming years, released last month, refrained from setting a mandatory cap on annual budget spending, reflecting Abe's focus on boosting growth rather than on curbing expenditure in restoring Japan's fiscal health.
