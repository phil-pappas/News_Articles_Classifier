PUBLISHED: 16:18, Thu, Jul 23, 2015 | UPDATED: 16:41, Thu, Jul 23, 2015 GETTY Banks will no longer be able to make complaining customers call a premium rate \nProviders that are frequently complained about will also be publicly named and shamed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as part of the changes that take effect today. The regulator must now be notified of all complaints that are made to companies and this information will be available to consumers to help them make better decisions about which firms to trust. Under the current rules the FCA is only aware of the number of issues that take longer than a day to resolve. However, firms are to also be allowed up to three days to resolve a complaint informally - triple the current one day target turnaround. The watchdog said the increase will give firms more time to sort a complaint in the first instance and should mean better and easier resolution of more problems for customers.It's hoped that customers will have complaints better dealt with as a result of the changes. Christopher Woolard, director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said: \"Our rules will help deliver the quicker, easier and fairer resolution to complaints that consumers want. \"Getting this right is also vital for firms. A properly resolved complaint can keep a customer happy, and protect the firm’s reputation. \"But, more than that, effective complaints handling systems can act as an early warning system for firms.”The changes have been welcomed by critics but there are calls for all firms - not only financial companies - to be banned from using premium rate numbers for customer service lines.
