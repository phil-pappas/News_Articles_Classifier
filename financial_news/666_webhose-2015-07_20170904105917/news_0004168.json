Photo: Imaginechina \nAsk any private bank in the region where they cast the net for new clients and the answer is mainland China. Ask them how they do that and the answer is far more ambiguous. \nBank of East Asia's private bank says it has a strategy that has already boosted the share of private banking customers from mainland China, where growth in sheer wealth, along with the number of people with high net worths, is set to outpace other major economies in the decade to come. \nThe numbers, so far this year, show BEA might be on to something. In the first five months of 2015, the private bank had driven up its share of mainland Chinese assets under management by 18 per cent, Gloria Sun, the head of private banking, told the South China Morning Post . At the end of May, mainland Chinese assets represented 33 per cent of all private banking assets, up from 28.4 per cent at the start of the year. \nBy 2017, BEA aims to have half of its private banking assets hailing from mainland China - a goal that would be easily achieved if it could maintain the rate of pickup in the first half of this year. \nThe strategy has less to do with the private bank's operations, which are based in Hong Kong, and everything to do with BEA China's expansion in mainland China, which, by number of branches for a foreign bank, was second only to HSBC Ltd. \nFrom Hong Kong, BEA's private banking operations look similar to many of the players in the market, if not much smaller. The bank does not disclose its assets under management although it said it grew 9 per cent last year. It has more than 40 relationship managers, compared with hundreds at the biggest private banks that have operations in Hong Kong. We don't have 128 relationship managers but we do have 128 branches in China ... In China, we must have an edge over [our competitors]. Our network will enable us to do a lot of things that they would not be able to provide Grace Chow, BEA's general manager and head of wealth management \nBEA's strengths become more apparent after it crossed the border to mainland China, where it was the first foreign bank in the country's reform era to establish operations. While the vast majority of branch networks at foreign financial institutions in mainland China have grown sluggishly, held back by onerous regulation, BEA has expanded throughout most wealth centres and now has 128 branches. \nIts offshore private bank has no formal operations in mainland China but the corporate side of BEA China has channelled its clients' business towards the Hong Kong private bank as more mainland China-based entrepreneurs do business abroad. \nThat relationship between the onshore corporate bank and the offshore private bank has been crucial to capturing mainland Chinese wealth as it trickles offshore - a task most regional wealth managers are hard at work trying to crack. \n\"We don't have 128 relationship managers but we do have 128 branches in China,\" said Grace Chow, the general manager and head of wealth management. \"In China, we must have an edge over [our competitors]. Our network will enable us to do a lot of things that they would not be able to provide.\" \nUBS China, the biggest private wealth manager in the region, by contrast, had 1,186 relationship managers in Asia last year but just one mainland Chinese branch and sub-branch, both in Beijing. \nGlobal private banks have homed in on the level of wealth mainland China is projected to generate in the years to come, often with Hong Kong as an offshore base. The number of Chinese with more than US$30 million in investable assets is expected to grow 80 per cent between 2013 and 2023, by far the highest rate in the world, according to a 2014 report from Knight Frank. \nBEA's reach in mainland China might bring a major advantage over most global competitors, excluding HSBC, which had 173 outlets in 2014. But in terms of reach within the country, the domestic banks are virtually unbeatable. \nMainland Chinese banks have redoubled efforts over the past three years to gain a share of the private banking market in Hong Kong, with banks such as China Construction Bank and China Merchants Bank leading the way. \nOnshore, with tens of thousands of branches among the biggest banks alone, mainland China's private wealth managers have dominated the market. \nOffshore and on the international playing field, Chow says they are far less competitive or efficient. \n\"I think because of the management philosophy, most Chinese banks still need their parent company in China to approve a lot of things. So it makes things move very slowly,\" she said.
