Photo: Louie Douvis\nAfter a 40-year career in retailing, Barry Saunders was ready to hit the ski fields and tend his grape vines in the Yarra Valley when he stepped down as managing director of The Reject Shop in 2007.\nSoon after retiring, the former Myer, Target, BIG W and Pacific Brands executive got a call from a group of investors seeking his help turning around a 30-year old baby goods business, Baby Bunting. Mr Saunders hadn't changed a nappy in years but the grandfather-of-four was intrigued.\n\"They had an interesting proposition – they wanted to turn a small four-store family owned baby business into a national category specialist,\" Mr Saunders recalled this week.\n'The more I did my due diligence the more I became intrigued by the whole thing' said Barry Saunders. Photo: Andrew De La Rue\n\"Initially I thought I'd offer a little bit of advice and take a little investment – the more I did my due diligence the more I became intrigued by the whole thing.\"\nAdvertisement Seven years later, the 74-year-old is now executive chairman and a 5 per cent shareholder in Baby Bunting, which is looking at raising between $50 million and $70 million in an initial public offer to fund the next stage of growth after a series of raisings over the last few years.\nWhile two major baby goods specialists, Babyco and Mothercare, have collapsed in recent years, Baby Bunting has gone from strength to strength and is now the largest player in a highly fragmented $4.5 billion market.\nSales have risen almost five-fold, from $38 million in 2008 to $175 million this year, and Baby Bunting now has a footprint of 31 stores as well as a thriving online store generating sales equivalent to a bricks and mortar store.\n'Not even halfway there' \"We believe we're not even halfway there yet,\" said Mr Saunders, who sees scope to open between four and eight new stores a year, lifting store numbers to more than 70 as Baby Bunting moves from urban areas into regional centres, such as Ballarat and Bendigo, and tests new markets such as Newcastle and the Gold Coast.\n\"That's heavily dependent on the availability of sites – we're very selective in the choice of sites and we don't believe in opening for opening's sake,\" he said.\nBaby Bunting's chief executive, Matt Spencer, a former Kathmandu executive, is due to kick off an investor roadshow next week but Mr Saunders insists the retailer's 100-odd shareholders have not decided whether to proceed with an IPO or look at other strategic options such as a trade sale.\n\"It will depend on investor feedback and any other alternatives and the general state of the economy,\" he said. \"If there was an IPO my guess is a significant number of existing shares would continue to be held by the current holders.\"\nPrivate investment firm TDM Asset Management holds 46 per cent and is expected to retain a significant holding after a float, while the founding Nadelman family owns about 15 per cent. With 160 online players there is scope for consolidation.\n\"We're a long-term supporter of the company and we'll continue to be so,\" TDM partner Tom Cowan said. \"TDM looks globally for high quality businesses with outstanding management teams and long duration growth prospects – we're delighted with how Baby Bunting is progressing and look forward to remaining significant shareholders into the future.\"\nMr Saunders attributes the company's success to its broad product range, which includes leading brands such as McLaren and Bugaboo prams, Huggies nappies and Safe-n-Sound carseats, good product availability, competitive prices, strong customer service and ancillary services such as installations, parcel pick-up, lay-buy, and baby feeding and change rooms.\nWhile birth rates are slowing, Mr Saunders believes the trend towards women having children later in life, when they are more financially secure, will underpin solid industry sales growth.\n\"Mothers are having their children a little bit later, which means they're in a better economic position to enjoy their babies and there's evidence they prefer to buy new things than maybe a few years ago, when people would pass things on,\" he said.\nAccording to IBISWorld, online baby goods sales have risen almost 18 per cent a year over the last five years and are forecast to grow 13 per cent a year over the next five years. With 160 players in the online space, there is room for consolidation.\n\"We believe it's a good defensive market in that people will continue to have babies – the long-term trends are quite strong,\" Mr Saunders said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T16:13:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
