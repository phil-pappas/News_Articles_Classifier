Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Tony Abbott might take a GST increase to the next election but has warned the states any change will have to be part of a broader reform to ensure no overall rise in the tax take, rather than a straight revenue-raising exercise.\nFederal Labor said it would fight a GST increase under any circumstance, while on Friday Labor leader Bill Shorten will challenge Mr Abbott to another election fight over climate change.\nThe Opposition Leader will use his opening speech to the ALP National Conference in Melbourne to confirm Labor will implement a 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030 and also introduce an emissions trading scheme, dealing in low-cost international permits.\n\"If Mr Abbott wants to make the next election a contest about who has the best policy solution for climate change, I've got a three-word-slogan for him: 'Bring it on',\" he will say.\nA clear split over tax emerged between the states and the federal government at the end of the two-day leaders' summit in Sydney . As well as ruling out a GST increase just to raise revenue, Mr Abbott played down any prospect of raising the Medicare levy, despite all parties at the summit, including the Prime Minister, formally agreeing to explore increases to the GST and the levy and making a decision by Christmas.\n\"All leaders agreed to keep Commonwealth and state tax changes on the table, including the GST and the Medicare levy,\" the communique released on Thursday said.\n\"There was a unanimous commitment among leaders that we need to confront these issues head on and keep an open mind on ways to better fund the needs of our citizens.\"\nMr Abbott, whose ministers have already come out strongly against the Medicare levy idea and any GST increase designed solely to raise revenue, said he preferred changing the GST as part of a broader tax reform process, including getting rid of inefficient taxes. He preferred leaving the Medicare levy unchanged.\n \"Just increasing taxes is hard to see as reform. Whereas if the tax mix were to be changed in ways that make our economy more efficient and more productive, that increases incentives,\" he said.\n\"My focus is on more efficiency. Other people's focus may well be on the revenue pressures.\n\"All of us are in a fiscal bind at the moment and we've got to look at all the options, but as far as I'm concerned any changes to any system, whether it be the tax system or indeed the health system, have got to be about making things work better.\n\"Making the whole thing more efficient, so that in the end our economy is stronger, because without a stronger economy we will go downhill no matter what other changes we make.\"\nHe also softened his previous approach that any change to the GST would need the support of all the states and the federal opposition, saying \"something approaching a consensus\" would be required.\nStates want more revenue The summit was called to find a long-term funding solution for public health and education, prompted after the federal government withdrew $80 billion in long-term funding in the 2014 budget.\nNSW Premier Mike Baird proposed increasing the GST to 15 per cent and spending all the revenue on health, while Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews and Queensland's Annastacia Palaszczuk, with the backing of ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr, preferred raising the 2 per cent Medicare levy to 4 per cent over eight years.\nFollowing the summit, Mr Baird, South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill, Mr Barr, and Ms Palaszczuk stressed that revenue raising to plug the yawning health gap must be the priority, not tax reform per se.\nMr Baird, who has warned that health funding will be short by $35 billion a year by 2030, said \"the primary focus at the moment has to be on that health-funding gap\".\n\"That's what we've all agreed around this table. Broader tax reform considerations can be considered once we get to a position on what we know exactly that gap is going to be and what the options are to fix it,\" he said.\nMr Weatherill called the meeting the most constructive in which he has been involved in his 13 years of politics.\n\"We've also been very honest about the fact that involves raising more revenue, and inevitably that means looking at increasing some taxes, which is not usually the sorts of things that politicians like talking about,\" he said.\n\"But that's what we did talk about and we've committed to continue talking about them.\"\nMr Barr said: \"There's now agreement on the problems that we face within our federation – that we need to raise more revenue, taxes are going to have to increase. Let's ensure though that these taxes are fair, that they're levied efficiently and that they contribute to economic growth in our country.\"\nShadow treasurer Chris Bowen said federal Labor would oppose any GST change.\n\"Dear Prime Minister, stop lying to the Australian people – increasing the GST by 50 per cent is a tax increase,\" he said.\nPM favours GST over levy As the leaders met on Thursday, Treasurer Joe Hockey backed Social Services Minister Scott Morrison and other cabinet ministers who warned against raising taxes solely for the sake of revenue.\n\"Tax increases overall do not represent tax reform,\" Mr Hockey said, adding that overall taxation must be lower.\nAsked if he would take a GST increase to the next election, Mr Abbott indicated he would and was confident he could gather the necessary political and public consensus.\nHe said a tax \"green paper\" would be released \"in the next month or so\" and a \"white paper\" early in 2016, followed by \"dealing in an honest and upfront way with anything that might be proposed\".\n\"Because in the end if there is to be substantial change here in terms of who does what, if there is to be substantial change here in terms of the tax mix, we need to have something approaching a consensus,\" he said.\nAgreement on GST imports As a starting point the premiers agreed to apply the GST to imported goods valued at less than $1000 and bought over the internet.\nThe details will be thrashed out at a meeting of the treasurers scheduled for August but the aim is to apply the tax to item values as low as $20.\nThe summit said the focus of federation reforms must be health, education, housing and infrastructure and, in a significant development, leaders agreed to transfer responsibility for vocational and education training to the Commonwealth, as long as the states remained as TAFE providers within a new national system.\nThe summit agreed that as well as pouring more money into health there also had to be greater efficiencies, and there was an in-principle agreement for the Commonwealth, through Medicare, to cover treatment in hospitals based on a so-called \"efficient price\" for each treatment.", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/gst_funding_light_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-07-23T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T17:02:19.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
