The $5 billion will cover GM's share of engineering vehicles and retooling factories, GM said.\n\"We are taking significant advantage of the global scale we do have,\" GM President Dan Ammann said in a briefing on Monday ahead of a planned trip to Brazil. GM is expected to outline this week investments in Brazil and India related to the project.\nGM Chief Executive Mary Barra earlier this year rebuffed a proposal from Sergio Marchionne, FCA's CEO, to consider combining the two companies to generate better economies of scale by jointly developing vehicles.\nThe large-scale, small-vehicle project with SAIC is the clearest example yet of Barra's strategy of focusing GM instead on \"merging with itself\" by consolidating fragmented vehicle and engine programs within its sprawling global operations.\nGM's current stable of compact models, such as the Chevrolet Aveo or Onix, ride on mechanical foundations developed separately by the automaker's Korean or European operations. The new generation of such vehicles will use common components and sell at a rate of about 2 million vehicles a year. \"That's a pretty significant consolidation,\" Ammann said. GM currently manages a total of 26 different vehicle architectures. By 2025, GM wants just four.\nGM's new emerging-market vehicles will compete with low-cost models offered by the Renault-Nissan Alliance , Volkswagen AG and others. GM's strategy is \"not about a low-end vehicle,\" Ammann said. Instead, GM plans to equip new Chevrolets with features such as data connectivity, and engineer them to comply with emissions controls and safety technology requirements that are moving toward the same standards as markets mature, Ammann said.
