The brand is also set to launch more collaborations with British fashion designers after its partnership with model Laura Bailey ended two years ago. \nRadley is known for its colourful designs \nJustin Stead, the former boss of the retailer behind Mappin & Webb, Watches of Switzerland, and Goldsmith jewellery chain, joined Radley in April and asked the owners to give him 120 days to conduct a a strategy review. Mr Stead helped sell Aurum to US private equity firm Apollo for around £180m in 2012. \n“Radley is a great English brand with terrific potential. We have been gauging interest in the company but there is not an imminent decision, we are still in the plan and review phase,” Mr Stead said. “We have been having calls left, right and centre from people interested in the business, but I think that’s normal with a private equity-owned retail business.” \nRadley was founded by Lowell Harder in 1998 when she started selling her colourful handbags from a stall in Camden Market, north London. \nThe company has 30 stores in the UK including concessions within John Lewis and House of Fraser, as well as independent stores and an international footprint in Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Australia and Taiwan. \nMr Stead said that China was a “natural progression”. British fashion brands have proved to be attractive to Asia’s booming middle class and the driving force behind recent deals including House of Fraser’s takeover by Chinese conglomerate Sanpower and Cath Kidston’s sale to Baring Private Equity Asia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T22:50:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
