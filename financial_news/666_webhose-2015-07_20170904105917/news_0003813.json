But, the newly launched Turing Phone might just be the one to create a design and material revolution in the industry. First of all, the phone doesn’t come from a traditional smartphone manufacturer. For that matter, it’s not even a consumer electronics company, but one involved in robotics. The company is called as the Turing Robotics and is quite positive about its newly announced Turing Phone. \nWhen it comes to design, the Turing Phone is nothing like you may have seen in the market. With bold colors and a sharp blocky design, it looks like the Lamborghini of phones. In fact, the CEO Chao sums up his vision for the phone’s design in a few sentences. \n“Not everyone wants to drive a Volkswagen. There are people who like Aston Martins, Lamborghinis, and Ferraris. Right now, most phones are Volkswagens.” \nSo, according to Chao, Turing Phone is basically the supercar of the smartphone industry and it does come with the looks of such a product. The phone is mostly made out of liquidmorphium, which is apparently the next big thing in the industry. The material is stronger than steel and aluminum and is more efficient to manufacture. This makes it a great material to build lightweight yet super strong products like a smartphones. So, it’s no surprise that the Turing Phone is being touted as unbreakable. \nThe phone does not feature any micro-USB ports or even a headphone jack. Rather, there is an Apple’s Magsafe like magnetic charging port. The company says that the phone is almost unhackable, thanks to the numerous secured features built right into the device. For example, it comes with end-to-end encryption which also extends to a majority of its apps. There is a fingerprint reader on the side, which will unlock the phone. Plus the phone avoids the use of third party servers as much as possible. This makes it a hard device to crack. \nSpecs are a little outdated, but it doesn’t mean the phone’s not powerful. It comes with Snapdragon 801 chip on board, which was Qualcomm’s flagship chip till last year, with 3GB of RAM and 16GB/ 64GB and 128GB of storage options. Up front there will be a 5.5-inch display with full HD 1080p resolution. A 3000mAh battery will power all these specs. It will run on its own proprietary UI based on Android 5.0. \nThe Turing Phone is waterproof too, thanks to the water repelling Nano coating on its internals. The device will be up for pre-order starting July 31 for $610 (16GB).
