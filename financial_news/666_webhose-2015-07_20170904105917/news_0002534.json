The animals bundle together to get some shade from the few, almost bare, trees. \n\"I appeal to government to assist the community of Otuani with food,\" Uaturumika said. \nThe situation has reached a point where about 130 children staying in the hostel at the Musaso Senior Primary School are sent home over weekends, as the food available is hardly enough to feed them during the week. \nMany of the children stay up to 15km from the school and walk there and back. \nWalking through the village, one can sense the despair, desperation and a weak pulse of life as goats roam the dry football field looking for something to graze. \nA man-made dam some 100 metres away from the football field is dry and the few pieces of greenery in the area are inedible for man and animal. \nHowever, Kunene governor Angelika Muharukua told Nampa that the distribution of food aid is taking place, albeit at a slow pace. \nMeanwhile, mobile phone network is non-existent and the village is connected to the rest of the world only via landline; an option available to only a few people. \nUaturumika said despite the availability of electricity, mobile phones are of no use here, and in cases of emergency, there is little they can do. \n\"We have no network to communicate with people outside our village; we are suffering and asking the government to help us to get connected,\" he stressed. \nA little ray of hope came in the form of a new clinic, which opened earlier this year. The clinic is staffed by a handful of nurses and stands as a beacon of hope in the community. \n\"This clinic helps us a lot, as many people get their health assistance from it,\" said Uaturumika. \nHe commended the government for opening the clinic, adding that in the past, people had to go to Opuwo for medical help. \nThe inhabitants of one of Namibia's many vast, undeveloped and sparsely populated areas, are forced to adapt to the unpredictable patterns of weather that leave them desperate for government's intervention. \nNampa", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T12:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T12:32:58.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
