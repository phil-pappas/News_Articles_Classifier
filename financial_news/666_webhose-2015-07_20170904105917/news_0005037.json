Photo: Mariah Carey, Instagram\nThe Packer/Crown Resorts PR machine – the one that steamrolled Sydney, that bends states governments to its will at will – rarely does anything by accident.\nSo it was interesting to see it stage a burst of public action over the weekend with a last-minute push for a Chinese state-owned casino and residential development in Brisbane.\nCrown's Brisbane battle with Echo for the massive Brisbane CBD site has been relatively low-key compared with the snow job and brawl to get its Sydney casino.\nThe Labor machine men who featured in the ABC's Killing Season have been at work as the Palaszczuk government reviewed its predecessors' processes, but the weekend rollout is curious given that only the final governmental tick is required after a long and detailed assessment.\nThe Palaszczuk government has been heavily criticised for its lack of decision making, but the Premier has promised to announce the winner of the new casino development sooner rather than later after Tuesday's state budget.\nThe flurry of Packer activity suggests that, at this 11th hour, perhaps the actual decision has not been made.\nAfter the Mariah Carey European circus, the James Packer profile is back on local ground in force, fed to several major newspapers, including the usual big pro-Packer splash in the Daily Telegraph – a paper with which the Crown boss seems to enjoy particularly close relations. (It's doesn't matter that the piece was in effect a PR rehash of a four-month-old SMH story that the Sydney casino tower will mainly be apartments – the hotel in the skyline-dominating tower isn't very big despite the tourism talk.)\nWith the Terror article inevitably highlighting the international tourism claims, it's perhaps no surprise that the Crown machine needed to push the same sorts of claims in Brisbane first with a drop for Murdoch's Sunday Mail – \" Packer promises to put Brisbane on the map in last ditch casino pitch \".\nIt is bemusing that the Packer machine manages to tell the same story to Victoria, NSW, Western Australia and now Queensland – each is the one that Crown is concentrating on bringing the international gamblers to.\nIn the Queensland case, it's more than a little confusing: Why would Crown divert business from its own three Australian properties to Brisbane where it would have a distinctly minority stake? Particularly when, for all its charms, Brisbane lacks the international tourism appeal of Sydney and Melbourne.\nDespite the PR appearances, it seems Crown has only a 25 per cent share of the Brisbane project, the other 75 per cent belonging to China's Greenland Holdings, a Shanghai-based state-owned enterprise best known for building apartments. It's actually a Chinese government project, not Packer's.\nA Standard & Poor's feature last month warned that Chinese developers' \"aggressive expansion overseas or into new businesses will weaken the credit profiles of some developers such as Greenland and Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd, considering their already-high leverage\".\nA CLSA analyst's report on rival Echo in October pointed out that S&P had just downgraded Greenland's credit rating from stable to negative and that the logistics of probity checks on a Shanghai SOE would be interesting – just two of several reasons why the analyst thought Echo had a clearly better bid than Greenland and would win the government's nod.\nBut the Packer/Crown machine does seem to have a way with governments.\nMichael Pascoe is a BusinessDay contributing editor.", "external_links": ["http://www.couriermail.com.au/business/packer-promises-to-put-brisbane-on-the-map-in-last-ditch-casino-pitch/story-fnihsps3-1227438392932", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/baranga-oooh-james-packers-luxury-sky-villa-the-crown-in-casino-palace/story-fni0cx12-1227439300032"], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:03:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
