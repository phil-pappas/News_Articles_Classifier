Tamara Voninski Share on twitter by Tony Boyd The promotional material being spruiked around the market for the biggest sharemarket float of the year shows there's big money in clipping the tickets of industry superannuation fund members.\nLink Group , which is another shining example of rolling up multiple businesses, is said to be worth between $2 billion and $2.5 billion. It is said to have rolled up about 35 different businesses under the ownership of Pacific Equity Partners.\nThe promise of earnings growth looks to be partly predicated on large-scale job cuts, according to a document introducing the group to investors which fell into Chanticleer's hands on Wednesday.\nThe document shows that about 800 jobs will have to go as part of the \"synergy opportunities\" as Link grows its fee-for-service work.\nThere is a certain irony in that business model because most of the jobs will be lost in a business formerly owned by five major industry funds called Superpartners. The owners were AustralianSuper, Cbus, HESTA, HOSTPLUS, and MTAA Super.\nWhen Link bought Superpartners in September 2014 it gained huge-scale efficiencies in its super administration business. It added about 4.7 million accounts.\nThis deal more than doubled the fund administration revenue of Link. All five industry funds signed new long-term contracts with Link.\nThere is a whole separate story about the failure of Superpartners to build a viable business over a period of a decade. Its shareholders spent about $500 million only to have the system scrapped by Link.\n All the super members on the Superpartners platform are being shifted to the AAS administration platform owned by Link. That is as risky move in the middle of a process of taking the company to market.\nPitches for the Link initial public offering are said to be coming from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and UBS.\nChief executive of Link John McMurtrie is a strong drawcard for the IPO because of his lengthy experience in financial services and proven ability to manage complex integrations.\nThe primary equity raising in the IPO is expected to be $400 million but the extent of the sell-down by the shareholders is unknown.\nWilson HTM analyst Stewart Oldfield says prospective investors are being told Link is forecasting it will make just under $200 million in EBITDA in FY2016.\n\"As is often the case the timing of the float seems to be more about the relative health of the sharemarket and the ambitions of the vendors rather than what is necessarily in the best operational interests of the business,\" Oldfield says.\nSo much for LMI Lenders Mortgage Insurance has been a valuable tool used by banks around the world to protect themselves against losses on mortgages. However, it has rarely been called upon to cover losses in Australia because of the low home-loan default rates.\nThat low level of insurance claims has made Australia a happy hunting ground for LMI companies including Genworth and QBE Insurance.\nThe insurers have benefited from the fact that banks compel borrowers to take out LMI when the loan to value ratio is 80 per cent or more.\nOne glaring exception to the generally benign LMI conditions in Australia was a spike in loan losses experienced by Genworth in Queensland in 2011.\nA jump in delinquencies in Queensland was caused by widespread flooding, a downturn in retail spending and pressure on small businesses in the state.\nThat unfortunate episode is now the subject of a class action in the United States against Genworth Financial Inc brought by Hialeah Employees' Retirement System and New Bedford Contributory Retirement System.\nThat legal action pales into insignificance when seen against the potential threat to the LMI business in Australia from the prudential regulator's unwillingness to recognise the benefit to the financial system from the use of LMI.\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's recent pronouncements in relation to strengthening the capital of the country's banks did not mention LMI.\nAPRA gives the banks no credit for using insurance that, in effect, adds billions of dollars in additional protection to depositors in banks.\nThis is a blow to the long-term business of LMI in Australia. Why compel borrowers to use a system that affords no capital relief for banks at a time when banks need to raise the cost of borrowing?\nIf Australia follows the lead of New Zealand, LMI will disappear apart from the captive insurers used by banks for loans with high LVRs.\nAn alternative, which does not seem to be on APRA's agenda, is to follow the lead of Canada and provide banks with capital relief for loans carrying LMI cover.\nThe only reason Chanticleer can think of to explain why APRA is turning its back on access to an additional $5 billion in capital to protect depositors is because of the near collapse of several LMI providers in the United States following the financial crisis.\nHowever, without LMI thousands of borrowers will not be able to get a loan.\nBoral's big day Continuous disclosure rules and a Supreme Court Judge in Victoria made sure Wednesday was a big day for Boral chief executive Mike Kane.\nWhen Boral's board of directors figured out its 2015 results were going to be more than 15 per cent above consensus, a market announcement was mandatory.\nConsensus earnings estimates have ranged between $208 million and $215 million in recent weeks, according to Bloomberg. Boral said it expected net profit before significant items for 2015 to be within the range of $240 million to $250 million, subject to finalisation of the year end audit.\nThe company said its result was underpinned by a number of factors including strong earnings in June and higher than expected property sales.\nKane's other news was the decision by Justice Bell in Victoria to grant Boral discovery from the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) in proceedings brought against the CFMEU by Boral. Boral will now be entitled to read transcripts of compulsory examinations conducted by the ACCC under section 155 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010.\nThis was a slap in the face for the ACCC which argued that the court should exercise its discretion not to order the CFMEU to produce to Boral the transcripts of compulsory examinations and documents referred to in any of the examinations or interviews on the basis of public interest considerations. The judge noted confidential information would be protected.\nTabcorp's compliance\nThe respected members of the board of Tabcorp must be embarrassed by the company's compliance fails in relation to anti-money laundering laws .\nAt a time when listed companies are spending more money than ever on compliance, Tabcorp appears to have snubbed its nose at Austrac. That was not a smart move given that Austrac's new chief executive, Paul Jevtovic, has good reason to show the industry he will not tolerate multiple compliance failures.\nJevtovic has plenty of skin in the game, given that his name is on the court action taken in NSW against Tabcorp.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-07-22T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:04:15.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
