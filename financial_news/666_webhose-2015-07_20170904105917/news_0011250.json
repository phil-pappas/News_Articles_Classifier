The supermarket, Aldi, accepted it was a cherry stone that had caused the damage. \nIt offered to pay for dental treatment and asked me to submit receipts and medical reports. Private treatment was quoted at £475 but I said I would go with the NHS option for £280. Aldi then refused to pay. \nI emailed again to Aldi to no avail. I am hoping you will be able to convince it to pay me as it promised. GD, West Sussex \nThe damage was such that the dental work required involved a crown. You were happy to save the store money but very disenchanted when it reneged on the agreement. \nNearly nine months after the event you then wrote to me. \nNow Aldi says: “We apologise to Mr Dobson for any dental damage he incurred while eating this product, though we are confident this product was correctly labelled, with all necessary warnings that it might contain fragments of cherry stone. \n“As a gesture of goodwill, we have happily covered the costs of Mr Dobson’s dental treatment.” You report that it was a whole stone, not just a fragment, that caused the problem. \nAldi has since stopped supplying the product at issue although I understand this is not related to this incident. \nSurely Aldi should have “happily” paid first time round having agreed to do so. Aldi has now written to you further, saying, without admission of liability: “Aldi insists on the highest standards with our products and we hope that you will continue to shop with Aldi in the future. \n“With that in mind, please find enclosed a cheque in the sum of £280 in full and final satisfaction of all claims arising from the incident.” \n• If you want to contact Jessica, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T15:13:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
