REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann \nZURICH (Reuters) - UBS (UBSG.VX) posted on Monday a bigger-than-expected jump in second-quarter net profit as the Swiss bank released results one day early following a newspaper report on the figures. \nNet profit rose 53 percent on the year to 1.2 billion Swiss francs ($1.25 billion), much more than the 3.2 percent rise forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts that was not published before the Zurich-based bank posted earnings. \n\"In order to be transparent and counter certain incorrect and misleading information that has become public, UBS chose to release its second quarter 2015 results one day early,\" the Swiss bank said in a statement. \nOn Sunday, Swiss weekly Sonntagszeitung said that the Zurich-based bank would post a year-on-year increase of about 25 percent in quarterly net profit. \nIn a statement, UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said he was \"pleased with the quarter\". \nThe above-consensus earnings come just a few days after cross-town rival Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) posted figures and flagged an overhaul of its strategy that helped shares surge more than 6 percent. \nUBS's private bank posted adjusted net new money growth, a key indicator of future revenue, of 8.4 billion francs (5.6 billion pounds) in the second quarter, above the poll consensus. \nUBS also bolstered its capital cushion, a measure of a bank's ability to withstand a crisis, to 14.4 percent. \n(Reporting by Joshua Franklin; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T08:52:07.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
