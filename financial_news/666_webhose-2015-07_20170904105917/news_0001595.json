So the implication the CMA seem to be saying in this piece of economic theory is that we should all be happy doing this for nothing, which I just don’t think is credible. \n“That’s the only thing I want to challenge. It doesn’t stack up... £50 a family is the total profit we make.” \nHe acknowledged that British Gas could however be more cost efficient in a more competitive market. \nMr Conn said the CMA’s proposed temporary price caps on default tariffs were a “perfectly feasible idea” although he had questions about how it would work. \nAnalysts at Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) said the plan was “likely to be seen as negative by investors” while UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) said the proposal was “potentially harmful to gas retailers”. \nMr Conn said: “Depending where it is set and how it is set, it could have an impact on our margins for our standard variable customers, but let’s wait and see.\" \nHe said other proposals put forward by the CMA, such as lifting a cap on the number of tariffs they could offer, may be “offsetting factors that mean it does not materially impact the profitability”. \nOther suppliers also broadly welcomed the CMA's report. RWE (Xetra: 703712 - news ) and ScottishPower both said the CMA report served to “dispel myths” about the energy market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T22:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T23:19:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
