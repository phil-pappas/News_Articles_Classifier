With climate change threatening to adversely affect the environment, there's a greater need for concerted effort from the motoring population to significantly contribute to the reduction CO2 emissions. Carbon footprint is on the rise and as a key stakeholder; Fast Rent-a-Car believes that one effective way of reducing CO2 emissions is through eco-friendly driving. \n\nFast Rent-a-Car is on the driver's seat as it seeks to educate every motorist on how they too can make their contribution towards making this world a little greener & safer.\n\nEco driving is often encouraged because even the slightest of differences made by drivers like you can protect the environment and keep the planet clean. For a better understanding, here are a few simple tips that get you from point A to point B in your rental and on the road towards eco-friendly driving.\n\n1. Steady speed\nWhenever possible, switch off the engine instead of idling in traffic. Avoid abrupt or hurried starts; increase the speed gradually, the same goes for when you brake. Maintain your speed at or below the posted limit. \n\n2. Staying cool\nHaving trouble bearing with the heat but would still like to save on fuel? Try this out next time you're cruising over 40 MPH. Run the air-conditioning for about five minutes or till it's reached an optimum level of temperature, then switch over to the fan, thus leaving the chilled air that's already present in the vehicle running in circulation.\n\n3. Routine check-ups\nThe fuel system should be working efficiently and leaving you with fewer chances of being left in the middle of the road at the least expected times. Vehicles with low pressure tires or fuel system problems guzzle more gas to drive.\n\n4. Limit the load\nBesides the essentials: a first aid kit, spare tire and associated repair and safety equipment, the vehicle doesn't need to lug around too much else. Don't treat the roof rack or trunk like spare storage space. If you don't need it, don't bring it along. Carrying around any excess weight causes it to take more fuel to move, thereby increasing your carbon footprint.\n\n5. Keep calm and drive on\nLastly, try to keep a cool head when you're on the road. As clich as it may sound, the better your mood is, the likelier you are to drive in a road-friendly manner that keeps you, your fellow passengers, and your vehicle safe. \n\nAbout Fast Rent A Car \nLaunched in 1990, Fast Rent A Car is the region's leading vehicle-rental solutions provider with a fleet of over 7500 automobiles in over 20 categories.
