Photo: Dominic Lorrimer\nMetcash's ​appointment of retail \"hard\" man Steven Cain to lead its supermarkets division was rewarded by a 10.4 per cent surge in the embattled grocery wholesaler's share price.\nMr Cain will step up as chief executive supermarkets at a time of unprecedented competition in the sector as Coles, Woolworths and Metcash's IGA chain battle to stave off competition from an emboldened discount sector.\nHe replaces Metcash's long-serving supermarkets chief executive Fergus Collins, who left the business in March after 13 years.\nTough reputation Advertisement Mr Cain is understood to have earned a reputation for being a tough operator during his time as group managing director at Coles a decade ago.\nMore recently Mr Cain had held senior executive roles and advisory positions with retail and media businesses, but his career history includes a stint at Asda where he played a significant part in the turnaround of the group in the UK.\nOne analyst said Mr Cain's work as a \"change agent\" for Asda could prove a good fit with Metcash's five-year transformation plan.\n\"The [Metcash] business is going through a lot of change and it needs someone who is able to manage that change,\" he said.\nAn engineer by training, Mr Cain said he was delighted to be joining Metcash at \"an important time in the implementation of the Diamond Transformation Program\".\nThe Diamond project is focused on refurbishing rundown IGA stores as well as revitalising its Black and Gold brand and the Price Match program.\nThere are signs already that the program is delivering some results at IGA stores .\nPrice Match is a strategy where IGA matches the major supermarkets' shelf prices for a range of popular grocery items. The program was only officially rolled out in June.\nCommonwealth Bank retail analyst Andrew McLennan described Mr Cain as a \"good, hard\" operator who wasn't afraid of making difficult decisions.\nMr McLennan put a buy recommendation on Metcash earlier this month. He said the appointment of experienced discount retailer Mark Hewlett to the newly created position of executive general manager, new channels was also positive for Metcash.\n​Mr Hewlett spent the last three years with Woolworths in its convenience business but before that he spent 12 years working for discount giants Aldi and Lidl.\nPotential for discounting Market watchers suggest Mr Hewlett will leverage this experience in discount retail to drive volume through Metcash's distribution system and potentially even develop some sort of discount operation.\n\"There's room for two discounters in Australia. Aldi is one but there's room for another,\" Mr McLennan said.\n\"Many of the successful discounters in Europe are home grown ... and the second player here could come from Australia.\"\nMetcash is under pressure after unveiling a $640 million write-down last month that sent its shares tumbling.\nMr Hewlett said Metcash had \"great distribution capacity on which to build new models\".\nMetcash chief executive Ian Morrice said Steven Cain and Mark Hewlett were very \"strong additions\" to the executive team and would considerably strengthen Metcash's retail knowledge and capability.\nMr Cain has been working as an adviser for Metcash and officially starts work on August 1. Mr Hewlett begins on August 12.\nMetcash shares closed up 10.4 per cent at $1.17 on Friday.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/metcashs-biggest-iga-chain-sees-light-at-end-of-tunnel-20150708-gi7gvx.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/metcash-shares-plunge-as-wholesaler-withholds-dividends-after-640m-writedown-20150604-ghgbfk.html"], "published": "2015-07-17T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:47:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
