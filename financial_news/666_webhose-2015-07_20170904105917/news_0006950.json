Under that scenario, a $100,000 balance would be worth $1.478 million in 35 years. But if returns are 6.5 per cent, that balance will be worth $906,225 in 35 years.\n Picking the right long-term investment strategy typically determines 80 per cent to 90 per cent of an investor's total return outcome over the long term, McKie adds.\nYounger super savers need to maintain a long-term allocation skewed towards growth assets such as property and shares because they provide a hedge against inflation, he says.\n\"Adopting too conservative an investment strategy that won't keep pace with inflation is actually one of the biggest risks for younger savers,\" Steward Wealth director James Weir says.\nReducing the cost of fees and taxes is also important. \"When nominal returns are 10 per cent, paying an investment fee of 1.5 per cent costs 15 per cent of investment returns,\" McKie says. \"But if nominal returns sink to 5 per cent, the same fee will eat up 30 per cent of the lower investment returns.\"\nJust as important as managing fees is managing tax. \"People can boost their after-tax returns by managing capital gains, boosting franking credits and focusing on tax-loss harvesting,\" Weir says.\nIncreasing the after-tax return on a $100,00 super balance over 35 years by just 1 percentage point, from 5 per cent to 6 per cent, would result in a 39 per cent increase in the final balance from $551,601 to $768,608, he adds.\nStill, probably the most effective way to grow a super balance over time is to increase contributions.\n\"Start putting as much away as you can, as early as you can, to take advantage of the tax benefits of super and let compounding interest work its magic,\" Weir says.\nThe value of $1 invested when you are 50 is worth about $2.50 by age 65, whereas if that $1 had been invested at age 20 it would be worth about $18 by age 65, he adds.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/sallymrose", "https://plus.google.com/115164720240377561218/about?hl=en"], "published": "2015-07-10T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:54:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
