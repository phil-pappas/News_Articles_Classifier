Erin Jonasson Share on twitter by James Thomson Could life be about to be get a bit tougher for Australia's private equity firms?\nWhile the initial public offering window has stayed open for longer than any of them might have hoped, buying stuff isn't exactly easy. As we revealed last week, the sector has around $7 billion in dry powder, cash that it is simply struggling to spend as strong competition for assets and businesses (including from the IPO market) keeps valuations high.\nBut its not just that pile of undeployed capital that is a challenge. Now one fund manager – backed by the might of Australia's industry super funds, no less – is challenging the private equity sector's business model.\nIFM Investors, the $57 billion fund manager which is owned by industry super funds, is launching a new model that will see it invest around $50 million to $150 million directly in companies in Australia alongside one or more clients .\n\"What we are trying to provide is greater access to investment opportunities in high quality companies in the region. Access is the ability to provide meaningful cheques to take large stakes relative to the exposure that can be gained through conventional funds,\" Steven Lipchin, IFM's head of private capital told Jonathan Shapiro on Wednesday .\nClearly, this is one player with a strategy that is yet to be tested. But the move would appear to speak to a few trends.\nFirstly, super funds are having to get really creative about the way they spend the massive piles of money they have at their disposal. In the way that the super funds are increasingly taking direct stakes in infrastructure or public companies, they now want the same exposure to private growth companies.\nAnd secondly, the super funds may be questioning whether they are getting a good enough deal through the traditional private equity funds, where fee levels – typically 2 per cent management fee and a 20 per cent performance fee – have been criticised in the past.\n But what might really worry the private equity firms is IFM's very different investment horizon, as described by Lipchin: \"Generally private equity would measure its own performance in terms of internal rate of return on capital invested and a 'times (x) money' return. We are less focused on 'times money' and more on sustainable IRR and that gives us a lot more flexibility in terms of investment holding periods.\"\nIn other words, where private equity has traditionally looked to exit an investment after about five years, IFM's model means it is prepared to hang on for longer.\nThat could give the founder of a fast-growing private company a stark choice when they seek investment.\nDo you take the cheque from the private equity firm that will want a big return in a relatively short period?\nOr do you take a cheque from the super fund with the longer-term outlook, that is prepared to use more patient capital to get a return over a longer period?\nSome founders will themselves want the turbo-charged growth and big exit event that private equity is famous for. Others will want to grow slower, and keep building their business for the long term.\nWhatever the case, it's potentially another cashed-up competitor for those prize growth assets.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mrjthomson"], "published": "2015-07-30T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T04:43:04.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
