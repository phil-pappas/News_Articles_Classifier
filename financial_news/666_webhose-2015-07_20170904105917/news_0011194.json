Since the start of the 2014/15 West African cocoa season we have been below consensus regarding Ghanaian production forecasting an 8% decline on the expectation of less favourable weather conditions for the region as whole and reduced input usage in Ghana especially. This underpinned our view that once official forecasts were revised lower the global cocoa market would return to deficit in 2014/15 ensuring prices would average higher year-on-year. This view is now playing out as local forecasters are revising down estimates.\nDivine Chocolate Merges US and UK Business : In April 2015 Divine Chocolate announced plans to merge its US and UK based businesses in an attempt to gain a 'wider consumer reach.'
