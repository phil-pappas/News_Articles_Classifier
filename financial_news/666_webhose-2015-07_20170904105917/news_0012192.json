Twitter Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Malcolm Turnbull's cross-social media blogging of his train trip to Geelong, the same trip Speaker Bronwyn Bishop took in a helicopter, has thrown into the spotlight the increasingly sophisticated ways politicians are using social media to gain voters.\nLast week NSW Premier Mike Baird made a major policy announcement via Twitter video, about GST reform, which reached 270,000 people, with 70,000 actually watching it.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten (and his staff) have discovered Periscope, the app that lets you broadcast a live video stream from your mobile to anyone who wants to watch, and are filming every press conference with wild abandon.\nMeanwhile, corporations have caught on. Facebook for example has beefed up its government and politics team to pitch new features and ways to collect donors to US Presidential campaigns desperate to extend their reach.\nIf our health system is to survive, we need our political leaders to bring solutions to the table.
