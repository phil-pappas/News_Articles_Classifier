Cnova includes a series of major e-commerce entities such as Cdiscount - operating in France, Belgium, Brazil, Ivory Coast, Colombia, Senegal, Panama, Ecuador, Thailand and Vietnam - and Cnova Brazil operating through Extra.com.br, Pontofrio.com and Casasbahia.com.br. \nThe group registered a promising first quarter for this year ensuring a strong 17.8% progression of its revenue for a total of 915,5 million €. According to Jean-Charles Naouri, chairman of the group, these figures rise to 28,2% representing 1,25 billion € when focusing on the global sales volume including the transactions carried out by third party suppliers. \nThe major flow of 14,8 million active customers (+27,6%) registered on the first three months of activity in 2015 represents a total of 9,3 million orders (+38,2%), an important progress that satisfies Jean-Charles Naouri.The announcement has certainly accelerated the share’s increase (+1,77%) reaching 6,31$, but yet the introduction stock value (7$) calls for greater efforts.
