Tax credits was a part of that by raising workforce participation, and also by topping up the incomes of low paid, which probably helped to cap pay and encourage labour demand,\" he told MPs. \n“I do worry as to whether the simultaneous withdrawal of tax credits and ... a much higher minimum wage will reduce both the supply and demand for labour, in a way that if a future downturn hits the outcome in terms of jobs may not be as good as this last one has been.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T00:19:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
