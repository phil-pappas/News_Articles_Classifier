This trend has grown stronger over the years and is continuing to show remarkable progress.\"\n\n\"Today Indian companies are not just investing and creating jobs, they have also become significant stakeholders in the growth and prosperity of their local communities. Their linkages run deep through the support extended by them to education programs and capacity building,\" he said.\n\nTogether, 100 Indian companies employ more than 91,000 people across 35 states and the District of Columbia. The top five states in which Indian companies have generated maximum employment are: New Jersey (9.278 jobs), California (8.937 jobs), Texas (6,230 jobs), Illinois (4,779 jobs) and New York (4,134 jobs), the release noted.\n\nThe total value of tangible investments made by these 100 companies exceeds USD 15.3 billion.

As India surges forward to become the fourth fastest growing source of FDI into the U.S., it is critical that we recognize the positive impact of Indian business investments in the country. In Virginia, Indian companies have been key players in creating jobs and engaging communities. I hope to see this trend continue in the future, with increased Indian business operations in the country.\" (KNN Bureau)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T19:54:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
