Photo: Supplied\nWhat happened to the La Dolce Vita ethos? The scooter look is suddenly and sharply less cool in Australia – vespers for Vespas – while hogs are in clover, the illusion of the Wild One never stronger.\nThat's a reading of Australia's motorised two-wheel market over the June half, courtesy of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries.\nThe hog sales are mainly middle-aged accountants wanting to be something other than middle-aged accountants. Riding a motorbike is more expensive than guitar lessons but doesn't require the dedication, let alone talent.\nScooter sales plunged 26 per cent compared with the previous corresponding period, but Harley Davidson overtook Honda in the road bikes category. Its sales were up 14.6 per cent to 4566 hogs - 21 per cent of the road bike market - while Honda dropped 9 per cent to 3980 units.\nAustralia is not in danger of becoming a scooter society. Southeast Asia we're not. Photo: Supplied\nHonda still leads the total motorcycle, scooter and ATV business with a 24.6 per cent market share, thanks to first place in the ATV and off-road motorcycle markets, but bragging rights among the Born to Be Wild dreamers have gone to Harley D.\nWhich opens up all sorts of possibilities for conjecture about what motivates people to take the seriously dumb risk of riding two motorised wheels on public roads. (Four wheels dangerous, two wheels much more dangerous, to paraphrase Orwell.)\nOverall road motorcycle sales were flat, Harley Davidson taking market share from other brands. It's tempting to wonder about a correlation with car sales, where the most expensive are the fastest-growing segment.\nContrary to some of the mythology, Harley Davidson's success is not a reflection of the rise of Hells Angels and Commancheros and the profitability of marketing ice. Heck, the degradation of bikie gangs is such that apparently they don't even have to have bikes anymore.\nThe hog sales are mainly middle-aged accountants wanting to be something other than middle-aged accountants. Riding a motorbike is more expensive than guitar lessons but doesn't require the dedication, let alone talent.\nNot that there's anything wrong with that. We all have our romances, props, methods of fear-inducing excitement. Personally, I have preferred Alfas, albeit suddenly being without at least one for the first time in 26 years.\nAnd speaking of Italians, the scooter thing is indeed interesting. The illusion still lives to the extent that the top-selling scooter is Vespa with 19.4 per cent – but that's only 2785 units over the six months. Australia is not in danger of becoming a scooter society. Southeast Asia we're not.\nHonda was second with 16.6 per cent. Anyone seen an Italian starlet aboard a Honda scooter? Did a mod ever ride a Honda? (And if you don't know what a mod was, Google it.) Maybe that's still the Australia Post market speaking – the postie's scooter was a vehicle class all of its own, a unique product to Australia Post specs.\nThe most likely way to die on our roads remains travelling on two motorised wheels. And there's not even the pushbike riders' excuse of getting fit – until they come off and break something. Or worse.\nYou takes your chances, as they say. And maybe you were Marlon Brando in another life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T04:51:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
