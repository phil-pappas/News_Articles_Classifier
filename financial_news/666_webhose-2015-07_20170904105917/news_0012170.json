That doesn’t mean you have to go broke, though. \nThe month of July is a great time to save money — not just spend it — if you know where the deals are this time of year. Best Time to Buy: July Edition \nIn addition to Independence Day sales, July promises to offer a whole month’s worth of savings. Whether you’re redecorating your home or looking for cheap summer entertainment, there are a number of items that go on sale this month. 1. Computers \nIt’s often said that a computer becomes dated as soon as you buy it, so you might as well take a slightly older model to knock off a big portion of the price. Computers go on sale this month because it’s back-to-school season, and many major tech companies come out with the latest products and upgrades due to increased demand. April Dykman of GetRichSlowly.org recommends you find out what will be discounted to make room for the next big thing from technology shows, like MacWorld and the International Consumer Electronics Show. 2. Grills \nOnce the 4th of July is over, so too are the barbeques that go hand in hand with this holiday. Stores are ready to get rid of everything related to outdoor cooking so they can make room for cooler-weather items. Of course, you still have plenty of time to grill and enjoy the summer months, so pick one up now while the sun is still out. \nRelated: 15 Best Fourth of July Freebies, Discounts and Deals 3. Broadway Tickets \nAutumn is the peak season for Broadway; regular attendees are less likely to stick around for a show during the summer. Plus, July is the off-season for New York tourism in general, so theaters offer up big discounts to attract ticket buyers. If you’re a fan of the stage, now could be a great time to plan a trip to New York and purchase tickets for a show on Broadway for as much as half off. 4. Furniture \nNew furniture hits showroom floors a few times a year, but during the summer that time is August. July will be when retailers are rushing to move older stock out so they can bring in the new pieces. In fact, you can expect to spend 10 percent to 50 percent less when purchasing furniture during this month. Outdoor furniture is usually the most heavily discounted, as there won’t be much demand once fall arrives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T11:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T18:36:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
