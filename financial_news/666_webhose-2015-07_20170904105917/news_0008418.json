Katherine Griffiths Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Durkin Regulator Greg Medcraft is expected to be the first casualty of a full scale review of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, as simmering tensions with the federal government are brought to a head.\nThe government's \" capability review \" – which will examine splitting up, merging or overhauling the regulator – follows a string of high-profile scandals that engulfed the Commonwealth Bank, Macquarie Private Wealth and the National Australia Bank, and which in some cases could have been detected earlier.\nThe politically damaging scandals that have been sheeted home to the government by Labor senator Sam Dastyari amid calls calls for a royal commission , have put unwanted pressure on the Coalition as it gears up for next year's federal election.\nThe government's frustration has been exacerbated by a lack of confidence in Mr Medcraft, a Labor-appointee and former ALP member, who despite working as a Wall Street investment banker is seen as pro-regulation and is pushing hard for stronger penalties and powers to intervene in the market.\n\"The review is looking at the culture of the organisation and its skill set,\" Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told the AFR Weekend .\nMr Medcraft – whose term expires in May – would not be the first casualty of the Abbott government's clean-out of Labor government appointments, which has included top public service chiefs including former Treasury Secretary Martin Parkinson, the sacking of former Victorian premier Steve Bracks as Australia's Consul-General in New York and the clean-out of the NBN board.\nEarlier this year, Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull confirmed a Coalition policy that allegedly requires anybody appointed to a government board by Labor to be dumped when their term expires.\nTensions between the Australian Securities and Investments Commission chairman and Liberal Senator Mathias Cormann surfaced late last year, after the regulator warned that Australia was a \"bit of a paradise\" for white-collar crime, comments that enraged the government and forced Mr Medcraft to backtrack from his position .\n The ASIC chairman has also been vocal in calling for additional government funding and has sparked controversy for his regular overseas travel as head of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions.\nMr Medcraft, who has been labelled the \" houdini of the regulatory set \" for his ability to wiggle out of tricky situations, remains optimistic the review will pave the way for his long-championed user-pays system, which he hopes will be the legacy of his five-year term.\n\"We are really supportive of this review because it is closely linked with government's consideration of the Murray inquiry recommendation that ASIC become industry funded as well as the other changes to our powers,\" ASIC said about the review, which was revealed by The Australian Financial Review on Friday .\nThe federal government remains open to the user pays model, following the proposed $3 billion sale of the ASIC registry but is hedging its bets ahead of an expected backlash by the business community.\n\"The government is considering the user pays model and the consequences that may flow from that,\" Mr Frydenberg said.\nNationals Senator John Williams said: \"Ive been disgruntled with ASIC for years because they have been too slow to act.\" Mr Williams also raised concerns about Mr Medraft's dual role as chair of IOSCO given the task he faces at home.\nThe independent review of ASIC – to be headed by productivity commissioner Karen Chester, former chief executive of the Queensland Treasury Mark Gray and barrister David Galbally – will examine the allocation of ASIC's $300 million budget and 1500 staff.\nThe inquiry will review ASIC's ballooning responsibilities that have expanded to include market supervision, financial literacy, self-managed super and consumer credit, and whether ASIC's functions could be carved-off or merged with other agencies.\nEarlier this year, Mr Frydenberg visited the Financial Conduct Authority, Britain's corporate watchdog, which was overhauled is 2013 and whose chief executive Martin Wheatley quit last week after learning his term would not be renewed by the conservative government .", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108544913517269724355/posts", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/asic-chiefs-overseas-trips-draw-criticism-20131122-2y1p5.html", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/patrickdurkin"], "published": "2015-07-24T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:06:29.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
