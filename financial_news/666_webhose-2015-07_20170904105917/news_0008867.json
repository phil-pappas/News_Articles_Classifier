Photo: Dominic Lorrimer\nANZ is offering customers free financial advice if they have less than $50,000 in superannuation and will pay staff a $500-a-year super top-up – if they're female.\nThe bank will also pay super contributions to paid parental leave for up to 24 months as part of measures, to be announced on Wednesday, designed to close the gender pay gap whereby women earn $700,000 on average less than men over their lifetime.\nThis is an increase from the current period of 12 months.\n\"We're calling out and trying to close this gap – [the initiative] is not perfect, but we're making progress,\" the bank's chief executive of global wealth Joyce Phillips said.\nAdvertisement \"Over time, we believe these new measures will help improve the financial security of women at ANZ by directly targeting the areas of advice, superannuation and financial education.\"\nWhile women have outnumbered men in higher education for years – 42 per cent aged 25 to 29 have a university degree compared with 31 per cent of men – women still earn up to 36 per cent less and retire with half the superannuation due to the pay gap and breaks in their careers.\nWomen who work full-time are paid an average $295 less per week compared with their male counterparts, or $15,000 a year.\nOne in five women yet to retire have no superannuation, and nearly 40 per cent report having no personal income at the age of retirement.\nNew customer approach \"We've trained our private bankers and also 57 planners to take a new approach with our customers, and hopefully connect better with our female customers,\" Ms Phillips said.\n\"Much more still needs to be done, though, to achieve full gender equality in the workplace and while we recognise we're not there yet, this announcement is about rethinking how we address the imbalances women face in the workplace and in retirement,\" ANZ chief executive Mike Smith said.\nThe research also found women earn 19 per cent on average less than men, and that almost 15 per cent are likely to experience poverty in retirement. One in two mothers who return to the workforce also experience discrimination.\n\"There is an opportunity for us to address these imbalances at ANZ, and to work to redesign the systems within both business and the community to support women's success and financial wellbeing for the future,\" Ms Phillips said.\nFormer prime minister Julia Gillard, tennis great Martina Navratilova and former chief of army David Morrison will attend the ANZ launch.\nCall for inquiry Meantime, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said on Tuesday that she wanted 50 per cent of board positions on state-owned corporations to be held by women by 2020 .\nMs Palaszczuk said cabinet had endorsed the plan. \"I'm firmly committed to addressing the inequality that we see in government boards, but more broadly than that, across the spectrum.\"\nAnd on Wednesday morning, the Greens industrial relations spokesman Adam Bandt said they would move for a Senate inquiry into women's superannuation savings following the ANZ move.\n\"On average, women have $44,000 in their super account, compared to $82,000 for men. This is an extreme level of inequality and ANZ is doing the right thing by trying to change this for their employees,\" he said.\nWith Mark Ludlow", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/leadership/half-of-queensland-board-positions-to-be-women-by-2020-20150728-gim5lh"], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T06:56:45.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
