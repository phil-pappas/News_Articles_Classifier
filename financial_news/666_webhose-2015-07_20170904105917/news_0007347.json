This is a decrease of 11 663 tourists from one country alone. \nIt is estimated that the first two quarters of this year will see a drop of 70% in tourist arrivals. \nOne of the main reasons given for this decline by the stakeholders I met with are the Visa regulations that came into effect in June this year. \nAccording to the Tourism and Business Council of South Africa, every 12 tourists coming to our country creates 1 job. That means that roughly 971 job opportunities were lost to South Africa based only on the decrease in tourists from the first quarter of this year alone. \nThis means that the Visa regulations have potentially killed almost 1000 job opportunities. \nJust last night I received an email from an irate director of a tour operator company, specialising in school sports tours to South Africa from the United Kingdom who have 2 400 students traveling to our country in the next few months. \nAfter 11 of their number were denied boarding a flight to South Africa last night, due to a lack of communication from the South African embassy on visa requirements which they therefore could not comply with, \"they will not be considering South Africa as a destination in the future as a result of the current implementation of the Visa regulations and Immigration Act in South Africa\" \nIt is clear that these regulations have a direct and devastating impact on tourism and the ability of our economy to create jobs. \nThe DA has consistently called for an e-Visa system and biometrics on arrival to facilitate easier access for tourists to South Africa. Countries that have implemented this system, such as Turkey, have seen an impressive increase in tourists since implementing an e-Visa system. \nWith real alternatives on the table, these unjustifiable and job killing Visa regulations must be immediately suspended and withdrawn. \nJames Vos", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T18:58:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
