Not according to a new report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, which calls on the IRS to “proactively” reach out to taxpayers on this issue.\n“People are making mistakes, but they aren’t getting caught,” says Barry Picker, a CPA in Brooklyn, N.Y., adding, “The IRS wants people to comply, but they don’t want to penalize them.”\nTIGTA identified nearly 639,000 taxpayers with IRAs worth $40.4 billion who may not have taken required distributions in tax year 2012. In addition, TIGTA identified nearly 6,500 taxpayers who self-reported that they did not take required distributions in prior years, paying excise taxes totaling $6.2 million. Those are taxpayers trying to come clean; the penalties are calculated as 50% of the amount that should have been taken out. 335 of them got the penalties waived in full.\nThere are people with $1 million IRAs getting this wrong. That means they are avoiding a current income tax hit on the missed distributions, and the money stays in the IRA compounding tax-deferred. When taxpayers don’t take the money out as required, the Treasury loses revenue because taxpayers are sheltering IRA funds from taxation.\nIf you fail to take out a required minimum distribution from your Individual Retirement Account by Dec. 31 each year, the sooner you fess up and ask for a wavier, the more likely you won’t be hit with a 50% penalty.

Similarly, the IRS could use date of death information to notify the estates of deceased individuals of distribution rules associated with IRA inheritances, which would increase the likelihood of beneficiaries complying with the distribution rules of inheriting an IRA (the IRS pooh-poohs that idea).\nSince TIGTA issued a 2010 report on IRA noncompliance, the IRS has been trying to get the message across through generalized educational materials and by issuing “soft” notices to 1,500 potentially non-compliant taxpayers so far. TIGTA says the IRS should communicate directly with taxpayers to inform them of the distribution requirements, and the IRS should broaden the scope of ferreting out noncompliant taxpayers by including small business IRA owners, not just traditional IRA owners in its sights.\nIf it’s a true mistake, you can take out the missed distributions in one fell swoop, and file for a standard waiver (Form 5329) of the 50% penalty on missed distributions. The IRS notices sent to potentially noncompliant taxpayers explains this: “If you can show that your failure to take RMDs was due to reasonable error and that you are taking reasonable steps to correct the error, we can consider waiving the 50% tax.”\nPage 1 / 2 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["http://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2015reports/201510042fr.pdf", "http://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2010reports/201040043fr.pdf"], "published": "2015-07-16T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T16:16:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
