The prospect of higher rates enhanced the dollar's appeal, and propelled it to session highs.\nThe British pound also got a lift from the prospect of higher interest rates, and was up slightly on the day at $1.5616 .\nMinutes from the Bank of England's July 8 meeting revealed on Wednesday that several policymakers are moving towards voting for the first rate increase following BOE Governor Mark Carney's recent comments that a hike might happen around the end of year.\nEconomists predicted that three of nine members of the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee might vote for a rate hike in August, which could put the central on track for a majority to back an increase later this year or in early 2016.\nIn other Asian currencies, Indonesia's rupiah skidded to 13,395 per dollar, its weakest since August 1998.\n(Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T07:50:03.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
