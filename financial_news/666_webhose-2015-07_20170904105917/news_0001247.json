Smart Money Now Is Saying Yes Written by: Robert McGarvey 07/20/15 - 2:25 PM EDT More Headlines Post-Retirement Work May Not Save Your Golden Years \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — Suddenly there is a profusion of ways to lock in an airfare without committing to buy it. United , along with some other major carriers, now offers a version, and there also are third-party players such as FLYR’s FareKeep and Options Away. The core idea: see a price you like and a small fee, generally under $40, holds the fare for possibly several days, perhaps a week. Use that time to decide that, in fact, you honestly want to go to Rome in August - or maybe to see if your travel companion is in fact available on those particular dates. New York entertainment lawyer Conrad Rippy told of recently looking for a business class flight to London, and the fares he kept seeing were upwards of $5,200 apiece. Then one day, there it was: a fare of $2,200. Just one problem: Rippy could not reach the friend with whom he was traveling to confirm his availability on the specific dates. What to do? For $13, Rippy bought FareLock on United which gave him a guarantee of that low price for 72 hours. (A somewhat pricier variation is available from United that allows a week to dither.) It turned out his friend was in fact available, so Rippy bought the tickets.“I had never used a FareLock before - but it saved me $3,000, for $13,” Rippy said. Incidentally, he did check the fare a few days after locking it in, and it had bounced back up over $5,000. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T23:47:24.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
