Mohammed || The Economy Times \nAccording to the Ghana Chamber of Mines, relatively new mining exploration in the country has decline drastically over the years. \nIt cited, a number of disincentive factors contributing to the decline trend which the Chamber sees as a sign of collapsing mining industry in the country. \nAmong some of the factors mentioned are the overburdened pre-exploration taxation that mining companies have to incurred while it is different in almost all the other mining countries in the Africa especially in the sub region. \nThe chief executive officer of the chamber, Sulemanu Koney has therefore called for the need for the government to reconsider some of its mining policies, specifically the fiscal regime policies and directives. \nMr. Koney at a workshop organized for members of the Journalists For Business Advocacy (JBA) in Accra last week, emphasized that, reforms in the mineral code of Burkina Faso has positioned the country as a significant site for exploration in Africa in recent times. \nSimilarly, Cote d’ivoire’s revised mining code has been hailed as the “game changer” on the African continent. Currently, Cote d’ivoire has over taken Ghana in terms of green field projects. \nAlso, Senegal is actively encouraging investments into its mining sector. \nIt is in light of these keen competition for the little foreign direct investment (FDI) in mining exploration in Africa from other countries on the continent that necessitate the repositioning of Ghana’s mining industry to be able to maintain its enviable second position on the continent in mining. \n“It therefore eminent that, to sustain our mining industry we need a pipeline of investments in exploration, development and production,” Mr. Koney urged. \nMiners in the country have over and over again complained that, exploration investment is highly expensive compared to that of other countries, that is, considering the taxes and other levies that have to be paid even before exploration activities begins does not make sense to a serious business entity. \nHowever, the Ghana chamber of mines has said it is engaging government on the possible reconsideration of the taxes before exploration issues and pleads on the government to consider ‘growing the pie of mining revenue’ to have a prolonged future benefits to the country. \nMr. Koney stated that, it has been difficult times for the mining companies all over the world, and have to constantly review their business strategies especially cost management to survive. This gives an indication that, the industry is virtually collapsing at a high rate and something has to be done now to reignite and sustain interest of miners in the country. \nAccording a recent survey by the SRQ and ACET, whose report is yet to be launched, it states that, for every US$ 1.0 of mining company’s profit, the government receives US $ 1.6. This statistics shows how devastating the mining industry is becoming. \nIn 2014, mining accounted for 34% of gross export revenue in the country, with 77.5% on average of the mining revenues brought back into the country, contrary to some assertions by the public that the miners do not bring back their proceeds into the country. \nMr. Koney revealed that, it is on records that mining companies bring back between 73% to 100% of their revenues into the country to enable them continue their businesses and production. He quizzed, if they do not bring back those revenues to reinvest into their operations where and how do they then refinanced their operations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T22:44:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
