Now, the phone will automatically detect pictures that fall into one of those two groups - filing them away in their own folder for easy sharing or deleting.\niPhones already store some kinds of photo away in their own folder - time-lapse, slo-mo, burst photos and videos all get their own album.\nIt seems that the phone decides what a screenshot or a selfie based on how they have been taken, rather than by using any special image recognition technology. Google Photos can also recognise screenshots, selfies and other kinds of pictures - but it does so by using complicated computer programs that recognise the content of the images, and so has to be turned off in Europe.\nThe new feature was found in the latest release of the iOS 9 beta, which was just sent out to public. It also brings the Apple News app, lets people choose to stream at a higher quality in Apple Music and turns off the beep that Siri makes when phones are in silent mode.\nA public beta of iOS is expected to be released soon, letting anyone that signs up get their hands on the software. iOS 9 is set to be released in September, alongside the next iPhone, which is rumoured to have a front-facing flash to let people take selfies in the dark.\nFollow TOI Tech on Twitter >>> @ toi_tech\nAnd like us on Facebook >>> TOI_tech http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=ios9,IOS,Apple OS,Apple,android Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/TOItech", "https://twitter.com/toi_tech", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-07-11T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T10:50:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
