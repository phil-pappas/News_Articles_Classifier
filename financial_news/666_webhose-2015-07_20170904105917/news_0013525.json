(AP Photo/Daniel Ochoa de Olza) \nATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The latest news on Greece's financial woes , a day after the country's bailout with European creditors expired and the country failed to pay a debt due to the International Monetary Fund (all times local): \n___ \n11.43 a.m. \nFrench Finance Minister Michel Sapin is hoping for an agreement with Greece before Sunday's referendum but called the situation \"terrifyingly complicated.\" \nSapin said on French radio RTL that \"the aim is to find an agreement, before the referendum if possible.\" Eurozone finance ministers are set to discuss Greece's latest two-year bailout request later in a teleconference. \n\"If Greece votes yes, negotiations will continue in difficult conditions, but we'd be able to quickly find an agreement,\" he said. \"If Greece votes no, there is a risk of sliding towards a Greek exit from the euro.\" \nSapin also said the \"little countries,\" many of which have taken made big economic changes over the past few years, have taken a tougher stance on Greece than Germany. \n___ \n11.34 a.m. \nCredit ratings agency Standard & Poor's reckons a Greek exit from the euro could \"easily weaken the upturn\" currently taking place in the eurozone. \nThough, the agency says the risks of contagion to other eurozone countries are less elevated that in 2010-11, it does warn that a so-called Grexit could \"lead to increased risk aversion among investors, lenders and consumers.\" \nS&P has upgraded its projections for the eurozone to 1.6 percent growth this year and 1.9 percent next, from the previous 1.5 percent and 1.7 percent. \n___ \n10.45 a.m. \nU.K. Treasury chief George Osborne says the failure of the Greek government to make its scheduled payments to the IMF has only served to add to a sense of crisis in the country. \nGreece failed to repay a debt of roughly 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) to the IMF, becoming the first developed country to fall into arrears since Zimbabwe in 2001. \nOsborne said it is vital to resolve uncertainty to ensure economic and financial stability across Europe. \n\"We hope for the best; but we prepare for the worst, and we stand ready to do whatever is necessary to protect our economic security at this uncertain time,\" he said. \n___ \n10.40 a.m. \nThousands of elderly Greeks thronged banks that were opened especially for pensioners who don't have bank cards, to allow them some access to their money. \nWithdrawals are limited to 120 euros ($133) per person for the week. \nHowever, a seeming last minute decision to serve customers on an alphabetical basis, announced by some banks overnight and others in the morning, led to confusion and frustration. \nMany pensioners waited in line from before dawn but were eventually told they would have to return Thursday or Friday. \nGreek banks have been closed since Monday as the government imposed strict capital controls to prevent a bank run in the wake of its decision to call a referendum on creditor demands. \n___ \n10.30 a.m. \nMarkets took in stride Greece's failure to pay the roughly 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) it owed the IMF with stock indexes across Europe posting solid gains. The Stoxx 50 index of leading European shares was up 0.7 percent while Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent. \nThere appear to be some hopes that Greece's new proposals to the eurozone may meet with some support. Eurozone finance ministers are set to weigh Greece's latest proposal for aid later, in a teleconference that's been put off until 5.30 p.m. Brussels time, according to Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the eurozone's top official. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T11:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T16:14:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
