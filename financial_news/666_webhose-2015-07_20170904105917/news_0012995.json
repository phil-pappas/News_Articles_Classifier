It has been choppy between $1.0955 and $1.1279 this week in reaction to ever-changing developments in Greece. \nAgainst the yen, the euro slipped 0.1 percent to 136.25 , having fallen nearly 1 percent on Tuesday. \nThe International Monetary Fund on Tuesday confirmed Greece had not made its 1.5 billion euro loan repayment. IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said Greece had asked for a last-minute repayment extension, which the Fund's board will consider \"in due course.\" \nWith its missed payment to the IMF, Greece is on a path out of the euro with unforeseeable consequences for both the EU's grand currency project and the global economy. \nYet, there was no major reaction in markets. \n\"There is so much uncertainty, speculation, truth and partial truth that many markets are in stasis; waiting to see which way this goes,\" said Emma Lawson, senior currency strategist at National Australia Bank. \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has ruled out further negotiations with Athens until after Sunday's referendum, when Greek voters decide on whether to stay in the euro zone or return to the drachma. \nOpinion polls show a majority of Greeks favour holding on to the euro, but the referendum is shaping up to be a close call. \nWith the euro on the backfoot, the dollar index drifted up to 95.529 from Tuesday's low of 94.847. Versus the yen, the dollar stood at 122.42, near a five-week low of 121.93 plumbed overnight. \nGreece is likely to continue hogging the headlines, relegating surveys on manufacturing activities to the background.
