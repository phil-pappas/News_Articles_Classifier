(NYSE:ZAYO), a global provider of bandwidth infrastructure, today announced the completion of a dark fiber route between the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) data center facility at 1700 MacArthur Blvd in Mahwah, New Jersey and Equinix's International Business Exchange™ (IBX®) data center at 800 Secaucus Road (NY5), outside of New York City. The completed route spans 37.7 km (panel to panel), making the new route the shortest, lowest latency fiber route currently available between the two locations. By leveraging Zayo's extensive existing fiber footprint, the project will generate an attractive return based on the anchor enterprise customer alone. \nThe route provides financial institutions with the reliable, high-bandwidth and high-speed connectivity required to transport critical financial data. Customers can benefit from reduced latency from Mahwah to major data centers via Equinix's NY5 facility, including 1400 Federal Blvd in Carteret, 300 Boulevard East in Weehawken, 60 Hudson Street and 111 8th Avenue in New York. \n\"The completed Mahwah route enables us to provide financial firms with the best solution for high-bandwidth, low latency connectivity,\" said Zach Nebergall, vice president of metro dark fiber at Zayo. \"As we expand our relationships with customers in the New York area, we will continue to invest in similar opportunities that leverage our existing fiber network to both further drive returns and expand our competitive position.\" \n\"Today, hundreds of capital markets participants, including exchanges, service providers and buy and sell side firms colocate critical trading and supporting systems inside the Equinix Secaucus campus,\" said Stewart Orrell, senior director of global financial marketing at Equinix. \"By providing key new routes from Equinix in Secaucus, Zayo is helping financial services companies transport their critical data with the speed, security and reliability they require to be successful.\" \nThe route connects to Zayo's New Jersey/New York dark fiber network, which spans more than 500 route miles, and Zayo's global network, which extends more than 84,000 route miles across the U.S. and Europe.
