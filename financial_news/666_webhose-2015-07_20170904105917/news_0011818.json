'Crowdfunding was always going to disrupt real estate.' Richard Chan Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell Crowdfunding is popular for new gadgets, indie concerts and quirky experiences, but one start-up about to list in Australia hopes the funding system can work for real estate development, too.\nCoAssets, a Singaporean-based company that runs a website used to raise money for property developments around south-east Asia, will list on Australia's smaller index, the National Stock Exchange, on Wednesday.\nFounder and chief executive Getty Goh is aware many people may be wary of his offering that raises money in an industry rich with available capital.\n\"The listing is about credibility,\" Goh told Fairfax Media. \"We recognise for a lot of consumers this kind of investments and backing start-ups is quite risky. People are very sensitive to that so we wanted to set ourselves apart and show we were solid from the beginning.\"\nCoAssets launched in April 2013 and went through a series of Singaporean-government-backed schemes to develop quickly, including the Expara accelerator.\nSince then, the company has registered about 11,400 investors and raised more than $36 million for mostly residential developments. Goh says they have another $445 million worth of projects in active rounds or scheduled to come onto the platform.\nProperty developers seeking capital pitch their plans to the CoAssets team. Once it works, the project is loaded onto the site where investors can commit as little as $1000 or more to be part of a minor shareholder cohort co-ordinated by the CoAssets team.\nProjects listed so far have raised between $1 million and $10 million and been proposed by developers in Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. These include affordable accommodation blocks in Indonesia, a deluxe hotel in Thailand, and the redevelopment of a waterfront property in Sydney's Balmain.\n \"Not every deal that applies to comes on our site gets listed, and if they list there is a success rate of one in four, as investors can read a lot about the project, where it is and what the plans are,\" Goh said.\nIn a region teeming with investors as well as scouts for global investment firms from all over the world, some may ask why developers would choose to raise funds from people they have never met, or why someone would invest their money with an entrepreneur they are unlikely to meet.\n\"It's a good question; but it's about giving people the chance to reach opportunities they otherwise wouldn't,\" Goh said. \"We work with a lot of smaller operations, and see ourselves as an incubator for tomorrow's big property developers.\"\nReal estate crowdfunding is taking off around the world, led by US companies RealCrowd, FundRise and Prodigy Network, which regularly raise several million and proffer an average return of about 12 per cent.\nAmong these companies' most ambitious projects is FundRise's for a stake in 3 World Trade Centre, the third-tallest building slated for the World Trade Centre, comprising mostly high-end corporate office space.\n\"Crowdfunding was always going to disrupt real estate,\" Goh said. \"The bigger perspective now is people who can see opportunities that established investors don't can be part of the solution.\"\nThough there are a range of Australian properties on the site, Goh said no Australian developer has raised funds on the platform yet. He said his team would be focused on developing their presence in Australia throughout the year, with a view to listing on the Australian Securities Exchange in late 2016.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711", "https://twitter.com/rosepowell"], "published": "2015-07-06T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T22:04:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
