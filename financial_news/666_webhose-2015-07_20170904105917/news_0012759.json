Last year, Petrobras had its first operating loss since 1991 because of fuel sold below import costs and the write-offs.\nPetrobras, as the company is known, has recouped almost 300 million reais from illegal offshore accounts of former executives after they became the state’s witnesses and agreed to revert the proceeds of corruption. That’s just a fraction of the 6.2 billion reais ($1.8 billion) the company wrote off for 2014.\nBendine also said Friday that, while Petrobras has been holding meetings with bankers to discuss the potential initial public offering of its fuel distribution unit, the company has yet to pick a firm to lead the transaction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T21:42:23.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
