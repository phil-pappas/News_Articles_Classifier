They are lying with the full knowledge of that fact. \n\"No means powerful pressure for a financial agreement that will give a solution to the debt ... an agreement that is socially just.\" \nMr Tsipras said Europe must stop acting in an \"undemocratic way\" and sought to reassure Greeks that their bank deposits were safe. \nThe speech came after he wrote to creditors saying that Greece will accept terms by the European Commission on Sunday but with a number of amendments. \nGreece wants to keep a reduced level of VAT for its islands, reduce the size of cuts to its military budget and delay the phasing out of a supplement for some retired people. \nThe move comes after Mr Tsipras previously rejected conditions that the creditors wanted Greece to meet in exchange for further bailouts. \nGermany, the largest single contributor to Greece's bailout, said the proposal wasn't good enough. \nChancellor Angela Merkel told the German parliament: \"We will wait for the referendum. There can be no negotiations on a new aid program before the referendum.\" \nBut French President Francois Hollande urged an accord before then, saying it was the responsibility of other countries that use the shared currency to keep Greece in the eurozone. \nHe said: \"We have to be clear. An accord is for right now, it will not be put off. If it doesn't happen, we would have to wait for a referendum, but there is always a risk of turbulence and a leap into the void.\" \nEurozone finance ministers are due to look at Mr Tsipras' latest proposals at 5.30pm on Wednesday. \nSky (Other OTC: BSYBF - news ) 's Robert Nisbet says the Greek Parliament has been closed ahead of the referendum on Sunday but may reopen if a bailout deal can be reached. \nHe said there is confusion over whether the latest proposal relates to the bailout deal that has already expired or a deal relating to a later tranche of funds due to become available shortly. \nIf a deal is to be reached, Mr Tsipras wants to keep VAT in the Greek islands at 16%, compared to the level on the mainland at 23%. \nThe discount is in place to account for the added cost to residents of goods being shipped off shore, but could increase costs for tourists if abolished. \nHe also wants the EKAS scheme phased out more slowly. Under Mr Tsipras' plan, the variable supplement that gets paid to pensioners to bring their monthly income up to â‚¬700, would continue to be paid to the richest 20% for longer. \nThe original deal asked for EKAS to be phased out for the richest fifth immediately, with it being phased out for all pensioners by 2019. \nThe letter also asked for a delay to an extension of individual business income tax, and a smaller cut in the military budget. \nFinancial markets reacted positively to the developments initially, with all the major stock markets regaining some of the ground lost this week. \nThe euro climbed against sterling, but investors remained cautious. \nAt a news conference to outline the Bank of England's latest Financial Stability Report, its governor Mark Carney warned the outlook for UK financial stability had \"worsened\" because of the crisis in Greece.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T19:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T19:41:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
