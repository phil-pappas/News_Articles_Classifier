Mr Kusher said capital city home values have risen by 26.8 per cent since reaching their most recent low point in May 2012, while the Australian dollar has fallen by 13.3 per cent in trade-weighted index terms over that period. Investor activity, both domestic and foreign, in the housing sector has surged in recent years on the back of record low interest rates and strong gains in home values in certain areas. \"With the RBA stating that the Australian dollar remains overvalued, any further falls in the Aussie dollar are likely to result in even more attractive buying conditions for foreign buyers,\" Mr Kusher said. \"We expect that particularly from China the level of investment will continue to grow exponentially year-on-year for quite a while.\" Foreign Investment Review Board figures put China as the largest foreign real estate investor in Australia, followed by the US. Mr Kusher said recent government measures aimed at maintaining stability in China's share market may even give Chinese investors even more resolve to invest offshore. \"We also think as different countries make different rules around foreign buyers, that might even drive more Chinese buyers to Australia.\" ", "external_links": ["http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/aust-housing-more-appealing-for-foreigners/story-e6frfkur-1227435586522?sv=9d3c18500c0c9a32e45fcd0f89bf55a&title=Aust+housing+more+appealing+for+foreigners", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/aust-housing-more-appealing-for-foreigners/story-e6frfkur-1227435586522?sv=9d3c18500c0c9a32e45fcd0f89bf55a&title=Aust+housing+more+appealing+for+foreigners", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/aust-housing-more-appealing-for-foreigners/story-e6frfkur-1227435586522?sv=9d3c18500c0c9a32e45fcd0f89bf55a&h=Aust+housing+more+appealing+for+foreigners", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/aust-housing-more-appealing-for-foreigners/story-e6frfkur-1227435586522?sv=9d3c18500c0c9a32e45fcd0f89bf55a", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Aust+housing+more+appealing+for+foreigners&c=HOUSING+may+look+expensive+to+many+Australians+but+a+falling+Australian+dollar+is+expected+to+increase+its+appeal+to+foreign+buyers.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/aust-housing-more-appealing-for-foreigners/story-e6frfkur-1227435586522?sv=9d3c18500c0c9a32e45fcd0f89bf55a", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/aust-housing-more-appealing-for-foreigners/story-e6frfkur-1227435586522?sv=9d3c18500c0c9a32e45fcd0f89bf55a"], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T03:32:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
