The group includes Brigade Capital Management, Candlewood Investment Group and Perry Corp., said the people.\nPuerto Rico’s bondholders are examining their options after Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said last month that his administration would attempt to put off payments on some obligations. The comments by Garcia Padilla, who called on officials to come up with a debt-restructuring plan by Aug. 30, triggered the biggest price decline in the commonwealth’s general-obligation debt in at least two decades.\nSusan Peters, a spokeswoman for Davis Polk, Aaron Daniels, associate general counsel for Brigade, and Michael Neus, general counsel at Perry, didn’t immediately return telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment. Michael Lau, chief executive officer of Candlewood, declined to comment.\nThe new group was formed to represent bondholder interests in the exchange offers that Puerto Rico officials are expected to advance, said two of the people. It also could pursue other strategies, they said.\nThe creditors of the GDB have been working for weeks to organize as the island lurches toward a September deadline when the development bank is expected to run out of cash, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg last month.\nThe GDB’s liquidity has waned as it’s lent more to other government agencies on the junk-rated island. Net liquidity fell to $778 million at the end of May from $1.02 billion a month earlier, according to data released on the bank’s website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T21:29:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
