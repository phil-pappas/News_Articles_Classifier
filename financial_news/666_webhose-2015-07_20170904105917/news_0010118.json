The answers he gave doctors during a medical assessment were literal, intense and lacking in social niceties, Cooke said. They contained no irony or humor.\nThe 35-year-old Hayes has pleaded not guilty to eight counts of conspiracy to manipulate the London interbank offered rate, the benchmark used to value more than $350 trillion of loans and securities. Each count carries as much as 10 years in prison.\nHayes, who took the stand for the first time Tuesday, said he had not conspired dishonestly to manipulate Libor. His wife, Sarah, was in the courtroom for the first time in the 28-day trial.\nProsecutors say Hayes persuaded, bullied and cajoled fellow traders and brokers to move benchmark rates to make his positions more profitable. Hayes’s lawyers say the practice was widespread.\nHayes’s ability to understand mathematical patterns is a characteristic of Asperger’s, Cooke said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T13:14:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
