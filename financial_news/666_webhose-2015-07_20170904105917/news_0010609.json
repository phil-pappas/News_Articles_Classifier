Whichever way,\" Dijsselbloem, who is also the Dutch finance minister, told reporters ahead of a cabinet meeting in The Hague. \n\"But we have to see whether the proposals will genuinely help pull Greece from the doldrums,\" Dijsselbloem added, two days ahead of a summit of EU leaders on Sunday. \nThe summit bringing together leaders of all 28 EU nations, not just the 19 that use the euro, could yet be cancelled if an agreement is reached beforehand. \nHowever even if that is the case parliaments in several EU nations, notably Germany, will have to vote on whether to accept Greece's reform plan in exchange for another huge bailout -- its third in five years. \nIn a bid to head off a possible challenge to the measures within his hard-left party Syriza, Tsipras urged his lawmakers \"to stand united and firm in front of these important decisions.\" \nThe Greek offer, set out in a 13-page document, concedes to Greece's paymasters on several key points that Tsipras's ruling coalition -- and the Greek voters, in a referendum last weekend -- had previously fiercely opposed. \n\"Greece has come across on almost all issues and has clearly shown its willingness to compromise,\" said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at the German bank ING-DiBa. \n- Tsipras's gamble - \nThe reforms agree to creditors' demands to overhaul pensions, increase sales taxes, and commit to privatisations. But they seek to limit changes on other thorny issues, including tax breaks for Greece's islands and cuts to military spending. \nThe proposal aims to procure financing \"for three years, debt adjustment and a front-loaded investment package of 35 billion euros ($38 billion),\" a Greek government source said. \nTsipras is taking a political gamble by making any concessions to creditors' demands. \nHardliners in Syriza and coalition partner the Independent Greeks have obstinately rejected further austerity. \nSyriza's parliamentary spokesman, Dimitris Vitsas, urged party MPs \"to support the government's effort to reach a deal,\" saying it \"kicks off the resolution of the debt issue.\" \nAlthough Greek voters last Sunday roundly voted \"No\" to accepting tough austerity terms for a bailout that expired June 30, they are alarmed at capital controls that have closed banks and rationed ATM cash. \nThey overwhelmingly want to keep the euro. \n\"The government has to find a deal with its European partners no matter what. We didn't vote 'No' to leave the eurozone,\" said a pensioner in Athens, Nikos Eftekidis. \nBut another pensioner, Giorgos, said the \"government's proposed measures are very tough, I wasn't expecting that. That's not what the Greeks voted for.\" \nGermany leads a bloc of eurozone nations saying that, after two bailouts over the past five years totalling 240 billion euros, and 107 billion euros in debt forgiveness in 2012, Greece is looking like bottomless money pit. \nTsipras hopes his new offer will pass muster with those hostile eurozone countries, and open the door to creditors discussing another round of relief from Greece's suffocating 320-billion-euro ($350-billion) mountain of debt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:34:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
