On the other hand, we are confident that as the economy rebounds, the expenditure envelope will increase in tandem with revenue. In the interim, focus will be on pipeline projects and MDA/MMDAs are not to incur unauthorized expenditures beyond their budgets and budget allotments. \n'Mr. Speaker, against this background, I have come to this House to request for Supplementary Estimates of GH¢865,789,380.00 in accordance with Article 179 (8) of the 1992 Constitution and Standing Order 143 of this House,' Mr. Terkper requested. \nHe said the government is on track to achieve its target.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T02:59:52.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
