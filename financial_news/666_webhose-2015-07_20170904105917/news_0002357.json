PUBLISHED: 15:50, Fri, Jul 10, 2015 | UPDATED: 16:04, Fri, Jul 10, 2015 GETTY The car hire rules have been altered \nAt the beginning of June the paper part of the UK driving licence was abolished and motorists were required to provide rental companies with a unique DVLA code that allows the firm to check online driving records. But the code only worked for 72 hours and critics said the window was too short. Holidaying Brits would be severely inconvenienced if they wished to hire a car halfway through a trip, as they would have to find internet to log on to the DVLA's 'Share Driving Licence' website with their driving licence number and National Insurance number. The DVLA has now backed down and agreed to extend the code's validity to 21 days.Nine out of ten drivers previously surveyed by Money.co.uk said the 72 hour window was not long enough.

However, the added complication of needing a National Insurance number could also cause problems as many do not carry it with them. Critics have now called on the DVLA to also axe this requirement. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of Money.co.uk, said: \"The abolition of the paper counterpart of the British driving licence has caused the chaos we predicted, particularly for drivers hiring cars overseas.\"Today’s announcement from the DVLA to extend the validity window of the share driving licence code from just three to 21 days is wonderful news and should help resolve some of the teething problems. \"However, the second issue that the DVLA still hasn’t addressed is the fact that drivers need to use their National Insurance number to generate the code. \"This is a piece of information that many people do not have to hand, particularly when they travel. This initiative set out to simplify the DVLA’s services and save the Government £8 million. \"To truly simplify this service, the DVLA should rethink the information required to generate the code without compromising security.”It's thought the changes could particularly impact older people who don't have access to the internet or who are not online savvy - they are instead required to ring the DVLA in order to get the code. A DVLA spokeswoman said drivers should check with their hire company in advance what documents or information will be required. What you should take to hire a car abroad:*A 72-hour or 21-day access code*Your photocard driving licenceIf you've only got a paper driving licence (that's licences issued before 1998) you need to keep hold of it - these remain valid and should not be destroyed.
