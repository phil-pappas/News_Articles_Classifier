Of the total contribution, the largest share has been donated by Ola's driver partners. The contribution goes to the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund, (PMNRF). Pranay Jivrajka, COO at Ola said , “We are extremely proud of the contribution that has been made by our driver partners and customers. Our driver partners took the initiative extremely seriously, generously contributed, and helped in maximizing the amount of contribution by informing every customer that took a ride in their car about Ola’s initiative towards the relief work. We are proud to share that we have collected a total fund of Rs. 35 lakhs with the largest share from our driver partners.” Ola’s customers contributed towards the relief fund by entering the code ‘Nepal’ when recharging their Ola wallet.
