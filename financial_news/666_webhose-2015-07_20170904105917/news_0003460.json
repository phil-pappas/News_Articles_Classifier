When Twitter Inc. reports its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday , interim chief executive Jack Dorsey will be in an awkward spot.\nAs he talks to investors about Twitter’s TWTR, -2.03% potentially underwhelming results, they may wonder if he is fully focused on the social media pioneer. That’s because his other company, mobile payments provider Square, has reportedly confidentially filed for an initial public offering.\nAnd that IPO, while it involves a seemingly hot, well-known startup, could be a tough slog.\n“They are losing a lot of money,” said Sam Hamadeh, Chief Executive of PrivCo, which provides data and research on private companies.\nUnlike the major credit card companies, Hamadeh said merchants using Square’s credit card reader do not pay an up-front flat fee. Instead, Square is paid a small percentage of the transaction. PrivCo estimates that Square lost money on about $900 million in revenue in 2014, before its fees to banks and other partners.\n“If you charge $2, you are only paying 5 cents [to Square],” Hamadeh explained. “You are simply asking for people that no one else would want to become your customers. …It’s a terrible business model.”\nSquare’s business model is also deployed by late-arriving rivals PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL, -1.65% and Intuit Inc. INTU, -1.58% both of which now offer credit card readers for mobile devices. However, PayPal and Intuit have other far larger profit-generating businesses. In Intuit’s most recent earnings in May, the company did not break out revenue or separate results from its GoPayment credit card-processing unit, which is part of its small business online ecosystem.\nSquare’s investment bankers — reportedly Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and J.P. Morgan — may also be shopping the company to see if it would fit better at a more well-rounded company. Last year, the Wall Street Journal reported that Square had been looking at shopping itself amid widening losses, and that it had talked to Google Inc. GOOG, +0.59% sometime in early 2014. A spokesman at the time, however, said that Square was not and had never engaged in acquisition talks with Google.\n“Honestly, if I were a banker at Goldman, I would think this is a good way to put the company in play to be bought,” Hamadeh said.\nA spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Square declined to comment on reports, initially by Bloomberg News , that Square has filed to go public via the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS, Act, which lets companies with annual revenue of less than $1 billion file their documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission privately. She also declined to comment on speculation about Square’s financial results.\nDorsey, who co-founded Twitter in 2006, has returned as its interim CEO to help the social media pioneer refocus in a leadership void. Last month, Dick Costolo, its CEO since 2009, stepped down under pressure as the company’s user growth and financial results continue to disappoint Wall Street.\nBut the pending IPO of Dorsey’s other “baby” — which he owns about 25% of — could put Dorsey in a bit of a pressure cooker, if indeed Square’s numbers are not pretty. Square’s IPO also puts Twitter in a difficult spot with a need to more quickly replace Dorsey.\nThe company’s CEO search already had one major unique difficulty factor: Twitter has three of its former CEOs on its board: Dorsey, Costolo and co-founder Ev Williams. Any incoming CEO is going to be leery of stepping into that minefield, combined with the rumored drama at a company that is nearly as famous for the infighting in its early days as for adding words like hashtag and tweets to our daily lexicon. Williams said at a conference earlier this month that he did not believe the board’s makeup would be a factor, but that he was willing to step down if a new CEO “would prefer one fewer CEO on the board.”\nAlternatively, the Square IPO news could also have a positive impact on Twitter’s CEO search, by further clarifying that Dorsey is not going to be Twitter’s CEO on a permanent basis. Potential contenders who are on the fence about making their interest known could come forward.\nWhatever Square does in the next several months, be it an IPO or shop itself, it’s clear that Dorsey needs to steer it in the right direction. And that cannot happen if it he also in charge at Twitter.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303825604579513882989476424", "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/07/14/twitters-ev-williams-id-leave-board-if-three-ex-ceos-is-a-problem/", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-24/square-said-to-file-confidentially-for-initial-public-offering"], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T04:42:07.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
