Source: Supplied\nThe 71-second video shows a man filming himself with a woman in front of a mirror. A Uniqlo store announcement can be heard clearly in the background welcoming customers and advising them that fitting rooms are on the second and third floors while cashiers are on the first.\nUniqlo has denied any involvement in the video. It also has urged shoppers to make proper use of its fitting rooms, which already have become a euphemism for make-out spots among China’s web users, who are urging other clothing retailers to enlarge their fitting rooms to attract new clientele.\nThe online carnival is abating, however, now that the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has chastised two of the country’s main internet companies for allowing the video to go viral. It had been circulating mainly on Sina Corp.’s microblogging site and Tencent Holding Ltd.’s popular mobile message app. The agency summoned senior management of the two companies for face-to-face reprimands Wednesday, and by Thursday the video was difficult to find.\nBeijing police also announced that it would investigate. Chinese law bans the manufacture of obscene material while cyber-rules ban its spread online.\n“The viral circulation of the obscene fitting room video on the internet ... has severely violated socialist core values,” the CAC said in a statement.\nThe CAC also suggested that the incident could have been a publicity stunt.\nOnline searches for Uniqlo has soared as a result. Source: AP\n“Highly concerned Web users have reprimanded the acts that are suspected vulgar marketing or event marketing ... and have called for severe punishment,” the official said.\nSina and Tencent must “further improve their social responsibility awareness”, the official added.\nChina’s Communist Party oversees a vast censorship system — dubbed the Great Firewall — that aggressively blocks sites or snuffs out content and commentary that is pornographic, violent or deemed politically sensitive.\nPopular social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are inaccessible in the country, as is YouTube.\nUniqlo “firmly” denied the video was a marketing ploy in a statement posted on its website and verified Weibo account.\n“As a responsible international brand, Uniqlo ... would like to ask consumers to abide by social ethics, maintain social justice and correctly and properly use the fitting spaces provided by Uniqlo stores,” it said.\nIThe store has become something of a tourist attraction.
