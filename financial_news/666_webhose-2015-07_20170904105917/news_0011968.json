Pat Scala Share on twitter by Ben Potter The greatest business disruption since the Industrial Revolution is helping to fuel \"high single-digit\" revenue growth for KPMG in Australia and the United States this year, local chairman Peter Nash says.\nTo counter it, KPMG is investing in big data analytics start-ups via its own venture capital fund to deliver new digital tools more quickly to clients that are desperate to make sense of oceans of data about their customers and suppliers.\nMr Nash said the sector was benefiting from good growth in the US, China, Canada, India and Japan, strong liquidity and transaction flows in markets, and demand from corporate clients for help in dealing with the \"unprecedented disruption to their business models\".\n\"I am particularly optimistic about the business environment for professional services firms,\" Mr Nash said after attending a meeting of chiefs from KPMG's top 25 global markets in New York last week. \"We'd look to the next 12 months with optimism for achieving probably high single-digit growth in Australia and the US.\"\nMr Nash reported that a \"generally positive dynamic\" emerged from the KPMG chiefs' meeting, shaped by encouraging economic news from the US, China, India, Japan and South Korea.\nHe said Australia should be alert to the implications of Greece's anti-bailout vote for global growth but not unduly alarmed, because it was unlikely to be a \"pervasive influence on our economy\" .\nMr Nash said demand for the firm's business advisory and management consulting services was also driving growth as companies grappled with the \"all-time high\" rate of business disruption in their markets and the challenge of building new markets.\n\"It's very, very demanding and as a result you'd expect them to be reaching out to us for help [in dealing with disruption] for a considerable amount of time.\"\n Urgent need for new tools Mr Nash said the rate of change is a challenge to businesses, advisers and governments, and those that do not address it risk falling behind the competition.\n\"If we are to grasp the opportunity we have to think of it as a wave of change as disruptive as the Industrial Revolution,\" he said. \"To ignore it or to think of it as something less significant than the Industrial Revolution would be not only to miss the opportunity but to set our economy back.\"\nMr Nash said that, apart from services traditionally associated with digital disruption such as communications and retail, professional services such as accounting, law and engineering were starting to feel the impact of globalisation.\nThat was creating an urgent need for new digital tools as firms faced a choice between either being disrupted or disrupting themselves and their rivals with new channels to market.\nTo deliver such tools to clients more quickly than KPMG could build them itself, the company invested in a range of big data start-ups via KPMG Capital's now closed $US100 million fund.\nThese start-ups include Customer Compass, which harvests information about customers from digital and physical sources and presents it visually to clients; Bottlenose, which trawls social and broadcast media to tell clients how they're faring in the collective public mind; and Astrus, which harvests data to forewarn companies about potential problems with environmental, social, regulatory and criminal breaches by suppliers.\nKPMG Capital was launched in November 2013. Mr Nash said it was necessary because the rate of digital disruption was so great that the firm felt it needed help to get new tools to clients as soon as possible to help them unlock value from their data.
