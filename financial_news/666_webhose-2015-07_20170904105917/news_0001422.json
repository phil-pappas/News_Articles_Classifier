Not in rugby league, but job creation.\nTHE Premier State dominated the June employment figures, with the number of people with a job currently rising by 12,200 a month.\nThat compares to a national rate of 15,200 a month, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics trend estimates - a smoothed-out version of the more volatile seasonally adjusted numbers. If you add up the state and territory totals, rather than take the bureau's own estimate of the national trend, employment is growing at 18,400 a month. Either way, it's mostly NSW. You can throw in a bit from Queensland, with the Sunshine State adding 3,500 jobs a month. The other states and territories? Not much happening there. It's what economists have been rather hopefully calling \"rebalancing\" - as Western Australia and the minerals-rich parts of other states and territories slow down, other sectors of the economy pick up the slack. The switch is being driven by booming housing prices, which is prompting home building, and the help to tourism hot spots of a lower Australian dollar. The rebalancing - or transition, baton change, handover or sector rotation, call it what you like - isn't happening fast enough. Total employment growth really needs to pick up to over 20,000 a month to lower the unemployment rate. But at least jobs growth is happening.
