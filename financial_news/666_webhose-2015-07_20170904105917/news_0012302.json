Whether you support gay marriage or shudder at the thought, you probably have realized this is a very significant decision. It’s particularly important to small business owners, who will want to be sure they remain within the law as they serve customers. \nThe ruling does not apply to bona fide churches, which still have the right to do marriages within the guidelines of their faith. If, however, a church is registered as a business but is not registered with the IRS as a tax-exempt church, the easiest thing to do is to comply with the ruling. (There are many churches today that have opted out of tax exempt status. For the purpose of the law, they are probably going to be considered businesses, and thus must comply.) \nCompanies who conduct wedding as a business are also likely need to comply. The difference can be hard to understand, but in general, if your business is called “Cathy Watson’s Mormon Weddings” and you only do weddings for Mormons, you are not going to need to comply, but if your business is “Cathy Watson’s Weddings,” then you will. If you have a Mormon Wedding business (or a Muslim one, etc.) then you will need to keep very accurate records indeed to show that you never, ever deviate from doing Mormon Weddings, or Muslim ones, or whichever religion your charter mentions. You’ll also likely have to be able to show that you ask for some kind of proof of membership of the individuals requesting the service. In other words, if you do weddings ONLY for members of a faith that is tax-exempt as a church and does not conduct gay marriages, then you will need to ask for a copy of a baptism or membership record for each party, strictly to protect yourself. \nThere’s an easy way around this confusion, of course. If you serve clients of any faith, whether you make wedding cakes, doorbell pulls, or conduct civil marriages, you don’t have to worry about whether or not you’ll be complying. Set some simple and clear rules, if you feel the need: No naked weddings, no sex acts depicted on cakes, no phallus or vagina depictions. As long as you don’t discriminate against one group or another, keep within local community moral values and you’ll do just fine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T11:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T16:38:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
