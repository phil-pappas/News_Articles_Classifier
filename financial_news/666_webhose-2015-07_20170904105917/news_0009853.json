The kingdom's biggest lender, National Commercial Bank, fell 1.5 percent.\nSaudi Arabian Mining Co. (Ma'aden) lost 1.3 percent after the price of one of its products, copper, fell to a six-year low as Chinese manufacturing contracted by the most in 15 months in July.\nSahara Petrochemical Co dropped 2.3 percent, having reported a 94 percent decrease in second-quarter profit.\nBanque Saudi Fransi fell 2.6 percent as its shares no longer carried a semiannual dividend. Herfy Food was down 1.0 percent for the same reason.\nUAE, EGYPT\nDubai's index fell 1.3 percent as all but a handful of stocks declined. Lender Emirates NBD, down 2.3 percent, was one of the main drags on the benchmark. It had risen 10.4 percent last week on strong second-quarter results.\nAmlak Finance, which had gained about 150 percent since the stock resumed trading in early June, dropped 3.6 percent. Many institutional investors believe the stock's dramatic rise was fuelled by speculation and it is overvalued by commonly used metrics.\nNational Central Cooling Co. (Tabreed) was one of just a few gainers, climbing 0.7 percent after posting a 2 percent increase in second-quarter profit.\nAbu Dhabi's market slipped 0.4 percent and Abu Dhabi National Energy Co (TAQA), whose earnings are sensitive to oil prices, tumbled 4.2 percent. Another energy firm, Dana Gas, fell 5.1 percent.\nQatar's index edged down 0.3 percent and heavyweight Ezdan Holding was the main drag, sliding 1.1 percent ahead of its second-quarter earnings announcement. After trading closed, the firm which has interests in real estate, finance and other industries, reported a 30 percent rise in second-quarter net profit.\nEgypt's market gave up early gains and closed 1.0 percent lower with most stocks in the red.{PHDC.CA;PCTCHNG}\n\"I think it's just profit-booking in some property names and banks,\" said Harshjit Oza, analyst at the Cairo-based Naeem brokerage.\nAlso, Palm Hills Development tumbled 6.2 percent ahead of the addition of new shares placed through a rights issue, which will dilute the existing stock.\nSUNDAY'S HIGHLIGHTS\nSAUDI ARABIA\n* The index lost 0.8 percent to 9,302 points.\nDUBAI\n* The index fell 1.3 percent to 4,148 points.\nABU DHABI\n* The index edged down 0.4 percent to 4,881 points.\nQATAR\n* The index fell 0.3 percent to 11,909 points.\nEGYPT\n* The index slid 1.0 percent to 8,005 points.\nKUWAIT\n* The index slipped 0.1 percent to 6,282 points.\nBAHRAIN\n* The index was flat at 1,337 points.
