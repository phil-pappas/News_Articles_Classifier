Last Friday, the editors of the publication announced the recipients of the 2015 40 Under 40 Awards representing the most accomplished young talent in the Silicon Valley area. \nMichelle Crosby launched Wevorce, a company dedicated to changing divorce for good by keeping families out of court. With a step-by-step approach, Wevorce helps couples divorce amicably using its web-based technology to offer structure and automate the paperwork. Methodology focuses on the untangling of complex issues while mitigating the mental anguish and financial burden of divorce, all at a fraction of the cost. \nThrough the divorce archetypes that Michelle and her team developed, Wevorce can predict the costs and steps families need to take to settle their divorce with 97% accuracy. And, the services generally cost about one-third of a typical divorce (the national avg. is $27,000). To date, Wevorce has processed over $40 million in assets through its platform and has saved families about $4M in legal fees. Over 300 families have engaged with Wevorce, and in 2014, Wevorce kept 100% of its active families out of court. \nMost recently, Michelle created the Wevorce Community, a network of diverse professionals that has grown from 20 members to more than 400 since March 2015. Wevorce is now able to provide post-divorce services to families also in need of real estate, insurance, financial or emotional support. \n\"I am humbled to be a recipient of this award and would like to thank Silicon Valley Business Journal.
