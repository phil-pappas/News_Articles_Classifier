The company's swoosh logo and \"Just Do It\" motto are ubiquitous in sports. \nToday Nike sponsors many of the world's most iconic athletes, including Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Serena Williams, Rory McIlroy, Roger Federer, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar. \nLast week, Nike reported fiscal 2015 earnings of $3.3 billion on $30.6 billion in revenues. \nKnight, who Forbes says has a net worth of about $24.3 billion, said he planned to stay involved with Nike. \n\"For me, Nike has always been more than just a company ? it has been my life?s passion,\" Knight said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T02:33:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
