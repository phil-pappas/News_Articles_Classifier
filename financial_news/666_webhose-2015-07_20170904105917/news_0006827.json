IFAD, UPU and the World Bank saw that in order to reduce the cost of remittance to Africa and throughout Africa, they needed to help Ghana Post. This project would enhance remittances in Africa and outside Africa,' Mr Adu-Boafo said. \nHe added that Ghana Post was currently in talks with the Ministry of Communications and the Bank of Ghana (BoG) to obtain a minimum license. \nActing Managing Director said the World Bank and some of the partners for the project would provide Ghana Post with generators, computers, other accessories and funds to improve services in Ghana to reduce the cost of remittances.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T15:57:08.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
