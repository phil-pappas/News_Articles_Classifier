( Tweet This ) \n\"My guess is we're following Europe. The retail sales number was so bad that we're not reacting to it,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. It's a \"continuation of the Greek (relief) rally.\" \nEuropean stocks ended mildly higher on hopes that the Greek parliament will pass the legislation needed to secure a third bailout. Asian shares were mixed with Chinese stocks ending a three-day winning streak to close just over 1 percent lower. \nThe Greek finance ministry submitted a reform bill Tuesday. The nation's parliament has until Wednesday night to approve the legislation, paving the way for Athens to meet a Monday repayment deadline to the European Central Bank. \nU.S. equities rose further in the afternoon but gains remained muted in light volume trade. \n\"If (Greece and Germany) can't get this passed by Monday then all hell could break loose again,\" said John Caruso, senior market strategist at RJ O'Brien & Associates. \nHe expects gold to decline further and prices on the 10-year Treasury note to rise towards last week's highs. \nRead More Greece secures bailout: What next? \nIn other international news, Iran and six major powers early on Tuesday clinched a historic nuclear deal that will see some sanctions against Tehran eased in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program. \nU.S. crude oil settled 84 cents higher at $53.04 a barrel. Earlier, oil briefly fell more than 2 percent as investors anticipated an increase in Iran oil exports as sanctions are eased. The energy sector rose more than half a percent as the second-best sector in the S&P 500. \n\"I think the biggest change in sentiment is energy turning around,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. \n\"With (Iran) as a backdrop I think we're going to focus on how companies are doing,\" he said earlier. View photo . \nThe S&P 500 held above 2,110, while the Dow Jones industrial average topped 18,000. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed, trading above 5,110, as biotechs surged more than 2 percent and Apple ( AAPL ) gained. The Dow transports rose slightly. \n\"Yesterday's 1.1 percent rally in the SPX allowed it to break out from a short-term consolidation phase, which we view as a positive technical catalyst,\" BTIG Chief Technical Strategist Katie Stockton said in a note. \"Next and final resistance is at the May high near 2135, which we believe is surmountable in the weeks ahead.\" \nThe Dow swung back into the black for the year on Monday as stocks surged more than 1 percent following news of a bailout deal between Greece and its creditors. \nLast week \"you tested support perfectly and support held. Right now the absence of bad news (overseas) is good news,\" said Adam Sarhan, CEO of Sarhan Capital. \"The data is very bullish for the easy money trade.\" \nStock index futures were narrowly mixed in early trade, with S&P and Dow futures extending losses slightly after retail sales showed a decline of 0.3 percent, missing expectations of a 0.3 percent increase. \n\"I think we're still cautious because we have some major events-Beige book tomorrow,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital. \nRead More Banks, retail sales, Iran may steal the thunder from Greece \nIn other economic news, May business inventories rose 0.3 percent , in-line with expectations. Business sales rose 0.4 percent after increasing 0.5 percent in April. \nU.S. import prices unexpectedly fell in June as the lingering effects of a strong dollar offset rising costs for petroleum products, keeping imported inflation pressure under wraps. \nTreasury yields recovered losses after the inventory report, with the 10-year yield (U.S.:US10Y) at 2.41 percent after dipping below 2.4 percent on retail sales. The dollar fell against world currencies, with the euro above $1.10 and the yen at 123 yen against the greenback. \n\"I think to some extent the focus on the overseas problem (has) allowed us to ignore that we have a growth problem in the U.S.,\" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. \"Especially if you get disappointment in things like retail sales, that's going to underscore that trend.\" \nEarlier, U.S. small business confidence fell in June to its lowest level in more than a year amid expectations of weaker profits and a softening labor market, which could temper expectations for strong economic growth in the second half. \n\"To a certain extent, bad news keeps the Fed at bay,\" said Ben Pace, chief investment officer at HPM Partners. \"Maybe the thought is the Fed might delay (a rate hike).\" \nThe data comes ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's semi-annual testimony before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. \nRead More Odds on for September rate hike: Fisher \nKansas City Fed President Esther George speaks at 8:15 p.m. ET Tuesday on economic conditions and monetary policy. \nSecond-quarter earnings season kicked off with banks JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC ) and pharmaceutical firm Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) reporting before the opening bell.
