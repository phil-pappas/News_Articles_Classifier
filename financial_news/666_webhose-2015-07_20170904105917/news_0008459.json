Here Are the First 8 U.S. Stocks to Buy Written by: Laurie Kulikowski 07/23/15 - 2:49 PM EDT Tickers in this article: ABX DFT DHT EYES FB GDP MHR MNKD MSFT NEWT YHOO \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) - Looking for some stock-picking inspiration? \nJim Collins, a contributor to Real Money (a sister-site to TheStreet ), created a Sweet 16 list of long-only U.S. stocks together for an international client. Collins, who runs Portfolio Guru , noted the list does not include any preferred shares, ETFs, call options, etc. \n\"I certainly don't see much near-term upside for this market, so I leaned heavily on my income-investing principles in the construction of his portfolio,\" Collins wrote on Thursday . \"We'll beat a flat market because of the portfolio's yield of about 5%, and we should substantially outperform a declining market due to the portfolio's low risk profile. More Headlines 5 Health Care Stocks Under $10 Set to Soar \nHere are the first eight stocks in Collins' list. We've included assessments from TheStreet Ratings for added perspective. \nTheStreet Ratings , TheStreet' s proprietary ratings tool, projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period, including both price appreciation and dividends. Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecast company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a buy yielded a 16.56% return in 2014, beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a buy yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nNote: Year-to-date returns are based on July 23, 2015, closing prices. \n\nMarket Cap: $8.6 billion Year-to-date return: -31.5% \nBarrick Gold produces and sells gold and copper. The company is also involved in exploration and mine development activities. \nCollins said: Oh my God, did I really buy a gold stock? When something hits a 25-year low, you have to at least take a look. ABX's 2.7% yield fits in well and there is upside when/if gold prices recover. \nTheStreet Ratings: Sell, D \nTheStreet said: \"We rate BARRICK GOLD CORP (ABX) a SELL. This is driven by some concerns, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover. The company's weaknesses can be seen in multiple areas, such as its generally high debt management risk, weak operating cash flow, generally disappointing historical performance in the stock itself and unimpressive growth in net income.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team are as follows: The debt-to-equity ratio of 1.27 is relatively high when compared with the industry average, suggesting a need for better debt level management. Net operating cash flow has decreased to $316.00 million or 45.98% when compared to the same quarter last year. Despite a decrease in cash flow of 45.98%, BARRICK GOLD CORP is in line with the industry average cash flow growth rate of -54.90%. Despite any intermediate fluctuations, we have only bad news to report on this stock's performance over the last year: it has tumbled by 51.09%, worse than the S&P 500's performance. Consistent with the plunge in the stock price, the company's earnings per share are down 37.50% compared to the year-earlier quarter. Naturally, the overall market trend is bound to be a significant factor. However, in one sense, the stock's sharp decline last year is a positive for future investors, making it cheaper (in proportion to its earnings over the past year) than most other stocks in its industry. But due to other concerns, we feel the stock is still not a good buy right now. The change in net income from the same quarter one year ago has exceeded that of the Metals & Mining industry average, but is less than that of the S&P 500. The net income has significantly decreased by 35.2% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from $88.00 million to $57.00 million. The company's current return on equity greatly increased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of significant strength within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Metals & Mining industry and the overall market, BARRICK GOLD CORP's return on equity significantly trails that of both the industry average and the S&P 500.
