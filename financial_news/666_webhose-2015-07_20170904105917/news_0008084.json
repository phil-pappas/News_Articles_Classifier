Sasha Woolley by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Pepper Group's initial public offering has been cornerstoned with commitments from a dozen offshore and domestic investors, sources said.\nIt's understood the deal has been underwritten at a multiple of 10 times calendar year 2015 net profit after tax, which equates to a price of $2.60, down from 12 times.\nThe deal came after Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras agreed to a list of reforms in exchange for a bailout package . The resolution presented Pepper with a more stable backdrop when asking funds for commitments for a $145 million raising.\nIt means the float is covered and a bookbuild will not be required. A prospectus is expected to be lodged by the end of the week.\nPepper's management and founders are not selling into the float and will account for around 45 per cent of the register after the listing.\nThe multiple was cut to 10 times profit in a bid to garner strong support in the secondary market.\nPepper, founded about 15 years ago, has forecast revenue growth of 31 per cent to $304 million for calendar year 2015, and net profit growth of 34 per cent to $47 million.\nGoldman Sachs and Macquarie Capital were the joint lead managers on the IPO, while Highbury Partnership was the company's financial adviser.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T05:07:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
