It has been a rough ride for commodities traders so far this year. Prices for many commodities are suffering from sizable losses, but there are ways to help make the road smoother.\nFrank Holmes, chief executive officer and chief investment officer at U.S. Global Investors, spoke with MarketWatch recently to offer a few hints on the best ways to navigate the commodity landscape. Holmes, a well-known fund manager, and natural-resources and emerging-markets expert, was in town for the San Francisco Money Show.\nRead about Mark Hulbert’s thoughts on market sentiment following the Money Show.\n1) Global purchasing managers index\nGross domestic product data offer a look back at the economy, while global PMI data is a forward-looking indicator. “Understanding PMI is one way investors can use patterns to improve their chances of positive returns in the market, just like card counting in a game of Blackjack,” Holmes said in a recent blog .\nBloomberg, U.S. Global Investors Holmes told MarketWatch that when you are considering global PMI data, it should include Europe, the U.S., Japan and China—with China being the “800-pound gorilla,” he said.\nHis investment team’s research showed that when the one-month reading for the global PMI crossed below the three-month trend, there was a significant probability that materials, energy and commodities would fall six months later. And when the reading crossed above the three-month trend, manufacturing activity would ramp up, improving the performance of commodities such as copper HGU5, -1.52% and crude oil CLU5, -1.45%\n2) Money supply\nLike PMI, money supply is more forward looking. Whenever you have the money supply rising rapidly, the commodities in those countries seem to be rising in that currency—and as money supply grows, you’re seeing an economic pickup.\nChina’s so-called M2 money supply (a measure of monetary supply including cash and other highly liquid assets) and productivity growth have come in higher than expected. “Perhaps the Chinese economy is beginning to turn around,” Holmes said in a blog .\n3) Emerging markets\n“The big commodity trade is emerging markets,” said Holmes.\nFor example, Brent oil and Russia have very close ties. About half of Russia’s stock market is oil, so if Brent prices LCOU5, -0.95% turn higher, the Russian ruble RUBUSD, -0.273823% and oil stocks are likely to follow, said Holmes.\nAs for China, Holmes, who co-manages the U.S. Global Investors China Region Fund USCOX, +0.36% warned the correction in its stock market isn't over. Given that, “I’m buying stocks that meet the stringent valuation metrics of year-over-year growth in revenue, top half growth in returns on invested capital, [and] growth in dividend yield. These are factors that give you that balance.”\nThe “tipping point” for China is when its PMI rises above 50. That “would mean that the underlying cash flow of the economy supports the valuation of stocks.”\nRead: Why $1,200 is important for gold\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/investor-alert/#.Va6Alfl1xEQ", "http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/global-investors-you-should-be-paying-attention-to-this-economic-indicator/#.Va6AV_l1xEQ"], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T15:16:20.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
