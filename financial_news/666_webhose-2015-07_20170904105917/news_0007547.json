That brought it in sight of a six-week low of $1.0915.\n\"There is still implementation risk, and (Greek Prime Minister Alexis) Tsipras still has to sell it at home ... but I was speaking to many clients yesterday and there is a shift in focus ... to more fundamental market drivers,\" said Credit Agricole FX strategist Manuel Oliveri in London.\nThe common currency slid to a 12-year low of $1.0457 in March when the ECB launched its quantitative easing policy. But it spent much of the past two months above $1.11 as talks between Greece and its creditors dragged on.\nThe dollar hit a 12-day high against the yen, which lost its safe-haven appeal with the worst-case-scenario of Greece exiting the euro seemingly averted, at 123.74 yen.\nInvestors will get a chance to hear the latest Fed thinking when Chair Janet Yellen gives her semi-annual testimony to Congress later this week. Dollar bulls had been given some fodder on Friday when Yellen said she expected a rate hike at some point this year.\n\"The dollar should have a relatively easy time topping 124 yen, especially if Yellen sounds hawkish during the testimony,\" said Junichi Ishikawa, market analyst at IG Securities in Tokyo.\n\"Breaching 125 yen, however, is a different story. Japanese authorities have spoken out when the dollar nears 125,\" he said, adding that another factor to watch is volatility in Chinese stocks.\nAs oil prices fell, the Canadian dollar dropped to C$1.2800 against its U.S. counterpart, its weakest since mid-March, while fellow oil-producer Norway's crown also fell.
