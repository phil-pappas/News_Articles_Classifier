David Tease by Tim Dodd It would cost only about $300 million a year to dramatically improve student achievement in the early years in Australia's most needy primary schools, according to a new study by the Grattan Institute.\nThe institute said results could be improved through intensive programs that targeted teaching to children's specific needs, using methods that some Australian schools are already trialling successfully.\nIn a report published on Monday, Targeted teaching: how better data can improve every student's learning , the Grattan Institute said the programs required teachers to spend more time accurately assessing students' level of learning, and responding with specific teaching to take them to the next step.\n\"Working together, teachers should assess what each student knows now, target their teaching to what they are ready to learn next, and track each student's progress over time,\" the report said.\n\"Teachers should then analyse their own impact, keep what works and change what does not.\"\nThe report said that, if done well, these changes could lift Australia to a top-five position in school achievement as measured by the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).\nThree case studies The report, by Grattan Institute's school education program director Peter Goss and its school education fellow Jordana Hunter, publishes case studies on three unnamed Australian schools which have introduced such programs to achieve better results.\n One of the schools, a low socioeconomic regional NSW primary school, appointed two senior full-time teachers as instructional leaders who co-ordinate the targeted teaching program. The achievement levels of students in the early years are assessed in fine detail, and they are given targeted assistance to help them master the skills required for the next level of achievement.\nThe teachers at the school told the researchers they were much busier. \"At the same time, teachers feel more satisfied than in the past, when they had less confidence in their approach,\" the report says.\nThis system is able to cater for the wide range of achievement levels in schools. And rigorous tracking of students' progress lets teachers know quickly if a student has stalled in their learning and also allows teachers to quickly know whether their teaching methods are effective.\nDr Goss said this approach used in early primary school would cost $2500 per student per year, or $300 million if extended to all disadvantaged Australian primary schools that needed it.\n\"In the context of a $44 billion spend [by the state and federal government annually on schools] it's a bargain if it works,\" he said.\nThe $300 million a year estimate compares to the $6.5 billion a year cost of fully implementing the Gonski school funding reforms, which the Abbott government has said it will not do. Dr Goss said that the extra $300 million in spending advocated by his report would not necessarily have to be new money, but could be funding that governments divert from elsewhere.\nThe study also examined a public high school in Victoria where similar methods are used in maths classes. At this school, maths classes are combined and teachers team-teach, the students doing different tasks depending on their level of ability, and up to four teachers working in a class of 50.\nIt takes more resources than traditional teaching and the school was able to use a $1 million grant under National Partnership funding, a federal Labor government program which has now ended, placing the program in jeopardy.\n\"They say they can't afford to continue it without further resources,\" Dr Goss said.\nA third case study examined a Catholic primary school in the Parramatta diocese in Sydney which is in an earlier stage of moving towards targeted teaching methods.\nThe report says it takes years to fully implement the changes in schools. Dr Goss said that at the Victorian high school, it has taken six years.\nHe said the changes were needed to deal with the huge differences in the achievement level of students in the same year in many Australian schools. The report found that a year 7 class could have some students working at a year 1 level, while others have mastered concepts from year 8.\n\"There's a huge range of current achievement in Australian classrooms. It's really challenging to teach. Neither the kids at the top nor at the bottom are learning much,\" Dr Goss said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T06:15:33.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
