Longmont, Colorado (PRWEB) July 21, 2015\nParascript, the industry innovator in advanced data location, extraction and classification, is today announcing it is opening nominations for businesses to qualify for the “ Ultimate Document Challenge ”. Parascript will review submissions, and if one meets the qualifications identified by the challenge, that business will be selected to have its information governance challenge solved at no cost.\n“The Ultimate Document Challenge provides us with the opportunity to showcase our newest document classification solution and to give back to the business community that has played such an important role in helping Parascript establish its leadership position as an industry innovator,” Greg Council, the Vice President of Marketing and Product Management, said. “Parascript software has been the premium choice for businesses streamlining their document management processes, ensuring highly accurate data location and extraction for over 20 years. Today, we’re transforming the way businesses manage document-centered work by lowering the bar of cost and complexity so that organizations of all sizes can enjoy what only larger companies to-date could deploy.”\nTell Us Your Document Challenge\nEverybody faces information document overload. When documents enter the organization, often no consistent rules or processes exist to manage how documents are described or where they are stored. This results in two major challenges:\n Managing Documents & Associated Metadata If the organization has: (1) a large volume of incoming documents; (2) faces issues with managing the process of identifying and applying document descriptors (metadata); and (3) must ensure proper documentation is collected and shared, we’d like to hear your story. Perhaps, your organization spends a significant amount of time manually checking files to verify every document is present and checking each off. Not only is document presence important, but staff also must ensure that the documents, which require initials or signatures, are properly completed. Even after all this careful, tedious effort, mistakes can be made. Does this sound like your organization?\n Finding the Right Information at the Right Time Challenge Organizations face major process inefficiencies when staff wastes time attempting to find important documents and the data contained in those documents. Staff spend time looking for that single document among a variety of documents because the documents are not uniformly organized, described or lack metadata entirely. Does this sound like your organization?\nTell us your document challenge and your organization may be selected to receive the complimentary document classification software solution for increased efficiency, document security, and risk management.\nUltimate Document Challenge 2015 Registration\nSubmissions can be placed now through close of business on Friday, October 2, 2015. Parascript looks forward to contacting any selected Ultimate Document Challenge candidate on or before Friday, November 6, 2015.\nFor more information and to enter your business in the Ultimate Document Challenge, please go to: http://www.parascript.com/go/2015-ultimate-document-challenge/\nParascript Document Classification\nParascript Document Classification advances classification beyond batch classification, which is limited to organizing pre-defined sets of documents in an established order.
