The Nasdaq 100 has gained 6.9 percent this year, compared with a 2.4 percent rise in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.\nSpeculators are wary as a strong dollar and turmoil in Chinese stocks threaten the technology industry’s profits. Intel Corp. said Wednesday it expects the personal-computer market to fall further than expected, spotlighting challenges for semiconductor companies amid slowing demand for PCs and their components.\n“The options market suggests uncertainty remains high as we approach earnings,” said Kurt Ayling, a technology, media and telecom analyst at New York-based Susquehanna Financial Group LLP. “With skew elevated, the cost of protection won’t come cheap.”\nThe fund, known by its ticker QQQ, rose 0.7 percent to $111.10 at 9:36 a.m. in New York, touching the highest level since March 2000. It has gained 1 percent since the end of May, even as semiconductor stocks just posted their worst month in three years.\nOverseas Turmoil Options protecting against a 10 percent decline in the tech ETF’s shares cost 9.8 points more than those betting on a similar climb, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The relationship between the implied volatilities known as skew reached 10.4 on July 9, the highest since June 2012.\nProfit for S&P 500 technology companies grew 1.5 percent in the second quarter from the same period last year, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg July 10. At the beginning of 2015, these corporations were expected to post a 13 percent rise for the quarter. Intel’s report Wednesday kicked off two weeks of announcements by the largest U.S. technology companies.\nEarnings estimates have been weighed down in 2015 by the U.S. currency, which rallied to its highest levels versus its peers since at least 2005 earlier this year.\nThe dollar’s strength has especially hurt technology companies. The group generates an average of 54 percent of their revenue from outside of North America, compared to 31 percent for all companies in the broad-market index, according to data from companies that provide the information in their financial statements.\nChina Selloff Traders are also expecting a rout in Chinese equities to curb consumer demand in the region. Companies such as Qualcomm Inc. and Nvidia Corp. gathered at least half their revenue from China last year, Bloomberg data from financial statements show.\n“What you see is a strong dollar, global economic concerns and seasonality as negatives for the tech sector as we approach quarterly results,” said Scott Kessler, an equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ. “All of these put together indicates it would be appropriate to be more measured or prudent in respect to allocations here.”\nIndustry-specific concerns are centered on suppliers of PC components. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index has slid 6.8 percent since June 25, when Micron Technology Inc. issued a sales forecast that missed analysts’ estimates, citing weaker demand for PC components.\n“There has been some pretty punk numbers from estimates as to how many PCs were manufactured in the recent quarter, and many semiconductor companies sell into this,” said Jason Benowitz, a New York-based senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investment Group Inc.\nIntel Outlook While PC chips provide the majority of Intel’s sales, demand for processors is helping to offset the weakness. Its shares jumped 2.5 percent in late trading Wednesday after the company predicted third-quarter sales that may exceed analysts’ predictions as owners of data centers add capacity. Intel has dropped 18 percent this year.\nConsolidation among semiconductor makers also could provide a lift to QQQ’s shares. A wave of deals helped boost the Philadelphia semiconductor gauge as much as 8.6 percent this year, and a person familiar with the matter this week said Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. is planning to offer $23 billion for Micron.\nAdding to speculators’ concerns is investors’ tendency to unload technology stocks with other higher-risk holdings in market selloffs. The S&P 500, which closed Wednesday about 1 percent below an all-time high, has swung recently amid talks between Greece and its creditors. A deal had yet to be completed as of Wednesday.\n“People are worried about Greece and China,” said Tom Mangan, a money manager at James Investment Research in Xenia, Ohio. “If I wanted to hedge something, it would be tech simply because of its additional risk.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T16:53:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
