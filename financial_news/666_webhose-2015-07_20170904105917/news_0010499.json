If we change back to drachma the cost for Greece will be much larger so we can import things\" \nYannis Kardakis showed Sky News an old drachma note and when asked if he thought Greece may soon be using them again replied: \"I think so\". \nDespite this, he is still keen to stay in stay in the EU.. \n\"All the people in Greece we worry about what's going to happen tomorrow, what's going to happen the next day, the next week, the next month, it's our future. But I believe that Europe can't leave us like that.\" \nGreek banks have been closed and cash machines withdrawals restricted to €60 a day to prevent the banking system collapsing as default neared. \nAthens has received nearly €240bn in two bailouts from the European Union and International Monetary Fund since 2010, but the Greek people have been forced to accept cuts to pensions, wages and public services. \nMore follows...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T04:23:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
