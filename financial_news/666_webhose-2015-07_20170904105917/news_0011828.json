Despite a relatively low population of 24 million – and despite a large proportion of that population being either obese or overweight – Australia is the second largest sports nutrition market in the world worth AUD805 million. Given the high number of obese and overweight Australians the consumption of sports nutrition products is far from uniform across the population with only a small proportion of the population responsible for the vitality of the category.\nCompetitive Landscape\nSupplement specialist stores – tracked by Euromonitor International under other healthcare specialist retailers – and online sales are responsible for a large proportion of sales in sports nutrition in Australia; so much so that these channels are the primary battlefields for brands and the major influence on the category’s competitive landscape. Many of the major players in sports nutrition in Australia are importers of US brands which are then distributed through these two channels. It is through this business model that Nutrition Systems the importer of brands such as MusclePharm MuscleTech Cellucor BPI and Arnold Schwarzenegger has become the leading player holding a 14% value share in 2014.\nFull Report Details at\n - \nIndustry Prospects\nThe attempts by producers of sports nutrition to appeal to a wider cross-section of the Australian community have come at a pertinent time for the category which has experienced a significant slowdown. Current value growth was only 12% in 2014; the lowest value growth since 2009. Growth is likely slow further over the forecast period as the category approaches saturation. Attempting to appeal to mainstream consumers is even more apt given that the population of the target demographic with the highest usage of sports nutrition – young men – is expected to stagnate over the forecast period as a result of Australia’s low birth rates during the 1990s. Stagnation of the population of young males is not definite however as high migration levels might ensure continued population growth. The continued growth of sports nutrition will require the industry to appeal to a wider demographic expanding their audience to include both older consumers and women.\nReport Overview\nDiscover the latest market trends and uncover sources of future market growth for the Sports Nutrition industry in Australia with research from Euromonitor's team of in-country analysts.\nFind hidden opportunities in the most current research data available understand competitive threats with our detailed market analysis and plan your corporate strategy with our expert qualitative analysis and growth projections.\nIf you're in the Sports Nutrition industry in Australia our research will save you time and money while empowering you to make informed profitable decisions.\nThe Sports Nutrition in Australia market research report includes:\n * Analysis of key supply-side and demand trends\n * Detailed segmentation of international and local products\n * Historic volumes and values company and brand market shares\n * Five year forecasts of market trends and market growth\n * Robust and transparent market research methodology conducted in-country\nOur market research reports answer questions such as:\n * What is the market size of Sports Nutrition in Australia?\n * What are the major brands in Australia?\n * What is the market size of Sports Nutrition in Australia?\n * What are the major brands in Australia?\n * Do consumers prefer powders tablets or RTD?\n * Do consumers prefer protein amino acid whey or creatine products?\nReasons to Get this Report\n * Gain competitive intelligence about market leaders\n * Track key industry trends opportunities and threats\n * Inform your marketing brand strategy and market development sales and supply functions\nReport Table of Contents:\nSPORTS NUTRITION IN AUSTRALIA\nEuromonitor International\nJune 2015\nLIST OF CONTENTS AND TABLES\nHeadlines\nTrends\nCompetitive Landscape\nProspects\nCategory Data\nTable 1 Sales of Sports Nutrition by Category: Value 2009-2014\nTable 2 Sales of Sports Nutrition by Category: % Value Growth 2009-2014\nTable 3 NBO Company Shares of Sports Nutrition: % Value 2010-2014\nTable 4 LBN Brand Shares of Sports Nutrition: % Value 2011-2014\nTable 5 Forecast Sales of Sports Nutrition by Category: Value 2014-2019\nTable 6 Forecast Sales of Sports Nutrition by Category: % Value Growth 2014-2019\nExecutive Summary\nConsumer Health Registers Slower Growth in 2014\nthe Ageing Population Remains A Key Growth Driver\nSwisse Wellness Led Overall Consumer Health in 2014\nGrowth of Parapharmacies/drugstores\nGrowth Expected To Slow Over the Forecast Period\nKey Trends and Developments\nGrowing Influence of Private Label\nRegulations Inhibit Growth\nParapharmacy/drugstore Price-cutters\nMarket Indicators\nTable 7 Consumer Expenditure on Health Goods and Medical Services: Value 2009-2014\nTable 8 Life Expectancy at Birth 2009-2014\nMarket Data\nTable 9 Sales of Consumer Health by Category: Value 2009-2014\nTable 10 Sales of Consumer Health by Category: % Value Growth 2009-2014\nTable 11 NBO Company Shares of Consumer Health: % Value 2010-2014\nTable 12 LBN Brand Shares of Consumer Health: % Value 2011-2014\nTable 13 Penetration of Private Label in Consumer Health by Category: % Value 2009-2014\nTable 14 Distribution of Consumer Health by Format: % Value 2009-2014\nTable 15 Distribution of Consumer Health by Format and Category: % Value 2014\nTable 16 Forecast Sales of Consumer Health by Category: Value 2014-2019\nTable 17 Forecast Sales of Consumer Health by Category: % Value Growth 2014-2019\nAppendix\nOTC Registration and Classification\nVitamins and Dietary Supplements Registration and Classification\nSelf-medication/self-care and Preventive Medicine\nSwitches\nSources\nSummary 1 Research Sources\nAbout Fast Market Research\nFast Market Research is a leading distributor of market research and business information.
