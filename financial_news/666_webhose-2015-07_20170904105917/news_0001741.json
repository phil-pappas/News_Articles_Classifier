Blooomberg by Matthew Stevens Fortescue Metals Group will doubtless welcome as unprecedented and significant the confirmation by its mightier Brazilian competitor Vale that it will retire some of its higher-cost iron ore production in the face of uncertainty over future demand and pricing.\nThe word is that the Fortescue folk received Vale's decision to retire up to 30 million tonnes of capacity as a signal that future expansions will \"progress more carefully\" and that there remains some potential yet that more of Brazil's higher-cost supply could fall out of the market as the world's biggest single producer tries to keep pace with the Pilbara troika's drive down the cost curve.\nFor mine though, I would put Vale's latest market advice very firmly in the be-careful-what-you-wish-for basket.\nIn re-announcing April's commitment to retire more expensive production as a new generation of processing is introduced, Vale has affirmed previous guidance that it would produce 340 million tonnes of iron ore and made no change to its long-term plans to hit 450 million tonnes a year.\nSo, in telling us it will retire higher-cost production while maintaining overall volume, all that Vale is telling the iron ore world is that its costs are going to fall further and faster than many had anticipated.\nThe very best case outcome, from a Fortescue perspective at least, was described most pithily by the RBS resources team in Ontario. \"After following up with the company, we now believe the announcement is not as large an incremental positive for the iron ore market as we first thought,\" the analysts reported.\n'A positive for Vale' After deciding that the curtailment was \"a positive for Vale\" but \"neutral for the iron ore market\", Team RBS said Vale was at least \"exercising discipline to curtail production and maintain its original guidance that it was otherwise on track to exceed\".\n If market scuttlebutt is accurate, the necessity for that same discipline appears to have escaped Fortescue.\nThe Third Force and its redoubtable chairman Andrew Forrest have pretty famously spent the past few months demonising BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto for pursuing kamikaze production strategies that aim to minimise production costs by running their individual systems at nameplate capacity.\nBut there is informed speculation that Fortescue exported 15.1 million tonnes of ore in June. For very good reason, Fortescue was unable to confirm or deny that speculation on Tuesday. It is days away from delivering quarterly production numbers and well into its pre-profit blackout period.\nBut if the speculation is correct, then June's tonnes translate into an annual run-rate of 180 million tonnes. As recently as April, chairman Forrest asserted that Fortescue would not exceed its annual target of 165 million tonnes. That promise might yet hold. But if rumour is longer-term reality, then Fortescue is doing what its says others should not: it is capturing value by maximising throughput to drive down unit costs, generate additional cash flow and sustain profitability through times of substantial price volatility.\nLike everyone else in iron ore, Fortescue's mission is to get to the lowest point possible on the cost curve. For the Pilbara Three, that ambition is presently achieved best by running systems at peak capacity while paring production costs. Vale, on the other hand, has a few more questions to ask and more levers to pull.\nA lot of moving parts Getting a feel for the Vale iron ore machine is a fairly tough task from this distance. There are an awful lot of moving parts. Vale runs four discrete production systems across Brazil and it is in the process of expanding either mining or processing capacity at three of them, while simultaneously pruning higher-cost material from two of those.\nThe biggest of those systems is the monster Carajas mine, Serra Norte. It produces more than 100 million tonnes annually of some of the highest-grade material in the seaborne system. And system capacity is three-quarters of the way through an expansion called S11D. It will introduce up to 90 million tonnes of similarly high-grade material to the market by the end of 2016.\nThis expansion is expected to cost up to $US16 billion ($21.55 billion) and carrying that heavy burden has been made a lot easier by China's decision in May to deliver more than $US5 billion in funding and firm future custom to the project.\nThe production cuts confirmed on Monday but originally announced in April will come from Vale's lesser southern and south-eastern systems.\nAll told, Vale operates 17 mines across those two systems. Some of those mines are the lowest-cost producers in Vale's system but just as many have struggled over recent years with depletions and grade declines. Those issues have been mitigated by increasing levels of processing that lifts ore to export specifications and at some point after 2018 Vale is going to have to invest up to $US10 billion on expanding its processing capacity to sustain its long-term 450 million tonnes a year target.\nOver the past two years Vale has invested $US1.54 billion on revamping the processing capacity of its south-eastern system.\nThe future The plan is to introduce lower-grade itabirite ores to the supply mainstream. They have previously been treated as waste material. But as higher-quality hematite and itabirites have been mined, this lower-grade stuff is now the future for the southern systems.\nWhat makes that so immediately interesting is that so much lower-grade itabirite has been stockpiled over the years. In some cases there are three and four years of supply sitting around Vale mines, which means only that source material for the processors can be accessed rapidly and cheaply.\nAs recently as August Vale was saying that investment in 45 million tonnes of itabirite processing would net out at an additional 15 million tonnes of potential by 2018. But that potential is plainly not going to be exercised. Vale's focus has moved from volume to margin, says its new boss of all things ferrous, Peter Poppinga.\nThis quest for margin maximisation is obviously appropriate. But is it also indicative of a change of strategy and does it imply that Vale has decided to accept the role of marginal producer by removing production in an attempt to recover supply-demand balance?\nWell, that is one way of seeing it. But I am not convinced. For mine, this simply means that Vale is able to retire high-cost supply and replace it with production that will lower its average production cost. The effect of this is that Vale becomes more competitive but in doing so it runs the risk of lowering the floor price of iron ore.\nCiti says the tonnes targeted by Vale come at a cost of about $US60 a tonne, which means they are well out of the money at current prices.\nActing rationally So Vale is simply acting rationally by replacing high-cost tonnes at the first opportunity. This point was made again and again across the great plains of iron ore analysis on Tuesday. From London, for example, Barclays identified that Vale was \"not providing price support\" â€“ indeed it was doing \"quite the opposite by effectively lower the cost curve\".\nAnd there's the rub for Fortescue. No matter what the Third Force says, it is the next-highest-cost operator after Vale among the majors and the Brazilian would appear to hold more options on costs and their reduction over the medium term.\nSome interesting analysis by Barclays shows that Vale's average landed cost in China, on a 62 per cent iron ore content basis, will be $US46.30 through the second half of FY16. The firm predicts Fortescue's average cost, on the same basis, will be $US43.10. Fortescue would dispute those numbers and we would guess Vale might too. But they are indicative of the closeness of the contest to avoid the title of the highest-cost major in iron ore.\nThis is important only because market theory suggests that, should the market drift further into oversupply, it is the highest-cost major that ultimately sets the floor price for iron ore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:05:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
