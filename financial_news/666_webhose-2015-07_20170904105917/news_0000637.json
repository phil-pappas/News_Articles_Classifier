He points out the beds from which a goodly portion of the previous night’s tasting menu was plucked just hours before being served in the hotel’s two-hatted restaurant.\nWe barely take a step without the British-born chef indicating another ingredient: beetroot for a cracker starter; Jerusalem artichokes for the soup; turnips for the Sher wagyu sirloin dish; cauliflower for the confit bonito; and brussels-sprout tops, used to garnish a plate of western plains suckling pig.\nAlthough impressive, the garden, in the shadow of Mount Sturgeon, is only a fraction of what is at the disposal of Wickens and his kitchen brigade. Scattered in and around the township are an olive grove and chook pens, a cottage garden with snail farm behind a historic homestead – another of the hotel’s accommodations – and orchards (which supplied figs, acorns and almonds for the previous night’s meal). Then, of course, there’s the original kitchen garden, complete with grand hothouse, within the walled estate of Dunkeld-raised businessman and QC Allan Myers, whose family company – Dunkeld Pastoral – owns the Royal Mail and another 9000 or so hectares in the region.\n“It’s taken me a long time to get my head around all the produce from the gardens and work out how to use them to their full potential,” confesses Wickens, who took the reins from Dan Hunter – now at Brae – close on two years ago.\nSow satisfying ... Robin Wickens in the kitchen garden at the Royal Mail Dunkeld. supplied Working alongside two full-time gardeners, Wickens acknowledges, too, that the garden isn’t some of-the-moment, on-trend boutique plot embraced by a restaurant eager to prove its green credentials. It’s rapidly becoming a serious part of the business.\nAlready the Royal Mail is pursuing greater efficiency and productivity from its garden enterprises, with plans to double the size of the main garden. As evidence, an orchard of underperforming pomegranate and apple trees behind a pair of polytunnels was torn up to make way for high-turnover vegetables, such as onions and carrots.\n“We’re not just growing a kitchen garden for the sake of it,” explains Royal Mail’s recently appointed general manager, Carl Forrest. “Everything needs to make financial sense.”\nBiota Dining, in NSW’s Southern Highlands, is another destination restaurant investing heavily in its kitchen gardens. After outlaying $12,000 for fencing, irrigation, soil and plants for a modest 30 square metres, growing garnishes and less common plants (yarrow, rue, tatsoi), owner-chef James Viles quickly built another garden and plastic hothouse, in which he could more cost-effectively propagate seeds and raise seedlings.\n From there, he cultivated a 400-square-metre garden for “the big messy stuff” – tomatoes, artichokes, corn – last year, adding a 250-square-metre “bar only” patch, full of cocktail botanicals and aromatics, behind newly built accommodation. “I wanted to grow as much as we could,” Viles says.\nHe concedes that running kitchen gardens on this scale hasn’t come cheaply – he estimates it’s loaded another 15-20 per cent onto his operating expenditure, which includes dedicated gardeners (but not the “time and learning” put in by kitchen staff).\nTo help underwrite the cost, Viles has established a separate shoots business – an offshoot, so to speak – with capacity to grow 500 trays of “weird and wonderful” shoots in a 35-metre, fully automated polytunnel, selling to restaurants in Sydney, Canberra and Wollongong. While not yet profitable, if it can boost sales from 30 trays a month to 50, Viles will be breaking even. “It allows us to do more at Biota, which flows through to what you get on the plate,” he says.\nForrest says the Royal Mail’s gardens are also approaching a point where they pay for themselves. For example, the hotel has become almost self-sufficient with lettuce, saving close to $12,000 a year. “The return on investment is immediate,” Forrest says. “We can justify the expense of the gardens through the savings.”\nIn fact, the proportion of spending on external suppliers has plummeted from 80 per cent in 2012 to 35 per cent this year and falling. Last summer, the gardens were supplying about 80 per cent of the kitchen’s needs. Forrest would like to achieve 100 per cent, but believes the mid-90s is more realistic. There are plans to grow mushrooms next and possibly introduce lamb and beef from Dunkeld Pastoral’s farms to “continue our story of being self-sustainable” and, longer term, to open a provedore store.\nWickens is assisting by shaping his menus around the produce available each day. He has also developed a computer program to audit produce, as well as oversee growth and harvest cycles. “Leeks come out one day, carrots go in the next.”\nSome smaller country restaurants are similarly striving for self-sufficiency. In the Victorian town of Trentham, for instance, Annie Smithers’ acre-sized kitchen garden supplies up to 90 per cent of the fruit and veg for her restaurant, du Fermier.\nSome city places, too, have off-site gardens and farms supplying produce. Richard and Belinda Weston’s farm in Brighton, Tasmania, provides at least 80 per cent of the seasonal produce for their Pigeon Hole Cafe in West Hobart and several other Hobart restaurants, including MONA, Ethos Eat Drink and Franklin. At the time of writing, it was supplying pumpkins, tomatilloes, paprika and root vegetables, such as kohlrabi and swede. “In 30 minutes, you can have the produce picked and on your plate,” Richard Weston says.\nSydney chef Sean Moran prefers to say his 20-hectare farm at Bilpin “embellishes” his Bondi Beach establishment, Sean’s Panaroma, because it caters for roughly 10 per cent of the menu “in waves”: persimmon for trifle, peach leaves for ice‑cream and quince for jelly; Saddleback suckling pig; Wiltshire Horn lamb and Belted Galloway beef. “I’m not a businessman … we do what we love,” Moran says.\nMelbourne’s Vue de Monde aims to have its gardens at Heide furnishing “35 per cent of the menu’s vegetable needs” by next year, owner Shannon Bennett says. At the same time, his group has 3.2 hectares of its 28-hectare property at Burnham Beeches, in the Dandenongs, under cultivation, supplying all its kitchens with seasonal crops.\nBennett also has an emu farm and a two-hectare truffiere of 500 trees, which he’s hoping will produce 50-80 kilograms of truffles this year.\nThe kitchen gardens of city restaurants, though, aren’t meant to sustain their daily needs. While the gardens of the Chiswick restaurants in Woollahra and the NSW Art Gallery supply the kitchens with nearly all their herbs, owner Matt Moran admits they’re more about promoting a positive garden-to-plate philosophy. “It’s really important to show people where ingredients come from and seasonality,” says Moran, whose family farm – more profitably – supplies the Chiswicks and Moran’s ARIA restaurant with aged beef and lamb shoulders.\nAt Vue de Monde, first-year apprentices start in its kitchen gardens. “Chefs become more educated and passionate about what they put on the plate,” Bennett says.\nRyan Edwards, executive chef of Appellation at The Louise , in the Barossa Valley, says its 10 garden beds and fruit trees, supplying 5-10 per cent of the menu, similarly help his chefs to better understand and monitor seasonal produce. The garden also enables them to interact with guests and grow specialised, hard-to-source crops.\nJust down the road, on her 4.5-hectare Tanunda property, Tuoi Do cultivates her own organic seasonal Vietnamese herbs and vegetables in 16 raised beds, for her restaurant, fermentAsian. She grows Vietnamese mint, basil and coriander, mustard greens, snow peas and lemon grass. Her approach is not unlike that of Sydney restaurateur Sujet Saenkham, of Spice I Am fame, who grows his own Thai produce.\n“I find the quality [of ingredients] we try to get in is not good enough,” says Do, outlining plans to rebuild and enlarge the garden to supply not only her restaurant, which is being renovated, but also a future cooking school.\nBack at Dunkeld, Forrest is giving me a tour of the Royal Mail’s comprehensive wine cellar. Beside the wine racks are several kegs of the lemon verbena pink peppercorn wheat beer it crafted in partnership with Brunswick East’s Temple Brewing. It’s another revenue stream, like Viles selling elderflower cordial, Smithers’ seasonal preserves or the green tomatoes the Royal Mail will turn into chutney.\nMaybe they’re not huge money-spinners but it’s money for jam. “If one in four of 10,000 [annual] visitors buys an $8 jar, that’s $20,000 to the bottom line without any effort,” Forrest figures.", "external_links": ["http://www.royalmail.com.au/", "http://www.thelouise.com.au/dine/", "http://pigeonholecafe.com.au/", "http://www.vuedemonde.com.au/"], "published": "2015-07-01T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:08:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
