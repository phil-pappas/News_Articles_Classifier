AP by Spencer Soper Amazon.com reported a surprise second- quarter profit on top of sales that beat analysts' estimates, showing investors -- as it has done before -- that the Web retailer can make money when it puts the brakes on investments.\nShares in Amazon jumped as much as 19 per cent after it reported that revenue rose 20 per cent to $US23.2 billion, exceeding analysts' average projection of $US22.4 billion. Net income was $US92 million, or 19 cents a share, the company said in a statement Thursday, compared with the prediction for a loss of 14 cents.\nChief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos is pushing the Web retailer, which he founded two decades ago, beyond sales of books, electronics and household items as the business matures. While Bezos has focused on pouring profits back into growing Amazon's business, he has occasionally pulled back on spending to show that Amazon can be profitable. Operating expenses grew slower than sales, rising 17 per cent to $US22.7 billion, Amazon said.\n\"They are showing investors that if they want to deliver profits, they can,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock. \"Amazon is a dominant online retailer, well on its way to becoming one of the world's largest retailers.\"\nShares surged in extended trading. The stock declined 1.3 per cent to $US482.18 at the close in New York, leaving it up 55 per cent this year.\nAmazon is also investing to lure more customers as competition intensifies. Wal-Mart Stores is rolling out a new membership service to challenge Amazon Prime, which offers two-day shipping, TV shows, photo storage and other benefits for an annual fee. Startup Jet.com officially debuted this week, following months of testing to give online deal-hunters an alternative to Amazon.\nAmazon's cloud-computing division, which offers Web data storage and computing services and includes customers such as Pinterest and Netflix, had sales of $US1.82 billion, up 81 per cent from a year earlier.\nAmazon forecast third-quarter revenue of $US23.3 billion to $US25.5 billion, compared with analysts' average projection of $US23.9 billion.\n \"We've had competition for 20 years now from some of the biggest names in retail and other areas,\" Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call. \"We're used to competition, but we focus on the customer ... We're happy with the results.\"\nBezos also owns The Washington Post.\nThe Washington Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T01:05:28.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
