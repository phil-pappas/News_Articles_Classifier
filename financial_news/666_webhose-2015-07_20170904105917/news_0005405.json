Upbeat U.S. economic data and comments from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen indicated a likely interest-rate increase later this year putting pressure on gold prices.\nGold for August delivery GCQ5, -0.76% shed $6.90, or 0.6%, to $1,146.60 an ounce on Comex, after tallying a loss of $10 an ounce, or 0.9%, in the past five trading sessions.\nSeptember silver SIU5, -2.02% dropped 30.5 cents, or 2%, to $15.01 an ounce, ready to extend its loss to a third straight session.\nData Wednesday showed that prices U.S. companies paid to produce goods and services rose in June for a second month, with the PPI index up 0.4% .\nIndustrial production in June , meanwhile, rose by a better-than-expected 0.3%.\nThe Fed’s Yellen on Wednesday said she expects the U.S. economy to strengthen over the rest of 2015 and put the central bank on a path to raise interest rates at some point this year. See the live blog and video of Yellen’s testimony.\nHigher interest rates are a negative for gold, which tends to benefit from looser monetary policy. Gold doesn’t offer interest. The ICE U.S. dollar index DXY, +0.53% traded higher following Yellen’s testimony, putting further pressure on dollar-denominated yellow metal.\nAlso Wednesday, the Greek Parliament was set to decide whether to adopt a raft of unpopular and stringent reform measures demanded by the country’s international creditors.

They added that could lead to the European Central Bank increasing key loans, Greek banks reopening and negotiations on new financial aid.\n“In the short term this could further reduce the attractiveness of gold as a safe haven,” the Commerzbank analysts said.\nLooking a bit further ahead, Chintan Karnani, chief market analyst at Insignia Consultants, said among the factors that could get gold to move higher, Asian demand has to rise and prices have to “break and trade” over $1,260 an ounce to “attract hot money.”\nIn other metals trade, October platinum PLV5, -0.91% fell $9.20, or 0.9%, to $1,019.10 an ounce, while September palladium PAU5, -2.50% declined by $9.05, or 1.3%, to $648.30 an ounce.\nSeptember copper HGU5, -0.73% was little changed at $2.533 a pound.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T19:21:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
