Employers added 254,000 jobs in May, down from an initially reported 280,000, Dow Jones Newswires reported.\nAt 3.24pm the rand was at R12.2547 to the dollar from a close of R12.2540 on Wednesday. It reached a strongest level of R12.21 to the dollar in intraday trade, as the dollar backtracked after the payroll report.\nThe rand was at R13.5816 against the euro from a previous close of R13.5443 and at R19.1298 to the British pound from R19.1330 previously.\nThe euro was at $1.1083 from its previous close of $1.1054.\nThe June payrolls were released on Thursday due to the US Independence Day celebrations on Saturday. Wall Street will be closed on Friday.\nThe unemployment rate, which is obtained from a separate survey of US households, fell to 5.3% in June, from a predicted 5.4%, compared to 5.5% the prior month. The rate is the lowest since April 2008, but reflects fewer Americans were looking for jobs.\nUS employers steadily added jobs in June, but wages were flat and the participation fell, suggesting pockets of weakness remained in the labour market, the newswire said.\nMarket participants are now waiting for the referendum in Greece on Sunday on austerity measures, which is bound to provide further market direction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T17:36:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
