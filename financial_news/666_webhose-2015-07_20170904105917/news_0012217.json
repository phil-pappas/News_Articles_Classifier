This is up from $2.65,\" the EGAS official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. \nThe official said that another deal had been signed with Edison for a price of $5.88 per million British thermal units, up from $2.65. \nReuters could not immediately reach the companies for comment. \nThe amended prices will apply to gas produced from new discoveries, the official said. \nEgypt last month signed a $2 billion exploration deal with Eni. \nOil minister Sherif Ismail told Reuters in March that Egypt had agreed to pay BP and RWE Dea more for their Egyptian production.
