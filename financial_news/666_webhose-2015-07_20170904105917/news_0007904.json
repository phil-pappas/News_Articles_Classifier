The longer an employee stays with one company, the less he earns. In fact, employees who stay with the same company for more than two years will earn at least 50 percent less over the course of their careers, according to Forbes. \nThe single best move a talented, skilled professional can make is to leave a dead-end job in pursuit of a new title and, of course, a higher salary. If you’re seeking a higher salary, job-search sites can be a powerful tool to find opportunities and make new connections that will help you command better pay. \nRead: How to Double Your Salary in Two Years 5 Best Jobs Sites to Get a Higher Salary \nThe best jobs sites help you quickly find information on jobs you’re interested and connect with the hiring team at the company you want to work — and ultimately, increase your income .
