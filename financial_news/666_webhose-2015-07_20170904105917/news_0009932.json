Photo: AP\nWall Street sank on Monday, with the Nasdaq losing almost 1 per cent after the steepest decline in Chinese stocks in eight years increased concerns that cooling growth in the world's No. 2 economy could hurt China's trading partners.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average finished at its lowest since February, the Nasdaq Composite hit a four-week low and the benchmark S&P 500 ended at its lowest in over two weeks.\nIn an additional negative sign, 480 stocks hit 52-week lows on the New York Stock Exchange, the most in one day since October 15.\nAfter Chinese stocks plunged more than 8 per cent, the top securities regulator said Beijing would keep buying shares to stabilise the market as an unprecedented rescue plan already in place appeared to sputter.\nUS-listed shares of Chinese companies slid, including Alibaba and Baozun.\nCommodity prices resumed a downward spiral, with the Thomson Reuters CRB commodities index hitting a six-year low and oil a four-month low.\n\"It's hard to assess whether China single-handedly can deep-six the market,\" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. \"A significant slowdown in China impacts not just the US but global players as well.\"\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.72 per cent to end at 17,441.79 points. The S&P 500 lost 0.57 per cent to end at 2,067.75. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.96 per cent to 5,039.78.\nNine of the 10 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with the energy index's 1.35 per cent fall leading the decliners.\nWith second-quarter reports well under way, analysts expect overall earnings of S&P 500 companies to dip 0.3 per cent and revenue to decline 3.9 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nSuch results could inflate already relatively pricey valuations. The S&P 500 trades near 16.9 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data.\n\"Valuations are a concern right now,\" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin. \"We really need to see corporate revenue growth.\"\nThe main event for US markets this week is likely to be the two-day US Federal Reserve meeting, the last before September, which still looms as the first possible date for an interest rate increase.\nTeva Pharmaceutical's shares jumped 16.41 per cent to a record high of $US72.00 after it agreed to buy Allergan's generic drug business for $US40.5 billion, giving up on its bid to buy Mylan. Allergan rose 6.09 per cent while Mylan fell 14.51 per cent.\nFiat Chrysler fell 4.88 per cent after a US auto safety watchdog announced a $US105 million fine against the automaker over lapses in safety recalls.\nOn the NYSE, 2.73 stocks fell for every one that rose. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered gainers 2.47 to 1.\nThe S&P 500 index posted 3 new 52-week highs and 58 lows; the Nasdaq Composite saw 21 new highs and 246 lows.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T14:44:18.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
