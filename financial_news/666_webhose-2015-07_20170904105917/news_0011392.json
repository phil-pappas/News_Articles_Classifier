He has already formed relationships with key figures including European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi.\n“We want to continue the discussion. I believe something can change in Europe,” said a shaken Tsakalotos, who admitted to having “stage fright” upon assuming the post at “not at the easiest moment in Greek history”.\nThe 55-year-old leftist economist, who had been a pointman in Greece's bailout talks since April, replaced the flamboyant Yanis Varoufakis hours after the latter resigned.

This government will do the same in the coming period.”\nThe Guardian describes Mr Tsakalotos as Athens’ “secret weapon” whose experience “engaging critically” with neoclassical economic thinking and privileged Oxford and private school education makes him well prepared to run negotiations.\n“The fact that he also sounds like an aristocrat helps too,” a Syriza insider told The Guardian . “He speaks their language better than they do. At times it’s been quite amusing to watch.”\nWhile some have welcomed the change, others are sceptical that Mr Tsakalotos will be willing to concede any more ground than his predecessor on further austerity measures.\nBloomberg News said he would be a “ change of style, if not necessarily of substance ”, given his staunch support of Syriza’s anti-austerity policies.\n“I don’t expect Tsakalotos’s appointment to lead to a significant change in Greece’s policies but his less confrontational approach should definitely help negotiations,” said Diego Iscaro, an economist at research group IHS Inc, told Bloomberg.\nOthers have pointed to his recent book, co-authored with economist Christos Laskos, titled The Crucible of Resistance: Greece, the eurozone and the World Economic Crisis , in which he criticises “permanent austerity” and urges other European countries to emulate Syriza’s model.\n“By alienating an entire nation of people, the Troika has revealed the internal contradictions of the modern neoliberal establishment, as well as the inadequacies of the earlier social-democratic Keynesian regime,” the book’s description reads.\n“Tsakalotos and Laskos suggest that there is very little that differentiates Greece from other countries struggling under austerity, and that parties such as Syriza could usher in a new, democratic and socialist era across the continent.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/the-worlds-toughest-gig-euclid-tsakalotos-now-has-the-impossible-job-of-fixing-greece/story-e6frflo9-1227432337388?sv=feb39b63995c01fd5ae46766f4cb9e50", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/the-worlds-toughest-gig-euclid-tsakalotos-now-has-the-impossible-job-of-fixing-greece/story-e6frflo9-1227432337388?sv=feb39b63995c01fd5ae46766f4cb9e50", "http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=The+man+with+the+impossible+job&c=THE+man+who+must+now+lead+Greece%26%238217%3Bs+negotiations+with+furious+European+leaders+has+admitted+a+severe+case+of+%26%238220%3Bstage+fright%26%238221%3B.+We+don%26%238217%3Bt+blame+him.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/the-worlds-toughest-gig-euclid-tsakalotos-now-has-the-impossible-job-of-fixing-greece/story-e6frflo9-1227432337388?sv=feb39b63995c01fd5ae46766f4cb9e50", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/the-worlds-toughest-gig-euclid-tsakalotos-now-has-the-impossible-job-of-fixing-greece/story-e6frflo9-1227432337388?sv=feb39b63995c01fd5ae46766f4cb9e50&title=The+man+with+the+impossible+job", "http://www.amazon.com.au/Crucible-Resistance-Greece-Eurozone-Economic-ebook/dp/B00F93V6A6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436238278&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Crucible+of+Resistance%3A+Greece%2C+the+Eurozone+and+the+World+Economic+Crisis", "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/euclid-tsakalotos-greeces-secret-weapon-in-credit-negotiations", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/the-worlds-toughest-gig-euclid-tsakalotos-now-has-the-impossible-job-of-fixing-greece/story-e6frflo9-1227432337388?sv=feb39b63995c01fd5ae46766f4cb9e50&h=The+man+with+the+impossible+job", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/the-worlds-toughest-gig-euclid-tsakalotos-now-has-the-impossible-job-of-fixing-greece/story-e6frflo9-1227432337388?sv=feb39b63995c01fd5ae46766f4cb9e50&title=The+man+with+the+impossible+job", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-06/tsipras-taps-trusted-ally-to-end-varoufakis-era-of-confrontation"], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T09:34:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
