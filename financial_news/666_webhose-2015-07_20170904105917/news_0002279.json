Her fortune shrank by $6.4 billion in June as Shenzhen-listed Lens Technology tumbled 36 per cent. Zhou became the country's richest woman after the maker of mobile-phone glass covers went public in March. Getty Images by David Barboza Shanghai\nAt the height of the frenzy for Chinese stocks, just about every company was a winner.\nAn online gaming start-up was valued at $7 billion. Shares in a fireworks company that had moved into finance shot up 300 per cent. A struggling property developer was transformed into a sharemarket darling, just by changing its name to suggest it was an internet company.\nThen there was the case of Beijing Baofeng Technology, an online video company whose stock price soared 4200 per cent in the three months after it went public early this year. The company's shares climbed 10 per cent – the maximum amount allowable under exchange rules – nearly every day for more than 30 days.\nViewed through the lens of the recent market tumult, experts said China's stock bonanza bordered on the insane.\nBefore things fell apart a few weeks ago, China's remarkable bull run was reminiscent of the internet bubble that gripped the Nasdaq sharemarket between 1998 and 2000, when companies such as Pets.com and Webvan that had no profit quickly became more valuable than some industrial stalwarts.\nAt the time, everyone talked about how technologies and industries would transform society, justifying eye-popping valuations. They were right about the future, just not necessarily about specific companies and the high stock prices.\nThe same may now be said of China in early 2015. Even as stocks have stabilised in recent days, investors have continued to pummel such smaller companies, the same ones they had bid up in the boom.\n \"People got too enthusiastic,\" says Teng Bingsheng, who teaches strategic management at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing. \"There was a huge amount of energy, like a nuclear bomb, and they let it go off.\"\nThe madness was driven, in part, by the peculiar dynamics of China's sharemarket. Unlike in the United States, where institutions and big funds are the primary investors, trading here is dominated by smaller players – speculators, day traders and inexperienced retail investors, many of whom started financing stock purchases with borrowed money.\nChina's market is also shaped by the heavy hand of the government, which makes decisions about what companies can list shares, when to promote stock rallies and, now, how to intervene when prices plummet. The government, in other words, views the market as a policy instrument, a mechanism to fulfil its political and economic goals. The result can be a volatile market that swings from boom to bust.\n\"In China, the regulators aren't neutral,\" says Chen Zhiwu, a professor of finance at Yale University and an expert on China's financial system. \"The government's stated intention this time was that they wanted to use the stock market boom to fuel innovation and start-ups. This isn't how a market is supposed to work.\"\nSeparation from the state For years, government reformers have pushed to loosen the state's grip on the economy and financial markets, hoping to create a more efficient marketplace to aid private companies, particularly small businesses that have a difficult time borrowing from state banks. The idea was to restructure the sharemarket, moving it away from its roots where it served mostly state-owned companies.\nA breakthrough seemed to come last year, when the government put innovation and the development of tech start-ups high on its agenda. It began to consider using the sharemarket as a way to aid young companies while also bolstering a slowing economy.\nFollowing a one-year moratorium on new listings, regulators began approving public stock offerings in late 2013. The floodgates opened soon after, and hundreds of companies went public in Shanghai and Shenzhen, helping China overtake New York as the world's biggest IPO market in the first half of this year.\nInvestors went mad for the shares of new companies, bidding them up to stratospheric levels. On Shenzhen's ChiNext board, a kind of Nasdaq-style marketplace, 69 companies went public this year. Those stocks, on average, gained 672 per cent through June, when prices peaked. Three companies rose more than 2000 per cent, including Beijing Baofeng Technology.\nWith share prices rising, the government also put its imprimatur on a raging bull market. The state media began promoting a new golden age of stocks. As recently as April, the state media editorialised that the bull market was \"just beginning\".\nThe first signs of trouble came in May, when prices began to slump. The next month, in the face of a flood of new listings and warnings about overpriced shares and a possible market \"correction\", share prices began to plunge. Even after China's central bank cut interest rates in late June, making stocks relatively more attractive than bank deposits, the market continued to slide.\nWorried that a sharemarket crash could lead to social unrest and weaken an already slumping economy, the government announced a raft of measures to pump up shares. In recent weeks, the government has funded purchases, suspended new public offerings and opened an investigation into stock manipulation.\nWhile the measures had stabilised stocks at the end of last week, the situation created confusion about what signal the government was sending. Regulators who had pushed for a more market-oriented system now seemed to be setting a precedent for more intervention by the government, says Teng at the Cheung Kong School.\n\"The logic of the new government was to jump-start the stock market to generate cash into the economy,\" he says. \"They thought it would be a virtuous cycle. But it became a vicious cycle.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T12:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T21:11:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
