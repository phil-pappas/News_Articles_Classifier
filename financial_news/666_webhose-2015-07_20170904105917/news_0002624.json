Natalie Grono by Tim Binsted Private health insurer nib has snapped up World Nomads Group, Australia's third-largest distributor of travel insurance, for $95 million as it diversifies away from the heavily regulated health insurance space.\nThe group, which provides cover to more than 1.1 million people in Australia and New Zealand, said on Wednesday that World Nomads Group (WNG) is \"a good strategic fit\".\n\"WNG is an excellent business with significant expertise, experience, and capabilities in the fast growing and fast moving travel insurance market,\" nib managing director Mark Fitzgibbon said.\nThe target generated gross written premium of $117 million and normalised earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation of $10 million in the year ended June 30.\nWNG does not underwrite insurance policies, but it distributes them and in Australia and New Zealand, it administers policies on behalf of general insurers.\nThe $95 million acquisition fee is on an enterprise value basis, meaning it accounts for both the debt and equity value of the business.\nnib said it will fund the deal from surplus capital and debt. The insurer was advised by JPMorgan and King & Wood Mallesons.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T04:04:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
