You got a call to come in and interview for a prospective job! Now comes the worry and the nervousness. But don’t stress. Being properly prepared for the interview will help your confidence and impress your potential future employer enough to the point where the next call you get may be for a job offer. \nIn order to get ready for the interview, the very first thing you need to do immediately is to begin studying up on what not only the entire agency does, but also what section your particular job will be in. For instance, if you are interviewing to be a tax collector at a state agency, you would want to look up what that agency’s mission statement is AND what the tax collection section does specifically. You can do this by researching the internet and asking your friends if anyone works for this company or similar companies in similar fields. Just stating the mission statement in the interview at some point will let the prospective employers know that you know what the agency is about AND that you took the time to do your research! There’s usually a question that centers around the theme of “Why do you want to work here?” This is perfect opportunity for you to throw in that you believe in the organization’s mission statement and then say what it is verbatim from their website. So memorize their mission statement! \nNext, think about what kinds of questions they may ask. Write down your lists of strengths and weaknesses. Try to make your strengths sound amazing and your weaknesses as a work in progress that is likely to become your new strengths. For example, you might say that your strength is your motivation and your weakness is your organization. However, since you are so motivated to focus and work on your weakness, your organization skills are now better than the average person, but it’s always a struggle in progress. This ties in your strengths and weaknesses to actually sound like two strengths! \nSell yourself. Don’t be afraid to name off all your relevant accomplishments. Even stating, for example, that you take good care of your health may be worth mentioning because they know that you won’t be calling in sick too much. \nRemember, the questions are not as important as to how you act in the interview. You may answer every question correctly, but if you sound like a robot, they may not hire you just because you’d be a bore to work with. Be yourself! If you’re funny, crack some jokes. If you’re smart, show them! \nLastly, dress as nice as possible. If you’re unaware of how to properly fashion fit your suit, belt, dress, pants, and etc., then look google search “how to properly dress for an interview” online. \nRemember, be confident, be yourself, research the company, sell yourself, and dress professionally. Doing all these before and during the interview may help you gain that extra edge just enough that they might call you back with an offer. However, if you end up not getting the job, don’t let that get you down. Many times the employer may have already preliminarily selected the applicant they want before they conduct interviews. Or other times, the position did not receive final approval and becomes unavailable. When you don’t get a call back, just be appreciative for the experience as it will certainly help you in future interviews. Likewise, if you make a good impression in the interview and don’t get the job this time around, they may be more inclined to hire you in the future when another job opens up in their department.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T19:46:01.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
