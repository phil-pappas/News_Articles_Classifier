The contract will run until 2018. \n“Such a resolution has been adopted in line with the corporate governance recommendations with regard to the rotation of the external auditor, following a proposal of the audit committee and as result of a selection procedure developed with full transparency,” the bank said. \nWith sprawling global offshoots, complex assessments of capital and ongoing provisions, the banking sector’s audits are often the most expensive contracts available. The relationship also generates other work that can add tens of millions to the overall bill. \nLast year, Santander paid Deloitte €28.3m to audit its financial statements. The bank also paid for other services such as sending out letters, auditing its capital levels and checking its interim results. Along with tax advice and other services, Deloitte was paid €89.9m. \nSource: Grupo Santander's 2014 annual report \nThe win provides new work for PwC at a time when it is parting ways with several blue-chip clients. Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) ' audit generated £35m in statutory fees and £10m for other work for PwC last year, although last week Barclays hired KPMG for future audits. \nTesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) recently replaced PwC with Deloitte after 32 years, as part of its bid to clear the decks in the wake of problems in the way it accounted for commercial revenues. \nLarge listed companies in the EU have been required since 2014 to change their audit provider every 10 years, in an attempt by regulators to minimise cosy relationships that could undermine independence and cause problems to be missed. \nThe rules go further than recently-adopted UK requirements for FTSE 350 companies to put their audit out to tender once a decade, without an obligation to switch provider. \nThese reforms followed a Competition Commission report on the industry's shortcomings leading up to the financial crisis, which found signs of \"misalignment\" with shareholder interests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T15:07:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
