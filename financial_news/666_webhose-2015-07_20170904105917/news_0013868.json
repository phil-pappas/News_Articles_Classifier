London waterways alone have seen a 50pc increase in boat numbers over the past five years, official figures suggest. \nAlmost 33,000 people operate a houseboat on Britain’s waterways, up 9pc on last year, a number that has been creeping upwards over the past decade, according to boat licence data collected by the Canal River Trust. \nThe biggest increase is among so-called “roving” houseboats, the charity said, where owners don’t buy a fixed mooring but can remain in almost any location for two weeks before they must move on. \nAmong these wandering boaters are friends Sophie Dundovic and Ollie Spragg, two entrepreneurs who share a boat moored in Hackney. The east London area has seen the biggest influx of boats in England, with an 85pc annual increase in moorings. \n• 'With £250,000 how can I help my children, aged seven and 37, buy property?' • Petrol and diesel: The cheapest countries and why Britain ranks as one of the most expensive \n“We’ve lived in Notting Hill, Little Venice and Regent’s Canal it’s been an incredible way to live in some of the most exclusive areas,” said Ms Dundovic, who has been living in a rented boat, “Penny”, for the past eight months while she develops a new smartphone app. \n“We both own start-up companies and it’s crucial for us to be in central London, but we’re not in a position to get a mortgage or pay premium prices for rent. This way, I can walk to meetings with investors,” Ms Dundovic said. \nThe pair’s £700-a-month, two-bedroom boat, is “basic but comfortable”, they say. The best part “the people, we live among a lovely community of students, professionals including a photographer, a chiropractor, as well as retired couples” is worth the winter freeze and having to empty out the septic tank. “In the depths of winter I was wearing a ski suit just to get through the night,” Ms Dundovic said. \nThe pair’s bid to cut housing costs comes as a recent report said just 43 homes in London are considered “affordable” which includes houseboats. \nJust one in six properties are affordable across Britain, according to housing charity Shelter, which based its research on the median income of £30,748 for first-time buyer families. \nHidden on the Thames, a group of luxury houseboats show a different side of riverside life. Boaters can pay £1.85m for a five-bedroom barge on Taggs Island, a private residence near Hampton Court surrounded by a cluster of 65 luxury floating homes. \nThe houseboats moored at Taggs Island have private gardens and their own entry bridge \nThe boat’s estate agent boasts “a vibrant community of artists, writers and musicians” with parking for five cars, a garden, summerhouse, separate accommodation for an au pair and its own bridge to the island. \nIt’s still cheaper than buying an equivalent five-bedroom home in nearby Kingston £2.2m, according to property portal, Zoopla. \nMs Dundovic and Mr Spragg, who rent their boat, get a similar discount for living in an area where rent costs upwards of £1,500 for a studio flat. \nThey admit their boat “isn’t the most glamorous on the water but we’ve seen a lot worse”. \nRun-down, damp and lacking any plumbing or power, many of Britain’s houseboats are a far cry from the idyll of Taggs Island. “Some of the boats we viewed as prospective renters were absolutely horrendous,” Ms Dundovic said. “One didn’t have a bedroom or lavatory and had two planks of wood instead of a seating area.” \nWhether boaters are buying or renting, seemingly cheap prices can mask the true cost of living in a houseboat, according to experts. \n“More people are choosing to live afloat and boating is a brilliant thing to do,” said Joe Coggins of the Canal and River Trust, which is responsible for maintaining the 2,000 miles of waterways in England and Wales. “But it is a specific way of life that doesn’t suit everybody.” \nHe warned that there are “hidden costs” in keeping a boat and that everyday maintenance, such as buying fuel and emptying the lavatory should be treated like a part-time job. \n= The costs = \n• Mooring: varies; £2,000 plus in London • Insurance: £200 • Boat licence: up to £1,100 • Boat safety certificate: £150 • Fuel, maintenance and pumping out: £100-£200 a year Estimates from the Canal & River Trust \nBoaters will need to think about mooring, buying a boat licence and maintaining the boat. \nThe cheapest mooring option is to “continuously cruise”, which involves moving the boat along the canal bank every 14 days. Otherwise home mooring, typically in privately owned marinas, varies depending on your boat size and the location, but can cost more than £2,000 a year. \nHome mooring means you’ll also have to pay council tax albeit in one of the cheaper bands and you must have residential planning permission. But even those without a home mooring have hidden costs to pay. Lacking a postcode, they might find it difficult to apply for bank accounts or other forms of credit. \nEvery boat on the waterway needs a licence which costs between £510 and £1,100 a year, depending on the length of your boat. You’ll also need insurance, with at least third-party cover starting at £200, before you can get a licence. \nFirst (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) -time boat-buyers are also unable to get a mortgage, because there is no land to secure the lending to. Instead, they can opt for a personal loan or specialist marine finance, where the loan is secured on the boat. Surveying a boat before you buy costs around £400. \nA boat safety certificate (£150 plus any repairs you might need), like an MoT for your boat, is required every four years. \n“Live on a boat if you love the lifestyle, not because you think it will save you money,” Mr Coggins said. \nkate.palmer@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T13:29:21.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
