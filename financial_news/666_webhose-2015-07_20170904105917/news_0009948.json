The 488 GTB was officially launched to the Australian market in Sydney on Wednesday.\nHe attributes it to the soaring residential property prices in Sydney and Melbourne, a steady sharemarket which has made solid gains despite the wobbles over commodity prices, Greece bail-outs and a downturn in Chinese stock prices, and the rising stream of dividends as ASX-listed companies pay out record levels of profits to shareholders who are annoyed at measly returns from cash. The wealthy were doing very well.\n\"I have a pretty good idea of confidence levels among our client base and I can tell you it's pretty strong,\" he says.\nFerrari generally sells between 110 and 115 vehicles in Australia annually, but in the first six months of calendar 2015 it has sold 93 vehicles, he says.\nMr Appleroth's great-grandfather, Bert Appleroth, was a Sydney tram conductor who set up a business in 1917 which became Aeroplane Jelly, one of Australia's food icons alongside Vegemite. He says it is sole traders and successful business people who buy Ferraris, rather than chief executives of the large sharemarket-listed companies.\nHe says the steady unemployment rate nationally in Australia has prompted a renewed demand from sole traders who want to reward themselves after building up a business. They were reluctant to do that in the past few years when there was large amounts of restructuring and people losing their jobs.\n\"When you're letting people go, it's not the coolest thing to be seen driving a Ferrari,\" he says. \"There's been a period of abstinence since the GFC\".\nBut that has passed, and the pent-up demand from buyers with two years' worth of stock pre-sold, was evidence of the change in sentiment.\nFerrari has five dealers, one in each of the mainland capital cities, and there is now a two-year wait until 2017 for one of the new 488 GTB models.\nHe says if the Australian dollar falls against the euro, then the company will have to look at increasing the price of the vehicle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T17:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T14:43:57.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
