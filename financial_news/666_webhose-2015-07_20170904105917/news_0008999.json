Photo: Getty Images\nWhen were you last wowed by exceptional service on an Australian holiday?\nService so good – across travel, accommodation, entertainment and eating out – you commented on it, recommended the holiday to others, and made a point to return.\nA holiday where nothing was too much trouble for tourism operators providing the service and staff took real pride in their work, company and region.\nMy guess is many readers will answer the first question with \"rarely\" or \"never\". They have become accustomed to average service on Australian holidays, so their next trip is overseas – paying the same or less, and enjoying much better customer service.\nAdvertisement How many times have you heard people rave about service at an overseas resort or on a cruise? Why don't travelers rave about customer service on Australian holidays?\nI'm sure some do, and it is easy to generalise about service standards and base arguments on a few bad experiences. So you tell me: are service standards on Australian holidays improving or deteriorating?\nIt's an important question. The coming boom in Asian consumption is an unprecedented opportunity for Australia's tourist industry and the broader economy. Billions of people in emerging markets are forecast to join the middle-class by 2030.\nSome will, for the first time, have enough money to travel overseas. Strong growth in inbound Chinese tourism in Australian in the past few years is a taste of the magnitude of this opportunity over the next two decades.\nMy fear is Australian tourism follows the education sector's approach: churn through as many paying customers as possible, lower industry standards, treat the market (international students) like a cash cow, and lose contact with customers when they head home.\nMy hope is our tourism industry steps up and does something different: create, collaborate, innovate and consistently exceeds customer expectations. And that the industry builds on recent gains through genuine customer-service innovation.\nImagine the potential of combining the country's natural beauty – as good as or better than anywhere – with world-class customer service. Our tourism industry could unlock its incredible potential as the Asian consumption boom unfolds.\nBut service has to improve – quickly.\nI'm tired of the usual excuses: Australia is too expensive to do business, wages are too high, the industrial-relations system archaic.\nThe truth is, there are too many tourism operators who gouge holidaymakers, do not care about repeat business, and have appalling service standards. And too many hospitality workers who are only doing their job until something better comes along.\nI feel sorry for hardworking tourism operators who go out of their way to please holidaymakers and promote their region, and for staff who love hospitality work. They are let down by too many slack operators who sour the experience through shoddy service.\nTake my recent experience on a Queensland holiday. Great place. Great people. Average service. Every café or tourist attraction involved long queues, dealing with poorly trained staff, and paying inflated prices. (The same is true of some holidays in other States, in my experience).\nWhen a café charges $35 for a meal, to a packed room, and has two only two waiters, you know tourists are being robbed. Or they charge $4.80 for a small coffee that is made by a casual, teenage waitress who has no barista training.\nClearly, the operator is taking advantage of holidaymakers who will never return to the venue, and cares nothing about helping the local tourism industry.\nHere are some ideas to lift service standards in tourism, beyond the usual arguments around industrial relations and training:\n1. Co-ordinated marketing\nIt's astonishing how one can book a flight, car hire, and accommodation for a tourist destination – yet receive nothing from the region. Rarely are there pre-holiday marketing offers, real-time offers during the holidays (other than pamphlets), or surveys after the holiday.\nIt feels like some tourist destinations do not even realise you visited and they rely solely on private tourism operators, many of whom are terrible marketers.\nIt should be almost mandatory that, when visiting an Australian tourist destination, you download its App for your smartphone, fill in a short online survey to help the destination understand your expectations before arrival, receive targeted marketing offers, and are able to provide real-time feedback.\nThe region then uses big-data analytics to understand how customers are using the tourism \"product\", and anticipate their needs. Granted, this strategy is light years ahead of some private operators who still hope people pick up daggy pamphlets, but well within reach of forward-thinking destinations.\n2. Real-time feedback\nToo many tourist destinations do not ask customers about their experience or have sufficient systems for feedback. When was the last time the region you visited, not only its private operators, surveyed you about your experience?\nMy hunch is too many tourism regions do not understand how customers rate their product or understand which private operators are weak, letting everyone else down. Without strong data, they can do nothing about the problem.\n3. Incentives\nThe female taxi-driver who picked up my family on a recent holiday went out of her way to explain and promote the region's many attractions. She was a great example of one part of the tourist ecosystem helping win business for others – and a rare service highlight.\nTechnology could help regions create stronger incentives to lift customer service and collaboration platforms to benefit a wider group of operators.\nConsider a destination that gets much more data on travellers before, during and after their visit. Operators that consistently receive a high service score in customer surveys receive more leads or more promotion in marketing offers; those that get poor scores receive less.\nOperators that refer travellers to other businesses receive higher rankings and referrals, and so on. Effectively, the region takes much greater control of marketing, communicates with tourists daily (if requested) and uses that data to incentivise operators.\nBut that assumes local councils or tourism bodies are capable of managing such innovation. I'm sure many private operators will argue they are the real problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T04:48:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
