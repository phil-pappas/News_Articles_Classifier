That represents a 32% premium to MarkWestâ€™s closing price of $59.75 a share on Friday. Upon closing, MarkWest will become a wholly owned subsidiary of MPLX.\nMPLX was created by Marathon Petroleum Corp. in 2012 to own and operate pipelines and other midstream assets. Marathon will contribute $675 million to fund the cash payment to MarkWest shareholders.\nMarkWest Energy Partners processes natural gas in plays including the Marcellus and Utica shales. The deal values MarkWest at $20 billion, including $4.2 billion in debt.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/mplx-to-buy-markwest-energy-creating-4th-largest-mlp-1436785264?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T16:20:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
