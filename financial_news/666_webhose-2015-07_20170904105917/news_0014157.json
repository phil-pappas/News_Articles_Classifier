This is the ultra-low-cost carrier’s 50th consecutive profitable quarter. The airline said the results were due to maintaining low costs and flexibility to react to the market.\n“During this [12-year streak] we have seen macro disruptions in our economy including extremely high oil prices, significant financial disruptions and a recession. Throughout the years, our model of maintaining low costs and the flexibility to react to this constantly changing landscape has been critical to our long-term success,” chairman and CEO Maurice Gallagher said.\nRevenue rose 10.9% to $322 million, while expenses dipped 2.1 % to $229 million, producing an operating profit of $92.7 million, up 64.4% from a $56.4 million operating profit in the prior-year quarter.\nSystem traffic rose 13.6% to 2.3 billion RPMs on a 17.5% increase in capacity to 2.7 billion ASMs, producing a load factor of 85.7%, down 3 points.\nRASM lowered 1.7% to 12.49 cents and CASM decreased 15.8% to 8.64 cents. CASM ex-fuel was 5.79 cents, up 1.8%.\nIn the first half, Allegiant was embroiled in a contentious labor dispute with its pilots. In June, the US Court of Appeals ruled in Allegiant’s favor that the airline had the right to make changes in pilot work rules.\nAllegiant flies five Airbus A319s and nine A320s, 47 McDonnell Douglas MD-83s and six MD-88s. It will add four A320s in the second half of 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T21:03:09.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
