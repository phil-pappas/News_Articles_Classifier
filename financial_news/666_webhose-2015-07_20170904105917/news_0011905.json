Photo: Daniel Munoz\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission believes the use of the word 'significant' when it comes to potential breaches of the law should be scrutinised, following a series of high-profile scandals in the financial services industry.\nSpeaking to journalists on Wednesday, ASIC chairman Greg Medcraft noted that serious allegations of misconduct and insider trading at wealth group IOOF put the spotlight on Australia's current breach reporting regime.\n\"I think the word 'significant' has something that does cause issues, and I've said before in the Senate that I think that word 'significant' breach probably needs to be revisited because there's a lot of light interpretation and people could spend several years working out what is significant,\" he said.\n\"I do think it's an area that does need to be looked at frankly because, if you think about it, it goes again to the heart of our system, because our system is one that is self-executing in that we rely on management to report breaches of the law,\" he added.\nAdvertisement Mr Medcraft's comments come after IOOF boss Chris Kelaher admitted the company did not report serious allegations of misconduct by senior staff to the corporate watchdog, despite IOOF investigating insider trading and front running six years ago.\nMaking the comments at a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Mr Kelaher confirmed the $2.6 billion company had investigated its head of advice research, Peter Hilton, in 2009 and in 2014 for potential front running through a relative's account. Another staff member, Edward Youds, was also investigated for insider trading but he noted that the two men had not broken the law.\nIOOF, which has a network of more than 1100 advisers, had compensated 57 clients in the past two years and was reviewing the client files of a financial adviser based in Perth, who had never been reported to ASIC. The corporate regulator was made aware of the allegations after they were revealed by Fairfax Media.\nAllegations at IOOF come after a slew of other scandals permeating Australia's multibillion-dollar wealth sector. Commonwealth Bank of Australia's wealth division has been hit by cases of dodgy advice, after the bank reported 16 planners to ASIC for \"significant breaches\". There have also been reports of breaches by National Australia Bank.\n\"We can all work well and it can all work with trust and confidence and self-execution if people do the right thing,\" Mr Medcraft said.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/ioof-boss-admits-company-never-reported-suspected-insider-trading-to-asic-20150707-gi6nmg"], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:08:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
