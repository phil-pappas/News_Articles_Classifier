So you are left with a single-B independent oil and gas company in Colombia,\" said the trader.\nPacific Rubiales's shares were down nearly 41% at C$3.13 as of 10:13 EST, according to Thomson Reuters data. Alfa shares were up 4.3% at Ps31.4.\nThe market reaction on Alfa's own bond curve was modest, as the company was not planning to consolidate Pacific Rubiales into its balance sheet, said the trader. Alfa notes traded up by roughly a point early on Thursday.
