Independent directors of the company sought legal advice after receiving a threat from Singapore Power in late May. Ken Irwin Share on twitter by Tony Boyd The corporate governance train wreck at Victoria's primary electricity transmission network AusNet Services is worse than first thought with independent directors worried that dominant shareholder Singapore Power wanted them to break the law.\nChanticleer can reveal that independent directors of the company sought legal advice after receiving a threat from Singapore Power in late May.\nThe threat came in the form of a letter to the company setting out the terms and conditions of a joint bid for TransGrid, the transmission company being sold by the NSW government.\nThe letter set out the terms for bidding and concluded with the threat that if the board did not agree to the terms Singapore Power would do everything in its power to stop AusNet from bidding for TransGrid.\nIt is illegal under the Competition and Consumer Act (CCA) for separate parties to make agreements between themselves about bidding for contracts.\nThis prohibition on bid rigging under the cartel provisions of the CCA is being tested in the Federal Court at the moment. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is taking action against Paul and Moses Obeid over alleged cartel behaviour in the bidding for mining leases in NSW in concert with Cascade Coal.\nThere is no suggestion by Chanticleer that Singapore Power acted illegally in threatening the directors of AusNet. In fact, if Singapore Power is a related party of AusNet this would be the robust argy bargy between commercial partners.\nBut the independent directors of AusNet, led by Tony Iannello, were sufficiently worried about the threat from Singapore Power to seek legal advice on the implications of the threat.\n At that time AusNet was working with its financial adviser Citi to develop a consortium bid for TransGrid.\nAusNet's independent directors sought legal advice from the law firm advising them on the transaction Gilbert + Tobin.\nChanticleer understands the directors were conscious of the CCA cartel provisions, which say that you cannot act in concert to get a better outcome from a bidding process. Based on their review of the legal advice directors took the view that it was not appropriate to accede to the threat made by Singapore Power.\nThere was a second important reason why the independent directors did not think it was in the interests of shareholders to agree to the TransGrid bidding conditions put forward by Singapore Power.\nThe independent directors thought the terms were not commercial. The price was too high and could possibly have resulted in Singapore Power potentially entrenching its position at the company.\nIt is clear the independent directors of the company were trying their best to defend the interests of minority shareholders.\nThis strong message did eventually get through to Singapore Power.\nIn the weeks leading up to last week's AusNet annual general meeting, Singapore Power sent another letter to the board resiling from its demand that the independent directors abide by its earlier threat.\nBut Singapore Power still decided to use its voting power to sack Iannello from the board. Singapore Power was joined in that vote by China's State Grid Corporation.\nSingapore Power owns 31.1 per cent of AusNet and State Grid owns 20 per cent. If they happen to agree on important issues such as director voting they can jointly control the company. But Lim Howe Run, Singapore Power's corporate representative, said last week that \"there have been no arrangements nor understandings between SP and State Grid on any of the resolutions put forward at AusNet's ag\".\nSingapore Power said it did not submit an expression of interest and will not participate directly in the proposed NSW TransGrid transaction or enter into any consortium which competes with AusNet for this transaction. If the goings on at AusNet are investigated by the ACCC a critical question will be whether or not Singapore Power and AusNet were related parties or independent bidders for TransGrid at the time the letter was sent.\nIndustry sources say Singapore Power did explore bidding in its own right for TransGrid but it struck problems because of concerns about the corporate governance of any consortium it was involved in.\nTo a series of questions Chanticleer sent to Singapore Power's PR representative on Monday, Singapore Power said it \"has nothing further to add beyond the statements which have already been provided\".\nTechnology leadership Banking has often been likened to a big technology business that moves money electronically. That simplistic description ignores the value of a strong credit culture and the importance of nebulous attributes that engender trust in the institution.\nBut if a bank fails in the technology leadership stakes it will soon lose its customers and possibly disadvantage its shareholders.\nThat is why James Eyers's report about Westpac Banking Corp's inability to charge property investors and owner occupiers different interest rates is of serious concern.\nWe could be seeing the first worrying signs that the Westpac is paying the price for not replacing its core systems.\nWestpac has always argued that its customer facing systems were the best in the market and that it was not a technology laggard. It has said that there was no need to dump the 40 to 50-year-old systems at its core.\nThat argument never washed at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which did put make the commitment to spending billions of dollars to enable real time banking.\nHowever, Westpac must find a way to charge for higher risk lending or start turning customers away. The alternative would be to breach its obligations to the prudential regulator.\nChina's capital outflows The world is increasingly interested in the large capital outflows from China but it is all a little too late, according to Standard Chartered Bank's chief China economist, Shuang Ding.\nHe told Chanticleer that the average monthly capital outflows of $US50 billion over the past year are coming to an end.\nHe says the outflows were a function of the Chinese corporate sector covering their short positions in US dollars. These position were built up as part of the carry trade, which involved borrowing in cheap US dollars and taking it back to China.\nThe corporates were encouraged to unwind this carry trade by the Chinese authorities because it showed conservatism and an understanding of managing foreign exchange risk.\nHowever, in a recent note to clients, Ding said the measures due to be introduced later this year will encourage a new wave of capital outflow from China.\nHe said the \"introduction of the Qualified Domestic Individual Investor (QDII2) programme, which allows households to invest overseas, will likely lead to net capital outflows in the medium term, although we expect the government to maintain its safeguards under the managed-convertibility regime.\"\n\"We expect it to continue to run a current account surplus and to calibrate liberalisation measures, to ensure capital account outflows do not consistently exceed the current account surplus.\n\"We believe the CNY will maintain its strength against most major currencies in such a scenario.\"\nChina's current account surplus is this year expected to be a record. It is expected to be about $US400 billion or at least double the previous year.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-07-27T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:04:46.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
