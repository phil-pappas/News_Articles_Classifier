Photo: Justin McManus\nAustralians holidaying overseas must accept their dollars will buy less European beer and fewer New York hot dogs, as economists predict the currency will only continue to slide in value.\nThe Australian dollar hit a new six-year low on Monday of US74.78c, its lowest level since May 2009, on the back of continuing uncertainty in Greece .\nAustralian holiday makers were enjoying parity with the US dollar as recently as 2011, but AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said he expected the currency would continue to fall.\n\"My own view has been that it will probably be down to around 70¢ by the year's end and that some time in the next year or two we'll see it into the 60s,\" Dr Oliver said.\nAdvertisement \"At the moment we've come back to what I would call 'fair value', but history tells us we usually go a bit lower than that … it tends to overshoot.\"\nHe said Australians were already responding to the currency's drop by holidaying locally rather than overseas.\nMelbourne bicycle representative and tour guide Al Bethel has kept an eye on the dollar before he flies out on Saturday to lead a group following the Tour de France around Europe.\nThe tour of 12 will follow the mountain stages in Italy, France and Switzerland, where the drop in the dollar's value will be most keenly felt.\n\"Every day people are doing the calculations, every time they spend money they are conscious of it,\" Mr Bethel said.\n\"The inexperienced tourists are just going to buy things because of the wow-factor, but the experienced tourists are always going to do a calculation and look at where the dollar's at.\"\nThe dollar was on parity with the Swiss franc in 2012 and was 87¢ in September last year, but had slid to 70¢ on Monday.\nTravel guides suggest mid-range tourists in Switzerland spend about 250 Swiss francs a day.\nFor Australians following this advice, the movement in the dollar's value from September to July translates to a hike from budgeting $285 a day to $352 a day.\nWhile the dollar was down to 67 euro cents on Monday, compared with a year-high of 73¢ in April, Dr Oliver said the drop had been softened by the crisis in Greece, which was weakening the shared European currency.\nHe said holidaymakers heading to Asia will also get less for their dollar, because many Asian currencies are tied to the US greenback.\nA Fairfax Media survey of 25 analysts published on Friday shows they predict the dollar will finish 2015 between US68¢ and US80¢, with the average coming in at US73¢ .\nTourism and Transport Forum Australia CEO Margy Osmond said Australians may start to look domestically for holidays if the dollar headed lower, a scenario that would also attract more overseas visitors.\n\"We could be seeing more travellers visiting Australia from our established markets like the USA, New Zealand and the UK as well as from emerging markets in Asia.\n\"Further falls in the Aussie dollar could also see the number of Chinese visitors to Australia crack the 1 million mark this year.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T19:12:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
