Photo: James Davies\nAfter all the pain big banks caused in the global financial crisis, making them safer is one of the top goals of regulators around the world.\nThis was one of the problems considered by last year's financial system inquiry, which Treasurer Joe Hockey is expected to respond to soon. On Monday the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority provided an important guide on its thinking on the inquiry's top recommendation.\nIt is pretty technical, but it can affect bank shareholders and customers. Here are five key questions on crisis-proofing the banks.\nThe simplest measure of a bank's strength is its capital.\n1. What makes a bank strong?\nAdvertisement Perhaps the simplest measure of a bank's strength is its capital, which is funds for absorbing losses. Shareholders' equity and retained profits are especially important parts of a bank's capital.\nBanks need capital buffers so that when loans aren't repaid they can cover the losses. Think of it as an airbag in a car. Just like in real life the size of the air bag is important here.\nThe big banks helped lead a strong rebound on the ASX.\nTo measure the amount needed experts look at the banks' capital compared with the value of their loans. Australia's big banks have capital ratios of about 8.5 to 10 per cent of their loan books.\nThe Financial System Inquiry chaired by David Murray last year concluded that Australia's banks were in pretty good shape on this measure, but there was room for improvement.\nThe inquiry's first recommendation was that Australia set its capital standards so that our banks are \"unquestionably strong\" compared with the other banks they compete with for funding overseas.\nBanks need capital buffers so that when loans aren't repaid they can cover the losses.

Well what on earth is \"unquestionably strong\"?\nJust as when mixing a gin and tonic, this is an important question but one that can be difficult to answer.\nMurray says it should be set by looking overseas. He wants Australia's banks to be in the top quarter of the ladder in the world - the top quartile. That recommendation is sitting on Treasurer Joe Hockey's desk.\nMost analysts agree that banks' returns are likely to suffer.

That would lift their capital ratios by about 2 percentage points to the level needed to meet Murray's definition of \"unquestionably strong.\"\n3. How will the banks get there?\nThis is the question investors have been asking banks since Murray floated the idea of higher capital levels last year. We've already seen a few examples of what banks can do.\nOne option is to ask shareholders to cough up some extra money in an equity raising. National Australia Bank did this in May, raising $5.5 billion, some of which will bolster the bank's capital position , and finance its exit from the UK.\nAnother option is to sell assets and pocket the proceeds. ANZ chief executive Mike Smith has flagged this approach, which could see it offload several minority stakes in Asian banking businesses.\n4. What does that mean for bank dividends?\nMost analysts agree that banks' returns are likely to suffer. That suggests we're unlikely to see strong growth in bank dividends - but neither will bank boards want to cut the cash value of dividends per share.\nThis month Morgan Stanley analyst Richard Wiles forecast return on equity would be about 1.5 percentage points lower in the \"medium term\" than today because of the higher capital reserves. That would translate into a period of \"flat\" dividends, he said.\n5. And what about bank customers?\nBetter capitalised banks should be safer. But holding extra capital comes at a cost and there is a good chance they will try to pass some of the extra cost onto customers.\nThis may be done by tinkering with interest rates on loans and deposits: what is politely termed \"re-pricing.\"\nJP Morgan analyst Scott Manning last month estimated banks would have to jack up interest rates on home loans by 0.3 percentage points to pass on the costs of some of capital requirements being mooted in global discussions.\nOf course, they would still be subject to the forces of competition. Manning said such \"blanket\" re-pricing would be unwise because it would give their smaller rivals a better chance of competing.\nNonetheless, if the Reserve Bank of Australia cuts interest rates again, several analysts predict the big banks will use it as an opportunity to claw back some of the costs of holding more capital.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/anz-eyes-asset-sales-to-boost-shareholder-returns-20150505-ggulw7.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/nab-profit-hits-33b-clydesdale-bank-demerger-and-55b-rights-issue-announced-20150507-ggvvsj.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/apra-says-bank-capital-will-not-be-tied-to-international-benchmarks-20150713-giar62"], "published": "2015-07-13T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:53:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
