Indeed, India is projected to clock gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 8.2% in 2016-17, the highest among developing Asian economies ( see chart ). ADB is not the only global or regional financial institution that has given a bright outlook for the Indian economy; the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects India’s growth to zoom ahead of Asian economies. The World Bank has said similar nice things.\nHowever, high growth could mean higher inflation. According to the latest ADB outlook, India’s inflation is going to rebound to 5.5% by 2016-17, the highest among Asian economies after Kazakhstan. In fact, IMF expects consumer prices in India to rise to 5.8% in 2015, 5.9% in 2016 and 5.2% in 2017. That brings us to the problem. If inflation is really going to stay above 5%, according to the estimates of ADB and IMF, that would be well above the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) objective of targeting consumer price inflation of 4% for 2016-17. Simply put, if ADB and IMF forecasts are right, there’s no room for RBI to cut rates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:33:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
