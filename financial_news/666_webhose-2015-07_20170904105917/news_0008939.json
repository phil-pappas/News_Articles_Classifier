A review of corporate costs will continue as part of Beach’s broader organisational review,” Mr Cole said.\nBeach reported quarterly production of 2.3 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe|), up 8 per cent on the previous quarter.\nBeach Energy (Frame content direct link: http://markets.theaustralian.com.au/embed/BPT/640 .) Full year production of 9.2 MMboe was at the upper end of revised guidance.\nSales volumes were up 16 per cent on the prior quarter, which was largely attributed to higher oil production and increased customer demand for gas.\nFull year sales volumes of 10.5 MMboe were marginally below FY14 record volumes.\nTotal revenue of $170 million for the quarter was $40 million, or 30 per cent, higher than the previous quarter, mainly due to increased sales volumes and stronger Australian dollar oil prices.\nBeach maintained a strong cash position of $170 million, up $5 million from the previous quarter.\n“An increase in June quarterly oil and gas production delivered a strong end to the financial year for Beach.\n“This was a result of prudent financial management which included a significant reduction in the\ncompany’s capital expenditure.”\nBeach’s capital expenditure of $69 million was 13 per cent down on the prior quarter and 52 per cent lower than the same time last year.\nFY16 capex is forecast at between $240 million and $270 million.\n“Beach is in a strong financial position with our cash balance slightly up from the previous quarter as a direct result of decisions made, especially in relation to capital expenditure,” Mr Cole said.\nThe company has continued to realign its focus on Australia by exiting Romania and\nprogressing the sale of its Egyptian business.\nBeach expects to produce between 7.8 and 8.6 MMboe in FY16, lower than FY15 production mainly due to reduced drilling activity and natural field decline.\nGas sales volumes over the same period are expected to be higher because of a likely drawdown from storage.\nBeach’s organisational review is continuing, with outcomes from the company’s review of strategy to be announced in the coming weeks.\nBeach shares were down half a per cent in early trade at 90.5c.", "external_links": ["http://markets.theaustralian.com.au/embed/BPT/640"], "published": "2015-07-29T17:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T18:53:26.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
