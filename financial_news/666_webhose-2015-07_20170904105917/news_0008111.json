Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow Australian governments must give farmers more rights when mining companies are negotiating access to potential gas or coal reserves on their property, says Human Rights Commissioner Tim Wilson.\nAs a national debate was fought over mining access to agricultural land, Mr Wilson said the laws did not help the impasse by licensing mining companies to gain access to a farmer's property so they could prospect and extract resources.\n\"It is not done on the basis of consent or respect for the farmer. And that's when you get conflict and I would argue, a human rights violation,\" Mr Wilson said in a speech to be delivered to the Castan Centre for Human Rights law conference at Monash University on Friday.\n\"But it's important to focus on the cause of the problem. Many people will see a mining company trampling on the rights of the farmer. But the issue is not the miner. The miner is only doing what the law allows them to do.\n\"The issue is the law and whether it properly respects the surface property rights of the farmer. Only government can legally facilitate this violation and absent the necessary respect for rights.\"\nMr Wilson said most of the opposition to coal seam gas was \"nonsensical and absurd\" but human rights abuses did occur. He said property rights were often the forgotten human right.\nIn Australia, a property owner owns the top soil and what's on it, while the government owns anything underneath - which means they can mine or build a tunnel under your home.\nMr Wilson said the process worked well when there was a voluntary exchange or free-market approach where a farmer negotiated entry rights to his property and a share of the profits of gas wells on his property.\n AgForce chief executive Charles Burke said Australia had a convoluted system of federal and state laws, compared to the United States laws which gives farmers more rights to negotiate a stronger financial outcome.\n\"We need to have the opportunity to explore and extract minerals but it needs to be done more in conjuction with the custodians above the ground. It's time to review the laws in Australia and there needs to be a better balance,\" he said.\nThe problems with the legal system was not just restricted to farmers, but also indigenous Australians who under existing laws did not have the full property rights that traditionally governed native title.\n\"These issues must be addressed in the interests of all parties. Conferred rights aid both communities and the mining sector because it gives certainty and predictability,\" Mr Wilson said.\n\"This then means that negotiations can be held and undertaken in good faith, they can properly recognise each party's power, and there can be certainty and acceptance for any outcome.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-07-23T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T02:01:20.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
