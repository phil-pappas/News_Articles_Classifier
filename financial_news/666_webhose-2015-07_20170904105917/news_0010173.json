Chris Pearce Share on twitter by Perry Williams Two of Australia's most powerful infrastructure players say Brookfield's $9 billion tilt for Asciano may unleash a flood of overseas interest in local utility and electricity assets as global investors clamour for reliable earnings in a low-yield economy.\nPort of Melbourne Corporation chairman Mark Birrell and NSW Ports chairman Paul McClintock said the Canadian giant's proposed bid for ports and rail operator Asciano could lead to a surge in interest in other assets being put up for sale by state governments.\nAsciano's Patrick stevedores business is one of the largest users at both the Port of Melbourne and Port Botany in Sydney.\nWith the $6 billion Port of Melbourne itself potentially up for sale later this year, Mr Birrell said he was encouraged by the emergence of Brookfield's offer for Asciano.\n\"I'm very pleased that there is heightened investment interest in the nation's infrastructure assets because we need extra funds attracted to it to help fund new projects,\" said Mr Birrell, who is also chairman of Infrastructure Australia. \"Australia can't simply rely on increased public funds – it has to attract new sources of capital – and overseas funds are increasingly going to drive this interest. They like the long-term returns.\"\nBrookfield offer Brookfield, Canada's largest alternative asset manager, lobbed a non-binding cash-and-shares offer last week valuing Asciano at $9.05 a share, a 36 per cent premium to the $6.65 the company's stock closed at on Tuesday. Asciano shares climbed by about 20 per cent in the following three trading days before falling 14¢ or 1.75 per cent to close at $7.86 on Monday.\nMr McClintock said Asciano chief executive John Mullen had impressed the market by improving its port and rail infrastructure over the past few years and said companies with long-lived assets were particularly attractive given low growth in other asset classes.\n \"In a lower interest rate world, there will increasingly be more and more investors looking at long-duration assets,\" said Mr McClintock, who is also the chairman of the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia (Ceda). \"It's an international space so you will see lots of foreign interest coming through as assets around the country are put up for sale.\"\nA string of major government-owned Australian infrastructure facilities are being primed for sale by the end of this year as state governments seek to raise cash to build new roads and highways.\nThe Victorian government is debating whether to put the Port Of Melbourne up for sale in a potential $6 billion deal while NSW Premier Mike Baird has promised to spend $20 billion on state infrastructure projects following the expected long-term lease of its electricity poles and wires.\nRenewed interest Mr Birrell said the renewed interest from international investors was giving governments the confidence to consider the leasing and outright sale of lucrative state-owned assets.\n\"It motivates governments to look at whether they can recycle capital out of old assets into new, secure in the knowledge that there are people who want to invest. That's healthy and I think the privatisation of electricity in the 1990s in Victoria proved the benefits both in terms of increased competition but also reusing the capital,\" Mr Birrell said. \"I think the Baird government's process of making a long-term lease of energy assets will be equally successful.\"\nBoth Asciano and Brookfield are undertaking a period of due diligence, expected to take about six weeks, leaving investors to question how the takeover offer will be structured and whether Brookfield may consider drafting in consortium partners to boost its bid.\nOne sticking point with the deal is the mix between cash and shares that will be offered to Asciano shareholders. Brookfield has offered Asciano shareholders units in the US-listed Brookfield Infrastructure Partners fund and cash but has yet to specify the value split between the two.\nBrookfield is understood to have started initial talks with investment bank Citi over the possible financing of a deal in the past week with a possible advisory role also up for grabs.\nFlexible funding deal possible Credit Suisse last week speculated Brookfield may look for a flexible funding deal that will appeal to Asciano investors hungry for access to capital markets.\nWhile Asciano has a crucial relationship with both the Sydney and Melbourne ports authorities, its relationship in Victoria has been strained in recent months.\nIn March, Mr Mullen called for the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission to take a more active role in regulating Australia's ports , after the Port of Melbourne proposed raising stevedore rents by up to 800 per cent.\nMr Mullen warned that up to 20 per cent of container volumes through the Port of Melbourne could be lost if the port goes ahead with the proposed rent increases.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/perrybwilliams", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/rome-is-burning-stevedores-cry-foul-over-port-of-melbourne-rent-increase-20150311-141axd.html"], "published": "2015-07-06T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T22:09:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
