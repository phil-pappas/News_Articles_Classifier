Charles Soukup purchased 50,000 shares for 51p each, spending a total of £25,000. \nFollowing the transaction, Soukup, the founding shareholder and chairman of Thalassa, holds 3.49m shares in the group, which represent 14.1% of its total voting rights. \nThe company last month reported a full-year pre-tax loss of $12.23m compared with profit of $4.96m a year earlier and revenue declined 49.1% to $15.5m, as companies' exploration budgets were slashed with the oil industry being rocked by staff cuts, disposals and equipment write-downs following the collapse in the price of oil starting at the end of last year. \nTop Director Buys Thalassa Holdings Ltd.
