Paul Jones Share on twitter by David Ramli Telstra is ramping up the amount it spends on its mobile phone networks to a total of $5 billion in the three years ending June 2017 to fend off competition from key rivals like Singtel-Optus.\nTelstra chief executive Andy Penn announced the telco giant would raise the annual spending on maintaining and expanding its mobile network by $500 million over the next two years during a speech to the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia on Thursday. The speech is his first significant public appearance since taking the reins .\nIt represents a 25 per cent increase on the amount that Telstra would normally spend on the network comes just weeks after Optus pledged to raise its infrastructure spending from around $1 billion per year to $1.77 billion over the next 12 months .\n\"We will increase our total capex investments to 15 per cent of sales for the next two years providing more than another half a billion dollars for mobiles,\" he said. \"In total, over three years to June 2017 we expect to have invested more than $5 billion into Telstra's leading mobile network.\n\"We will continue to expand our 4G footprint to 99 per cent of the population [and] our overall footprint to 2.5 million square kilometres, which we believe is around double that of our nearest competitor.\"\nTelstra has traditionally spent between $1 billion and $1.2 billion per year on its mobile network and is the dominant player in the market. But it is locked in a race with Optus to become Australia's leading provider of mobile services.\n\"During my time as chief executive I am committed to make sure we have the best networks in Australia with the broadest coverage,\" he said.\nTelstra's rivals have also been highly critical of the company's mobile market dominance and claim it has an unfair advantage backed by government incentives that costs customers extra money.\n But Mr Penn launched a staunch defense of Telstra's position and said it was thanks to serious investments.\n\"There is a lot of noise from our competitors about the fairness of Telstra's superior mobile network. But it is there because, we have had the vision and we have been prepared to invest,\" he said. \"Let's face it, all three operators have the capacity and the balance sheets to invest. The only difference between us is Telstra has consistently been prepared to do so.\n\"It is Telstra that is putting up almost 90% of the capital from the industry to support the black-spot programme.\"\nThe news is likely to greatly benefit Telstra's mobile network supplier Ericsson.\nMore to come.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/telstra-customers-hit-with-31b-in-annual-taxes-centre-for-international-economics-report-20150615-ghlxfz.html", "https://twitter.com/Davidramli"], "published": "2015-07-09T11:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:11:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
