The court was not immediately available for comment.\n\"This finding by the court is really very strange. Unfortunately it seems like the court wanted to forward this hot potato to the higher courts,\" Schrems' lawyer, Wolfram Proksch, said in a statement.\nSchrems accuses Facebook of aiding the U.S. National Security Agency in running its PRISM programme, which mined the personal data of Facebook users.\n\"This litigation was unnecessary and we're pleased that the court has roundly rejected these claims,\" a spokesman for Facebook said. \"We remain happy to work with our regulator, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, to address any questions about our commitment to protecting people's information.\"\nEuropean politicians have grown increasingly concerned about Facebook, Google and other American companies' domination of the Internet industry, and have sought ways to curb their power.\nSchrems also has a case pending at the European Court of Justice financed by crowd-sourcing, which mainly relates to the so-called Safe Harbor agreement governing data transfers from Europe to the United States.\n($1 = 0.8989 euros) (Reporting By Shadia Nasralla,; additional reporting by Erich Auchard in Frankfurt; Editing by Thomas Atkins and Andrew Heavens)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T12:34:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
