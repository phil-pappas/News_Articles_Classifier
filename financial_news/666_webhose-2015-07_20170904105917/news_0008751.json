The trust made up of office buildings from China Vanke Co. in the southern city of Shenzhen is awaiting completion of industry and commerce registration before it starts to trade on the Shenzhen stock exchange, Yu said.\nThe China Securities Regulatory Commission in June granted approval for the first public sale of units by a REIT, allowing builders to look for alternative ways to make money from their investments in commercial property.\n“The over-subscription is in line with our expectation,” Yu said over the phone. “The product drew quite a bit of public attention.”\nThe listing schedule hasn’t been derailed by the stock market rout which has wiped out about $2.5 trillion of market value since June 12, she added.\nThe REIT, backed by the operating rights of the property assets, differs from the traditional REIT structure in the U.S., where investors have full ownership of the assets in the trust, according to a June 17 Barclays Plc report.\nThe underlying assets are owned by Shenzhen Qianhai Development & Investment Holding Co., a state-owned developer fully owned by the Shenzhen municipal government, according to the trust’s June 23 prospectus.\nIt’s the only “quasi-REIT” product in China designed to be accessible to all retail investors once it lists on the Shenzhen stock exchange, Barclays said in the report.\n“At least it shows that the government is becoming more and more open with REITs,” said Du Jinsong, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T06:47:45.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
