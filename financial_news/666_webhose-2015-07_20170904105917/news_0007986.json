Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates hurt sales by 8.3 percent.\nSecond-quarter earnings excluding one-time items were $1.08 a share Analysts had forecast $1.06 on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nHumira is AbbVie’s biggest product and made up 63 percent of the company’s revenue last year. The drug brought in $3.54 billion, short of the $3.69 billion analysts had estimated. AbbVie is seeking to reduce its reliance on the biotechnology medicine, which will eventually face competition from cheaper versions known as biosimilars. To diversify, it bought Pharmacyclics Inc. for $21 billion in May, gaining a blockbuster cancer therapy that AbbVie thinks could be applied to many more malignancies beyond its current approvals for several types of blood cancer.\nThe drugmaker also has a hepatitis C treatment, Viekira Pak, generated $385 million in sales, compared with an average estimate of $370 million. AbbVie is competing with Gilead Sciences Inc. for a share of the lucrative hepatitis C market.\nAbbVie shares fell 2.2 percent to $69 at 8:02 a.m. in New York, in trading before the market opened. The stock has gained 30 percent in the past year, compared with a 54 percent increase in the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T15:21:36.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
