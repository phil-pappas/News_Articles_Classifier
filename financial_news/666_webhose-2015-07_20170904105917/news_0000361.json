That&apos;s good news for the remainder of the year as smaller declines in spending on oilfield infrastructure stretching from western North Dakota to south Texas will become less of a drag on the economy, barring of course a collapse in oil prices.\nWhen the government releases its first estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product on July 30, the data will probably show an even bigger decrease in outlays on mining, exploration and well shafts after a 49 percent annualized retreat from January through March, according to Daniel Silver at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York.\nThe plunge will subtract 0.7 percentage point from GDP in the second quarter after reducing growth by 0.4 point in the first three months of the year, Silver wrote in a research note last week. Private investment in all non-residential structures, including but not limited to factories, hotels and oil rigs and platforms, slumped an annualized 18.8 percent in the first quarter. That marked the biggest nosedive in four years.\nWhile the number of active rigs will keep falling in the third quarter, the rate at which oil companies are pulling back from the fields is starting to moderate, as the chart below shows. According to Baker Hughes, the number of U.S. oil and gas rigs plunged 27 percent in the first quarter from the previous three months and 35 percent in the second quarter. In the first two weeks of this quarter, the average count is down 4.9 percent.\nMore stable oil prices already are helping stop the bleeding.\n\"We think investment in mining exploration, shafts and well structures will only subtract a tenth or two from 3Q GDP growth,\" Silver said.", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/ilbhEIxvmdvk/v1/460x260.png\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iWfTfVXX7CMU/v1/460x260.png\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/igIrC7D7m40g/v1/460x260.png\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iRTsTHWzMiJ4/v1/460x260.png\\"], "published": "2015-07-14T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:02:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
