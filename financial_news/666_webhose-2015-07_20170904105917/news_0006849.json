Second, we believe no meaningful reform can be made under FIFA's existing leadership.\" \nFIFA has been under scrutiny since Swiss police raided a luxury hotel in Zurich on May 27 to make arrests in a sprawling corruption probe of the international soccer body. \nUS authorities have charged 14 people in all -- soccer officials and sports business executives -- over more than $150 million in bribes paid to secure television and marketing contracts for football tournaments. \nSwiss authorities are in parallel investigating the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively. \nIn the wake of the scandal, non-government activists have called for tough scrutiny of large banks, arguing that they turned a blind eye to evidence of illegal payments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T03:37:51.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
