This is known as the interchange fee. While these costs are borne initially by retailers’ banks, they are passed on to retailers and in turn to the public, including those not paying with plastic, through higher prices.\nThe new rules cap these fees at 0.2% for debit card and 0.3% for credit card transactions. At present, credit card interchange fees in the UK are typically around 0.85% per transaction, so retailers should enjoy “significant savings”, the Treasury consultation said.\nThe chancellor, George Osborne, said on Monday that he was “determined to tackle the unfair fees that Britain’s businesses are often charged when their customers pay by card – fees which are often passed on to consumers”.\nThe EU regulations allow governments to set lower caps for domestic card transactions, though in the consultation document the UK government proposes an average 0.2% limit on debit card and 0.3% on credit card fees.", "external_links": ["https://www.gov.uk/government/news/credit-and-debit-card-fees-to-be-capped", "https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/interchange-fee-regulation/interchange-fee-regulation-a-consultation"], "published": "2015-07-28T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T17:06:45.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
