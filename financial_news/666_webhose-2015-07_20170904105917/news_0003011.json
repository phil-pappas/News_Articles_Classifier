The program represents another important step in GM's previously stated architecture consolidation plan. \nThe vehicle family is being developed by a multinational team of engineers and designers assigned to ensure each entry is tailored to meet the expectations of customers in each market. Vehicles will be manufactured and sold in several markets including Brazil, China, India and Mexico, and exported for sale to other important growth markets. There are no plans to export the vehicles to mature markets such as the United States. A high level of localization of parts suppliers should drive significant savings over the life of the program. The program is expected to grow to more than 2 million vehicles annually with the first entry planned for the 2019 model year. \n\"We have taken many decisive actions over the past few years to restructure our business in specific markets as part of our plan to become a more customer-focused company and to generate superior returns on our owners' capital,\" said Ammann. \"This growth initiative is the next important step toward our goal of building the world's most valued automotive company.\" \nMore information on the investment plans and all-new vehicle family will be announced in the future in each market. \nAbout Chevrolet \nFounded in 1911 in Detroit, Chevrolet is now one of the world's largest car brands, doing business in more than 115 countries and selling around 4.8 million cars and trucks a year.
