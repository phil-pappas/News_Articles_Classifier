FDC by Tommaso Ebhardt, Ruth David and Mark Clothier Ferrari, the supercar maker being spun off by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, picked UBS Group to help manage its initial public offering in New York later this year, people with knowlege of the matter said.\nJPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs Group are also due to play a role in selling 10 per cent of Ferrari's shares to investors, said the people, who asked not to be named before an official announcement. Fiat and Ferrari declined to comment, as did representatives for UBS, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.\nDebt-laden Fiat Chrysler is spinning off Ferrari to help fund a €48 billion investment program that focuses on expanding the Jeep, Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands globally. Chief executive officer Sergio Marchionne is expecting a valuation of \"at least\" €10 billion for Ferrari, which is equivalent to about 60 per cent of the parent company's market value. Marchionne's targeted figure is higher than the €8.7 billion average of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.\nIn addition to the IPO, Fiat Chrysler plans to distribute its remaining 80 per cent stake in the supercar maker to its own investors, with Ferrari being an independent entity from the beginning of 2016. Piero Ferrari, the son of founder Enzo Ferrari, owns the remaining 10 per cent.\nFerrari, whose logo features the colors of the Italian flag, plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange and will be organised as a Dutch holding company with its fiscal residence in the UK, Marchionne said last week. This would mirror the multi-national structure used by Fiat Chrysler. Marchionne said Ferrari's auto operations will continue to be based at its traditional home in Maranello in northern Italy and pay taxes there.\nThe listing, which was originally targeted for the end of June, was delayed until at least October 13 because of tax issues, Marchionne said last month.\nFiat is betting that Maserati can play a similar role to Ferrari, one reason why Marchionne is adding an SUV and coupe to the model lineup and opening plush US dealerships from Westport, Connecticut, to San Jose, California.\n\"Maserati is very important,\" Marchionne said in an interview. After the Ferrari spinoff, \"Maserati becomes the most coveted, exclusive brand that we have\".\n Maserati's reputation for performance is well established, and luxury autos are selling briskly in the US. But that segment of the market is crowded and aggressively contested by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi and Lexus. For Marchionne to succeed, wealthy Americans will have to see Maserati's $US69,800, entry- level Ghibli sedan as a viable alternative to the BMW 5 Series or Mercedes E-Class.\nAnd while Maserati more than doubled shipments to 36,448 in 2014, the brand has since stumbled. Through April, vehicle sales fell 9 per cent to 7306. First-quarter profit sank 39 per cent to $US40 million, a decline Fiat attributed to a slowdown in China.\nThe Ghibli, introduced in 2013, sold well at first in the US but in recent months dealers have been ladling out incentives. In May discounts rose to $US9602 a vehicle, almost triple the level in February, according to Autodata Corp.\n\"Some of the dealers, with the help of Maserati, got a little bit aggressive on discounting that vehicle, so it kind of lost its Maserati coolness,\" said Mark Akbar of AutoNation, which runs the San Jose store. \"It's a good car, it performs well. But margins have just gone down the drain since its introduction last year.\"\nThe challenge for Maserati is finding a way to broaden its appeal without chipping away at the exclusivity that lets it charge as much as $US210,000 for a convertible Quattroporte.\nThe 101-year-old brand started out making spark plugs for planes. The first car to bear the Maserati name was built in 1926 and immediately began winning races. In 1929, a Maserati set a world speed record - 153 miles (246 kilometers) per hour - the first of many to come. The brand's trident badge is a facsimile of the three-pronged spear brandished by a statue of the god Neptune in Bologna, Italy, Maserati's original hometown.\nOver the decades, Maserati built a reputation as a less flashy cousin to Ferrari, which plans an initial public offering.\nMaserati's cars were sleek and stylish and consumed the quarter-mile at a blistering pace. The relative scarcity of the product only enhanced the brand's exclusivity; global sales didn't crack 10,000 until 2013.\nThese were cars driven by rock stars. In 1978, Joe Walsh paid homage in the classic song \"Life's Been Good,\" in which he sings: \"My Maserati does 185. I lost my license. Now I don't drive.\" More recently, the Hollywood arrivistes of HBO's \"Entourage\" burned up the Los Angeles freeways in Maseratis.\nFiat bought the company in 1993, and in the past five years Marchionne has helped restore its performance and lustre. Maserati doesn't command Ferrari's 13 per cent margins, but its 10 per cent showing is triple that of Fiat Chrysler's margin overall.\nBoosting profit is crucial if Marchionne is to generate sufficient cash to develop the next generation of vehicles and technologies. His only other option is to share the costs by merging with another auto maker, which seems unlikely in the short term despite his efforts to cut a deal.\nMarchionne has pledged to boost Maserati margins to 15 per cent and almost double global sales to 75,000 by 2018 - a tall order, analysts say. IHS Automotive forecasts Maserati registrations of about 54,000 by then.\nExpanding the number of US dealers from 104 to 125 by the end of the year will help. So will adding the Levante sport utility vehicle, by all accounts an impressive model. Effective marketing could introduce the brand to drivers who otherwise would just buy German. Already, there's anecdotal evidence that the Ghibli is starting to attract younger buyers.\n\"They've got a hell of a lot to build on,\" said Joe Phillippi, president of AutoTrends, a consulting firm in Andover, New Jersey. \"But it's incredibly expensive to play the game. Marchionne can't afford to stumble. With the volume numbers he's trying to generate, he'd better not miss.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T04:07:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
