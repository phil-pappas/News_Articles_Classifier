But could the moves at the top help boost the long-term prospects of a sector that has fallen out of favour with investors in recent years? \n\"Generally across the board I like management restructuring stories and I like management forcing through change,\" Jessica Ground, U.K. equities fund manager at Schroders told CNBC's \" Squawk Box Europe \" on Monday. Billy H.C. Kwok | Bloomberg | Getty Images \nAnthony Jenkins, the chief executive of British bank Barclays, was fired earlier this month and until he is replaced, executive duties will be carried out by John MacFarlane – the chairman who suggested he would speed up the bank's turnaround efforts when he took the post in April. \nRead More Barclays Chairman: Jenkins 'not the right person' \nStandard Chartered, which has a focus on emerging markets, meanwhile said on Sunday that CEO Bill Winters, who took over in June after leaving JPMorgan , will take more direct responsibility for the bank's largest business divisions with a new management structure being phased in from October. \n\"Now that you have MacFarlane who knows what the future will be at Barclays and with Bill Winters at Stan Chartered you have very interesting situations,\" Ground said. \nMeanwhile, Deutsche Bank in May boosted the powers of co-chief executive Anshu Jain in a management shakeup, while in June Tidjane Thiam , the former CEO at U.K. insurer Prudential, started his new role as CEO of Swiss bank Credit Suisse. Underperformer \nExpensive fines, new regulation in the wake of the global financial crisis, low interest rates and a tepid economic recovery have all undermined the European banking sector in recent years. \nIndeed, in a sign of further turbulence Britain's Sunday Times newspaper at the weekend reported that Barclays plans to cut more than 30,000 jobs within two years. \nAlthough management changes will bring more uncertainty near-term, they are a positive development for long-term investors, analysts said. \nNew bosses at the top can change the way the companies are run, Andrew Sheets, chief cross-asset strategist at Morgan Stanley, told CNBC last week. \nRead More Morgan Stanley earnings, revenue top estimates \n\"I think that's a change in investor minds' that is overdue. It's interesting how much the European banking sector has still lagged the performance of U.S. bank ROE (return on equity) and U.S. bank profitability and so I think there's an argument that in some cases change was happening too slowly,\" he said. \n\"So even though uncertainty is never a universal positive, there is a case to say that these changes will drive greater reform and balance sheet clean up that will be positive,\" Sheets added. \nIn fact, Barclays' share price has risen almost 5 percent since the management changes unveiled earlier this month. StanChart shares have risen about 7 percent so far this year – a recovery that analysts attribute to planned job cuts and a decision to shut a struggling equities division. All change \nTalking about the management changes at Standard Chartered, Schroders' Ground said they should help increase accountability, which was a good sign for investors. <p>Is it time to invest in US banks? </p> <p>Patrick Spencer, managing director of U.S. institutional equity sales at Baird, explains why investors are abandoning European bank stocks for their U.S. counterparts. </p> \n\"I think what Bill Winters is trying to do is raise accountability. The other important thing is that he's slimming down the management structure and that helps raise accountability,\" she said. \n\"He has a reputation for being tough and focused and I think the management structuring shows the toughness and focus he is trying to get,\" she added. \nFrom October, the head of StanChart's major business units will report directly to the CEO instead of his deputy, the bank said on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T08:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:59:16.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
