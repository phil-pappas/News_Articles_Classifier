Previously, the CWU demanded a bonus payout of 12%. \nDiscussions between MTN and the CWU are ongoing. \nArrests after colleague 'doused with petrol' \nTo date, the strike has also been marred by allegations of violence and intimidation by CWU members outside MTN's offices in Johannesburg and other areas such as Midrand. \nThe Johannesburg Labour Court has issued an interim order to the CWU demanding that it refrain from violence and intimidation in its MTN strike. \nYet the company alleges violence has still occurred. \n\"Yesterday, two MTN employees who are participating in the industrial action were arrested after they allegedly doused petrol on another service centre staff member in Midrand,\" said MTN. \n\"Charges of intimidation and assault have been laid against the two employees who are also employees of the service centre warehouse. The two employees are appearing before the court today. MTN will also be lodging disciplinary proceedings against the implicated employees,\" the company said. \nFin24 could not reach CWU for comment. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T14:38:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
