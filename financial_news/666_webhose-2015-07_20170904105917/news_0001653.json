Retail point of sale systems are under increasingly sophisticated and relentless remote assault by cyber-criminals, warned the FS-ISAC in an official alert . The target is your credit and debit card data which the criminals know how to turn into instant cash. The other take-away: small businesses in particular may be under intense attack, and you may want to think twice before you plop down plastic at the neighborhood pizza shop or hair salon or an independent hotel. First, understand that FS-ISAC did not put numbers on the scale of the attacks but know that the U.S. Secret Service signed onto that warning, which comes on the heels of dozens of recent, well-publicized data breaches, from Home Depot and Target to Hard Rock Cafe and Trump Hotels . FS-ISAC - a quasi-official body funded by many banks and credit card companies and other organizations - was formed to facilitate anonymous information sharing among companies. The idea is that criminals use the same attack on many companies so if word is spread, defenses can toughen up. What the current FS-ISAC alert specifically warns about is the increased compromise of point of sale systems by criminals at some distance away - perhaps in Eastern Europe, the Middle East or China. Wrote FS-ISAC: “Criminals have successfully exploited databases and payment processing systems with remote access tools. There is a high probability that employees who have remote access to the company’s network will be targeted.” 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T17:52:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
