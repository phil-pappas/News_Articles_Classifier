He also noted that the labour minister has not declared operations at the Skorpion zinc mine to be continuous operations, which would permit the working of continuous shifts, as can be done in terms of the Labour Act. \nNamzinc informed the court that employees who are part of a continuous shift system, which the company has used for the past 14 years, agreed in their employment contracts that they would work daily 12-hour shifts for seven days, followed by seven days off work, with the same kind of cycle then being repeated. \nAccording to the company the system is necessary to ensure that its mine and zinc production plant would be able to operate profitably, and provides more advantages to employees who are part of the continuous shift system than what the Labour Act requires. \nWhile the average Namzin employee works 21,6 days per month, workers who are part of the continuous shift system work an average of only 15,1 days a month, have more free time than other employees, and also receive a monthly continuous operations shift allowance as part of their remuneration package, the company informed the court. \nCorbett argued that because the continuous shift system was more advantageous to employees than what the Labour Act required, it could not be ruled to be contrary to the Labour Act. He relied on a previous Labour Court judgement as support for that argument. \nAkweenda, though, also relied on a previous Labour Court judgement, which he said supported his argument. In that judgement, it was ruled that when there was a conflict between conditions of employment in an employment contract and a statutory prohibition, the statutory prohibition had to prevail. \nCorbett also argued that the MUN was using Namzinc employees' refusal to continue to work daily 12-hour shifts - employees started to work daily nine-hour shifts instead from Monday - was a tactic to put pressure on the company to settle a case in which 340 Namzinc employees are suing Namzinc for N$49 million in overtime payments. \nHe argued that since that case was pending, the employees could not now be allowed to stop working the daily 12-hour shifts that they had agreed to in their employment contracts. \nCorbett further accused the MUN of having reneged on two agreements with Namzinc, dating from 2004 and 2008, to support the company's application to the labour minister to be exempted from the Labour Act's limitation of the number of hours that an employee may work in a week. \nIf Namzinc employees' decision to unilaterally shorten their daily shifts from 12 to nine hours were allowed to continue and to result in a shutdown of the company's sophisticated zinc production plant, the company could suffer losses of up to N$360 million in terms of lost turnover, repairs to the plant, and the cost of restarting the plant, Corbett warned. \nThe Labour Act states that an employer may not require an employee to work more than 45 hours in a week. An employee may also not be required to work more than nine hours a day if the employee works for five days a week, or be required to work more than eight hours a day if the employee works more than five days a week. \nThe act also states that an employer may not require an employee to work more than 10 hours of overtime a week, or more than three hours of overtime a day. However, the labour minister may exempt an employer from complying with those provisions of the law.
