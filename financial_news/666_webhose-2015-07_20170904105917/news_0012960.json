This was due to the steep decline in metal polish sales as the leading brand Sidol by Henkel was withdrawn from the market. However the demand for other types of polish remained largely positive in 2014. Customers are price sensitive and they seek the “best” prices which helped economy and private label brands to gain ground on more expensive commercial brands. Thanks to the widening range of cheaper products and more moderate unit price movement consumers were able to raise or maintain their volume purchases for key polishes. Nonetheless the strong decline in sales of metal polish affected the whole category negatively.\nFull Report Details at\n - \nCompetitive Landscape\nHenkel Magyarország leads polishes in 2014 with a 34% share of retail value sales. Henkel continued to lose share as its Sidol brand was withdrawn from metal polish. The company offers standard and premium brands that are well-known and have been present in Hungary for a long time. It covers all types of polishes except metal polish and advertises brand/products regularly.\nIndustry Prospects\nPolishes is predicted to remain a stable but mature home care category over the forecast period. As the demand for polishes is limited and customers can easily give up these products if their spending power weakens leading producers are not expected to invest in product development. Thus customers will find the same polishes as in the review period. Meanwhile retail volume sales growth is expected as less expensive private label and commercial brands appear. Thus the leading producers will face price competition with emerging private label and cheaper commercial brands and they will have to keep their prices which will benefit customers.\nReport Overview\nDiscover the latest market trends and uncover sources of future market growth for the Polishes industry in Hungary with research from Euromonitor's team of in-country analysts.\nFind hidden opportunities in the most current research data available understand competitive threats with our detailed market analysis and plan your corporate strategy with our expert qualitative analysis and growth projections.\nIf you're in the Polishes industry in Hungary our research will save you time and money while empowering you to make informed profitable decisions.\nThe Polishes in Hungary market research report includes:\n * Analysis of key supply-side and demand trends \n * Historic volumes and values company and brand market shares\n * Five year forecasts of market trends and market growth\n * Robust and transparent market research methodology conducted in-country\nOur market research reports answer questions such as:\n * What is the market size of Polishes in Hungary?\n * What are the major brands in Hungary?\n * What are the future prospects for the polishes market?\n * What are the key new product launches in the polishes market?\nReasons to Get this Report\n * Gain competitive intelligence about market leaders\n * Track key industry trends opportunities and threats\n * Inform your marketing brand strategy and market development sales and supply functions\nReport Table of Contents:\nPOLISHES IN HUNGARY\nEuromonitor International\nJune 2015\nLIST OF CONTENTS AND TABLES\nHeadlines\nTrends\nCompetitive Landscape\nProspects\nCategory Data\nTable 1 Sales of Polishes by Category: Value 2009-2014\nTable 2 Sales of Polishes by Category: % Value Growth 2009-2014\nTable 3 NBO Company Shares of Polishes: % Value 2010-2014\nTable 4 LBN Brand Shares of Polishes: % Value 2011-2014\nTable 5 Forecast Sales of Polishes by Category: Value 2014-2019\nTable 6 Forecast Sales of Polishes by Category: % Value Growth 2014-2019\nHenkel Magyarorszag Kft in Home Care (hungary)\nStrategic Direction\nKey Facts\nSummary 1 Henkel Magyarorszag Kft: Key Facts\nSummary 2 Henkel Magyarorszag Kft: Operational Indicators\nCompany Background\nProduction\nSummary 3 Henkel Magyarorszag Kft: Production Statistics 2013\nCompetitive Positioning\nSummary 4 Henkel Magyarorszag Kft: Competitive Position 2014\nRossmann Magyarorszag Kft in Home Care (hungary)\nStrategic Direction\nKey Facts\nSummary 5 Rossmann Magyarorszag Kft: Key Facts\nSummary 6 Rossmann Magyarorszag Kft: Operational Indicators\nInternet Strategy\nCompany Background\nPrivate Label\nSummary 7 Rossmann Magyarorszag Kft: Private Label Portfolio\nCompetitive Positioning\nSummary 8 Rossmann Magyarorszag Kft: Competitive Position 2014\nExecutive Summary\nImproving Performance of Home Care in 2014\nInnovative Products Attract the Interest of Customers\nMultinationals Dominate Home Care in Hungary\nPrivate Label Continues To Gain Retail Value Share\nSteady Growth Is Expected in the Forecast Period\nKey Trends and Developments\nConvenience and Efficient Innovations Attract Customers\nModern Grocery Retailers Lead Home Care Sales\nPeriodic House Cleaning Boosts Home Care Sales\nMarket Indicators\nTable 7 Households 2009-2014\nMarket Data\nTable 8 Sales of Home Care by Category: Value 2009-2014\nTable 9 Sales of Home Care by Category: % Value Growth 2009-2014\nTable 10 NBO Company Shares of Home Care: % Value 2010-2014\nTable 11 LBN Brand Shares of Home Care: % Value 2011-2014\nTable 12 Penetration of Private Label in Home Care by Category: % Value 2009-2014\nTable 13 Distribution of Home Care by Format: % Value 2009-2014\nTable 14 Distribution of Home Care by Format and Category: % Value 2014\nTable 15 Forecast Sales of Home Care by Category: Value 2014-2019\nTable 16 Forecast Sales of Home Care by Category: % Value Growth 2014-2019\nSources\nSummary 9 Research Sources\nAbout Fast Market Research\nFast Market Research is a leading distributor of market research and business information.
