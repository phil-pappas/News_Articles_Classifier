By Jessica Gorst-Williams | Telegraph – 8 hours ago 6.25 -0.25 \nA reader finds herself being bounced from pillar to post over a faulty fridge freezer from Currys \nTen months ago we purchased a fridge freezer from Currys. We kept the appliance unplugged until renovations on our new kitchen were completed two months ago. Two weeks after that the goods in the freezer defrosted. We called Currys which immediately referred us to the manufacturer whose representative, on a second visit, supposedly fixed the freezer. \nExactly three weeks later I found my oak kitchen flooring flooded and all the items in the freezer defrosted again. I rang Currys but as before it referred me to the manufacturer. I believe that my contract is with Currys and that it has sold me an item which is not fit for purpose. I feel we should have a replacement. Can you facilitate this? LF (KSE: 093050.KS - news ) , Oxfordshire \nWith the fridge freezer spontaneously defrosting you were bounced from pillar to post. You work and your husband is in the Armed Forces and often away. A convenient time for the manufacturer to try and “fix” the problem with the same solution that had previously failed could not be agreed on. Also, because the contract is in the name of your husband, at one stage it was asserted the matter would have to be dealt with via him. \n• 'Currys sent wrong fridge-freezer, then refused refund' \n• 'Camera was faulty but Currys is making me pay' \nI spoke to Currys and it came back stating, “We were sorry to hear about Mrs (LSE: MRS.L - news ) F’s experience. Prior to receiving your correspondence we had already organised a replacement appliance for delivery. We will always look to resolve issues directly but on the occasions where we do refer our customers to suppliers, it is because they are best placed to help them with their queries as detailed in our receipt wallet.” \nThe replacement lacked a drip tray. Currys sent two versions, unsure which would fit. Neither did because the newer model has the tray built in. Currys has also now sent a £50 gesture of goodwill. \n• If you want to contact Jessica, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T23:23:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
