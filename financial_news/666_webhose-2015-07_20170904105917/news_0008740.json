Paul Jeffers/Getty Images by Duncan Hughes Westpac Group is clamping down on lending to overseas property investors wanting to buy residential property in the nation's popular residential markets.\nThe bank, which recently announced a reduction in loan-to-value ratios on investment loans to 80 per cent , has described the move as another measure to limit annual investment lending growth to a maximum of 10 per cent, as mandated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.\nThe bank's broker distribution division is writing to mortgage brokers identified as having a \"higher percentage\" of property lending to people not resident in Australia.\nThe letter does not identify the lending benchmark that triggers the review.\nAustralian address required \"As a result, all future home lending applications that you submit to Westpac must contain a primary application that has an Australian residential address,\" a leaked copy of the letter states.\nThat means the applicant must have an Australian visa and conform to Foreign Investment Review Board criteria. Non-residents need to obtain FIRB approval when buying property â€“ a rule that is now being more actively enforced.\nThe bank could not comment on how many brokers had received the letter.\n Mortgage brokers claim it is targeting the lucrative Chinese market that has been spending billions on residential property, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney.\nThe letter also states the review is a \"timely reminder\" about the bank's review and auditing procedures to ensure brokers conform to their agreement.\nA spokesman for the bank said: \"It's just a reminder to brokers with a higher percentage of non-resident lending that when submitting owner-occupied applications [they] should contain an Australian residential address.\"\nPressure from regulator Banks are rapidly changing their rules for lending to property investors , a response to pressure from the banking regulatory to reduce the amount of investor activity in the property market.\nLast week ANZ Banking Group and Commonwealth Bank of Australia both lifted their lending rates for all landlords. Earlier this month Westpac announced it would require applicants for property investment loans to have a deposit equal to 20 per cent of the property's value, up from five per cent.\nIn addition, mortgage brokers claim competitive investment pricing has stopped.\n\"The rate is now the rate,\" said Chris Foster-Ramsay, managing director of Capital Home Loans, about Westpac no longer negotiating on investment loan rates.\nOther measures aimed at reducing the demand from investors for property loans include reducing interest rate discounts, increasing interest rate \"sensitivity buffers\" and ruling out some types of income such as bonuses, when assessing an applicant's ability to repay a loan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:07:56.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
