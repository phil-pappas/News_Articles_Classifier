The Japanese publicly listed brokerage has announced that its revenues increased 5 percent when compared to the final quarter of the previous fiscal year which ended on March 31st 2015 to ¥12.9 billion ($104 million). \nOn the bottom line net profits increased by almost 7.5 percent for the same period to ¥1.7 billion ($13.9 million). \nLooking at a year ago the growth numbers are much higher due to the stark difference in volatility levels across the variety of markets on which Monex Group is operating. Revenues have spiked higher by 37 percent, while the bottom line increased more than threefold. \nThroughout the quarter the revenues of Monex from its Japanese operations have increased materially due to the booming stock market with average daily trading values increasing by 7 percent quarter-on-quarter on both Japanese stock exchanges. The company has also registered a record number of client assets for a quarter-end totaling ¥3.8 trillion ($30.6 billion). \nThe U.S. segment of the Japanese broker’s business appears to be slowly turning the corner with improvements in net interest income and a change in the custodian bank holding the client funds for TradeStation customers leading to a quarterly growth in operating revenues net of expenses by 4.4 percent to ¥4.1 billion ($33.8 million). That said, the bottom line for the U.S. business remained in the red. \nThe Chinese segment of the business has moved into the black with the sharp increase in activity on the Hong Kong market leading to a 69 percent quarterly increase in commissions from Monex Boom Securities. Total operating revenues net of expenses from the Chinese business were reported at ¥264 million ($2.1 million) with the bottom line from the segment coming in at ¥57 million ($0.5 million) before taxes.
