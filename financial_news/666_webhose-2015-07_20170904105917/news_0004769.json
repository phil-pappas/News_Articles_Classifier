Some expressed their anger on social media, with the Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) hashtag #ThisIsACoup trending. \nGreece's public servants are also to stage a 24-hour strike on Wednesday, the first big stoppage since Tsipras took power. \n- 'There have been mistakes' - \nFaced with a eurozone deeply distrustful of Athens after five months of tense meetings, 40-year-old Tsipras had to agree to demands that critics say rob Greece of financial independence. \nBut while he admitted \"there have been mistakes\", he defended his government's six-month battle with its creditors and refused to blame his flamboyant former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis for complicating matters, saying \"a perfect economist does not mean one is also a politician\". \nIf Greece does pass the agreement, Europe's next step would be to push the deal through several national parliaments, many in countries that are loath to afford Athens more help. \nGermany's Bundestag is likely to vote on Friday, provided the Greek parliament rushes through the four new market-oriented laws by Wednesday. \nEurozone finance ministers A new poll said 55 percent of Germans supported their chancellor, Angela Merkel, on the bailout deal, while a third said they would have preferred a Grexit. \nTsipras said he would defend his government from \"the plans of certain conservative Europeans\" and scoffed at the \"Plan B\" for the country's exit from the zone put forward by Germany's hawkish finance minister, saying \"Europe does not belong to (Wolfgang) Schaeuble\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T01:38:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
