Nemer reiterated his outperform rating, but raised his stock valuation estimate to a range of $495 to $520 from $421 to $450. He said current bottomline expectations are being hurt by abnormal events last year, such as a price cut at Amazon Web Services and a tax increase in Japan, resulting in estimates that don't match historical trends. Therefore, Nemer believes second-quarter adjusted EPS, which is due out on July 23, could beat consensus expectations by more than 10%. The FactSet Q2 EPS consensus is for a loss of 15 cents. \"Additionally, Amazon's 'Prime Day' event [Wednesday] could drive incremental sales in Q3 and another wave of Prime members that join with a 30-day free trial and subsequently convert into paying members ahead of the 2015 holiday season,\" Nemer wrote in a note to clients. The stock has soared 47% year to a record close on Monday , while the S&P 500 has edged up 2%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T16:28:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
