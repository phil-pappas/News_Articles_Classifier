Fluor previously serviced the Comanche Peak plant from 1991 until 2006. The nuclear power plant is located in Somervell County, Texas, in close proximity to Fluor’s regional Power Services office. \n“Fluor is an industry leader providing execution excellence in maintenance and outage services to the power generation market,” said Jim Breland, vice president of Fluor’s power maintenance division. “This significant award solidifies our footprint in the nuclear services industry.” \nComanche Peak is Luminant’s sole nuclear generation asset. The plant operates two units which, combined, produce 2,300-megawatts of power – enough energy to power about 1.15 million homes during normal operations and 460,000 homes during periods of peak demand. \nAbout Fluor Corporation \nFluor Corporation ( FLR ) is a global engineering and construction firm that designs and builds some of the world's most complex projects.
