Photo: Glenn Hunt\nEastern Australia will be well supplied with gas through to early next decade, causing delays to proposed new supply projects of up to five years of more, according to Citigroup.\nCiti's energy analysts are forecasting major delays to many of the 30-plus proposed gas projects in the eastern states, as development is focused on coal seam gas reserves connected with the three large LNG export plants being built in Queensland.\nIt said that AGL Energy, Origin Energy, Santos, Beach Energy and Senex Energy would all likely face multi-year delays for individual projects.\nThe new research found, however, that Beach and Senex would likely be the worst affected by the delays, while Santos and Origin, which are larger players with broader portfolios that include stakes in the LNG projects, would benefit overall.\n\"We see the winners from this outlook being integrated portfolio players (Origin and Santos) who can create value from storage, and arbitrage energy markets from volatility in gas markets likely to exist for many years,\" Citi analyst Dale Koenders said in the 60-page report.\n\"We also expect LNG proponents will benefit from sufficient gas to both ramp up projects quickly and debottleneck, and opportunity to engage in gas market to maximise capital efficiency. We see the losers from this market outlook as those with gas resources unlikely to be developed in scale for some time.\"\nCiti's confidence about the availability of supplies contrasts with some much more negative assessments by analysts including Credit Suisse and EnergyQuest. It assumes a decline in domestic demand in line with the latest forecast from the Australian Energy Market Operator, which said in April that east coast demand excluding LNG would slump 23 per cent in the five years to 2019, from 682 petajoules to 523 petajoules.\nHowever, it has been reflected in AGL Energy's decision announced on Monday to rely on gas purchase contracts for a larger chunk of its requirements than it had aspired to in the past. AGL chief executive Andy Vesey told investors on Monday he expected substantial quantities of gas to be available from a range of players.\nCitigroup said that based only on current reserves and gas production capacity that has already been sanctioned, the market will likely be under-supplied given the demand from the LNG projects starting in 2016. But it said that new coal seam gas capacity at the LNG ventures would be get the green light for development over the medium term, including expansions at Santos's Roma and Scotia fields, and that reserves would continue to grow both in the Cooper Basin and in CSG, providing enough supply for the market until 2024.\n\"Given this outlook, we see risk of delay for gas projects that are higher cost/risk,\" Citi said.\n\"This expectation is in contrast to the M&A activity over the last few years, with CSM acquisitions like Ironbark (Origin), Gloucester (AGL), and Narrabri (Santos) potentially now stranded by reduced outlook for demand.\"\nIn a second report detailing the impact of Citi's new forecasts on the energy stocks, it said it had put back its assumption on the start-up of AGL's Gloucester project to 2020 from 2017, while Origin's Ironbark venture may only begin production in 2025, five years later than it was previously assuming.\nFor Senex, its gas projects may all slide back to start production only in 2025, apart from the Western Surat venture which Citi still sees starting up in 2018. Beach, meanwhile, may only see gas production from its BMG venture in 2025, while its Cooper shale production may also only start mid next decade.\nHowever, despite the ample supplies, customers will not see any relief on prices, the Citi analysts said, still forecasting wholesale prices will rise substantially from historical levels of $3-$4 a gigajoule.\n\"With most of the cheaper gas resources quarantined for LNG projects or legacy domgas contracts, prices of >$5-$8 a gigajoule are required to incentivise development of the next tier of gas resources,\" they said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T21:47:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
