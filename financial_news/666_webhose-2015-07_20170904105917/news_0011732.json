The equity value of the deal is about $1.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nHorizon in March began trying to contact Depomed’s management and board, which “refused to engage in discussions with us and rejected our proposal,” Horizon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Timothy Walbert said in the statement. “The strategic and financial benefits of our proposal are highly compelling,” he said.\nHorizon’s work on specialty treatments and primary care would complement Depomed’s products for pain and central nervous system disorders, Horizon said.\nA deal would add “immediately and substantially” to earnings, Horizon said. Depomed shareholders would own about 25 percent of the combined company if the deal occurs, according to Horizon, which would retire $575 million of senior secured notes with cash and new debt.\nThe combined company would have 13 marketed medicines, nearly doubling Horizon’s current portfolio, it said.\nCitigroup Inc. and Jefferies LLC are serving as lead financial advisers to Horizon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T14:54:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
