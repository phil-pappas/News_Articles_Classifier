Short-selling is now equivalent to 3.6 percent of the company’s shares outstanding, the highest since records began, according to data compiled by Markit.\nDespite cutting prices by hundreds of millions of pounds, the U.K.’s largest grocer has lost more market share than J Sainsbury Plc and Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc since September, when Lewis took the helm. His turnaround strategy , announced in January, hasn’t kept discounters like Aldi and Lidl at bay, and last month the former Unilever executive said it won’t be easy to keep annual profit from falling this year.\n“When Lewis came in, he didn’t seem to be able to do any wrong,” Richard Clarke, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein said by phone. “They’ve now lost the initial trading momentum and he has tried to play down expectations.”\nThe stock market still values Tesco shares at a premium. The company trades at 22 times its estimated earnings over the next 12 months, above the average of 17 times for other large European grocers.\nThe largest Tesco short position is held by AQR Capital Management LLC, and is worth about 104 million pounds, according to regulatory filings. The position is the largest short AQR holds in any European stock. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment.\nU.K. grocers are a favorite target of short sellers, with Morrison and Sainsbury currently the two most-shorted companies in the FTSE 100 index. Tesco is No. 14.\nIn a short sale, an investor borrows stock from a third party, betting that the price will fall, and pocketing the difference if it does when closing the position. If the price increases, the shortseller may have to take a loss on the trade.\nRead this next: \\r Tesco Gets $61 Million as Retailer Settles U.K. MasterCard Suit \\r U.K. Supermarket Woes Continue as Aldi and Lidl Growth Persists \\r", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:59:31.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
