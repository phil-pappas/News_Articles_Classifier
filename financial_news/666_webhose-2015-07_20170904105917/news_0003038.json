The first is satisfying an investor's need for income, and while this should be solved by considering all asset classes, there is little debate that Australian equities and associated franking benefits are likely to be the go-to segment of an income-oriented equity allocation.\nThe second is the role of equities in a portfolio, which is usually to maintain and increase the real value of investment assets. That leads to the question of whether a dividend is worth more to an investor than compared to the cash flow being retained within the company, to adapt the colloquial \"a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\" metaphor.\nAnother issue is the prospect for dividends in global equity returns.\nThe debate on dividend versus capital returns is ongoing. If a company can reinvest its operating cash flow at a high return on capital, investors are clearly well served. It is no accident that the companies at the top of long-term performance tables are typically those with a relatively low dividend payout, even in Australia.\nOn the assumption that most investors are aiming for capital gains from global equities, it therefore makes sense to select managers who emphasise the potential growth of companies rather than the dividend. Yet the two might not be exclusive.\nWith many developed-world short-term interest rates at about zero, one should bear in mind the relative uplift in dividend yield compared with Australia is more or less the same – in round numbers Australia's cash rate of 2 per cent and equity yield of 4.5 per cent is in line with a global cash rate of near zero and dividend yield of 2.5 per cent, accepting that there are differences in the cash rate and yield across global regions.\nNot dissimilar Taking that further, the earnings yield (which is the inverse of the price-earnings ratio) is not dissimilar between Australian equities and global (both are about 6.5 per cent) and therefore it is the payout ratio of earnings that is very different.\nAbout 75 per cent of Australia's corporate earnings are paid out in dividends, versus 40 per cent globally. Further, some global sectors and regions have large cash holdings in the balance sheet, a rare outcome in Australia.\nThere are many Australian and global funds that appeal directly to yield-hungry investors by including \"income\" and/or \"yield\" in their name, or at the very least in their marketing material.\nThis could mean aiming for a high yield, which might result in the inevitable \"value traps\" – companies with apparently decent yield, yet on the cusp of a deterioration in earnings. Similarly, many yield companies are vulnerable to interest rate movements and it is noticeable that, with the probable move by the US Federal Reserve this year, high-yield sectors of that market have lagged.\nOn the other hand there are companies with low yields and the prospect of much better payouts in forthcoming years. Companies that are increasing their dividend often have confidence in their earnings and the consistency of those earnings. It is increasingly common for fund managers to agitate for a rise in payout if there is no other application for cash flow.\nFor Australian investors the portfolio sensitivity to yield can be high – a combination of the large weight in local big-cap dividend-paying companies alongside fixed-income assets. Holdings in global equities are best served by avoiding another version of this theme. Yet the indirect merits of companies with the capacity and willingness to start a dividend cycle as part of the investment thesis does have appeal, by increasing the potential capital value of the stock rather than the payout itself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T04:54:28.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
