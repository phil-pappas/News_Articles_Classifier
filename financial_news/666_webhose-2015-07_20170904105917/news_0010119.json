I will meet the Greek finance minister before the meeting and then we will see.\nIt's up to the Greek government to show how it can agree with its creditors.\nThe pressure is especially on the Greeks, the banks are closed and the situation is difficult. I guess the Greek government has an interest in coming up with serious and credible solutions soon.\nI think over the last week and months the Eurogroup has been very united in its stance and it means we do whatever it takes to strengthen the euro zone, to keep it together. Secondly we cannot have an outcome of this process which damages our credibility.\nEU ECONOMICS COMMISSIONER PIERRE MOSCOVICI\nThe European Commission is not resigned to Grexit. Grexit would be a terrible failure, a collective failure, we don't want it. We remain ready to work on the basis of an agreement but it is up to the Greek authorities to say in the clearest way how they wish to act to avoid the worst scenario, a scenario we don't want.\nDUTCH JUNIOR FINANCE MINISTER ERIC WIEBES\nI hope they will bring along a very serious proposal because only on the basis of the very serious proposal it makes sense to continue talking. I can't imagine that proposal to be any less serious than the one that was on the table (already) (Reporting by Renee Maltezou, Robin Emmott , Francesco Guarascio, Julien Ponthus, Alexander Saeedy, Julia Fioretti and Robert-Jan Bartunek)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T14:16:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
