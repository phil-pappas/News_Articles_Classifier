Their spokesman, Senator Anietie Okon, declared that Akwa Ibom should not been seen as a state where projects with extreme disaster potential are targeted. \n\"After proper examination of the pros and cons of the project, tapping the knowledge of experts on nuclear technology and related disciplines, we had no option than to brace up to oppose to the fullest and say emphatically and without any question that it is not welcome in our state. \n\"Our opposition to the location of the plant in our state is not borne out of ignorance of the benefits of the project, but more because of the peculiar experiences in our country and disastrous consequences that failure of nuclear plants have brought to even more discerning climes,\" he said. \nThe senator recalled the warning by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that Nigeria does not possess the right competences to handle nuclear issues. \nAccording to him, \"Technical impact assessment at the international level also indicated that nuclear plant is not suitable for Nigeria for now; for very obvious reasons. So why the insistence on having it.\" \nNigeria, he said is a country not known for taking environmental impact assessment seriously; quality control is not of the essence, while emergency response has always been a matter for grave concern. \n\"The slightest false-step in the nuclear project would result in monumental disaster. Even with the conventional alternatives, we have excelled in flip-flopping and it would amount to a deliberate invitation to disaster if Nigeria ventures into such an intricate project. \n\"We do not want that disaster here in our state. It is one of the strongest reasons why the opposition to the location of the plant in our state is emphatic and would remain decisive. \n\"In other countries where nuclear power has been used it was basically because they had exhausted all the conventional sources and therefore found the nuclear option the readily available alternative. \n\"Even with the available competences and expertise in those countries, they are today shutting down and reducing investments, in some cases to zero level, in nuclear power. \n\"If countries with known competences, like Germany, Italy, USA, Russia, Japan etc., are shutting down such plants and cutting back on investments in the option, what then gives Nigeria, where perennial incompetence in matters of safety and security has become legendry, the impetus to venture into such a risky project. \n\"With our famed lack of maintenance culture, this gamble would rightly be considered as a clear and deliberate invitation to disaster of monumental proportions,\" Okon insisted. \nWondering what qualifies Akwa Ibom State for such a project, the group urged the promoters of the project to take it to their area or any other part of the country, as the people of Akwa Ibom will do everything to stop \nThe body maintained that Nigeria is endowed with several easily processed and manipulated energy sources which have neither been fully tapped nor exhausted.
