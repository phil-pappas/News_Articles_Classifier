CHINA DAILY Share on twitter by Tony Walker China's markets may have stabilised towards the end of this week under the weight of central government intervention in the form of assistance to investors and margin call lenders, but the spectacle of a market in freefall and a Chinese leadership desperately trying to stem the declines should have been at best disconcerting, and at worst alarming.\nThe Beijing leadership's panicky statist response in which billions of yuan worth of assistance were pumped into the market and further initial public offerings cancelled reflects its extreme sensitivity about risks of civil unrest.\nThe Panglossian​ view of all this is that since investment in the sharemarket accounts for just 20 per cent of household wealth China's market volatility is manageable, especially given the country's $3.5 trillion in foreign exchange reserves.\nThe point is also made the Shanghai composite has been down this month just 30 per cent, after an 80 per cent gain over the past year. This is true.\nHowever, this \"all will be well in the best of all possible worlds view\" overlooks extraordinary challenges facing the Beijing leadership in its efforts to transform the Chinese economy to a demand-fuelled model from an investment-driven one.\nThis is why these market developments assume an importance far beyond what is simply a story about stock investors getting burned in the wild east.\nEncouraging individuals to invest their savings in the sharemarket had become important symbolically to the transformation process in the view of members of the Chinese leadership, notably Premier Li Keqiang who had hailed the wildly exuberant appreciation in stock prices as an indication of the success of such a transformation.\nAt the very least, this endorsement of the irrational exuberance of Chinese investors reflected an imperfect appreciation of the risks involved in an overheated sharemarket.\n An outlet for gambling Throughout their history, the Chinese have been inveterate gamblers, but in China itself outlets for these addictions have been limited by the Communist Party's ban on gambling, hence the appeal to punters of stocks that can be traded electronically – by a peasant farmer from the middle of a paddy field on a hand-held device, or a street vendor with a computer.\nNow the China sharemarket bubble has been pricked, if not burst, the question is what have we learned from the past week or so, and what might implications be for countries such as Australia whose dependence on China is a matter of life and death economically.\nLessons number one is that China's economic reform process was never going to proceed in a linear fashion in the sense that attempts to transform an increasingly complex economy would inevitably hit speed bumps along the way, and risk being thrown off course.\nThe threatened sharemarket meltdown is one of those moments. There will be others including one – we should only mention in whispers – that would constitute a much bigger risk, namely the bursting of a housing bubble.\nInvestments in property dwarf those in the sharemarket. China's debt load, much of it related to property, is estimated to be in the order 250 per cent of gross domestic product.\nThis is in the stratosphere and is – or at least should be – cause for concern.\nAustralia's Treasury mandarins – Treasury's China forecasting has been poor – need to be cognisant of the challenges. In that regard Canberra bureaucrats might review various other moments in China's bumpy transition to a market economy with \"Chinese characteristics\".\nIn the 1990's then Chinese vice-premier in charge of the economy Zhu Rongji brought about a soft landing with measures to restrain out-of-control credit growth, soaring inflation along with controls on a debt-burdened banking system.\nZhu pulled it off, but the size of China's economy then was less than half that of today, and far less complex and much less critical to the global economy.\nWe should pray China's latter-day mandarins know what they are doing in this latest phase because if they don't the commodities-driven Australian economy will be one of the first to suffer.\nThe collapse of the iron ore price would be a forerunner of much, much worse to come. What will almost certainly be the case in this next period is that China's economy will continue to slow.\nWhat we are in for is a bumpy road. We better get used to it – and perhaps give a bit more emphasis to getting our own economic house in order.\nTony Walker is The Australian Financial Review 's International Editor and a former Beijing bureau chief for the Financial Times.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/tonywalker1"], "published": "2015-07-10T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:03:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
