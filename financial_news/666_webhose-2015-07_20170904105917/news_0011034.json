Insight is the ministry's flagship project, aimed at widening the tax base by catching tax evaders using technology. The ministry has floated a tender worth over Rs 150 crore to buy data analytics software and the infrastructure that goes along with it, a person with knowledge of the matter said. The ministry has also attached a non-disclosure agreement to the tender to keep exact details on the project from getting leaked. The project is also expected to rank tax evaders based on the amount of tax that could be recovered, so that the authorities could go after the highest value targets first, the person said. \"The challenges faced in widening the tax base are proposed to be handled under 'Project Insight' which will leverage data analytics, alert management and case analytics capabilities to prepare case profiles and select appropriate intervention,\" Parliament's standing committee on finance said in a report in April. The project will track the Permanent Account Numbers being quoted on financial transactions and tally them with income tax filings. It is expected to automate a number of processes that took a lot of time in the past and therefore speed up resolution of cases pertaining to tax evasion, the official said. Though a tender calling for bids for the project was floated in June, ET could not access it on the government's procurement site. An advertisement states that representatives of bidders can collect it by submitting a letter of authorisation, a non-disclosure agreement and a pre-bid integrity pact. The revenue secretary did not respond to an email seeking comment. The Directorate of Income Tax (Systems) has also put out ads for recruiting staff for the project. \"The project will integrate enterprise data warehouse, data mining, web mining, predictive modelling, data exchange, master data management, centralised processing, compliance management and case analytics capabilities,\" the directorate said in a letter seeking candidates for the project. As per the letter, the project could restrict the interest of potential bidders. \"The interest in the industry on bidding for projects where there is back ended payment is low,\" said Neel Ratan, leader-government and public sector, PwC India.
