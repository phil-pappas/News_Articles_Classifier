PUBLISHED: 16:30, Wed, Jul 1, 2015 | UPDATED: 18:30, Wed, Jul 1, 2015 GETTY The Greek Prime Minister has urged the country to vote No on Sunday \nAlexis Tsipras today made a national address and said \"it's time to open a bright new page in our history\", just four days before Greeks are set to cast a crucial Yes or No to an IMF and EU backed bailout deal. \nThe leader today insisted that the referendum is not tantamount to an in/out vote on the eurozone and that turning down the package gives the government a stronger hand in negotiating a better deal for the country. \nHowever, Euro leaders have already warned that if Greeks vote against the bailout deal, they are in effect voting the country out of the euro . \nYet, the majority of defiant Greeks are set to vote 'No', according to a poll today by the ProRata institute in a Greek newspaper, with 54 per cent planning to vote against the bailout, compared to just 33 per cent in favour. Let us turn the page, upholding #democracy and our conviction for a better agreement. #Greece #dimopsifisma #Greferendum #OXI — Alexis Tsipras (@tsipras_eu) July 1, 2015 We owe it to our parents, our children, ourselves. It is our duty.We owe it to history. #Greece #Greferendum #dimopsifisma #OXI — Alexis Tsipras (@tsipras_eu) July 1, 2015 #??? / NO does not mean breaking w/Europe, but returning to the Europe of values. #??? / NO means: strong pressure. #Greece #dimopsifisma — Alexis Tsipras (@tsipras_eu) July 1, 2015 Come Monday, the Greek government will be at the negotiating table after the #referendum , w/better terms for the Greek people. #dimopsifisma — Alexis Tsipras (@tsipras_eu) July 1, 2015 \nIt comes as Mr Tsipras yesterday made a final attempt to change the terms of the agreement that could save Athens from imminent bankruptcy. \nThe Greek Prime Minister said he would accept creditors' terms for the deal, as long as they made concessions on pension reforms and VAT increases. \nBut his efforts appear to have come too late, as Germany has said that it would not take part in further negotiations until after Sunday's result. \nGerman Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble today said: \"I feel sorry for the Greeks... This government has done nothing since it came into office. \n\"We don't know if the Greek government is going to hold a referendum or not, whether it is for or against it. \n\"You can't in all honesty expect us to talk with them in a situation like this.\" \nEurozone finance ministers are, however, set to discuss the new offer from the Greek government today.
