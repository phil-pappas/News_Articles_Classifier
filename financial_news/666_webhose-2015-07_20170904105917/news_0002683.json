After the European Central Bank, which has kept Greek banks afloat, decided to lift the cap on emergency funding on Thursday, Greece's deputy finance minister said the banks would re-open next week.\n\"The banks are ready to open their branches but we have to wait for the final approval from the Central Bank of Greece. There are some technical issues that remain to be resolved, we also have to wait for the government's approval,\" a senior official at the Greek Banking Association told Reuters.\nAn official at the central bank told Reuters it was working with the government to open as soon as possible.
