Greece's Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis blamed trade unions, tweeting this: \n@tjibbe_hoekstra Not in my name. The said banner was the initiative of trades unionists - who did not seek the Ministry's permission. â€” Yanis Varoufakis (@yanisvaroufakis) July 1, 2015 The Unions may have been spurred to hang the banner following the release of Tsipras' latest letter to Greece's creditors , dated June 30, which leaked earlier today. The letter show Tsipras caving in to most of the Eurogroup's demands and the banner went up in the hours inbetween the leak and Tsipras' public address in which he backed a \"No\" vote .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T19:16:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
