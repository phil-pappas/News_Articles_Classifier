Interesting. So many people calling to say they are cutting up their @Macys credit card. Thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2015 Trump probably overstated the drop, however: The stock dropped around $0.14 per share, or roughly 0.1%. And the whole stock market is down by around 0.1%. The Republican businessman has repeatedly criticized Macy's after it announced Wednesday that it was dropping its Trump-branded products because of \"disparaging characterizations\" he made about Mexican immigrants during his campaign launch. Among other things, Trump accused Mexico of sending its \"rapists\" and drug dealers to the US. Here are some of Trump's other tweets gong after the department store chain: \nWhy doesn’t somebody study the horrible charges brought against @Macys for racial profiling? Terrible hypocrites! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2015 \nWho is @Macys to pretend innocence when they “racial profile” all over the place? Paid big fine! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 1, 2015 \nInteresting that @Macys criticized me but just paid $650,000 in fines for racial profiling. Are they racists?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T18:43:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
