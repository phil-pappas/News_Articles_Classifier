GDB President Melba Acosta said that local banks were \"larger holders\" of the notes but did not give details of the holdings.\n\"There have been discussions with banks in Puerto Rico, which are larger holders of these notes. It is a process that begins with this notification,\" Acosta said.\nThe GDB said the purchases are expected to be at \"prices or values that are materially less than par.\"\nPuerto Rico's Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said at the end of June that the U.S. Commonwealth's debt are unsustainable and that he would seek a broad restructuring with creditors. Puerto Rican finance official, including Acosta, will meet bondholders in New York on Monday.
