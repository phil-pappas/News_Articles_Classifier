Cobram Estate has been judged the world's best extra virgin olive oil producer for three years straight and last month posted a record harvest.\nBut the company's chief executive, Rob McGavin has a bitter taste in his mouth. Despite Cobram's success, it is handicapped from accessing the world's biggest olive oil market, Europe.\nOlive oil is the most adulterated food product globally.\nRob McGavin Trade restrictions, high import tariffs and a protective European industry have made exporting Australian product to traditional olive oil-producing countries prohibitive.\nOnly 25 per cent of the world’s production is extra virgin. Photo: Luis Enrique Ascui\nThe barriers remain despite industry experts warning of a global shortfall after poor harvests from the world's top producers, Italy and Spain.\nAdvertisement In the past year, Italian extra virgin olive oil prices have surged 44.1 per cent to €4133.25 ($6071.19) a metric tonne, while southern Spain prices have soared 62 per cent to €3298.25.\nAs the price surges, Mr McGavin said consumers risk being duped.\n\"Olive oil is the most adulterated food product globally, hence there is a lot of cheating that happens, by the Europeans particularly, but they're not the only ones by any stretch,\" he said.\n\"If the price of the oil goes too high they just blend something else in it. For example only 25 per cent of the world's production is extra virgin, but about 65 per cent of the world's sales are extra virgin.\n\"Therein lies the problem.\"\nDemand for extra virgin olive oil – which is made from crushing the olives and extracting the juice, as opposed to using solvents – has doubled in the past 17 years to account for 60 per cent of the Australian market.\nIts popularity is attributed to increased knowledge about its health benefits. US research Mary Flynn, of Brown University at Rhode Island, has found extra virgin olive oil can help prevent and treat chronic conditions such as arthritis, heart disease and type 2 diabetes, as well as some forms of cancer.\n\"That's a pretty powerful statement. And people are getting onto it,\" Mr McGavin said.\nBut he said the lack of an Australian olive oil standard allowed rogue overseas suppliers to take advantage of the increased demand.\nThe Australian Olive Association, which represents about 750 growers, was more blunt. \"Consumers are being conned,\" the association said, citing a report from a European Parliament committee that found olive oil was the No. 1 product at risk of food fraud.\n\"Unfortunately it is easy to substitute lower-grade olive oils or other vegetable oils into retail extra virgin olive oils and this is the basis of the documented high rate of fraud,\" the association said.\nMr McGavin said he is not against imported olive oil, saying there will be always a market for it. Australians will consume about 45 million litres of olive oil a year, while national production this year is expected to be less than half that, at around 18 million litres.\n\"We don't want any subsidies or favours,\" said Mr McGavin.\n\"We want people to sell a product and call it what it is. If it's refined olive oil, call it that. If it's extra virgin, make sure it is ... And try to get us access to where 70 per cent of the world's olive oil is consumed, which is Europe.\"\nGovernments on both sides of politics have promised to help secure Australia's olive oil industry better access to international markets, Mr McGavin said.\nDespite the commitments, olive oil was left off the Australian/China free trade agreement, which the Abbott government signed this year. This means Australian olive oil exporters still pay a 10 per cent tariff to send product to China.\nStill, this is considerably less than Europe's 100 per cent tariff, Mr McGavin said.\n\"That includes the UK. It's a real shame, knowing how well the wine industry has gone in the UK. To double the price before we even start … it really makes you mad, considering they send us whatever they want and call it whatever they want. Consumers are the losers in the end.\"\nDespite the challenges, Mr McGavin is optimistic about the future of the industry. Cobram, which produced a record harvest of 13.8 million litres this year, exports about 40 per cent of its product to China, Japan and the US, which are fast-growing markets.\nMeanwhile the company's annual sales have soared to $60 million from $2 million in 2001. The New York International Olive Oil Competition also judged Cobram as the world's best olive oil producer in 2015 for the third year straight.\n\"We have got a unique advantage where 95 per cent of our production is extra virgin and that's what the world is after,\" Mr McGavin said.\n\"It's also in the top 1 per cent by quality because of the way we grow it, principally. That gives us a fair advantage too.\"\nVeteran agribusiness adviser David Williams, of Kidder Williams, said while it was a \"fabulous product\", more work was need in marketing extra virgin olive oil's health benefits, which he believed if done successfully could sway European customers.\nThis includes proving the integrity of source, the type of oil, and linking that with the scientific health studies, he said.\n\"If you link those three things together, you will get a brand that you can sell into Europe,\" Mr Williams said.\n\"Forget about the trade restrictions, people will pay for it. You would be able to sell it at a premium.\"\nFollow us on Twitter @BusinessDay", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/businessday"], "published": "2015-07-17T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:35:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
