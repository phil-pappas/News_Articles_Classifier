Erin Jonasson by Marianna Papadakis More companies are taking cyber insurance because of the increasing threat hackers pose to their businesses.\nAustralian Cyber Security Centre co-ordinator Major General Stephen Day said Australia's networks and systems were experiencing increasingly sophisticated attacks in the public and private sectors.\nThe cyber threat came from a range of sources including individuals, issue-motivated groups, organised criminal syndicates and the intelligence services of some foreign governments, Major General Day said.\n\"There are gaps in our understanding of the extent and nature of malicious activity, particularly against the business sector.\"\nThe ACSC was reaching out to industry to build partnerships to improve their collective understanding, he said.\nIn 2014 about 11,000 incidents were reported to CERT Australia, the national response team for cyber security issues affecting businesses.\nThe more serious incidents, representing about 1 per cent, included targeted spear phishing, cryptolocker, ransomware and denial-of-service attacks, which could result in the loss of critical data, intellectual property and consumer confidence, as well as profit, Major General Day said.\nGrowing rapidly K&L Gates partner financial services Jim Bulling said the cyber insurance market was growing rapidly in Australia and more companies, including in financial services, utilities and telecommunications companies, as well as law firms and accountants, were taking policies to try to protect themselves from attacks.\n\"Any company with a large customer base or plays a significant role in infrastructure,\" he said.\nMr Bulling warned that such insurance was costly but companies must be prepared to negotiate over their cover.\n\"Don't try to bolt it on to existing professional indemnity, directors and officers and third-party policies. The definitions, exclusions and what's covered just doesn't work,\" he said.\n\"The insurers are keen to get into this new space. They will negotiate.\"\nHe also warned companies that if they gave insurers a risk profile they had to be rolling out the compliance measures they said were in place and that meant ensuring security practices, encryption, back-up and patching protocols were actually acted on, not just included in policies.\nCyber-insurance typically covers network interruption costs, crisis management, remediation and forensic investigation, restoration of data and third-party claims for the unauthorised publication of data.\nCyber attacks The market is well developed in the United States, where companies have been shaken by cyber attacks, including one on Target in 2013 that used malware to steal credit card details, resulting in mass board dismissals and a raft of class actions.\nMore recently, Sony blamed North Korea for a massive computer hack in November 2014 that involved stealing unreleased films and emails and has heightened tension between the two countries.\nThe Australian Cybercrime Crime Commission said in April cybercrime was costing Australia at least $1 billion a year, with malware posing the biggest threat.\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission recommended in its Cyber Resilience report in March that companies use the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework to assess and mitigate risks.\nThe report made clear the issue was not just one for IT security managers but was of sufficient importance to be elevated to board level.\nDirectors should be \"actively engaged\" in cyber risk management and take cyber risks into account when undertaking their duties, it said.\nHWL Ebsworth partner Andrew Miers agreed cyber insurance should be seen as going hand in hand with solid cyber risk management but said the take-up rate was still relatively low in Australia.\nAs the cyber insurance market grew and matured, it should encourage greater risk-management practices, he said.\n\"It's a bit like the way that the growth of property insurance saw an improvement in managing fire risk exposures in buildings. Back then it was bricks and mortar, now it's risks in the online world.\nGame changer \"Some think the proposed introduction of mandatory data breach notification laws by the federal government could be a game changer, much as it was in the United States, where similar laws have fuelled the cyber insurance market there for the best part of a decade.\n\"Breach notification laws create greater compliance costs, which companies may seek to insure, but also generate more information about data breaches and cyber risks, and hence a greater pool of actuarial data to enable a cyber insurance market to mature.\"\nSusan Elias, national manager cyber at cyber insurance broker Marsh, said she had seen a marked increase in the number of companies inquiring about it, but also warned it was no substitute for having a good risk-management strategy in place.\nMarsh provides companies advice on risk management and insurance transferral.\nMs Elias agreed there was little uniformity in policies offered by big insurers that covered everything a company might want and said negotiating a policy could absorb time and costs.\nFor example, some policies covered cyber terrorism incidents while others did not or were silent on it, she said.\n\"Insurers are already revising policy wordings that create ongoing pitfalls, so you always need to be reassessing what insurers are offering so the company buying it understands what they are buying.\"\nIrrespective of how much defensive measures companies put in place, no one could claim to be 100 per cent protected, she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T13:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T23:04:35.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
