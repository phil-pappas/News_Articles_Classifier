Fixing the gash and sending it back could take weeks. \nEnvironmentalists have criticised Shell's drilling plans in the Arctic \nShell spokeswoman Kelly op de Weegh said the Fennica's \"stay in Portland will be determined by the time it takes to make a safe, permanent repair\". \nIt is likely the icebreaker will return to the Chukchi before the preliminary drilling reaches the oil zone, expected sometime in August. \n\"Once we have determined the area is clear of sea ice, support vessels are in place, and the Polar Pioneer (rig) is safely anchored over the well site, drilling will begin,\" Ms op de Weegh said. \nShell has spent about $7bn on Arctic exploration but has produced no oil nor gas. If it finds the region to be rich in economically recoverable oil, production would not begin for at least a decade. \nEnvironmentalists have criticised Shell's drilling plans in the Arctic, which is home to whales, walrus and polar bears .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T02:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T04:27:04.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
