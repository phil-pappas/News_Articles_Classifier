The principal concern for miners and investors is whether it’ll stay there.\n“We don’t think the rally is going to run too far,” Xiao Fu, head of commodity strategy at Bank of China International in London, said after data showed prices gained more than 20 percent from a low on July 8. There could be some stabilization, with iron ore trading between current levels and $60, Fu said.\nThe commodity’s been on a roller-coaster ride in 2015, sinking to a six-year low in April on rising low-cost supply and stalling demand growth, before rebounding into a bull market the same month. That advance proved to be fleeting, with a new low seen at the start of July. Supplies are still plentiful and fundamentally it could remain soft, according to Fu.\n“Iron ore was oversold and now you have prices bouncing back,” said Fu, who correctly warned in mid-May that gains seen that month wouldn’t endure. “For the second half, we’re still a bit cautious for base metals and bulks in general.”\nOre with 62 percent content delivered to Qingdao rose 4.6 percent to $55.89 a dry metric ton on Wednesday, according to Metal Bulletin Ltd. While the gain of more than 20 percent from the July low met the common definition of a bull market, prices remain 22 percent lower this year.\nMiners gained in Sydney on Thursday as Rio Tinto Group rose as much as 2.9 percent to A$53.29 and traded at A$53.20 at 11:15 a.m. BHP Billiton Ltd. is 4.5 percent higher this week, while Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. added 14 percent since last Friday’s close. The three are the country’s top shippers.\nCommodity Losses Iron ore’s latest rally stands out amid losses in raw materials tracked by the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which fell 11 percent this year. Oil in New York entered a bear market last week, while copper in London fell to a six-year low on Monday.\nIron ore’s advances in July may have been spurred by mills stepping up buying just as cargoes from overseas missed expectations. The rise was supported by the speculation steelmakers were purchasing ore from ports, against the seasonal trend, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. said in a report on Thursday.\nExports from Australia were disappointing this month as maintenance at some terminals may have affected the pace of shipments, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report on Monday. The bank has forecast lower quarterly prices into 2016.\n“The rebound will be short-term and lower prices are expected, we still have an oversupply market,” Kelly Teoh, an iron ore derivatives broker at Clarkson Plc in Singapore, said on Wednesday before the price data. “It seemed there’s still some tightness in the physical spot cargoes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T07:11:48.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
