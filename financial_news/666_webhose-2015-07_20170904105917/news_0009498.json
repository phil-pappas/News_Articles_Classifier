Maybe Ten can apply this to its CEO suite, which has had five occupants in the past five years; perhaps it's time for a woman, watch this space, at this rate we shouldn't have to wait long.\nPay gap At least Anderson could sympathise with his female colleagues on the \"pay gap\" issue.\nHe has started as the new Ten boss on a $1.25 million base pay packet, which means he is well short of 'pay parity\" with his rock-star predecessor. McLennan was on a base salary closer to the $2 million mark.\nWe are sure McLennan was able to explain the reason for this particular \"pay gap\" given he would have been on the other side of the negotiating table as executive chairman.\nGod almighty The age of the God CEO might be over, but it does not mean a demigod like Wesfarmers boss Richard Goyder couldn't attract a decent crowd to his John Monash Oration on the above subject on Tuesday night.\nThe topic obviously did not apply to the John Monash Foundation's patron-in-chief, our GeeGee Sir Peter Cosgrove , who was busy elsewhere.\nCommonwealth Bank boss Ian Narev might have had a bit more sympathy for the argument that \"the age when chief executive officers were regarded as all-powerful, God-like figures is well and truly over\".\nBut as your columnist's deadline approached, Narev was only a tentative \"yes\" to attend the oration despite the fact it was being held at the bank's Sydney HQ, and was being hosted by one of his direct reports, Kelly Bayer Rosmarin .\nFairfax's departing chairman, Roger Corbett , was due to attend â€“ obviously to tell Goyder how much better it was in his day as a deity when Woolies was lording it all over Wesfarmers' grocery shop, Coles.\nFormer Telstra boss David Thodey was also on the guest list, along with style maven and former SBS chair Carla Zampatti .\nFriendly faces in the audience for Goyder included Wesfarmers board member Diane Smith-Gander , who champions the rights of women in the executive suite when she isn't chairing Transfield Services.\nThe group is copping a drubbing from a Senate inquiry at the moment over its running of the detention facilities at Manus Island and Nauru. According to recent testimony, female asylum seekers were denied easy access to sanitary pads for \"security reasons\".\nMonash man Former deputy PM Tim Fischer was always going to be a reliable fixture at the Monash oration.\nHe recently emerged as Monash's latest champion with his publishing debut: Maestro John Monash: Australia's Greatest Citizen General .\nFisher sought to right some of the wrongs meted out against a man he regards as one of our nation's greats.\nDespite his heroic role during World War I, Monash fell out of favour with various parties, according to Fisher.\nThis includes Australia's war correspondent C.E.W. Bean and the influential reporter Keith Murdoch .\nKeith's subsequent fame as a press baron has been outshone by his son, Rupert Murdoch .\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T06:57:16.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
