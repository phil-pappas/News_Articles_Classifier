The selectors insisted that the player was not dropped, but they admitted that the move was an attempt to \"send a message to the player to mend his ways\".\nGurbaj was accused of \"indiscipline and showing disrespect\" to the Indian coach by the special committee of Hockey India which had met in the Capital last week to discuss India's performance in the WHL Semi-Final as well as the performance of coach Paul van Ass.\n\"He has not been dropped but given a break. We wanted to send a message to him that such behaviour would not be tolerated. He's a fine player and a strong contender for a berth in the national squad for the Rio Olympics. The report we got from coaches about his behaviour in Belgium prompted us to take corrective measures,\" a selector told TOI. \"We will meet him before the next event and also counsel him.\"\nGurbaj has played over 200 matches for India so far. \"With the Olympics just one year to go, we don't want to spoil the team's spirit. Everyone knows how important the Games are. So we had to take some measures.\"\nOn the European tour, India will play five matches -two against France and three against Spain. They will play their first match on August 3 against France in Le Touquet. The team is currently undergoing training in Shilaroo, Himachal Pradesh.\nHockey India said in a statement the tour will help the team prepare for the FIH Hockey World League Final, which will be held in India later this year.\n\"It's a very important series for us as this will be a base for us to understand how we perform and deliver as a unit and the grey areas to be improved before the FIH World League Finals,\" chief coach Roelant Oltmans said.\n\"Our next step is the Rio Olympics 2016. Hence from here all tournaments are very important for us, as we have to keep working and growing as a team. We are not taking the upcoming series lightly as both teams are very competitive and playing against them will help us tackle the European style of hockey much better,\" Oltmans said in the statement released by HI.\nFollow TOI Sports on Twitter >>> @TOISportsNews http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Roelant Oltmans,Paul van Ass,Hockey India,Gurbaj Singh,European Tour Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://twitter.com/TOISportsNews"], "published": "2015-07-28T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:45:26.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
