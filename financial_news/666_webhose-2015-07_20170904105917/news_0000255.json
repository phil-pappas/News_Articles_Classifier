So that can be tabled until the market is stronger.\" \nThe go/no-go decision tomorrow morning would depend on the tone in the broader markets, with buyside and sellside alike watching the Greek debt standoff and China's stock market rout. \nSyndicate bankers say that, despite those woes, investor appetite for quality paper remains strong. \nCharter's merger with TWC will combine the fourth and second-largest cable players in the US. \nThe cable M&A deal would be the largest of its kind since records began in 1980, and the sixth-largest US M&A deal on record, according to Thomson Reuters data, valuing TWC at US$78.7bn including debt and US$56bn without. \nCharter initially said it had lined up commitments from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS - news ) , Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) and UBS when it announced details of the planned acquisition in May. \nIFR later reported that Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) had also joined the line up of banks arranging the financing.
