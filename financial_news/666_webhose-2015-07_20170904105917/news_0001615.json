One of the great trends of modern business has been outsourcing. Less discussed has been the tendency of successive governments to outsource the business of governing. Nowhere is this more visible than in the planning process. With this in mind, three cheers for the brave members of the North York Moors National Park Planning Authority who voted 8-7 in favour of the decision to allow mining group Sirius Minerals to develop a facility to mine potash under the moors. The question is, should they have ever been landed with a decision of such national importance, with the Government almost nowhere to be seen? Their CVs, on the authority website, don’t tell us how long they have been on the committee and so one can only wonder whether, when they signed up, they realised they would be deciding on a highly technical $2.5bn (£1.6bn) project with a mine life of over 50 years, rather than extensions to the car parking at Castle Howard. A number of our funds have been holding Sirius Mining since 2011. We, along with others, subscribed to the many rounds of funding since the project started. Certainly we can’t be accused of short-termism. The project is unlikely to show an operating profit until 2019 and the £130m raised to date is but a fraction of what will be needed. The potential benefits are substantial. The polyhalite Sirius will mine produces the raw material for high-grade natural fertiliser in a world facing an increasing shortage of arable land. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN estimates that between 1970 and 2050 the amount of arable land per head of the world’s population will have decreased 60pc, reflecting population growth. Tests prove that, across a wide range of crops including tea in China, polyhalite can increase yields by 10pc to 20pc. Potash (potassium carbonate) has been used for thousands of years for making glass and soap and for bleaching textiles The economic prize is also big. At peak, the mine looks set to produce £1bn of annual revenues. As most will be exported, this would reduce Britain’s persistent trade deficit by 4pc. Tax receipts from the project are forecast to be £230m per year. Thousands of jobs will be created in an area that needs them. The project was always going to be controversial, a mine in an area of great natural beauty. In one way the impact is quantifiable. It will be visible from 440 acres of the park. The nice lady in the park’s information office told me the size of the park: 554 square miles. With 610 acres to a square mile, that makes a total of 337,940 acres. The mine is invisible from 99.9pc of the park. Stating the obvious, deep-level mining happens far underground, and so is out of sight. From the start the company has designed the small part of the mine that is above ground to have the lowest possible impact. Those who doubt this should look at the final plans in the company’s 2014 accounts. In the 2011 annual report, the CEO, Chris Fraser, made, in my view, a tactical blunder. He wrote that his aim was to “return significant shareholder value as quickly as possible”. This was understandable, as he had commendably put the whole of his net worth into the project, but there is nothing that acts as more of a red rag to the planning bull than the merest hint that they are not in charge of the timescale. Sirius has been obliged to trudge through the valley of despond that is British planning for four-and-a-half long years. They were fortunate to have very patient shareholders who believed in the project, which could easily have expired through lack of funds. Eventually the committee decided to support the application, but after doing what any planning committee would do in such high profile circumstances: demanding extreme mitigation measures. Most notably they insisted that the mined product be taken underground the whole 23 miles to Teesside, at a cost of an extra quarter of a billion dollars. • 10 facts about potash The Secretary of State is almost nowhere to be seen in this. True, his colleagues at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs appoint nine of the 20 committee members, but their details suggest that, as with the other members, living in and having a love of the park is the main requirement to serve. The minister can intervene at the final appeal stage, but it would be a brave one, “bold and imaginative” in the words of Sir Humphrey, to overrule a local decision. The committee may have hoped for such intervention, but there is a long and expensive process that needs to run its course before the minister can appear. Share performance of Sirius Minerals in the to the beginning ot July (Source: Bloomberg) David Cameron once asked Simon Wolfson, the CEO of Next, why Britain didn’t have its own Silicon Valley, and was told that it would “probably never get planning permission”. Planning will be a big deal for this Government, with the Heathrow expansion, fracking and HS2. The notion of “local decisions made by local people” leads one to wonder whether members of Hounslow’s planning committee will be the ones deciding the future of Heathrow. The construction industry abounds with tales of huge projects handled by grossly under-staffed and under-budgeted local planning departments. Decisions made only in Whitehall aren’t the answer, but governments need to take the lead, working closely with local authorities and interested local bodies. We don’t seem as if we are anywhere near the right balance between local and central government when making these critically important decisions. There is far too much at stake for these not to reside much earlier in the process with the elected government of the day. They should be the ones who take the heat, not local councillors. It is time for them to bring the business of government back in-house. - Ian McVeigh is head of governance at Jupiter Asset Management", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T06:04:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
