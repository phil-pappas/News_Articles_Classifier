Source: News Corp Australia\nOn top of being the first significant find of multiple cretaceous-period fossils in one place in Victoria, Dinosaur Cove is also one of the most diverse troves unearthed, including bones from pterodactyls, plesiosaurs, crocodiles and a number of previously unknown species of polar dinosaur, including the leaellynasaura named after Dr Rich’s daughter.\nThe original storage shed, as well as parts from a flying fox used to transport supplies down the nearby cliff face to the site of the dig, are still at the property.\nTHE DINOSAURS BEHIND JURASSIC WORLD\nDr Rich said that anyone considering creating an attraction at the site would need to invest millions.\n“If you are going to do something like this you are going to need to do it right, not just spend $1 million for the land, but a couple of million to get it going,” Dr Rich said.\n“You are also going to need to get an endowment to keep it going and if you don’t do that, it’s going to go extinct.”\nCharles Stewart and Co sales agent Margaret Brown said the property was likely to sell to someone with a tourist development in mind.\nNEW DINOSAUR FOUND IN UNI STOREROOM\n“It’s one of the last properties where you have that view along the coast and the ability to build,” Ms Brown said.\n“I think it’s going to be someone who has the money and will develop it to do some kind of tourism.”\nShe added Apollo Bay was nearby, and the Castle Cove surf beach a 10 minute walk, with many of the regions most picturesque national parks and waterfalls also nearby.\nA fossil exhibition titled Wildlife of Gondwana arranged by Mr Rich’s partner, Pat Rich, opens at the National Wool Museum in Geelong from July 27.
