Bloomberg by John McDuling Ever since Greece imposed capital controls on its citizens, the value of bitcoin, in US dollar terms, has been rising. And it's up again today in Asian trading, by more than 5 per cent.\nLet's not get too carried away here. The virtual currency was an absolutely terrible investment in 2014, when a prominent bitcoin exchange collapsed and concerns about its use by criminals lingered. It remains highly volatile and has fallen by more than 15 per cent against the greenback this year.\nYet the recent uptick, coupled with exploding transaction volumes (see chart below) are two pieces of good news for its supporters, which now include Australian banks such as Westpac. The big bank, through its venture capital arm, recently took a stake in Coinbase , one of the world's most promiment bitcoin companies.\nAs The Financial Review 's Karen Maley pointed out last week , the price of gold has barely budged since the beginning of June, during which bitcoin's value has increased.\nBitcoin is a decentralised payment network, not controlled by any central bank or national authority, allowing people to transact with each other over the internet directly, without the need for any intermediary, such as a bank. It's effectively a giant ledger of transactions. A good explainer for how it works is here .\nWhether bitcoin's recent rise is due to nervous Greeks, fearful of losing their savings, actually buying it, or (more probably), the result of speculation, is a matter of conjecture . Either way, it's clear bitcoin is having a bit of a moment right now. Rising volumes and a comparative lack of volatility at a time of great macroeconomic uncertainty can only bolster its credentials, though its way too early to describe it as a safe-haven yet .\n Price of Bitcoin by end of week? I'll go first, I say $350. @billmiller_lmm\nâ€” Bill Gurley (@bgurley) July 6, 2015", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/14/us-bitcoin-criminals-insight-idUSBREA2D09820140314", "https://twitter.com/billmiller_lmm", "http://fortune.com/2015/06/29/bitcoin-price-hike-greece-grexit/", "https://twitter.com/bgurley/status/617848123390427137", "http://qz.com/312598/bitcoin-is-the-worst-investment-of-2014/", "http://www.wired.com/2014/03/bitcoin-exchange/"], "published": "2015-07-06T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T12:09:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
