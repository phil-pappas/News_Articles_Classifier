Economists had expected an overall loss of 10,000 jobs. \nIn the 12 months to June, employment increased 1.0 percent with 176,000 jobs, Statistics Canada said. \nFor men aged 55 and older, employment increased by 24,000. The unemployment rate in the group fell 0.3 percent to 6.1 percent. \nIn the 12 months to June, employment for this group rose by 63,000, up 3.2 percent, mostly a result of the population aging. \nThe number of public sector employees increased by 42,000 in June, Statistics Canada said. \nOn a regional basis, Quebec provinces took the biggest hit, shedding 33,000 jobs, all in part-time work. Employment in British Columbia was on the rise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T21:24:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
