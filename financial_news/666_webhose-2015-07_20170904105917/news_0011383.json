His cautious tone on deflation comes as the Bank of Japan’s efforts to stoke faster price gains run into headwinds in the form of weak consumer sentiment and low oil prices. The most recent reading of the BOJ’s preferred inflation gauge was 0.1 percent.\nThe minister also said that China’s economic slowdown poses a bigger risk to Japan than any financial turmoil flowing from the crisis in Greece.\nAmari, who is spearheading the government’s efforts to raise growth and reinvigorate the economy, reiterated that the weak yen has both positive and negative effects for Japan’s economy. He added that it was hard to say at what level the pros and cons would be unbalanced.\n“It’s important that foreign exchange rates reflect economic fundamentals and stay stable, without abrupt moves,” Amari said.\nCurrency Moves The currency traded at 123.08 against the dollar at 8:50 a.m. in Tokyo on Friday, after reaching 125.86 on June 5, the weakest level in 13 years. The yen has dropped more than 30 percent since Abe came to power in December 2012.\nBank of Japan board member Yutaka Harada said last month that inflation might not accelerate quickly enough to reach the BOJ’s 2 percent goal within the latest projected time frame of April to September of 2016.\nAmari declined to comment on whether the BOJ would need to increase monetary stimulus further to meet the price goal, while saying he expected the central bank would take a careful approach to reaching its 2 percent inflation target.\nThe most recent data for industrial production shows this key indicator of economic strength dropping, while export growth has slowed. JPMorgan Chase & Co. economists have predicted the economy will slow to a standstill this quarter while their counterparts at BNP SA says a contraction is possible.\nAmari said that while Japan’s economy is headed for recovery, there is some seesawing, and we may see that this quarter after strength in the three months through March.\nJapan’s economy expanded an annualized 3.9 percent in the first quarter from the previous three months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T09:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T06:47:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
