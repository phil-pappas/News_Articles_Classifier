It commissioned its first methods of payment survey in 2009 and repeated it in 2013.\nAccording to the study, cash accounts for about 44 per cent of the volume and 23 per cent of the value of payments, a decrease in 10 per cent in volume from the time of the Bank's previous report in 2009. Debit card use decreased in both volume and value in contrast to credit cards which made significant inroads with an increase of 11 per cent in volume, in large part because of a tripling of contactless credit card purchases.\nThe use of cash tends to vary across demographic groups based on region, age, income and education. The volume of cash decreased across all regions as well as income and education groups while the volume of credit card use increased.\nCash is used mostly for travel/parking, entertainment/meals and other types of goods and services such as financial services, charities and in speciality shops. Consumers choose cash over credit and debit cards because it is easy to use and for cost and securities reasons. Cash is held for situations when cards are not accepted and still is used primarily for small-value transactions, but even its share of these transactions is going down.\n\"The decrease in the volume share of cash use is not surprising in light of the introduction of payment innovations such as contactless payment cards and some stored-value cards which were designed to mimic the desirable properties of cash - i.e. they are easy to use and are fast,\" the report says.\nCanadians also increasingly are buying online. A study of online purchases by Ipsos Reid for the Retail Council of Canada has found that 82 per cent of Canadians have made an online purchase in the last year. The average cost of purchases was $954 with the most common being for beauty products followed by furniture and housewares, pet products and groceries.\nAlthough online purchases through a mobile device still are quite low - 20 per cent of Canadians made an online purchase using a smart phone in the last year - 90 per cent of Canadians use a desktop or laptop computer to buy online.\nThe Bank of Canada report found that payment by mobile devices such as cell phones and tablets still is quite low at seven per cent with the highest use among the 18 to 34 year old demographic and concludes that \"advances in technology and new business models may result in more payment innovations that could further affect the use of cash in Canada.\"\nThe reports speak for themselves.\nTalbot Boggs is a Toronto-based business communications professional who has worked with national news organizations, magazines and corporations in the finance, retail, manufacturing and other industrial sectors.\nCopyright 2015 Talbot Boggs\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T01:43:16.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
