The share have gained 16 percent this year, compared with the 0.6 percent decline of the 30-company Dow.\nOn Thursday, Visa reported fiscal third-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates and revised its full-year forecast for earnings-per-share growth. The Foster City, California-based company also provided an update on its expectations to complete discussions over a potential deal to acquire its European counterpart by October.\n“There is compelling logic for both Visa Inc. and Visa Europe to consummate a business combination and therefore regularly engages in such discussions,” the U.S. firm said in a statement, adding there’s no assurance a deal will happen.\nVisa and its European counterpart split in 2007 before the U.S. company’s initial public offering. Visa Europe is owned by more than 3,000 European banks and has a put option that would force its former parent to buy it within about nine months if at least 80 percent of its board agrees, according to company filings.\nVisa has held talks to buy its European counterpart in a deal that could be valued at as much as $20 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this year.\nBuyback Restrictions “Expectations for a Visa Europe update to come by October or earlier should propel shares higher today,” Darrin Peller, an analyst at Barclays Plc, said in a note to investors. Peller estimates a deal could help add as much as 10 cents a share to next year’s earnings.\nRestrictions would be placed on Visa’s ability to repurchase stock should it move forward with any deal, Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf said Thursday on a conference call. Visa previously estimated that exercising the put option would cost the company more than $10 billion. The final price depends on a complicated formula with a range of variables.\nThe U.S.-based payments network said Thursday that net income for the quarter climbed 25 percent to $1.7 billion, or 69 cents a share, from a year earlier. Profit excluding a tax benefit and an adjustment to the Visa Europe put option was 62 cents a share, topping the 58-cent average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.\n“Visa continues to post strong results despite little improvement in consumer spending,” Scott Valentin, a FBR Capital Markets analyst, said in a note. The results “benefited from increased FX volatility and lower client incentives, and the company has revised certain aspects of its guidance accordingly.”\nVisa revised its EPS growth forecast for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 to “mid-teens range” from “low-end of the mid-teens.” Revenue rose 12 percent to $3.52 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $3.36 billion. Total operating expenses increased 11 percent to $1.3 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T17:41:20.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
