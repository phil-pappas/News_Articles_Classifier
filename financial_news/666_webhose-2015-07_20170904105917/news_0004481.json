What better way to thank the people who have helped LBS Financial flourish over the last 80 years than by contributing to organizations promoting positive and inspirational causes?\" \nLBS Financial kicked off its Summer Acts of Kindness as one of the sponsors of the ABC Unified School District Foundation's Fun Run/Walk & Wellness Fair, which raised over $25,000 in net proceeds to assist teachers and children in need with the resources they need to learn most effectively. With almost 1,000 5k and 2k participants, the event was the largest ABC Fun Run yet. \nThe credit union has been adding value to the neighborhood for 80 years and will continue this great tradition. With its Summer Acts of Kindness, LBS Financial is also sure to include activities that contribute to local schools, due to its initial founding as the Long Beach Schools Federal Credit Union. \nThrough such acts as a reusable bag donation to the Food for Kids organization, the adoption of three local schools, and its sponsorship of the ABC Unified School District's Fun Run/Walk & Wellness Fair, LBS Financial is thanking its original Membership. Sponsorship of a kayak trip with the Teacher's Association of Long Beach is also scheduled. \nNotably, LBS Financial will sponsor a Pet Clinic at Scherer Park on July 16, in recognition of Long Beach's long history of being pet-friendly. In the spirit of caring for local animals, LBS Financial will ensure that the first 40 dogs or cats will be able to obtain free vaccinations and microchipping. The remaining pets will receive such services at a low cost, thanks to LBS Financial's sponsorship. \nOn July 20, LBS Financial will begin writing thank you letters to deployed American troops, through the nonprofit A Million Thanks. There will be a station set up at the branches where Members can take a few minutes to write words of encouragement and thank our troops. The nonprofit distributes the letters while also making soldiers' dreams come true through a donation fund. \nA Coastal Cleanup with the El Dorado Nature Center has also been scheduled for September 19, underscoring LBS Financial's commitment to the environment. As part of the statewide Coastal Cleanup, the largest coastal clean-up in California, LBS Financial will participate along with El Dorado Nature Center, the Aquarium of the Pacific, Heal the Bay and other big organizations to clean up our coast. \nThe full list of remaining Summer Acts of Kindness events that LBS Financial employees will undertake include: July 16: Pet Clinic and Scherer Park, 4:00PM to 7:00PM.
