Passengers are traveling farther as more long-haul routes are added and are also contributing to higher levels of ancillary revenue.\nRevenue, at almost NOK5.9 billion, was up 16% from the same quarter last year.\nThe LCC carried 7 million passengers in the second quarter, up 9% on the year-ago period. Strongest growth in passenger numbers was at London Gatwick, where Norwegian has a substantial base, with its Oslo home hub described as “a close runner-up” in growth. The carrier’s increasingly important Spanish network also experienced what the company described as “a solid rise” in passenger numbers.\nLoad factor for the second quarter was 85.2%, up from 79.6% a year ago.\nWithin this overall growth figure, the carrier reported its new long-haul services are operating at a load factor of 91%, with its expanding fleet of Boeing 787s carrying 324,000 long-haul passengers compared to 139,000 a year ago. Norwegian has a long-haul fleet of eight 787s, with four more to be added next year.\nNew long-haul routes are being steadily added from Scandinavian airports as well as London Gatwick, despite the continuing delay in the US regulatory authorities approving permission for long-haul subsidiary Norwegian Air International to operate transatlantic services on its Irish AOC.\nThe airline has also launched new routes between the Caribbean and Boston, New York and Washington DC.\nOn the cost front, the decrease in fuel prices more than offset a weaker Norwegian krone, with the fuel price benefit being accentuated by the increasing numbers in the fleet of economical 787s.\n“It has been a good quarter for Norwegian with a positive growth throughout our route network, particularly on our long-haul network,” CEO Bjørn Kjos said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T04:22:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
