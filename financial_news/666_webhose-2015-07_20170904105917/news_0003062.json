He added: \"We've spent billions rolling out superfast fibre broadband to more than 75pc of the UK.\" \nWe list all the price increases below, including a £1 rise in monthly line rental and a 40p per month increase to BT's international calls package. \n• I complained about poor mobile phone signal and was told 'move to China' • No mobile phone signal? You still have to pay '£800' to escape \nThe telecoms giant, which increased its pretax profits by 12pc this year to more than £3bn, is sending letters to affected customers today. \nExisting customers will be given 30 days to leave their contract penalty-free, under new rules introduced by the regulator last month. \nThe industry watchdog, Ofcom, now forces providers to let customers walk away from their contracts if they don't deliver what is promised, for example as a result a change in prices or poor signal. \nThis also means that customers can escape the price increases by switching broadband providers. Typically customers on older packages tend to pay more and have slower broadband speeds because they don't shop around. \nBT customers typically pay £18 a month for their broadband and £17 for line rental, at a cost of around £420 a year. \n• Cancelling Sky (Other OTC: BSYBF - news ) : regulator to investigate industry's 'aggressive' tactics • The mobile, TV and broadband companies most open to haggling \nBy contrast Sky charges £287 for its standard broadband package including line rental, while TalkTalk charges £260. These are savings of £133 and £160 respectively compared with BT. \nShopping around can come with a catch particularly when firms advertise \"free\" broadband packages that are actually hugely expensive. \nThis is because the companies make up the shortfall for the cheaper deals in other areas, such as line rental and costly call plans. \nHaggle and save £267 \nHaggling with your broadband and phone provider can also net a discount. Householders can save up to £267 a year by switching their old broadband subscriptions , according to mystery shopping by Which? last month. \nSuccessful hagglers save, on average, £14.79 a month on their broadband and TV packages compared with the advertised prices, according to the survey. \nTips include checking out competitors' deals and mentioning them to sales staff, as well as asking to speak to the \"cancellations\" department to suggest that you are serious about leaving the firm. \nExisting BT customers who are paying line rental monthly can also save 10pc by paying upfront. \n= Breakdown of the price increases = \n• Line rental: £16.99 a month to £17.99 a month • Line rental \"saver\" (paying upfront): £183.48 to £194.28 • Call set-up fee: 15.97p to 17.07p • Weekday calls: 9.58p per minute to 10.24p per minute • Unlimited anytime calls on mobile: 6p to 6.41p • Unlimited evening & weekend calls 2014 package is rising to £3.20 • Unlimited anytime calls 2014 package is rising to £7.95 • Friends & family international package: £1.20 a month to £1.25 a month • \"International Freedom\" package: £6.20 a month to £6.60 a month \n>> The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter \nkate.palmer@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T13:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:26:28.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
