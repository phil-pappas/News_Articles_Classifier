In particular, total investments amounted to € 442.5 billion while third party assets under management amounted to € 50.9 billion. \nGeneral account investments of € 366.1 billion, increased by 0.3% primarily due to the bond portfolio benefitting from the reinvestment of the premium income of the period in particular in corporate bonds. The equity portfolio also increased mainly thanks to the price effect. Investment properties are broadly stable. \nCash and cash equivalents decreased, in line with the Group investment policy. As in the previous period, the future asset allocation strategy of the policy will aim at consolidating current margins and minimizing liquidity. \nThe investment strategy for fixed-income investments aims at portfolio diversification, in both government bonds, where the European core rates are at record lows, and corporate bonds, including private placements and guaranteed loans. The objective is to ensure adequate returns for policyholders and a satisfactory return on capital, while maintaining a controlled risk profile. \nEquity exposure will be kept substantially stable, through geographical and sector rotation targeting regions and sectors with growth higher than in Europe. \nNew real estate investments will selectively focus on new geographical areas such as Asia, UK and Eastern Europe, to improve the overall portfolio diversification. The Group will also implement a more active portfolio management approach to improve the overall profitability. \nSignificant events within the period and after 30 June 2015 \nGenerali finalizes the acquisition of Generali PPF Holding In January, the Generali Group reached 100% ownership of Generali PPF Holding B.V. (GPH) by acquiring the remaining 24% minority shareholding held by PPF Group, in line with the agreements signed in January 2013. With the acquisition of the full ownership of GPH, the holding company operating in Central Eastern Europe and one of the largest insurers on that market, the company changed its name to Generali CEE Holding B.V. The acquisition of the remaining shares of GPH was completed under the terms previously announced to the market, for a final price of € 1,245.5 million. \nS&P withdraws rating at Generali's request On 13 February 2015, at Generali's request, Standard & Poor's withdrew its ratings on the Group. Consequently, Generali will no longer have an S&P rating. The decision, taken after a thorough review including consultation with investors and other stakeholders, is based on the inflexibility of S&P's criteria to take into account the significant improvement of the Group's financial solidity achieved in the last two years. Furthermore, the mechanical link to the sovereign rating applied by S&P does not give merit to the Group's high level of diversification nor the benefits of its broad geographical presence. In line with industry norms, Generali will remain rated by three major rating agencies: Moody's (Baa1), Fitch (A-) and A.M. Best (A). \nGenerali, BSI reaches agreement with US Department of Justice Generali announced that BSI, the Swiss private bank, had reached a Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), under which it resolved liability arising from its legacy US private banking business. BSI, which paid an amount of USD 211 million, is the first \"Category 2\" bank to reach an NPA agreement with the DOJ. The U.S. settlement is in line with the amount already provisioned in Generali Group FY14 financial statements, therefore no further material impact is expected on Generali Group 2015 accounts. The agreement with the American Department of Justice is a further major step towards the finalisation of the BSI sale process, which will occur after receiving the required regulatory approvals. \nGenerali strengthens its international management team In April, Generali strengthened its governance with the arrival of two new managers joining the Group to lead the Asia and the Americas areas respectively. Jack Howell is the new Asia Regional Officer responsible for Generali's activities in China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. In China, Generali is one of the leading foreign Life insurers. Jack Howell assumes the role held by Sergio Di Caro, who as from 1st January 2015 took over as Head of Generali Employee Benefits, the global market leader in this segment. Antonio Cassio dos Santos joined the Group as Americas Regional Officer. Generali is amongst the leading foreign insurers in Latin America, operating in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Guatemala, Ecuador and Panama. The Group is also active in Northern America with the Generali U.S. Branch. \nGenerali: renewed the revolving credit facilities In May, Assicurazioni Generali has renewed the revolving credit facilities, initially signed in May 2013 for a total value of € 2 billion, which may be used by the Company within a period of 3 to 5 years depending on the credit facility. This transaction will have an impact on the Group's financial debt only if the facility is drawn upon and allows Generali to improve its financial flexibility to manage future liquidity needs in a volatile environment. The new credit facilities substitute the previous ones - both those with a 2-year duration that have expired and those with a 3-year duration that have been closed in advance. A group of 21 primary Italian and international lenders participated with strong commitment to the transaction. The total commitments received amount to € 13 billion, more than 6 times the company's offer. The competitive offer process adopted by Generali allowed the Group to select 7 lenders and obtain very favorable conditions, strongly improved with respect to May 2013, both in terms of offered size and pricing. \nGenerali launches strategic repositioning in the German market In May, Generali announced a strategic business repositioning in Germany. Its aim is to enhance the competitive position of the Group in the German market by the end of 2018 through a simpler and business-focused governance, a new business model in Life insurance to ensure long-term profitability, a stronger focus on distribution strengths and a modern and leaner operating platform. The repositioning will further leverage on following key business strengths: simpler and closer-to-business governance through the integration of Generali Deutschland Holding, Generali Versicherung and Generali Leben into the new Generali Deutschland AG; multi-channel and tailor-made offer through Generali, AachenMünchener and CosmosDirekt. Back office operations to be consolidated; Life insurance long term sustainability through focus on low capital intensive and high performance new products, transitioning the business into a \"New Normal\" model; building a smarter and simpler operating platform with improved IT architecture; new country management team completed. \nInvestor Day At the Investor Day at May end Generali presented the new strategic plan with a commitment to set out a new business model and to achieve new, challenging financial targets focused on generating more cash and increased dividends. The goal of the Group is becoming the retail insurance leader, based on simple and smart products and services. Strong attention will be paid on customer experience throughout the whole journey from information search to contract renewal. With the new strategy the Group aims for a cumulative Net Free Cash Flow generation of more than €7 billion by 2018. Cumulative dividend by 2018 will amount to over €5 billion. Generali has identified several levers of value generation to reach its financial targets. They include new value-added services embedded in the offering, new business opportunities through partnerships and data analytics to improve pricing. The current cost efficiency programme will continue with annual cost savings of €250 million extended through to 2018, resulting in total savings of €1.5 billion from the beginning of 2012. A total of €1.25 billion will be reinvested in technology, data analytics and more flexible operating platforms. \nTelco demerger closed Following the finalisation of the Telco demerger in June, Telecom Italia ordinary shares owned by Telco - 22.3% of the shareholders' equity - were distributed to its shareholders (of which 4.31% to the Generali Group). With the demerger becoming effective, the shareholders' agreement among Telco's shareholders has terminated. \nGenerali acquired My Drive Solutions In July, Generali acquired full control of MyDrive Solutions, an English start-up founded in 2010, among the leading companies in the use of data analytics tools to profile driving styles with the aim of identifying innovative and tailor-made products for the customers and favourable tariffs for low risk drivers. In line with the new strategy announced during the most recent Investor Day, the acquisition of MyDrive enables the Group to obtain a centre of excellence in data analysis, whose competencies will be further enriched and around which a Hub specialised in telematics solutions and know-how will be launched to serve all segments and business units. This will allow expanding data analysis activities to a vast series of sectors, from fraud prevention to sophisticated customer segmentation, thereby facilitating the creation of intercompany synergies and the optimisation of the product offering. \nOutlook \nIn the macroeconomic scenario, a recovery in the GDP growth in the advanced economies - at record low interest rates - is expected, due to the positive outlook for the American economy and the ECB expansionary policy. The Greek crisis should not lead to a significantly negative impact on GDP and on market volatility thanks to the agreement with the creditor countries and institutions. \nWithin this scenario Group Life premiums will continue to reflect a prudent underwriting policy and a stronger focus on low capital absorption and higher value products. Initiatives will continue to enhance the in-force portfolio and to drive selective growth of some business lines, such as protection policy products and unit linked products. In the P&C segment, the Group will continue in 2015 to implement in force measures relating to underwriting policy and claims management. \nGiven the presence of an uncertain macroeconomic scenario and in line with its strategic objectives, in 2015 the Group will continue to undertake all actions aimed at improving the overall operating result. \nThe Manager in charge of preparing the company's financial reports, Alberto Minali, declares, pursuant to paragraph 2 article 154 bis of the Consolidated Law on Finance, that the accounting information in this press release corresponds to the document results, books and accounting entries. \nDEFINITIONS AND GLOSSARY \nAnnual Premium Equivalent (APE) = the sum of new annual premium policies, plus one-tenth of premiums on new single-premium policies. This is the premium basis used to compute Life new business value. \nNew Business Value (NBV) = expected present value, on issue, of future profits arising from new Life business in the period, net of the cost of capital. \nNew Business Margin (NBM) = new production divided by APE. \nNet inflows = collected premiums minus outflows for maturities and surrenders. \nCombined ratio (CoR) = loss ratio plus expense ratio (acquisition expenses+general expenses) divided by earned premiums net of reinsurance. \nCurrent year loss ratio = the ratio between: current year incurred claims (excluding nat cat claims) + related claims management costs net of recoveries and reinsurance to earned premiums net of reinsurance. \nPrior- years loss ratio = the ratio between: prior years incurred claims + related claims management costs net of recoveries and reinsurance to earned premiums net of reinsurance \nSolvency I ratio = the ratio between available margin and required margin. \nEquivalent consolidation area = refers to equivalent consolidation scope. \nEquivalent terms = refer to equivalent exchange rates and equivalent consolidation scope. \nOperating result was obtained by reclassifying the components making up earnings before tax in each line of business on the basis of the specific characteristics of each segment, and taking account of recurring expense of the holding. All profit and loss items were considered, with the exception of net non-operating costs, i.e., results of discontinued operations, corporate restructuring costs, amortisation of portfolios acquired directly or through acquisition of control of insurance companies or companies in the holding and other activities segment (value of business acquired or VOBA) and other net non-recurring costs. In the Life segment, the following are also considered as non-operating items: realised gains and losses on investments not considered in determining profits attributed to policyholders and net measurement losses that do not contribute to the formation of local technical reserves but exclusively in determining the deferred liability to policyholders for amounts not relating to policyholders and those on free assets. In the P&C segment, the following are considered as non-operating items: all realized and measurement gains and losses, including exchange-rate gains and losses. In the holding and other activities segment, the following are considered as non-operating items: realized gains and losses and non-recurring net measurement losses. The total operating result does not include non-operating holding costs such as interest expense on borrowings and costs arising from parent stock option plans and stock grants. \nOperating return on equity = ratio of the adjusted operating result return to the Group shareholders' equity adjusted for the other items of the Statement of comprehensive income. \nEconomic Solvency ratio = the Economic Solvency ratio is based on the internal model to the insurance scope of Generali Group, assuming the BSI Group disposal and the application of the current IORP regime to the overall French pension portfolio. The Group internal model is currently subject to the approval process conducted by the Group Supervisor as part of the Solvency II implementation process which is scheduled to take effect January 1, 2016. \nFor a description of the alternative performance measures, refer to the Methodology Note of the Group Annual Integrated Report . \nThe Group has availed itself of the option provided for by art. 70, paragraph 8, and art. 71, paragraph 1-bis of the Issuers' Regulations to waive the requirement to publish informative documents prescribed in relation to significant mergers, demergers, capital increase by contribution of assets, acquisitions or divestitures. \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION \nFor further information please refer to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Generali Group. \nTHE GENERALI GROUP \nThe Generali Group is one of the largest global insurance providers with 2014 total premium income of more than € 70 billion.
