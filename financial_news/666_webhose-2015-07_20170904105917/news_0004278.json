Will an industry shake-up force airlines to change? \nAirline customers are continuing to report difficulties in claiming compensation for delays and cancelled flights despite a fresh crackdown by the regulator, which receives 400 complaints a day. \nThe Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) received 20,000 cases last year from customers who had reached a deadlock with an airline that was refusing to pay. The industry body is now creating a new “aviation ombudsman” to cope with the increasing volume of complaints. \nPassengers are entitled to compensation if a flight is cancelled, according to European Union rules that require airlines to refund unused tickets or provide an alternative route as soon as possible. \nIf you’re delayed by more than three hours, the airline should also pay for a hotel if an overnight stay is required and for refreshments until a replacement flight. \nNew (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) data suggest airlines are ignoring these rights by refusing to respond to delay claims or using loopholes to escape payouts such as blaming bad weather or strikes. \n“The airline industry is like the wild west with no rule of law enforced,” said James Walker of Resolver.co.uk, a complaints resolution website that tracks customer gripes. Passengers can submit their complaint online, which Resolver forwards to the airline company’s best contact in its customer services department. \n• Just one in four insurers covers volcanic ash as standard • Flight delays: are you due £480? \nResolver is now studying 2,639 cases raised so far in 2015 to name and shame the worst airlines and pass the data to the CAA “to challenge unfair treatment of customers”. \nConsumer lobby group Which? said it was also planning a campaign after reports of shoddy airline customer services. \nMr Walker, who set up Resolver last year and has received 38,000 complaints across various industries, said: “Both the consumers and good airlines are being penalised, yet the scoundrels do not have to worry. \n“We feel it is not fair that some airlines are rejecting all claims they receive for flight compensation and yet major airlines are focused on ensuring they are dealing with their customers fairly.” \nAnecdotal reports submitted to Resolver suggest that easyJet and Flybe tend to deal with complaints quickly, whereas Jet2 is “rejecting all of the claims they receive for flight compensation”, a claim the company denied. \nWhich are the most complained-about airlines? Airline Complaints per year Complaints per million passengers Thomas Cook Airlines 3,657 601 Thomson Airways 3,043 299 British Airways 2,727 67 easyJet 1,536 43 Monarch Airlines 1,326 189 Ryanair 981 32 Jet2 569 94 Virgin Atlantic 518 82 Civil Aviation Authority complaints data January December 2014 \nShort-changed passengers could be given a fresh opportunity to escalate their complaints when a new ombudsman starts in September. At least four major airlines have pledged to sign up to the voluntary body, the first of its kind in the industry. \nBritish Airways, easyJet and Thomas Cook (Xetra: A0MR3W - news ) will join the free-to-use service, which will demand airlines resolve complaints quickly and fairly. \nThe CAA currently handles complaints but its decisions are not binding on member airlines, meaning they can ignore the outcome. \nThomas Cook is currently the most complained-about, according to the latest data, with 3,657 customer complaints last year, or 601 per million passengers. Thomson Airways had 3,043, or 299 per million. These are the complaints referred to the CAA, so each airline may have had more. \nSome airlines continued to refuse to pay compensation to customers even if the CAA said they should, the body acknowledged. “It can’t be right that many air passengers have to go to court to get a concrete resolution to their complaint,” said Iain Osborne of the CAA. \n“We are not prepared to let this situation continue an ombudsman will make sure air passengers benefit from a quick, fair and certain approach to dispute resolution.” \nThe ombudsman is being set up in response to new European rules that mean, from July, every industry should have a “dispute resolution” scheme separate from company complaints departments. A new retail ombudsman, for example, was set up for shops in January . \n= Delays and cancellations: your legal rights = \nCompensation rules are set out in EU “denied boarding regulations”, which cover anyone travelling from an EU airport, or to an EU airport, on an airline based in an EU member state (including Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland). You are entitled to compensation if your flight is delayed by more than three hours. \nHowever, it does not apply in “extraordinary circumstances which could not have been avoided, even if all reasonable measures had been taken”. \nAccording to the CAA, incidences such as a volcanic ash cloud constitute “extraordinary circumstances”, meaning travellers would not be covered under this law. \nHowever, airlines are still obliged to pay for food and accommodation for travellers while they are stranded. A CAA spokesman said: “Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) if it’s not their fault, if there is disruption of any kind, airlines have to look after passengers.” \nCompensation is calculated according to the length of the flight and delay, but payouts can be up to €600 (£418) for long-haul flights. \nHave you been denied compensation, or is your airline ignoring a CAA decision?
