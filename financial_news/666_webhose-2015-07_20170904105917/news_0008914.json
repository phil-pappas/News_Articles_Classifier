Just 6 per cent of people switch each year to get a better deal. \n• BT home phone customer? You could be paying hundreds for a £10 phone \nOfcom said it was concerned that people found the transfer process too complex and time consuming. \nCurrently, users must obtain a code from their old provider, and take it to their new one a process made more difficult by call centre queues. \nIn a public consultation initiated yesterday the telecoms watchdog said people should have to make only one phone call to move to a new provider. \nThe rest would be handled behind the scenes. Sharon White, the chief executive of Ofcom, said: “Consumers should be able to switch their mobile providers with minimum hassle to take advantage of the best deals on the market.” \nGuy Anker, the managing editor of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: “It’s vital the system is significantly simplified so customers only need to deal with the new provider as they do on so many other types of switching. Only then will people have the true confidence to get themselves a better deal.” \nOfcom data showed that rates of mobile switching fell from 9 per cent to 6 per cent between 2013 and 2014. \nIf customers were more likely to switch, companies would be forced to offer better deals, it explained. \n“Seamless switching processes can help promote competition,” the regulator said in its consultation document. “If switching is easy, providers face strong incentives to provide good-value, high-quality services. They may also compete to offer innovative services with the aim of winning customers from competitors.” \nA spokesman for O2 said the current system worked well for most customers, but welcomed “dialogue with Ofcom on where improvements can be made”. \n• For money-saving tips, tricks and ideas, get our weekly round-up here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T12:37:47.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
