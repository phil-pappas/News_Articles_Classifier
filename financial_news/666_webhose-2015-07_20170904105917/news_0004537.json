Firmer US economic data on Friday also underpinned the dollar with the strong dollar weighing heavily on commodity prices.\nAt the JSE’s close the gold price was 2.48% lower at $1,105.79 per ounce and the platinum price had dropped 1.10% to $983/oz.\nBarclays Research said in a note European equities were higher after German Chancellor Angela Merkel held out the prospect of limited debt relief as banks in Greece reopened on Monday, three weeks after they were shut, although capital controls and limits on withdrawals remain in place.\n\"Markets had been resilient with an abrupt turn in risk sentiment in equities despite the Greece– and China–induced volatility,\" Barclays said.\nDespite the sell-off in gold and platinum stocks on the JSE, there was a relatively buoyant interest in industrial and financial shares, cushioning the bourse and enabling the all share index to close firmer.\nThe Dow opened flat at the JSE’s close and the FTSE 100 was 0.06% higher as the Paris CAC 40 gained 0.23%.

Iron ore, copper, aluminium, nickle and zinc prices also continue to fall.\n\"Obviously the strong dollar is hurting commodity prices, as gold and platinum prices slide even further, but there are also concerns about the slowing Chinese economy,\" he said.\nThere is a lower need for metals in China’s infrastructure development, because China accounts for almost 50% of the world’s refined metal consumption.\n\"This is giving way to a more consumer and service oriented economy, that needs less metals,\" Mr Hansen said.\nAmong individual global mining house stocks South32 (S32) was 1.09% lower at R16.32.
