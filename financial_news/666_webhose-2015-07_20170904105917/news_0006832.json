Tim Bauer by Brian Robins His worth has surged by close to $200 million over the past 12 months to a mouthwatering $380 million, propelling Marcus Blackmore steadily higher up the BRW Rich List.\nAt the same time he's pocketed more than $5.5 million in dividends, and another $414,000 of 'pocketmoney' in the form of directors from his company, Blackmores, which isn't bad for a university dropout – he abandoned a science degree – but then he did have the good fortune to inherit the family's business.\n\"I started a science degree at Queensland University and failed in the first year … I think I majored in playing cards,\" Blackmore said in a university graduation address once.\nBut after decades as a household name in Australia, it is Asia – a market which has come to value Australian food product standards in the wake of the series of Chinese scandals spanning powdered milk to frozen berries and meat – that has emerged as the driver of his company's fortunes, prompting investors to 'buy'. That optimism has seen the shares more than double in just over six months.\nEarlier focus The focus earlier in the year was on whether Commonwealth Bank or CSL would be the first Australian company whose shares would top $100, with Cochlear and Macquarie Bank outliers. But if Blackmores shares continue the present trajectory, the vitamin and supplements maker might just be the outsider that pips these market heavyweights to the post – especially if a mooted inclusion in the ASX200 sharemarket index eventuates.\nBut a lack of clarity over its sales in Asia coupled with wariness over the stellar share price performance has prompted some analysts to pull back.\n\"I have always generally liked Blackmores as it has a simple-to understand-business – that is, a developer, marketer and seller of health products, namely vitamins, mineral, and herbal supplements. Plus everyone's heard of Blackmores and most households would have at least one of its products in home,\" says Alto Capital analyst Carey Smith.\n \"From a financial point of view the company has historically had a very good return on equity (ROE), low debt, paid out good fully franked dividends and has grown EPS over the long-term – all the while maintaining a very tight capital structure. There are not many companies that only have a bit over 17 million shares outstanding, even after 20-plus years as a listed entity.\nValuation concerns \"Valuation is where it gets tricky. Love the business and finances, but the valuation over the last couple of years has gone crazy. The share price has increased to over $80 from the mid-$20s year or two ago, pushing the P/E ratio into the high 20s, compared to a historic levels generally between 10x and 20x.\n\"The switch by many investors into stocks considered safe and good dividend players has resulted in Blackmores now trading at levels I consider too lofty to consider it a buy. I would seriously consider it as a reduce, if not an outright sell. It is being priced for perfection. At levels around the $40 to $50 mark I would be interested again.\"\nAs one fund manager explained the recent share price gains: \"For the first time you're seeing the operating leverage improve – revenue is growing faster than costs,\" with rising volumes flowing straight through to the bottom line.\"\nAlso helping to boost volumes has been changing marketplace dynamics as a key competitor – Swisse – has slowed its marketing spend.\n\"Swisse took its food off the pedal,\" WAM Capital chief investment officer Chris Stott said. \"It had been aggressively marketing and had taken market share.\"\nDomestic share drift That shift by a keen competitor has resulted in domestic market share drifting back to Blackmores, he said. Additionally, Chemist Warehouse is believed to have emerged as Blackmores' largest customer domestically, with the health products group benefiting from the rising market share of this chain.\nOverseas, the growth story remains intact, but with question marks about what is happening in China. Analysts pointed to regulatory change there a year ago which favoured domestic vitamin makers at the expense of foreign suppliers such as Blackmores.\nThat has prompted the destocking of some foreign product, creating a black market in the products of some foreign suppliers such as Blackmores. It seems that in many cases family members have been buying vitamins and baby formula in their local market and sending it to relatives living in mainland China.\nMore fundamental, for Morningstar, the lack of detail in Blackmores market disclosure about its Asian business makes it difficult to assess the company's prospects.\n\"The trouble is it consolidates five to six Asian countries into a single line – including China,\" says Morningstar analyst Chris Kallos. \"The company does have the right to do that, but since it is positioned as an Asian growth story, we need more detail.\"\nHeavyweight fight In particular, as more of Blackmores' fortunes ride the Asian growth story, this is pitting its fortunes against US heavyweights such as GNC and Vitamin Shop. As well, Blackmores failed in a push earlier into the US, so gaining further detail and additional clarity on its progress and strategy in Asia is important to investors reaching an accommodation that the current push into Asia will succeed.\nBlackmores sells into Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, China, Macau and Cambodia – widely varying markets with differing competitive dynamics and execution risk. Compounding the lack of clarity here, there is also caution over the limited information made available by the company publicly, since all communication with analysts is stage managed.\n\"Selective briefings with the CEO and her team, which is atypical of the companies I cover,\" one analyst said of Blackmores dealings with securities analysts. The company said it releases all of material provided to analysts to the broader investment market.\nRecent broker research has also raised the prospect of ASX200 index inclusion for Blackmores, which if correct would prompt passive index funds to buy into the company. Given the limited liquidity in Blackmores shares, this speculation has helped push its shares to their all-time highs.\nBut wariness abounds about the upside from present levels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T00:06:06.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
