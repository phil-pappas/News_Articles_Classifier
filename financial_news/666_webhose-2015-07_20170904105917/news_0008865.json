The $1.85 trillion superannuation industry is expected to grow by $1 trillion over the next 10 years, as super assets make up the biggest component of retirees' assets outside of their own home.\nThe Intergenerational Report found work participation rates of those aged 65 and older will climb from the current 12.9 per cent in 2014-15, to 17.3 per cent by 2055.\nNearly 50 per cent of respondents say they experienced no barriers to continuing to work. Those who faced roadblocks in finding jobs cited health reasons, ageism or discrimination against older workers and keeping up with technological change as being some of their concerns.\n\"Flexible working arrangements have played an important role in encouraging older workers to stay in the workforce – allowing them to maintain a healthy work life balance and prove the freedom and financial means to attend to their personal and family needs,\" Ms Rubinsztein said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Ruth_LiewAFR"], "published": "2015-07-27T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:05:52.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
