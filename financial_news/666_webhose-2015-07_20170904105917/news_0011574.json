Thinkstock The tax bill on a Roth conversion could trigger other tax events. You're Right! True is correct. Sorry, wrong! is incorrect. \nThe right answer is True. \nBe careful. When you convert money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, the amount you convert gets added to your taxable income for the year. So if you convert $10,000 and your other taxable income is $50,000, your total taxable income for the year will be $60,000. If you convert a large amount of money, you could easily push yourself into the next tax bracket -- or even into the top tax bracket. \nBy pushing your taxable income up, you could also trigger other tax events, such as getting hit with Medicare premium surcharges or phasing out of certain income tax deductions. Carefully estimate the impact of a conversion on your overall tax liability before you make the move. A smart strategy is to convert only an amount that will keep you within your expected tax bracket for the year.
