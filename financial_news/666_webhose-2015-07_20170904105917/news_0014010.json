Josh Robenstone Share on twitter by Peter Ker Mine closures will accelerate in oversupplied commodity sectors in coming months, the manager of the world's biggest mining funds says.\nIn a gloomy preview of the September quarter, BlackRock chief investment officer for natural resources Evy Hambro said miners were facing \"tough decisions\" amid modest demand and weak commodity prices.\n\"Looking ahead, the outlook for commodity prices remains subdued, given expectations of further US-dollar strength and a modest demand outlook. This pressure will continue to force tough decisions and mining companies are likely to remain in austerity mode,\" he said in a note published by BlackRock.\nMr Hambro said analyst forecasts for the coming earning season would need to be trimmed, and miners would also need to respond to recent falls in commodity prices.\n\"As the year progresses, we would expect an acceleration of closures of high-cost capacity in oversupplied markets,\" he said, in an apparent reference to the iron ore and coal sectors.\nBlackRock is the largest shareholder in BHP Billiton, Barrick Gold, Newmont Mining, Freeport and McMoran and South32, and is among the top four shareholders in each of Rio Tinto, Peabody Energy, Fortescue Metals Group, Glencore and Anglo American.\nThose positions have made Mr Hambro one of the world's most influential mining investors during the past decade, and he has used that influence in recent years to publicly lobby big miners into increasing shareholder returns.\nLike many investors, Mr Hambro said copper would have an attractive supply-and-demand profile in coming years, while iron ore and coal were looking \"particularly\" weak.\n \"Copper is among those base metals where we see attractive fundamentals, and within our copper exposure we are focused on companies with high-quality assets and robust production profiles. We are cautious around the bulk commodities given our view that supply-demand fundamentals for this subset are particularly weak,\" he said.\nMr Hambro's funds enjoyed spectacular growth during the resources boom, with the value of his World Mining Trust rising eight-fold between 2002 and 2008.\nBut much of those gains have been lost during the recent years of pain in the resources sector, with the World Mining Trust sliding 26.4 per cent in 2014.\nIn a note published by BlackRock in recent days, Mr Hambro said these years of pain were necessary to create the next phase of higher prices.\n\"While the sector continues to face headwinds, it is important to remember that we are another year further into the underinvestment phase and closer to the deficit markets that we foresee,\" he said.\n\"We expect an inflection point to be reached once price (and consequently return) expectations start to recover as a result of the supply curtailment, which should accelerate with the current commodity price weakness.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/pgker"], "published": "2015-07-30T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:05:40.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
