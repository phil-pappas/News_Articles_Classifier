The utilities have denied this. \nSuppliers were acting within the law and not making excessive profits but consumers who failed to switch energy provider were charged too much money, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Tuesday in provisional findings from a sector-wide inquiry. \n\"We are proposing a transitional price cap which would actually protect those who are disengaged and indeed those who are most disadvantaged,\" Roger Witcomb, non-executive director of the CMA, told BBC radio. \nBritain's biggest energy supplier, Centrica (LSE: CNA.L - news ) which owns British Gas, said it had \"concerns\" about some of the proposals, including the price cap. Its shares traded down 0.9 percent at 0841 GMT, while rival energy supplier SSE (LSE: SSE.L - news ) saw its stock fall 1 percent. \nThe CMA launched an investigation a year ago into whether Britain's six largest suppliers, which hold around 90 percent of the market, were abusing their dominant market position. \nThe companies are SSE, Scottish Power, Centrica, RWE (Xetra: 703712 - news ) npower, E.ON and EDF Energy. \nThe CMA found these large suppliers' lowest-priced deals were on average higher than those offered by their smaller competitors. Britain's independent energy providers include Good Energy, Ovo Energy or Frist Utility. \nPRICE CAP \nGood Energy Chief Executive Juliet Davenport called for more action to encourage consumers to break with suppliers. \n\"What we need now is next steps from the CMA that will enable us to 'unstick the stickies', and light touch regulation which helps the consumer,\" said Davenport. \nA price cap is intended to address these issues and to prevent customers who don't switch supplier regularly from being automatically moved on to higher-priced tariffs. \nThe CMA said it was now seeking views on the level and duration of the price cap. \nConsumer groups said the findings showed the energy market was failing consumers and that more needed to be done to protect them. \n\"We won't hesitate to take further action where the market is not delivering a fair deal for consumers,\" said Britain's Energy Secretary Amber Rudd. \nPrime Minister David Cameron has said he would implement changes to the energy market in line with the findings of the CMA investigation. \nThe utilities escaped the worst-case outcome of the competition probe that could have led to their break-up, a scenario that has weighed on their share price since the start of the investigation, analysts said. \n\"The CMA's findings will provide positive clarification that will be helpful to the companies,\" said Whitman Howard utilities analyst Angelos Anastasiou. \nThe CMA is obliged to publish its final findings by Dec. 25. \n($1 = 0.6424 pounds) (Additional reporting by Mike Holden and Abhiram Nandakumar; Editing by Jason Neely and Keith Weir)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T12:43:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
