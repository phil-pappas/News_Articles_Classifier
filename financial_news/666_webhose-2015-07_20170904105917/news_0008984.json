Rob Homer Share on twitter by Michael Smith James Packer was in the front-line the last time he went to war with rival casino operator Echo Entertainment. The battleground was Sydney and the billionaire waged a public and aggressive campaign on the owners of The Star who were trying to block his plans to build a rival casino just down the road at Barangaroo.\nThe usually reclusive billionaire was a regular in the media and appeared in public to sell his plans to a divided public and talk up the benefits it would bring to the city in the form of Asian tourism and jobs creation. Echo was tarred by a sexual harassment scandal at its flagship casino and Packer took a threatening 10 per cent stake in his rival.\nBut as Packer's Crown prepares for round two against Echo, this time in Brisbane, there is much less aggro. Packer is not even in the country. With his business and personal interests increasingly focused offshore, he dialled into a Crown board meeting held in Melbourne during the week to sign off on the final Brisbane proposal. Crown chief Rowen Craigie and the company's advisers at UBS are leading the process although Packer is said to be personally interested in how Brisbane is playing out.\nThe gaming giants are competing to redevelop the Queen's Wharf precinct, prime riverside real estate at the historic heart of the Queensland capital. Both projects are expensive and ambitious and will change the city centre.The winner is expected to be announced during or shortly after next week's state budget.\nThere is plenty of lobbying going on behind the scenes as Echo and Crown were allowed to submit last minute tweaks and clarifications to existing bids, including additional financial incentives, during the week. But the headlines around their competing $2 billion-plus proposals to build a new gaming and entertainment complex have been far less exciting. This is due to the strict probity guidelines put in place by the Queensland government to ensure there is not a repeat of the public circus in Sydney. Both sides have been warned not to talk publicly.\nPolitically sensitive issue of pokies The politically sensitive issue of poker machine licences is another wildcard. Echo has long argued it has the upper hand because its proposal does not require any new poker machine licences, allowing the Labor government to take the high moral ground if it does not pick Crown.\n\"It would be an issue for Labor to convince the people of Brisbane they need 2000 extra slot machines. To me the Echo bid makes more sense. Having said that stranger things have happened,\" Clubs Queensland chief executive Doug Flockhart told the Weekend AFR .\n But it is believed Crown, which analysts say need 1500 to 2500 poker machines for its project to be viable, has floated the idea of abolishing the existing buyback arrangements for pokie licences, which currently locks casinos out of bidding for licences held by clubs, pubs and hotels.\nA person close to Crown speculated there could be a new opt-in scheme administered by the government. This means that a pub or a club could not be forced to sell their licence but would have the option to do so if they wanted.\nIt is a contentious issue and the idea has not been tried elsewhere. The industry associations are not on board but Crown has deep pockets and struggling individual club or pub owners could be attracted by an generous offer to buy their licences.\nThere is currently a cap of 19,500 poker machine licences for hotel operators. Those licences are tradable through a tender process, which is held every four months. This means holders of those licences can be surrendered into a pool and sold in a secret tender process.\nThe prices for licences sold to hotels in the south-east Queensland region have ranged from $77,000 to $131,000 in the last 12 months but volumes have been small. A lack of demand for new licences in separate state-wide tenders for clubs have seen prices as low as $4700.\nClubs separately operate about 24,500 licences and there are 7500 machines shared among the state's existing four casinos.\nLack of liquidity Crown is arguing a lack of liquidity in the existing buyback arrangements bolsters the case for a new arrangement that would give it five years to buy the licences it needs without increasing the number of poker machine licences in the state. It is also understood the government has a balance of unused entitlements now that could also be offered.\nPoker machines are one of many deciding factors in the process that will also focus on employment growth, financial incentives in the form of taxes and fees, and community support for the proposals.\n\"If I was a betting man I would be betting fairly strongly on Echo because their status as the player already in the arena is fairly compelling,\" one clubs source said.\n\"It is almost inconceivable that the Queensland government could bring about a situation where you have two casinos across the street from each other.\"\nPub and club owners and analysts say Echo has not done itself any favours in Queensland by under-investing in its existing casinos in Brisbane and the Gold Coast in the past. It sold its Townsville casino in 2014. Echo is currently mid-way through a $345 million redevelopment of Jupiters on the Gold Coast. But it is still the front-runner, according to analysts.\nThe former Newman government was rumoured to have already decided to award the project to Echo. Labor's shock election victory in January put plans to privatise $37 billion in asset sales on ice that put the spotlight on Queen's Wharf as one of the biggest capital works projects now slated for the state.\nBoth bidders have teamed up with foreign investors. Echo's partnership with Hong Kong's Far East Consortium and Chinese conglomerate Chow Tai Fook, would see it redeveloping the existing Treasury site it owns into a boutique and retail space and build the proposed casino, hotel and residential project at Queen's Wharf. Large public spaces and links between existing and new retail precincts have won community support for the project.\nCrown, meanwhile, has partnered with Chinese state-owned developer Greenland Holdings, with a plan that includes a six-star hotel, a suspended waterfall bridge and a new theatre.\nThe stakes are high for Echo chief executive Matt Bekier, who has driven a turnaround in the company's financial performance since taking the top job more than a year ago. CLSA analysts say Echo is likely to receive a management fee taking its share of pre-tax earnings above 50 per cent if it wins the project.\nCLSA's Sacha Krien argues Echo should win because a single operator would attract greater investment, would limit the number of new slot machines, attract ore tourists from Asia and has broader public support.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-07-10T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:07:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
