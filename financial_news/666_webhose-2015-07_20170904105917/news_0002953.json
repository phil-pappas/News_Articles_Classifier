The Wall Street Journal’s Jason Zweig last week said gold is like a pet rock , and buying it is largely an act of faith.\nNow Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, has made fresh downbeat comments on gold as well, predicting it could trade below $1,000 an ounce. August gold GCQ5, -1.21% was last around $1,093 an ounce in Wednesday trading.\n“We think we are in a structural bear market, not only in gold, but across the commodity complex, as the individual commodity stories are reinforcing to one another, creating a negative feedback loop,” Currie told Bloomberg News in an interview on Tuesday .\nHis prediction is based in part on his take on the dollar DXY, +0.18%\n“With the more positive outlook on the dollar, and with debasement risk starting to fade, the demand to use gold as a diversifying asset against the U.S. dollar becomes less and less important,” Currie said in the interview.\nGold’s recent slide has put it at levels last seen more than five years ago, as shown by the chart below for the big gold ETF GLD, -0.31%\nBearish comments also have come from Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com.\nThe short-term outlook for gold “remains bleak,” he said in a note Tuesday. The paper market, meaning options and futures, is much larger than the physical market, and that’s driven prices lower, he said.\n“Another important factor, most often forgotten, is sentiment. At the moment, sentiment is decidedly bearish on precious metals — rightly or wrongly, it doesn’t really matter for some traders,” Razaqzada added.\nRead more: 4 reasons gold got caught in a ‘perfect storm’\nAlso see: Gold’s plunge sparks retail demand in China, India\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/07/17/lets-be-honest-about-gold-its-a-pet-rock/", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-21/goldman-s-currie-sees-gold-dropping-below-1-000-as-rout-deepens"], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T15:40:09.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
