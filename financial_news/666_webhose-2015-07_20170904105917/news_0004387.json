It can be used as a tool to organise criminal activities or mobilise gang members in the outside world. Furthermore, it is doubtful that unconstrained communications on social media would be good for their rehabilitation,\" Luck said. \nTechnology like signal blockers could be used to ensure that even if prisoners somehow managed to acquire mobile technology, it would be useless. \nAcceptable practice \nBlockers were the subject of controversy in Parliament recently when members of the opposition accused the government of using the technology during President Jacob Zuma's chaotic State of the Nation speech. \nThe technology could be effectively used in high security prisons. \n\"It is used in jails to block cellphone communication to the outside and will obviously be used where certain high level confidentiality is applicable,\" Dawid Jacobs, forensic solution provider with Strategic Investigations and Seminars told Fin24. \nSmartphones are considered luxury items, said Luck. \n\"Criminal justice carries an element aimed to punish criminal behaviour and there is a fine line between prisoner rights and prisoner indulgences. The ability to communicate freely on social media is usually seen as the latter.\" \nThe so-called Waterkloof four were found to have mobile devices in jail. Christoff Becker's prison privileges were suspended following the revelations. \nLuck said that the sanction applied to Becker is an acceptable practice in SA. \n\"In practice, internal prison rules usually classify smartphones as contraband for this reason and their use (or misuse) by prisoners can be apportioned in aggravation of their sentence.\" \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T16:12:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
