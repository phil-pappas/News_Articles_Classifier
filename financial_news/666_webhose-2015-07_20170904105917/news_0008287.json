The public wage bill had dropped from 70 to 57 per cent. \" \nThe new system enjoined heads of department to validate employees before their salaries are paid. \nMr Opoku-Mensah added that the system also places a great task on heads of department to capture and expose unscrupulous elements in the system. \nHe said the introduction of the E-pay slip began the process of addressing the grey areas in the payroll system. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T18:19:53.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
