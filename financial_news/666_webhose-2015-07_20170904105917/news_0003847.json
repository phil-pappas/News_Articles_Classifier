Housing starts are expected to total 187,400.\nThe prediction compared with a February forecast by the bank that saw a 2.0 per cent drop in existing home sales, prices rising 1.5 per cent and housing starts totalling 177,000.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:31:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
