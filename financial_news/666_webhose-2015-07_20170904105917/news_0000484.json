The university however said in a later statement it never confirmed the Afro 4000 would be safe for \"all\" rail situations. \nBut here is the twist in the tale: Rapport has learned that although the lines are supposed be hang no lower than 4.5 metres - as it was in numerous of the tests conducted by Prasa and the US - many of the lines swing as low as 4.22 metres due to poor maintenance. \nIn Prasa's own report of February 2014, it pinpoints four places in Gauteng where the lines are as low as 4.22 metres above the railway lines. \"The locomotive comes too close to the contact cable, the risk factor for train drivers is high,\" the internal Prasa document said. \nThe accepted safe distance between the roof of the locomotive and the cables should be at least 150mm. \nAt the Denver bridge just outside Johannesburg for example, there would be just one centimetre between the roof of the Afro 4000 and the overhead lines. (According to Prasa's own engineer, this poses an \"operational electrical risk\". \nThe engineeie then suggested a \"revised design\" and that the delivery of the Afro 4000 be delayed. \nExperts said the maintenance on both the Transnet and Prasa railway lines is in such a poor state that overhead power lines will have to be lifted to accommodate the Afro 4000. \nRapport understands that the low-hanging cables can be lifted, but it is not clear what the cost implications would be. \nPrasa has also in the past week bragged that the train ran safely between Cape Town and Johannesburg for the Cape Town Jazz Festival. \nBut a letter sent from Transnet, and seen by Rapport, indicates it was not such a smooth ride after all. \nIn an e-mail sent by a Transnet official to about 20 Transnet and Prasa employees at the end of March, Prasa was lambasted for bringing a premier class train on the return trip to Johannesburg after the jazz fest, pulled by the Afro 4000 without the required \"YQ authorisation\" of Transnet. \"No notice was given of such a move [the trip]. Please arrange that the locomotive be removed from the train,\" the e-mail instructed. \nOn June 30 Transnet administrative head Magiel Pretorius issued a notice to Transnet and Prasa, in which he also raised concerns. \"Due to the height restrictions on the section between Veertienstrome to Kimberley, the Afro Class locomotive is not authorised to currently run between Veertienstrome and Kimberley,\" he said. \n* Between 2 and 13 Afro 4000-locomotives delivered to South Africa to date, have in the past week been pulled out of Cape Town by old SA manufactured Class 6E-locomotives for adjustments, according to a Vossloh report. \n* In his response Prasa spokesperson Moffet Mofokeng said: \"Prasa will once again provide a detailed factual list proving the allegations that the Afro 4000 exceeds the requirements of the rail industry in South Africa, wrong.\" \n\"We invite all media, also Rapport, to a presentation and trip on the locomotive. We will also prove how Rapport's reporting has changed after its first misleading article, which proves that their intention was malicious and sensational.\" \nSource: Rapport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T18:56:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
