Reuters by John McDuling Someday, resources will not be Australia's biggest export. That day may come sooner than you think. In fact, amid extreme volatility in the price of iron ore , it might already be upon us.\nExports of services were almost equal to exports of metals, ores and minerals in May, according to the latest monthly data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nThe ABS does not seem to break out exports into specific product categories, but according to a speech by a Reserve Bank of Australia official earlier this year, iron ore was eclipsed by high-value services such as education and tourism in export dollars last year.\nServices exports were actually higher than resource exports as recently as 2009, just before the latest mining boom started.\nThey were consistently higher than minerals exports in the 1980s and 1990s, based on this data, which is seasonally adjusted and in current prices.\nThe iron ore price spiked by about 10 per cent overnight but it has been in a sharp downward trajectory all year, roughly halving in value.\nA lower iron ore price could dent a significant hole in the federal budget, economists believe.\nHappy Friday.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/comment-and-analysis/iron-ore-no-longer-our-biggest-export-20150313-142za6.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/budget-facing-multibillion-dollar-hit-after-record-fall-in-iron-ore-prices-20150709-gi8cmn.html", "http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/5368.0"], "published": "2015-07-10T09:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T06:06:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
