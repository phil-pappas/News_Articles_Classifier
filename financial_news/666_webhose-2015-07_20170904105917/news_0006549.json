That compares with the 1.16 trillion-won average of 23 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nSlowing demand for smartphones and computing devices in its key markets, especially China, reduced orders for the chipmaker’s dynamic random access memory chips. Researcher Gartner Inc. this month almost halved its 2015 worldwide semiconductor sales growth forecast to 2.2 percent citing softness in electronic-equipment segments including PCs.\n“Steep price decline of memory chips for personal computers was the biggest culprit,” Jay Yoo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul, said before the earnings announcement. “Demand for PCs will continue to remain tepid throughout the year.”\nApple Inc., SK Hynix’s largest customer, on Tuesday reported sales of 47.5 million iPhones last quarter, missing analysts’ estimates. Apple contributes about 9 percent of the chipmaker’s sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nU.S. competitors have painted a darkening industry outlook, mainly due to weaker demand for PC components. Micron Technology Inc., the biggest U.S. maker of memory chips, last month forecast fiscal fourth-quarter sales that fell short of analysts’ estimates after third-quarter sales fell 3.2 percent.\nSK Hynix’s operating profit for the quarter was 1.38 trillion won, compared with the 1.46 trillion won average of estimates.\nShares of SK Hynix have declined 20 percent this year, compared with a 7.8 percent gain in the benchmark Kospi index.\nThe Korean chipmaker said after the market close on Wednesday it will buy back 22 million shares between July 23 and Oct. 22. The value of the transaction based on the stock’s closing price on Tuesday of 39,050 won would be 859.1 billion won, according to the regulatory filing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T03:07:16.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
