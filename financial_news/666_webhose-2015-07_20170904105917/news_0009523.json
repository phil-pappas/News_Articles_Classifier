Analysts had estimated $16.74.\nSales of Tecfidera, which treats multiple sclerosis, were $883 million in the second quarter, below analysts’ estimates of $909 million. That marks another disappointing period for the drug, which in the first quarter also fell short of analyst projections.\nAnalysts have voiced concern that Tecfidera patients were being siphoned by Novartis AG’s MS drug Gilenya. Novartis’s head of pharmaceuticals said this week more people were using its medicine as a first option.\nWhile second-quarter adjusted earnings of $4.22 a share beat analysts’ average estimate of $4.10, revenue fell short. Sales of $2.59 billion compared with analysts’ projection of $2.73 billion.\nBiogen’s most closely watched product in development is an experimental treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. But expectations moderated on Wednesday when, in a small trial, a 6-milligram dosage of the drug had no statistically significant effect on patient’s cognitive decline. The company is taking the drug, BIIB037, into final-stage testing.\nThe biotechnology company has also been expanding its pipeline of treatments that use gene-modifying technologies to treat disease. That includes a $1 billion partnership with Applied Genetic Technologies Corp., a research deal with the San Raffaele-Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy to develop treatments for the blood disorders hemophilia A and B, and an agreement to work with Sangamo BioSciences Inc. for sickle cell disease and the blood disorder beta thalassemia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T14:13:12.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
