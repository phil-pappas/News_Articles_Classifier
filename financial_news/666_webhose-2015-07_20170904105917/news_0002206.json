It supplies companies such as Pret A Manger and Virgin Active, to care home operator HC-One and catering company Compass with sachets of frozen fruit, a blender, fruit juice and the cups and straws to serve freshly made smoothies without the burden of peeling and chopping raw fruit and vegetables. \nFounder Richard Canterbury, who was previously a marketing executive at Saatchi & Saatchi, has now signed deals with online supermarket Ocado and ready meals chain COOK to sell its smoothie sachets direct to consumers for the first time. \n“People have been asking us for a home-use product for years,” says Canterbury, 40. “Everybody has blenders these days, but no one wants to spend time chopping.” \nLove Smoothies provides all the tools and ingredients for creating a pop-up smoothie shop inside any cafe, hotel, gym or bar \nConsumers are increasingly clued up about nutrition, he claims. “Other smoothies on the market are pasteurised, which means that they’ve been boiled, destroying a lot of the nutrients. The fruit in our sachets is frozen two hours after the fruit is picked, retaining the goodness and taste.” \nLove Smoothies’ products are selling well so far, Canterbury claims, and the company is on target to achieve year-on-year growth of at least 50pc. “Ocado said that it was really impressed with the rate of sale and the reviews,” he says. \nCanterbury’s aim is to roll the smoothies out into the Whole Foods chain of stores, if talks between the pair are successful, and other small retailers. He is then targeting the major supermarkets. \nThe £3.4m turnover business will hit £50m within a decade, he says. \nBritish consumers spent £1.5bn on juice drinks and smoothies last year, despite a widespread backlash against sugar. Vegetable smoothies are now more popular than fruit varieties , however. Love Smoothies' best-selling product is Broccoli & the Beast, containing broccoli, mango, spinach, pineapple, banana and celery. \nAll the company's recipes are designed by Michelin (Paris: FR0000121261 - news ) -starred chef Dominic Chapman under the supervision of nutritionist David Dunne, who works with Harlequins Rugby Union Club, Queens Park Rangers Football Club and the Great Britain canoeing team. \nNot all Love Smoothies' inventions are a hit, however. \"We launched one called Tropical Colada, which I thought would be a bestseller but it bombed,\" says Canterbury. \"It was anemic in colour so it didn't look appealing, and it split quickly. It also turns out that coconut only sells in summer.\" \nConsumers prefer colourful smoothies \nThe company was quick to jump onto the green smoothie trend , however, swapping out sweet fruits for vegetables. \n“Veg smoothies are the big trend that came over from the US,” says Canterbury. “The States are about three to five years ahead, and everyone there is wild about kale and broccoli and beetroot smoothies.” \nLove Smoothies is currently developing its next generation of drinks in partnership with sandwich chain Pret A Manger, with ingredients such as charcoal and turmeric. \nThe company started life as a stall in Borough Market, London, in 2004. Canterbury learnt the hard way that smoothies are a very seasonal business. “We would make money in summer and lose money in winter,” he says. “Except January, when everyone wants to be healthy for the new year then sales go through the roof.” \nTo cut business overheads, he decided to outsource as many operations as possible, from sales to social media, and the business now employs just seven people. \nLove Smoothies founder Richard Canterbury \nLove Smoothies is working to ensure a steady stream of revenues all-year-round by targeting export markets that have their summers while it is winter in the UK. Around 25pc of sales are now generated from overseas customers in 10 territories, including Australia and the Middle East. “We’re aiming to get that up to 40pc within the next two years,” says Canterbury. \nSmoothies are an expensive treat, which has kept Canterbury from making a play in China or India. “The disposable incomes there still aren’t high enough,” he says. \nThe business has also diversified into non-smoothie products to help boost the winter business. It has created concentrated fruit teas, which come in ice cubes. Consumers add boiling water to serve the range, which includes apple & cinnamon and cranberry & hibiscus flavours. It has also launched a sideline selling all-natural frozen vanilla and fruit frappes. \nBut Love Smoothies’ latest product launch is a big departure from its core fruity business. The company has created its own take on bone broth, the soup made from boiled bones that has become a phenomenon in the US. \n“We’ve been looking into this for a year and have finally developed an organic product,” says Canterbury, who has spent between £80,000 and £100,000 on research and development. “It’s a big gamble, but when we left some in the fridge at the office, it all went, which is a good sign.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T08:38:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
