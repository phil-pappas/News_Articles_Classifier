In full sovereignty they expressed a clear 'No' to the proposals on the table in the eurozone. This is a difficult day,” Schulz said.\nSchulz also warned of the difficult situation that Greece faces and urged EU leaders to discuss “a humanitarian aid programme” for the Hellenic country.\n\"Ordinary citizens, pensioners, sick people or children in the kindergarten should not pay a price for the dramatic situation in which the country and the government brought the country now. Therefore a humanitarian programme is needed immediately and I hope that the Greek government will make in the next coming hours meaningful and constructive proposals allowing that it is meaningful and possible te renegotiate. If not, we are entering a very difficult and even dramatic time,\" Schulz added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T01:17:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
