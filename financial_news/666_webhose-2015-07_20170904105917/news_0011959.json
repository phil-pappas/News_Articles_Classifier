April's deficit was revised to a slightly wider C$2.99 billion.\nExports fell by 0.6 percent in May, with export volumes down 2.5 percent amid a decline in metal and non-metallic mineral products. Imports edged up 0.2 percent.\nEnergy product exports increased 1.3 percent as a rise in refined petroleum energy products was tempered by a decline in exports of crude oil and bitumen. Non-energy exports, which the Bank of Canada is hoping will help drive stronger growth, fell 0.6 percent. The central bank will decide on interest rates next week with markets pricing in about a 45 percent chance it will cut rates again after January's surprise cut.\nOil is a major export for Canada and cheap crude prices have weighed on the economy. After a contraction in the first quarter and a weak start to the second quarter, Canada is at risk of falling into a recession for the first time since the 2008-09 global credit crisis.\nExports to the United States declined 0.3 percent and Canada's trade surplus with its neighbor to the south narrowed to C$2.12 billion. Canada's trade deficit with countries other than the United States widened to C$5.46 billion as exports fell.\n($1=$1.2710 Canadian) (Reporting by Leah Schnurr , Editing by Franklin Paul)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T15:50:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
