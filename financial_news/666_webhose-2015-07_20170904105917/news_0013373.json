Revenue was slightly below estimates, and the company said organic sales in the current fiscal year will be down slightly to up single digits. \nCigna –The insurance company reported adjusted quarterly profit of $2.55 per share, beating estimates of $2.31, though revenue was slightly below forecasts. Cigna's results were helped by customer growth in its commercial and government segments, as well as rate increases. \nStanley Black & Decker –The tool maker beat estimates by ten cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.54 per share, while revenue was also above Street projections. The company also raised its full year guidance as its profit margins expand. \nTime Warner Cable –The cable operator earned an adjusted $1.54 per share for its latest quarter, missing the consensus estimate of $1.81, though revenue was essentially in line. Time Warner Cable had a net addition of 66,000 customers during the quarter, its first positive second quarter performance for that metric since 2008. \nStarwood Hotels –The hotel operator beat estimates by ten cents, reporting adjusted quarterly profit of 84 cents per share. Revenue also beat forecasts, despite the impact of a stronger dollar, and Starwood said a revamping of its cost structure helped results in the face of macroeconomic headwinds. \nCardinal Health –The drug distributor reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.00 per share, 1 cent above estimates, with revenue also beating forecasts. Cardinal also raised the midpoint of its current fiscal forecast, anticipating benefits from recent acquisitions among other positive factors. \nStratasys –The 3D printer maker matched estimates with quarterly profit of 15 cents per share, with revenue slightly above analyst forecasts. However, the company withdrew its full year guidance and gave a current quarter forecast that's far below current Street consensus, warning of a period of slower growth. \nADP –The financial data services provider missed estimates by four cents with quarterly profit of 55 cents per share, with revenue also missing estimates. ADP cites the currency fluctuations as well as higher than anticipated selling expenses as negative factors during the quarter. \nGNC Holdings –The nutritional products retailer fell a penny short of Street estimates with quarterly profit of 79 cents per share, and revenue also fell short of forecasts. GNC does say it is seeing improving sales trends and expanding profit margins. \nFacebook –Facebook estimates by three cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 50 cents per share and revenue also beating consensus. However, investors were disappointed by an 82 percent surge in expenses. \nWhole Foods –Whole Foods missed estimates by two cents with quarterly profit of 43 cents per share, with revenue also missing the mark and the grocery chain giving lighter than expected current quarter guidance. Whole Foods has been hurt by increasing competition and has also suffered negative publicity from overcharging complaints in its New York City stores. \nWynn Resorts –Wynn reported adjusted quarterly profit of 74 cents per share, well short of the 96 cent consensus estimate. The casino operator's revenue also missed estimates on declining results in the key Macau market. \nLifeLock –LifeLock beat estimates by a penny with adjusted quarterly profit of 10 cents per share, with revenue slightly above estimates. The identity protection services company lowered its full-year guidance, however, on anticipation of a recent FTC lawsuit weighing on profits. \nMarriott –Marriott earned an adjusted 82 cents per share for its latest quarter, one cent above estimates, though revenue came in slightly below forecasts. The hotel operator did raise its full-year guidance, on the strength of growth outside the U.S. \nWestern Digital –Western Digital reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.51 per share, seven cents above estimates, but the hard drive maker's revenue was below forecast as it deals with the impact of declining demand for personal computers. \nSony –Sony reported a 39 percent jump in quarterly profit, coming in above estimates on strong sales of camera equipment and PlayStation 4 consoles and related items. \nBaidu –Baidu announced a $1 billion share buyback. China's largest internet search company took that action after a weak earnings report dragged the stock's price down. \nMetLife –MetLife earned $1.56 per share for its latest quarter, seven cents above estimates, but the insurer's revenue was short of forecasts. Its results were hurt by nearly $600 million in derivatives-related losses. \nAB InBev –The beer brewer saw its latest profit fall short of analyst estimates, with sales in key markets weaker. The company said poor weather and weak economic conditions weighed on its results. \nNokia -Nokia reported better than expected second quarter results, helped by a sizable jump in software sales. \nTesla –The automaker launched a referral program for its Model S sedan, with current owners receiving a $1,000 incentive for any new customers they bring to Tesla. \nFord –Ford's new aluminum-sided F-150 got mixed results in new crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. \nQuestions?
