F -0.13 % But winning was costly. \nThe No. 3 U.S. auto maker sold 146,151 vehicles on a retail basis, likely representing the first time it outpaced Ford in the closely watched portion of the monthly sales that are sold to individual consumers at dealerships. Overall, Ford solidly outpaced its smaller rival—selling 224,681 vehicles overall compared with Fiat Chrysler’s 185,035. But that difference was due to Ford selling 35% of its vehicles to fleet buyers such as commercial users, governments and rental car companies. \nFiat Chrysler’s milestone comes amid a 63-month string of collective sales increases for its four brands, helped along by strong demand for its Jeep brand. Its ability to outpace Ford in June, however, was propped up by a much deeper reliance on sales incentives. \nAccording to researcher Autodata Corp., Fiat Chrysler spent an average of $3,382 in incentives on each vehicle sold, compared with Ford’s $2,595. \nAuto makers have worked to dissuade analysts from putting too much stock in a single month’s vehicle sales trends. During any given month, Toyota Motor Corp.’s Toyota brand outsells General Motors Co. GM -0.87 % ’s brands on a retail basis, for instance, but GM manages to retain the industry’s top spot year after year and its profitability is on the rise despite its inability to consistently outpace its Japanese rival at dealerships.

That is lower than the $3,427 spent by GM and the $3,277 by Fiat Chrysler, both of which have increased their spending. One of the reasons incentives are low is because Ford’s inventories are light, particularly as its highest-volume product, the F-150 pickup truck, is making an abnormally long transition from a steel-bodied version to aluminum. \nThe strategy and lack of F-150s is costing Ford market share. Through June, Ford’s 15.1% share of U.S. sales was four-tenths of a point lower than the first half of 2014. Over that same period, GM, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler and Nissan Motor Co. NSANY -0.67 % have essentially held share flat, or recorded an increase. \nFord says its volumes should pick up in the second half of 2015, and its profit margins will be fatter. In an interview, Ernst & Young automotive analyst Anil Valsan said the ability of auto makers like Ford to hold sales incentives in check while reporting higher volumes will be closely watched. ENLARGE \nThe wider U.S. market should provide a favorable backdrop for Ford’s second-half ambition. In June, the overall industry sold 1.48 million light vehicles, 3.9% higher than the same period in 2015 but 10% lower than May. \nJune’s seasonally adjusted annual selling pace was 17.16 million vehicles, the first time it has topped 17 million for two months in a row since 2005. That trend suggests the industry could hit 17.2 million in 2015, according to the National Auto Dealers Association, representing potentially the second-best year on record for the American car business. \nThe strong start to the summer selling season is welcomed by an auto industry combating slowdowns in other parts of the world. While India and Western European volumes are solid, growth has slowed in China while other emerging markets—notably Brazil and Russia—are in a tailspin. \nAmerican car buyers have long been among the most valued in the world by auto makers, as their spending and demand for bigger vehicles make sales more profitable. The high concentration of sales of trucks and SUVs amid lower gasoline prices, combined with better capacity utilization and tighter inventory controls, has made the U.S. market even more lucrative during the current boom. \nFuel prices currently are near their highest point in 2015, but they are still 91 cents a gallon lower than a year ago, according to the AAA. More than 54% of the vehicles sold in June were light trucks, according to Autodata, compared with 50.6% a year ago.
