Eurozone policy makers said they would not negotiate until Sunday's referendum in Greece on creditors' reforms. \n\"The market today took its cue from the European markets,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital. \"We're basically hopeful of a deal.\" \nUS businesses added 237,000 jobs last month, up from 203,000 in May and the best level since December, according to payroll firm ADP. \nThe Department of Labor will release the official US jobs report for June on Thursday. Analysts expect a gain of 230,000 jobs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T00:48:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
