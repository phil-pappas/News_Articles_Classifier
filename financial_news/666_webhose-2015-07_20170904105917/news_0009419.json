It was decided to resume discussions after the Eid holidays and talks will resume again in a week's time.\" \nThe reports said talks between Qatar Airways and SpiceJet first took place in March and a second meeting happened recently. \nIf a deal does take place, it will be the second such transaction in recent years after Etihad Airways picked up a 24 percent stake in Jet Airways in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T05:43:31.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
