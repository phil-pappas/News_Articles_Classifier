Its stock price peaked around 57 euros just before the company surprised investors with a capital hike in mid-February.\nShares of Rocket closed at 40.94 euros, up 2.21 percent on Monday but lower than the 42.50 euro price at which its shares were originally priced in early October last year but just above its 37-euro closing price after its first day of public trading.\nThe company said it had committed to a three-month lock-up on further stock or equity-linked transactions. J.P. Morgan is the sole bookrunner for the bond offering, the company said.\nLast month, at its first annual shareholder meeting, Rocket won investor support to raise as much as 4.5 billion euros ($5 billion) over the next five years to invest in new ventures and increase stakes in its existing start-ups.
