Katja Hall, CBI deputy director-general, said: “The Government has set out its stall to create a high-skilled economy, but firms are facing a skills emergency now which threatens to starve economic growth.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T02:06:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
