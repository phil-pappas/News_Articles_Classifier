Our EU economy Internet antitrust investigation shows that they cannot do this today,\" Vestager said in a statement. \n\"We believe that this may be in breach of EU competition rules,\" she said. \"The studios and Sky UK now have the chance to respond to our concerns.\" \nThere was no immediate reaction from the Hollywood studios or Sky TV to the announcement, which follows an investigation launched in January 2014. \nIn May Brussels unveiled an ambitious project to build a digital single market across the union of 28 countries and 500 million people, which is the world's biggest economy but sharply divided in digital terms. \nEuropean Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker also hopes to help build cross-national media champions to take on not only Hollywood but digital giants such as Google and Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news ) as well. \nAs part of that project, former Danish minister Vestager launched an investigation into the way e-commerce in general works across the bloc. \n- High-profile investigations - \nThe new probe specifically puts into question Europe's copyright rules, which allows Hollywood studios to sell their content individually to national markets, creating a divided European market in defiance of EU rules, according to the commission. \nThe Commission's \"takes the preliminary view that each of the six studios and Sky UK have bilaterally agreed to put in place contractual restrictions that prevent Sky UK from allowing EU consumers located elsewhere to access pay-TV services available in the UK and Ireland.\" \nSpecifically, subscribers to the Sky TV's network of channels are blocked from accessing its offerings of films and TV series once outside Britain and Ireland. \nThe Commission also said it was still examining similar cases involving Canal Plus (Paris: FR0000125460 - news ) of France, Sky Italia of Italy, Sky Deutschland (Other OTC: SKDTY - news ) of Germany and DTS (NasdaqGS: DTSI - news ) of Spain. \nSince taking office in November Vestager has made a name for herself with a series of high-profile investigations. \nUS-based firms, in particular tech companies, have been a particular target for Vestager amid concerns that companies across the Atlantic (Shanghai: 600558.SS - news ) are distorting the EU's single market. \nBut the investigations have raised deep suspicions in Washington over EU trade regulation. \nThey have also raised alarm in Moscow after the EU in April charged Gazprom with abusing its dominant market position in Europe, risking a new battle with Russia amid tensions over Ukraine", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:16:19.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
