They said there was no certainty an agreement would be reached or that it could overcome competition concerns. Both companies declined to comment. More Bolloré shakes up Canal Plus management \nProSieben is Germany’s biggest commercial broadcaster and Axel Springer is the country’s biggest news publisher, owning titles such as Bild , Europe’s best-selling tabloid, and the conservative daily Die Welt . \nThe deal has long been seen as a possible response to the rising pressure put on media companies in Germany and elsewhere by a handful of dominant US digital media companies. \nAxel Springer agreed a €4.2bn takeover of ProSieben in 2005, but the deal was blocked by Germany’s competition authority . The tables have since turned and ProSieben is now the larger company with a market value of €9.72bn, compared with €4.68bn for Axel Springer. \nThe combination would run counter to the recent trend in media groups for separating out-of-favour print assets from better-performing television businesses. \nNews Corp , Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper company, has split off from its larger 21st Century Fox entertainment arm; Time Warner has spun off its Time Inc magazines division and Gannett has split its local broadcasting business from the newspaper operation that includes USA Today and scores of regional publications. \nAxel Springer is controlled by Friede Springer, the widow of the company’s eponymous founder. Any agreement would require her backing as she controls just over 50 per cent of the company through a foundation. She is also close to Mathias Döpfner, a former newspaper editor she appointed as chief executive in 2002. \nPeople close to the situation said there may be ways to structure a deal that allow Ms Springer special voting rights in a combined company, but acknowledged that this was one important element of the talks that had still to be resolved. \nUnder Mr Döpfner, Axel Springer has concentrated on digital acquisitions , buying news broadcaster N24 in 2013 to supply video for its digital platforms. It has also invested in its classified advertising arm, where last year revenues grew to €512m. \nThe FT previously reported that Axel Springer approached AOL about a potential takeover late last year. \nAt the time of Mr Döpfner’s 2005 bid, the German competition authority argued that ProSieben and RTL, the broadcaster owned by Bertelsmann, had a duopoly over German TV advertising and a deal with Axel Springer would limit competition. \nProSieben had a 28.7 per cent share of the German TV audience last year, and a 44 per cent share of the advertising market. A tie-up with Axel Springer would enable cross-promotion of popular programmes such as Germany’s Next Top Model and The Voice of Germany, a talent show. \nThomas Ebeling has run ProSieben since 2009. Buyout firms KKR and Permira sold their stakes in the business in 2014, having acquired just over 50 per cent in 2006 from media entrepreneur Haim Saban and other US investors for €3.1bn. \nShares in ProSieben have risen 27.6 per cent this year, while Axel Springer’s stock has dropped nearly 5 per cent.
