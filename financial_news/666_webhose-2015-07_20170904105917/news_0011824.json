Jim Rice by Vanessa Desloires and Vesna Poljak Australian fund managers are bracing for more volatility in the market after Greece's resounding no to its debt bailout terms , but say there's plenty of opportunity for investors.\nAMP Capital head of investment strategy Shane Oliver said he was not surprised by the no vote, and said a Greek exit from the eurozone, a \"Grexit\", was highly likely.\n\"I secretly figure at the end of the day, once Greece finally leaves there will be a relief rally, that the thorn in the side of the euro is gone,\" Mr Oliver said.\n\"They're the ones who triggered each crisis; they're the ones who have struggled to manage the problem of economic austerity, unlike [countries like] Spain and Italy who have got their act together.\"\nMr Oliver said Monday's Australian sharemarket fall of more than 1 per cent reflected a degree of nervousness in the market . \"The risks are down, but there's still the fear of the unknown.\"\nPatersons research and strategy co-ordinator Andrew Quin echoed Mr Oliver's comments that the market was in a period of the unknown , which \"makes people run to the sidelines\".\n\"The Australian market's reaction at the moment is reasonably negative because it has become 'real' with the no vote,\" he said. \"There's no real need to make a definite decision on where you want to position yourself until it gets clarified, which you see it doing today.\n\"We have bigger issues in the background, and that relates to what's happening in China: it makes trading a little bit more cautionary.\n \"Greece's debt problems are not over; this is just the beginning. They owe a lot more money to other creditors, and because of the banking structure being closed at the moment, it adds up to hard times ahead and less ability to pay its debt position.\n\"On the other side of it, we watch closely credit default swaps and EU bond yields for signs of contagion effects, and they have been relaxed.\"\nGrexit likely \"The investing community, based on a few different polls, were probably two-thirds expecting a yes vote,\" said Grant Forster, chief executive of Principal Global Investors.\n\"From a rational perspective, markets players are trying to look at the situation rationally, the Greek people overwhelmingly want to stay in the EU and euro, but they're also getting right behind their government in kicking out the austerity measures.\"\nMr Forster said the likely outcome is Greece's exit from the eurozone.\n\"The market reacted in a way that was tolerable of the missed IMF payment on June 30, but it doesn't take much digging around to see that rarely do countries default on IMF payments. Even Argentina, when they've missed some payments, have not missed IMF payments.\"\nHe said the market's so-far moderate reaction suggests they may be underestimating the flow-on effects of a Grexit.\n\"It's still early days in the full European recovery; you'd hardly describe that as being robust. We haven't seen a line like in the US where there's low unemployment, growth coming back.\"\nGreece in perspective Perpetual global equities portfolio manager Garry Laurence said however that Greece itself, at only 2 per cent of Europrean GDP, was a very small part of the global economy.\n\"It's just creating a lot of uncertainty and what you're seeing is risk premiums starting to rise,\" he said.\n\"The uncertainty in global markets is around what the ramifications are of Greece exiting and how much debt they actually owe, and who owns that debt, and what it all means.\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if they do agree on something but if they really do default, its not so significant to global GDP growth,\" Mr Laurence said.\nAusbil chief economist Jim Chronis said developments from Greece was not news to change asset markets or asset allocation.\n\"The thing that is new is that we know is the US is recovering quite well and rates will increase,\" he said.\n\"You should be really focusing on the US and when they hike rates. It's a question of will they do it.\"\nOpportunities abound Mr Forster said an area worth investigating was domestic small-to-mid cap companies exposed to domestic earnings in the US; they were a \"decent strategy to have in your portfolio\" compared with US-domiciled companies with currency exposures. Traditional safe havens including US bonds, even at very low interest rates, were also attractive.\n\"Now that the market's potential has come off, there are areas to invest in, those who have a decent cash level now, in the next couple of months should be ready and able to invest,\" Mr Forster said.\nMr Oliver said there were opportunities for internationally focused investors in European stocks.\n\"I think Europe will hang together with easy monetary policy in Europe and a lower euro which will help profit growth,\" he said.\n\"Also, stocks which benefit from a lower Australian dollar, have low offshore exposure, will benefit. I think the trick in all of these things is not to panic.\"", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/greece_drama_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-07-06T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T12:12:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
