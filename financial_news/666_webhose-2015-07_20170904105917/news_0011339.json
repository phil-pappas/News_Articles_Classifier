Josephine Cumbo, Pensions Correspondent ©Dreamstime \nThe regulator is facing calls to shore up the financial safety net for investors in pension drawdown as new analysis showed many would face big cuts to retirement income if their provider went bust. \nWhich?, the consumer group, made the call as the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, the compensation fund of last resort, rolled out changes that will see improved protections for some savers, but leave others less well protected. More Paid-for pensions service criticised \nAs of July 3, pensioners drawing an income from an annuity will have 100 per cent of the value of their annuity covered if their insurer goes bust. \nIn contrast, savers in drawdown, where retirement funds are kept invested, have a weaker safety net if the same insurer went bust. \nDrawdown products, which have become more popular since new pension freedoms came into force in April, are covered only up to a maximum of £50,000, exposing investors to big cuts if their funds are above this level. \n“Our analysis of data from the Association of British Insurers shows that the average pot used to buy an income drawdown product last year was £66,000, and as high as £79,000 between January and March 2014,” said Which? \n“However, these products are only covered by the FSCS up to a maximum of £50,000, depending on the type of investments held, so on average £16,000 of each pension pot wasn’t protected last year if the provider went bust but this could have been as much as £29,000.” \nAccording to government data about 130,000 people will access their pension through income drawdown every year, meaning many will be accessing their pension flexibly , but without the same protection as other products, said Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?. \n“Pensioners now have more freedom over how to access their savings, but the level of protection varies considerably depending on the product they choose,” said Mr Lloyd. \n“People save hard for retirement all their lives and need to know their money is safe if their provider goes bust. The regulators must keep up with the reforms and increase the FSCS coverage for drawdown products as they have with annuities.” \nAccording to the ABI’s most recent statistics the number of income drawdown contracts sold by ABI members during the first quarter of 2015 increased 64 per cent over the past year, from 6,700 to 11,500. \nIn contrast, the number of annuities sold continued to fall, with 20,600 annuities sold during the quarter, compared with 28,700 the previous quarter and 74,100 in the first quarter of 2014. \nSome of the country’s leading pension providers said it made sense to improve protections for drawdown customers, so they were not at a disadvantage. \n“The lower level of protection offered in drawdown is a concern, given that many are choosing to put their money into drawdown rather than low interest yielding cash account,” said Ray Chinn, head of pensions at LV=. \n“There is a danger that this may deter people from selecting an income solution that could help them make more of the pension pot they have spent years building, or may present additional risk that pension savers are not aware of when selecting a drawdown solution.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
