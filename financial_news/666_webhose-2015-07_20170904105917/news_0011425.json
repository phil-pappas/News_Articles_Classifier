The reason being that the Finance Ministry is not giving them the budget allocations for them to carry out their mandate. For me it is a sabotage on what government is doing with the resources,” Mr Tetteh Chaie lamented. \nPIAC’s financial situation was too dire that its officials were nearly thrown out of their office at Asylum Down in 2014 because they could not pay for their rent. \nVice Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee Samuel Atta Akyea says the committee will haul the Finance Minister to answer how the oil revenue was spent and why PIAC is being starved of funds. \nHe said “we don’t have transparency and accountability. We do not know whether the revenue from the oil sector is being misapplied. We cannot even be sure. And therefore we need to push the government to come clean on this matter. We will haul the Finance Minister before the house to divulge how monies are being applied relating to petroleum revenue.” \nHe alleged PIAC is not being resourced so that it would not have the capacity to do it work well “in order not to bring out the rot” in the management of the oil revenue. \nPIAC, he said, has now been reduced to doing analyses in the office because it cannot go to the fields to establish proof of any projects executed with money accrued from oil. \nBut the Chairman of the Finance Committee, James Avedzi suggests PIAC must engage the Finance Ministry to get funds to operate while the amended Petroleum Revenue Management Act, which will now cater for its funding, takes effect in 2016. \nHe also admitted that PIAC is not the only institution struggling to raise funds from the Finance Ministry, explaining it is not because the ministry is refusing to release funds, but funds are not available .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T03:59:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
