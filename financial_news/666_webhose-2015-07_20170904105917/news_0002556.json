Let's pretend you guys don't know about it,\" said Joe, revealing a trick that obviously works well for the coalition cabinet.\n\"I think it (the tax structure) is appalling,\" added our Treasurer, demonstrating that he knew the difference between a sanger and a tax dodge.\nFor the record Joe, just a few months ago a report by British MPs accused PwC of promoting tax avoidance \"on an industrial scale.\"\nPwC represented most of the top 100 Australian listed businesses, including Macquarie Group and AMP, which were named in the so-called Luxembourg leaks.\nThe documents revealed how hundreds of Australian and foreign companies had cut secret deals with Luxembourg to save billions in tax.\nBut aside from that, the audience of PwC partners would have been befuddled by all this talk of foreign snacks.\nMax the Tax To be fair, PwC has been very generous to local tax authorities with the advice it has given on at least one occasion.\nOne of the crucial acts in Gina Rinehart 's battle to retain control of the multi billion dollar family trust - which was meant to vest to her children in 2011 - was the tax advice given by PwC. It was put before the kids as proof that vestment would trigger a tax liability that would \"lead to the bankruptcy of each beneficiary\".\nIt was used as justification to delay vestment by roughly half a century.\nAs the recent judgment on the legal battle said of the episode: \"[Rinehart] has demonstrated a willingness and ability to influence an organisation that one would otherwise expect to be independent - PricewaterhouseCoopers - to provide an advice in respect of CGT [capital gains tax] on an assumption about vesting, which was contrary to the advice already obtained, and to 'sanitise' a version of its advice for provision to the beneficiaries.\"\nReverse gear Just as well ANZ's chief teller Mike Smith is in India opening a bank branch this week.\nHis babu's back at the bank's HQ appear to have taken a slightly different tack to their maharajah on the subject of negative gearing.\nIn a submission to a parliamentary inquiry on home ownership, ANZ's submission plays down the case for any changes to the tax break for loss-making landlords, citing a Treasury paper which argued that the generous concessions on capital gains are to blame, not borrowing.\nBack in May, this certainly wasn't the tack being taken by Smith who said negative gearing should be on the table.\n\"People's behaviour is driven by the environment in which they operate,\" he said.\n\"If you have a structure which encourages borrowing, and in fact discourages saving, which is what we do have in this country, then it's hard to complain about the behaviour that results.\n\"I think the issue of negative gearing is something that does need further discussion but I think you can't do it individually, you have to look at it in the context of the overall tax system.\"\nPoles apart NSW Premier, Mike Baird played a pretty safe gig at the CEDA lunch in Sydney on Thursday, riffing on his love of Cold Chisel, Jack Johnson and baseball (he knows what a Golden Sombrero is - whatever that is).\nThe closest he got to controversy was telling the audience how perplexed his daughter was when her Facebook page was being overrun by 'poles and wires' posts around election time.\nThat wouldn't even frighten the gnomes from UBS, who were conspicuous by their absence.\nCommonwealth Bank veteran, Kelly Bayer Rosmarin , chaired the proceedings.\nWatching from the audience was Snowy Hydro boss, Paul Broad , ASIC deputy Peter Kell , Perennial boss John Murray , and BT's Crispin Murray . The former member for Bass, the Hon Warwick Smith , was also in attendance wearing his ANZ hat.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:47:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
