The government puts Angola's total reserves at just under 13 billion barrels.\nOperators will need to work with Angolan companies as the government seeks to increase local ownership of its resources.\nSeven of the new blocks are in the Kwanza basin and three in the Congo Basin.\nAngola currently produces around 1.7 million barrels per day of crude oil from large offshore fields developed by oil majors, including Chevron, Total, Exxon and BP.
