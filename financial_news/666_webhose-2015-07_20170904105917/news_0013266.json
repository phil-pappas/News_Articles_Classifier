We expect to have a resolution in the near term,” said John Martin, a managing partner with the Antares unit.\nGE cannot force asset sales in the SSLP: Both GE and ARCC have 50% veto power on any new investment or sale, according to KBW and Wells Fargo research.\nFrom now until closing, expected in the third quarter, the SSLP will continue to make investments, and Ares and CPPIB will have the opportunity to work together, but if Ares and CPPIB can’t reach an agreement to partner on the fund, GE said it will keep its stake and move ahead with an orderly wind-down. The average maturity of investments in the SSLP is 4.3 years.\nOf the $9.6 billion, GE holds $7.6 billion in senior notes priced at L+425, while ARCC has $2 billion in equity that returns about 13.25%, according to analysts. ARCC and GE split deal-origination fees equally. The fund mainly makes unitranche or senior-stretch loans, which have an average interest rate of 6.9%.\nIn a May 5 research note, Wells Fargo’s Jonathan Bock outlined how attractive the SSLP proves for a potential partner. Under one scenario that would keep the current 13.5% equity return, a preferred buyer would need to write a $2.4 billion check and be willing to receive a 7.28% return. The preferred investment would have 24% of equity behind it. That’s favorable to recent BBB CLO notes that have priced around L+370, with roughly 15% of credit protection behind them, Bock notes.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T06:58:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
