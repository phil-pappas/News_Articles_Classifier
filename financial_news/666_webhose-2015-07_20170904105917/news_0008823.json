Gas supplies were cut on July 3 and there was no indication when they would resume, he said. \n\"Our plant and other systems are in good health but we've had to shut down due to an unplanned disruption in supplies from the FPSO (floating, production, storage and offloading vessel),\" Yankey said. \nTullow did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThe Chinese-built, $750 million Atuabo gas facility in western Ghana processes around 100 million standard cubic feet of gas daily to feed nearby thermal power generators run by the country's main power utility. \nThe plant's construction was a crucial part of a government strategy to ease a chronic energy shortage that has contributed to a slowing of the economy. \nTullow holds a 35.48 percent stake in the Jubilee field. The other stakeholders are the state-owned Ghana National Petroleum Corporation with 13.64 percent, Kosmos Energy (NYSE: KOS - news ) with 24.08 percent, Anadarko Petroleum Corp with 24.08 percent, and Sabre/PetroSA with 2.73 percent.
