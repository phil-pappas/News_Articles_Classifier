But when it did on Saturday, it drew sharp criticism from teachers as well as other labor leaders.\nThe problem, Politico writes, was the timing given Clinton rival Bernie Sanders’ surge in popularity. Labor leaders said there was a clear understanding that before July 30, no national unions would make an endorsement. All of the Democratic candidates will have an hour-long interview that day at AFL-CIO headquarters. Labor leaders described the AFT’s move as “an insult,” when so many harbor lingering concerns about the subject of international trade and plan to press their issues in two weeks. AFT’s president, Randi Weingarten, is a longtime Clinton friend and donor, and defended the endorsement.\nWall Street bets on Bush, Clinton: Wall Street opened its wallet for Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush and for Democrat Hillary Clinton in their first weeks as candidates, despite the sometimes tough talk on the campaign trail about closing the country’s wealth gap. Bush’s haul includes nearly $145,000 from employees of Goldman Sachs and almost $167,000 from seven other big banks, according to The Wall Street Journal. Clinton, meanwhile, collected about $300,000 from employees at the nation’s six largest banks, with about $88,000 coming from Morgan Stanley executives alone.\n‘Billionaires for Bernie’: Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator challenging Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, wants to extract big-money influence from politics. And yet at least one Sanders supporter seemed to miss that point, filing a super PAC called “Billionaires for Bernie” with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday. The Washington Post writes Los Angeles lawyer Eric Jacobson will have to change the group’s name since unaffiliated PACs aren’t permitted to bear the name of the candidate. But Jacobson, a self-described progressive, is now scouting for billionaires to donate to the cause.\nTrump’s one target: There’s a growing subject of speculation in Jeb Bush’s world: How Donald Trump will present himself in the first Republican presidential candidates’ debate on Aug. 6. “Trump has one target and one target only,” an adviser to a rival GOP candidate told Politico. “He’s going to bring a lawn mower for Bush.” But if Trump is a danger for Bush, some close to the former governor say he also presents an opportunity. The debate will give Bush a national platform to take on Trump in strong terms and present himself as a mature, substantive leader who rises above toxic discourse.\nDetour on highway funding: The House passed a five-month extension of highway funding on Wednesday, acting before the federal Highway Trust Fund goes broke on July 31. But the Senate, writes the Huffington Post, still has other plans . Senate Republicans continue to press for a long-term fix, one that would supply the fund through next year’s election or beyond. The Senate will take an initial vote on highway funding Thursday.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/unions-seethe-over-early-clinton-endorsement-120206.html?hp=t2_r", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/07/15/theres-a-new-super-pac-for-bernie-sanders-it-wants-billionaire-donors/?tid=hpModule_f8335a3c-868c-11e2-9d71-f0feafdd1394&hpid=z8", "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/bush-girds-for-debate-smackdown-with-trump-120179.html?hp=t4_r", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-highway-trust-fund-vote_55a6cfe8e4b0c5f0322c4ad1?utm_hp_ref=politics"], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T16:42:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
