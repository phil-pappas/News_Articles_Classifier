It is a simple, efficient and short term instrument that allows retail investors to trade all the asset classes (equities, bonds, indices and commodities). It is a new way of trading financial markets is for new traders who are looking for a simple to understand way of increasing the value of their investments. It is known as binary options trading and provides traders with the opportunity to make quick profits on financial markets even if the price of the underlying asset of the option is not moving much.What is a binary option?A binary option is a financial instrument with a payoff that is limited to only 2 alternatives; this is why they are called \"binary\": either you chose the correct scenario and you cash in an amount of money that was predefined at the time you opened the position, either you chose the wrong scenario and you lose your initial investment.How do binary options work? As explained above, a binary option is an option for which the two possible outcomes are known before you open the position: either you make a profit of Y or you lose X (X being your invested cash amount). You chose a scenario on the relevant asset (do you think the asset price will go up or down?) for a determined time horizon (30 seconds, 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day...). At maturity (at the end of the selected time horizon) you look at the realized scenario. If your scenario was that the asset price would go up and it realizes than you make a profit of Y, if the asset price went down you loose X.The importance of trading with a regulated binary options brokerA regulated broker is a company that provides online binary options trading services and that has been granted an operating trading license by one of the main European financial regulator and that has to comply with strict restrictive rules imposed by the latter.
