The count stood at 76 on Tuesday, near where it has been for several weeks.\nThe rig count is tabulated daily by the state's Department of Mineral Resources (DMR), North Dakota's oil regulator. Field inspectors upload data to servers in Bismarck, which aggregates the data and automatically publishes it to a public website every day.\nThe DMR website also provides in-depth data on the depth and length of the state's nearly 15,000 wells, as well as oil production history. A mapping function graphically shows much of this data, including the location of each drilling rig operating in the state.\n\"We're hoping to get power back soon to the servers, but we're just not sure on timing,\" said Alison Ritter, a DMR spokeswoman.\nMDU Resources Group, which owns the utility for the region, reported that a problem at a substation in northern Bismarck cut electricity to an unknown number of customers. Crews arrived on the scene at roughly 8:30 a.m. local time (1330 GMT) to assess damage, said Rick Matteson, an MDU spokesman.\n\"They're not sure what the problem is and they don't as yet have an estimate for a restoration time,\" Matteson said.\nUtility customers reported waits of more than 90 minutes to contact MDU's customer service line.\nNorth Dakota produces roughly 1.2 million barrels of oil per day, according to the latest monthly report from the DMR.\nProduction statistics for May are scheduled to be released on Friday.
