A year earlier, the foreclosure-inventory rate was 1.7%.\n“With 3 million jobs created during the past year, the improving labor market has helped more borrowers stay current on their mortgage loan,” said Frank Nothaft, CoreLogic’s chief economist.\nForeclosures were completed on about 41,000 homes in May, down 19% from a year earlier and 65% from a peak, which was hit in 2010.\nMore jobs aren’t the only factor behind families avoiding foreclosure. Climbing home prices are helping, too. As property values rise, struggling owners gain equity, enabling them to sell their homes without taking a loss and move to more affordable places.\nThe passage of time is also behind improving foreclosure trends. It’s been about nine years since the housing bubble burst, and the pool of troubled properties has narrowed.\nCoreLogic The share of mortgaged homes in each state in the foreclosure process. New Jersey had the highest rate, at 4.9% in May. However, there are still elevated levels of distressed homeowners in the U.S., especially in certain areas. May’s 41,000 completed foreclosures were about double the monthly average of 21,000 in the years leading up to the bust.\nStates with the highest share of mortgaged properties in the foreclosure process in May were New Jersey, at 4.9%; New York, at 3.7%; and Florida, at 2.9%. Each of these markets is a “judicial” state, meaning that lenders must submit delinquency records to courts to move forward with the foreclosure process. Involving the courts tends to lead to longer foreclosure time lines and can upwardly skew data, CoreLogic noted.\nDon’t miss: An inside look at Manhattan’s emerging Billionaire’s Row\nJust five states, including Nevada and Florida, account for almost one-third of negative equity in the U.S. CoreLogic Meanwhile, certain markets that were hit particularly hard when the bubble burst make up a disproportionately large share of troubled homeowners. Just five states, including the likes of Nevada and Florida, account for almost one-third of negative equity in the U.S., according to another CoreLogic report. Negative equity means that a borrower owes more on a mortgage that a property is worth.\nRead more: Here’s why mortgage modifications have changed dramatically in last year\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T16:28:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
