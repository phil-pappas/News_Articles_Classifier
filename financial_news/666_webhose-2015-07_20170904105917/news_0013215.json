That compared with a profit of C$211 million, or 14 Canadians cents per share, in the second quarter of 2014, when the company was hit with impairment charges related to its Joslyn project and other assets.\nOutput from Suncor's northern Alberta operations rose 12 percent to 423,800 barrels per day, mainly due to less unplanned maintenance activity in the quarter.\nCash costs for Suncor's oil sands operations fell to C$28.00 per barrel from C$34.10 in the year-prior quarter, due to the positive impact of increased production, as well as lower natural gas prices and cost reduction initiatives.\nOverall, Suncor produced a total 559,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 8 percent from 518,400 in the second quarter of 2014.\nCash flow, a key indicator of the company's ability to pay for new projects and drilling, fell to C$2.16 billion, or C$1.49 per share, down from C$2.4 billion, or C$1.64, a year ago.\n(Reporting by Julie Gordon ; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T04:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T04:18:26.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
