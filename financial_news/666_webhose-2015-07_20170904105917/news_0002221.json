On Thursday, Mattel investors will get their first glimpse on how the company has implemented such goals. \nHeadwinds for Mattel, however, include a strong dollar and a continued sales slump for its core brands, which are down about 6% in the last four quarters. \nHere’s what investors can expect: \nEarnings: Mattel is expected to report a loss of 4 cents a share in the quarter, versus as gain of 3 cents a share a year ago, according to analysts polled by FactSet. \nRevenue: The toy maker is seen hitting sales of $995 million, according to FactSet. That would contrast with sales of $1.06 billion in the year-ago quarter. \nShare price: The analysts surveyed by FactSet have an average price target of $28.78 on Mattel, which represents 11% upside from Monday’s close. Shares have lost 16% so far this year, which contrasts with gains of 2.4% for the S&P 500 Index. SPX, +0.45% \nOther issues: Mattel’s cash position and how the Barbie line is doing are foremost for investors, said Steph Wissink, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. \nThey will want to know whether their dividend is secure and whether a upward sales trend for the Barbie brand has held from a second consecutive quarter after several months of declines. \nInvestors will also brace for potential bad news about some of the other lines. That includes some shakiness for Mattel’s American Doll line, Wissnik said. The pricey, large-sized dolls and their endless accessories have gained plenty of cheaper competitors. \nInvestors will also want to hear how brand messaging is improving and whether a “cohesive storytelling” across brands has helped retail sales, said Jaime Katz, an analyst with Morningstar. \n“With a refocus on core brands (like Fisher Price and Barbie) we would like to hear about how initiatives are being implemented now that management changes have occurred and what the layout for the remainder of the year might look like,” he said.
