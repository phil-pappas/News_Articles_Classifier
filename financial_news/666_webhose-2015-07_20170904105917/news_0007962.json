Robert Shakespeare by Michael Smith and Perry Williams It was a nail-biting moment for Matt Bekier as he paced the floor of his office in Sydney's The Star casino on Monday afternoon.\nBelow, the sun was setting over Darling Harbour and the construction crews working on James Packer's new casino tower across the water were packing up for the night.\nBekier knew journalists had been called to the Queensland government's Executive Building in Brisbane for the long-awaited decision on its $2 billion-plus Queen's Wharf project.\nIt was the moment the Echo Entertainment chief executive and a project team of almost 100 had been working towards for 18 months. But with only minutes to go before the official announcement there had still been no tip-off they had won.\nWorse still, there was a rumour Crown boss James Packer, who was bidding against Echo, was flying back to Australia. Had his last-minute campaign to steal the prize from Echo worked?\nThen the phone rang.\nWith general counsel and company secretary Paula Martin by his side, a tense Bekier finally broke into a smile: Echo had won.\nWhile the odds favoured Echo from the beginning, the sense of relief was palpable.\n Echo and its Hong Kong partners had won the tender process to build Brisbane's most ambitious infrastructure project in years. The site, which will encompass Echo's existing Treasury casino, stretches over 10 blocks of prime riverside land and will reshape Brisbane's CBD.\nIt includes a casino, a sky deck with restaurants and bars, the Ritz-Carlton and Rosewood hotels, a riverfront moonlight cinema and an underground shopping mall. Analysts estimate Echo's share of the capital needed will be about $1 billion.\nThe decision marked a turning point in Echo's four-year rollercoaster ride since its spin-off from parent Tabcorp in 2011. It was also a sweet victory against Packer, who in 2013 won an aggressive campaign to break Echo's casino monopoly in Sydney.\nLittle time to celebrate But there was little time to celebrate.\nThe champagne stayed on ice as Bekier flew to Brisbane that evening ahead of a 10am press conference with Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. Other Echo executives remained in Pyrmont briefing dozens of analysts and investors hungry for details of how it had played its winning hand.\nIt was a crucial win for Echo, which has staged a turnaround under Bekier's watch, and secures its dominant position in Queensland, which will compete with Macau and Singapore to lure wealthy Asian gamblers to Australia.\n\"Echo went through a difficult period but I'm delighted to see the company is now realising its potential,\" says former Echo chairman John Story, breaking a long silence to praise his former company's success.\n\"That the value in the Star [casino] has been realised, that the redevelopment of Jupiters on the Gold Coast is proceeding and that the opportunity has been grasped and won in Brisbane. The outlook for the company at the moment is very positive,\" he tells AFR Weekend .\nStory, who was chairman of Tabcorp before it was split into separate casino and gaming businesses in 2011, was the highest profile casualty of the Sydney casino wars three years earlier after rejecting Packer's proposed joint-venture with Crown.\nBut while all the attention was on Sydney at the time, the genesis of Echo's interest in Brisbane's Queen's Wharf was sparked under Story's reign when high flying US executive Larry Mullin was boss.\nIn late 2011 Echo proposed a major redevelopment of its dated and heritage-listed Treasury casino to Anna Bligh's Labor government, receiving a reasonable reception.\nThat encouraged Echo and its advisers to unleash a \"big picture\" master plan.\nBy the time Liberal Campbell Newman had replaced Bligh in March 2012, Echo's redevelopment had morphed into a 30-storey, 400-room hotel and gaming room on top of the neo-Italianate Treasury building.\nSources close to Echo recall the then Public Works Minister Bruce Flegg being horrified at the scale of the development on top of one of the city's most prized historic buildings.\nUnder attack By August 2013, Echo's tired Treasury building was under attack from Newman.\n\"They seem to be trying to say to people 'let us keep the monopoly',\" Newman said at the time. \"Why should they have an exclusive licence to print money essentially in the state of Queensland? Particularly when the venues, arguably, are not world standard.\"\nEcho boss John Redmond, a former Las Vegas casino operator who replaced Mullin at the start of 2013, realised it was time for a different course of action.\n\"From that point on we knew we needed a major rethink of our plans,\" says an Echo source. \"It couldn't be a tacked on building. It needed to be a much grander vision which all of Brisbane could buy into.\"\nBy December Newman and his deputy Jeff Seeney had developed a compromise: the government would sanction a second casino licence in Brisbane to an operator that could also reshape the five block wide Queen's Wharf site.\nWhile Echo had the upper hand as the incumbent, positioning itself as the winner was a long and complex process, with 26 companies showing early interest in competing for the tender. Crown's competing bid ramped up the pressure on Echo, which could not afford to cede territory to its billionaire head a second time round, to come up with a bid that was commercially viable but was the also most attractive to the public.\nA key factor in Echo's winning bid was finding the right partners and structure for its joint venture. Echo talked to more than 20 potential partners around the world, including Chinese property developer Greenland, which eventually teamed up with Crown.\nEcho needed partners with capital to develop the massive project, mixed-use development capabilities. In the end Hong Kong-based Chow Tai Fook and Far East Consortium stood out because of their tourism credentials in Asia.\nEcho is planning a celebratory dinner in Hong Kong within the next few weeks with tycoon Henry Cheng, head of the powerful family dynasty behind the Chow Tai Fook empire.\nBekier and strategy guru Harry Theodore are also expected to make the trip.\nBig hospitality building experience Echo chairman John O'Neill and other senior executives first met Cheng around the time when they signed the joint venture, often meeting in the Hong Kong office tower where Chow Tai Fook is based. Cheng and O'Neill also dined together at the prestigious private members' Dynasty Club in Hong Kong.\nThey liked Chow Tai Fook's experience building big hospitality businesses in China, hotels globally and in loyalty programs. Chief executive Patrick Tsang was heavily involved in the Brisbane process. There were also regular meetings with Far East's senior executives, including David Chiu.\nOnce the partners were in place and announced in June, Echo assembled a 100-strong army of advisers, consultants and architects.\nFormer Queensland premier Rob Borbidge and former Queensland Labor Party treasurer Damian Power were part of the lobbying effort, while Macquarie advised on the deal.\nMany on the Echo team were Queensland locals on the ground in Brisbane. Echo conducted focus groups and an extensive community consultation process. It knew community support for a project that was going to transform the city's CBD was going to be a deciding factor in the process.\nA war room was established in Echo's offices in the Treasury building, with the heavy-lifting taking place in the lead up to late October last year when about 500 pages of documents detailing every aspect of the bid had to be submitted to the government working group overseeing the process. This was followed by regular meetings to negotiate contractual documents and tweak and negotiate elements of the bid\n\"It was an intensive period,\" one source says.\nEverything was going to plan, but a change of government in Queensland in January took everyone by surprise and sparked fears it would delay the process. They needn't have worried. While there was speculation the Newman government had received a report recommending Echo's proposal, executives at the company never saw it and say they never assumed they had it in the bag.\nWhile final bids were submitted in May this year, that was not the end of the process. Both parties were allowed to submit tweaks and \"clarifications\" to existing bids.\nIt gave Crown time for an 11th-hour push to get its bid across the line with financial incentives to boost state coffers – including a poker machine buyback scheme. It meant nothing was certain.\nPublic lobbying banned It all played out behind closed doors, unlike Sydney where Packer spearheaded a public campaign. The Queensland government ran an extremely clean process that meant Echo and Crown were banned to publicly lobby.\nThe relief experienced in Bekier's office on Monday night was reflected in a rally in Echo shares to an all-time high of $5.07 when trading resumed the next morning, further rewarding Echo investors who have hung in for the ride.\nPerpetual, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and high conviction fund VGI Partners have all made substantial profits after fighting off plenty of Echo critics in the past three years.\nPerpetual bought into the stock after the Tabcorp split in 2011 and over several years built up a 10 per cent stake in the company, including part of Packer's share when he sold out.\nAfter winning permission to go above the 10 per cent cap, Perpetual owned 122 million shares or nearly 15 per cent of the company. Echo's share price then was $2.73, making its stake worth $333 million. The share price now is $4.86 putting the value at $595 million, but Perpetual have sold steadily on the way up and now have a holding of just under 5 per cent.\nPrivate high-conviction fund VGI Partners took a 3 per cent stake in Echo in March last year, and told its private investors at the time that Echo was the \"cheapest casino stock in the developed world\". It purchased 25 million shares in the company at an average price of about $2.30, more than doubling its money.\nBack in Brisbane there was finally time for a drink on Wednesday evening when O'Neill toasted directors gathered for a celebratory dinner in Treasury casino's private Surveyors Room. But many of the executives present know the challenge now is executing the plan.\nWhile Echo had the winning hand in Brisbane, Crown and a string of international players like Genting Hong Kong also have big plans to tap into Australia's potential as a drawcard for Asian high-rollers.
