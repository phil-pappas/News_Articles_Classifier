Getty Images by Alan Mitchell Regardless of the antagonists' claims, Greece's referendum was never designed to be the final word in whether they stayed in the eurozone.\nAnd nor should it have been. It was too entangled with the negotiating game.\nMany of the Greeks who voted no would have been merely responding to their prime minister's need for more bargaining leverage.\nIn any case, there were many more steps to go and, given time, it is likely a large majority of Greeks will want to stay in the currency union.\nThe incentives for the Greeks to leave the euro are not very great. Nor, for that matter, are the incentives for the other members of the euro area to push Greece out.\nFor the Greeks, there is really no alternative to the reforms advocated by troika if they want to escape poverty.\nIf they renege on their debt and walk out of the currency area, they will be rid of their debt. But, in truth, they don't have that much of a debt burden now, even though their government's debt is a massive 180 per cent of gross domestic product.\nMost debt eventually written off That's because the country's official creditors have reduced the debt servicing burden by pushing the debt repayments out into the future.\nAs was obvious even before the International Monetary Fund published last week's review of the Greek economy, a very large part of the debt eventually will be formally written off.\nFor now, the bargaining between Greece and its eurozone creditors need only be about an affordable rate of debt servicing.\nWhat's \"affordable\" gets back to the issue of economic reform.\nGreece's unresolved problem is its lack of competitiveness.\nIn the short term, the Greeks can increase its competitiveness by taking more real wage cuts. They can take those real wage cuts in the form of nominal wage cuts if they stay in euro area or via a depreciation of the drachma if they leave the euro.\nA drachma depreciation would be quicker and easier, but the necessary sustained reduction in real wages would be similar.\nWay out: increase productivity The way out of that poverty – inside or outside the euro – is to increase productivity.\nUnfortunately, that involves more painful economic reform. But putting off reform is painful too. It means Greece has to rely more heavily, for longer, on measures to suppress demand.\nGreece has pushed its budget back into primary balance and improved its current account balance by 12 per cent of GDP since 2009, but to do that it has contracted its economic output by a huge 22 per cent.\nAs the IMF's Wojciech Maliszewski noted, Spain, Portugal and Ireland had been more successful than Greece in stimulating exports while avoiding a collapse in economic output.\nAccording to Maliszewski, the difference was only partly because of Greece's larger initial competitiveness problem. It was also because Greece had done less to reform its economy.\nIt's a complicated story. Greece has done a good deal to reform its labour market, and nominal wages have fallen dramatically. On the measure that uses relative labour costs, Greece's competitiveness improved enormously.\nThe problem was that the cuts in labour costs did not turn into more competitive prices. That, the IMF says, was because Greece had not adequately reformed its product markets.\nCompetition policy reform This is what Australian readers know better as competition policy reform. As the barriers to competition are removed, the inefficient industries that were sheltering behind them contract, releasing capital and labour for use in more productive activities.\nWe have been at it, on and off, for decades and the Harper inquiry has just dumped another big \"to-do\" list on our lap.\nGreece also has been active in pursuing structural reform, and has achieved among the biggest improvements on the World Bank's Doing Business indicator in the years since the global financial crisis. But it is coming from the back of the pack, and it needs to be right at the front.\nIt is a painful process, in which unemployment initially rises. But as capital and labour are re-employed, productivity and output rises.\nOf course, it is a one-off gain. Beyond that, productivity growth is accelerated by innovation and technological advance.\nBut that too is driven by highly competitive product markets, in which investment in innovation and new technology is an essential part of survival.\nThat's what Greece needs, and it is why it joined the currency union in the first place.\nThe OECD's Adrian Blundell-Wignall will address the Australian Business Economists on The OECD Business and Finance Outlook:\nWhy Investors Need to Take Note .
