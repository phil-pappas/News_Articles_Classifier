It's irrational,\" Haun said. \nThe merged company will be 50 percent owned by the French government through GIAT Industries and 50 percent by the Bode (Shenzhen: 300023.SZ - news ) -Wegmann family, which owns KMW. \nA new holding company will have its headquarters in the Netherlands but the operating bases will remain in Germany and France, Haun said. The supervisory board will be made up of seven people, he said, among them two named by the French state, two named by Wegmann and three independents, who should not be from either France or Germany, he said. \nKMW and Nexter each employ more than 3,000 people worldwide. KMW supplies wheeled and tracked fighting vehicles to 30 nations and expects sales of 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in 2016, while Nexter is a maker of systems, ammunition and equipment with sales of 1.05 billion euros last year. \nWestern competitors on world military hardware markets include Britian's BAE, maker of the Challenger tank, and General Dynamics of the United States, which makes the Abrams.
