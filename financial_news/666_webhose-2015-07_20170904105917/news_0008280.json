PUBLISHED: 17:44, Mon, Jul 27, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:52, Mon, Jul 27, 2015 GETTY Property debt in Britain has reached £1trillion \nExperts said that homeowners are living in a false sense of security that could quickly be erased when mortgage repayment costs increase due to Bank of England action.Despite an increase in overall property debt, the amount of people describing mortgages or similar as a heavy burden had dropped from 11.3 per cent in 2010 to 10.6 per cent in 2012, according to data released today by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Yet, they could find that they are in for a shock when rates interest rise, which some experts believe could happen as early as November.The likelihood of a rate hike this year increased when Bank of England Governor Mark Carney last week said he expects rates to grow to 2.5 per cent over the next two or three years. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, said: \"There is a real risk that after more than six years of record low interest rates, many mortgage payers are still living in a false sense of security. \"The reality is that they may have a very short window in which to prepare for coming hikes in interest rates.“Households urgently need to conduct a financial healthcheck to make sure they will be able to cope with higher costs – be they higher mortgage payments or higher interest payments on outstanding balances on credit cards and personal loans.“We should be particularly concerned about younger homeowners, many of whom have never experienced a rate rise, as well as mortgage payers who are currently out of work or on income-related benefits.\" Related articles REVEALED: How a French bank's savings rate hailed as 'breath of... \nOverall household debts were found to have grown to £104billion, with one in five homes describing money owed as a heavy burden, showed the ONS data. The country's lowest earners are struggling the most, with these families five times more likely to say financial commitments are a heavy burden than the highest earners. Households in the South East have taken on the highest amount of debt estimated at £4,591 each, whereas those in Wales have the smallest amount at £1,900. But those in London are most likely to feel the strain of borrowing, while those in the West Midlands and Scotland were the least likely to feel that their debts were a problem. The data also showed how the debts of young people have soared in the four years after the economic crisis to 2012.People aged 16-24 now have the highest share of financial debt at a median average of £3,000, more than double just four years previously, according to the ONS. However, those aged 35-44 were under the greatest pressure from their debts and most likely to describe them as a heavy burden.
