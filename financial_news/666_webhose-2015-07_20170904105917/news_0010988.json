It's volatile in all its forms whether it's by truck, by rail, by pipeline. It really does endanger the health and safety of communities, the health of ecosystems, especially here in the Champlain Valley Region, but also, very importantly, at the points of extraction,\" McCumbert said.\nTom Evslin is the CEO of NG Advantage, a Colchester-based company that sells and delivers compressed natural gas. He says the truck was on its way to Ticonderoga, New York.\n\"I got a call that one of our trucks had been stopped, and then a few minutes later that somebody had irresponsibly chained themselves to it,\" Evslin said.\nHe says the protest not only slowed business, but more importantly created a safety risk.\n\"Look where it is. This is on the approach to a bridge. This is a truck carrying flammable fuels. It's a safer fuel than oil or propane, but it's still a flammable fuel. And to stop it in a traffic lane is incredibly irresponsible,\" Evslin said.\nEvslin told WCAX News that fuels carried in the company's trucks displace 2,000 gallons of fracked oil, and every truckload eliminates 1,600 pounds of CO2.\nBut that's not stopping protesters. The demonstration was part of a day of action across the region.\nIn Williston Tuesday, protesters attempted to stop construction on Phase One of the Vermont Gas natural gas pipeline.\n\"And whether it's pipelines like we have here or oil trains or gas trucks or the proposed electric transmission line, we really just can't be complicit in the continue destruction of our communities and our ecosystems,\" said Sara Mehalic of Rising Tide Vermont.\n\"We have the legal permits to build this clean energy project that going to bring natural gas benefits and the choice of natural gas to even more Vermonters. And the company does not condone anything that puts our folks at risk or even these trespassers at risk. This is an active work zone and what's happening now is not safe,\" said Beth Parent of Vermont Gas.\nAt the Champlain Bridge, traffic was down to one lane for more than an hour before troopers moved in to make arrests. Police say they arrested Damien Gabriel, who was chained to the truck in Addison. Four others were arrested there and four more in Williston.\nProtesters also held a symbolic train blockade in Ticonderoga, New York, in honor of the victims of the massive Quebec oil train explosion two years ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T04:25:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
