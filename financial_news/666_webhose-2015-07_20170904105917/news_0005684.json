She is licensed to practice law in Georgia and her firm is located in the metro Atlanta area.\nThe economic downturn and housing collapse have left many in dire straits and facing difficult decisions. Many see filing for bankruptcy as a final option, and one that is not preferred.\n“For example, many do not know that credit can rebound in a year, and the rebuilding process of reestablishing credit is not an insurmountable task. This webinar will answer this and other questions,” said Coleman.\nSome may be embarrassed or scared to admit filing bankruptcy. The stigma can ripple through friends and family, so the webinars offer a degree of anonymity for those who need answers. Anyone in Georgia but outside the immediate Atlanta area can also benefit from these webinars.\n“My practice is in Atlanta, but Atlanta is a very large place. Before making the drive and fighting the infamous traffic, I recommend watching the webinar. General questions can be answered,” said Coleman.\nAll bankruptcy cases are unique, so the information covered in the webinar is not a substitute for talking with an attorney nor should be considered to be entering into an attorney/client relationship.\nColeman offers a free initial consultation with anyone who still feels that bankruptcy is necessary. She strongly recommends watching the videos before scheduling a consultation.\nEnroll now for the free bankruptcy webinar on the website http://thecwlawfirm.com/events/\nColeman and Walton, LLP\nwww.thecwlawfirm.com\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
