Tomohiro Ohsumi Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires The Chinese sharemarket's slippery slope into bear market has turned some small cap companies into penny stocks, but even the country's most solid companies are not immune from the $3.5 trillion rout.\nThe bubble that was declared after the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 160 per cent in 18 months was largely attributed to fast and unsustainably rising small cap and tech stocks.\nBut the big players are no longer immune as the emergency measures don't work and the panic selling begins to spread to other Asian markets.\nThe CSI300 Index, which is a compilation of the 300 biggest market cap stocks on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, has also seen some massive hits. Just 8 stocks have recorded a gain in the past month, while two thirds of the index has shed 30 per cent or more of its value.\nHere are the top five stocks feeling the pain right now.\nChina Minmetals Rare Earth\nMargin trading was suspended in the mining company's stocks on June 30 after shares held by margin trading accounts hit 25 per cent of its market value. Its shares have lost the most value since the market began its plunge a month ago, down an astonishing 66 per cent to 13.60 yuan ($2.95) for a market cap of $13 billion yuan.\nNeusoft Corporation\n The IT solutions and service provider signed a deal on June 4 with US-based Sonic Foundry distribute its video creation software to the growing Chinese market, committing $3.1 million in revenue by the end of 2016. A week later, the stock became caught up in the correction, losing almost 64 per cent of its share value in a month.\nChina First Heavy Industries\nThe manufacturing company builds pressure vessels and steam generators for China's nuclear power systems. Its share price has fallen 63 per cent to 7.66 yuan, with a market cap of 50 billion yuan.\nTsinghua Tongfang Company\nBillionaire tech entrepreneur Zhao Weigou warned on May 30 that the tech industry in China had reached \"serious bubble\" territory amid surging valuations. He said in an interview that the valuations of China's chipmarkers were \"too expensive\" given the \"fierce\" industry competition, Bloomberg reported.\nMr Zhao has himself experienced a rapid rise, until two years ago the former goat herder was running an obscure state-owned company which has become the top microchip making company in the country, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nTsinghua Tongfang, a subsidiary of Tsinghua Unigroup, which has Mr Zhao as its chairman, has lost 63 per cent of its share value since June 8.\nLuxin Venture Capital Group\nIn May Bloomberg reported in May the VC firm stood to gain from mooted state-owned enterprise restructuring in China's Shangdong province, where Chinese authorities pledged to open up more SOEs to mixed ownership.\nThe eight stocks that have defied the market include companies which have benefited from the Chinese government's moves to boost liquidity to keep the share market afloat. China CITIC Bank's shares have gained almost 30 per cent in the past five days alone, followed by the Bank of China, China Life Insurance and Petrochina, which have all recorded double-digit percentage growth.", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/shanghai_short_hype/index.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/chinese-stocks-hit-bear-territory-as-bubble-pops-20150626-ghyuj3.html"], "published": "2015-07-09T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:17:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
