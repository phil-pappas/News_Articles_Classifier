Feil and Alicia Feil Peterson of Coldwell Banker Legacy list another house that appeared in the series finale in Albuquerque’s North Valley for $2.65 million. That home is where the show’s main character, Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston, threatened his former business partner with two fake assassins. \n“Breaking Bad” follows former high school teacher Walter White as he manufactures meth with a former student, Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul. \nThe show ended in 2013, but tourism companies in Albuquerque still embrace the drug-addled series and give “Breaking Bad” tours showcasing spots made popular in the show. \nThe city’s visitors’ bureau even includes a map of the show’s famous locations on its website.
