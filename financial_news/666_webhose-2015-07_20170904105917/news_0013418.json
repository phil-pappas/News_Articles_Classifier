Jean-Paul Pelissier Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has given Greece a particularly blunt warning. It doesn't make sense for someone to commit suicide, he says, because of a fear of dying.\nIt's one more sign of how much of the smooth veneer and urbane language usually favoured by European leaders has cracked this week – yet another casualty of the debacle in Greece.\nThe Greeks might not see the choice quite so clearly as they line up to vote in a referendum this weekend. The strict wording of the vote – whether to accept the tough European terms of a deal to get access to more borrowed money – obscures the much broader significance of what's at stake.\nEuropean governments want this to be seen as a yes or no to Greece staying in the eurozone. That's why they want a yes vote, hoping that Greek voters' preference for remaining in the eurozone will lead them to take what's on offer, unpalatable as that is. But for Greeks, that still equates to accepting a slow economic death over potential suicide.\nSo the Greek government wants the vote to be merely another chance to renegotiate what was supposedly a final offer from its frustrated creditors – effectively to use the moral power of sovereign democracy to force better terms. That's why Alexis Tsipras is vehemently arguing for a no vote after infuriating his fellow eurozone leaders by unexpectedly calling a referendum.\nObviously, the two sides can't both be right. They can, however, both be very wrong. And that is the real conundrum for Greece. The only choice on July 5 is what appears likely to be the least disastrous option in a crisis dominated by too many shared mistakes, misjudgments and failed bluffs.\nDepression and continuing pain in an economy certain to spiral further down? Chaos and even sharper pain in an economy suddenly cut off from the European emergency drip?\nThe formal expiry of the European bail-out deal, Greece's default on the scheduled €1.5 billion ($2.1 billion) payment to the IMF due on June 30 and the refusal of the European Central Bank to extend more emergency liquidity to Greek banks are but the official framework of misery and confusion to come.\n The temporary closure of banks and desperate people milling around ATMs are the tip of a possible iceberg.\nMarkets at risk Faced with those nightmarish images of the future and memories of the past, Greeks may vote to accept the deal, against the government's urging. They might prefer to continue staggering along under the weight of reform and austerity, European-style.\nThat would make it hard for the left-wing Syriza party to continue in government, despite only being elected last January. But the deterioration in the economy since ensures any alternative government would find implementing reforms and cutting spending even harder than before Syriza came to power on a pledge of no more austerity.\nThe prospect of a no vote has just about everyone – although unsurprisingly not the Syriza government – predicting a \"Grexit\" and most likely the return of the drachma. That would seem to ensure social and economic disaster stalking the whole country, at least in the short term.\nIt obviously wasn't supposed to get down to this for Greece. Nor, even if it did, was the fate of Greece supposed to be important enough to destabilise the markets and other economies. A lack of financial contagion is still the optimistic operating assumption in other European capitals, bolstered by the ECB's belated willingness this year to pump as much money into the system as necessary.\nThe ASX certainly responded with insouciance to any threat on Wednesday. But no one can be sure of whether jittery market confidence will hold firm. Nor what a failing Greek state might do to the political stability of Europe, already unsettled by violent extremism, populist movements and the mass migration of refugees from other countries suffering political and economic upheaval.\nBoth China and the United States can agree on the strategy on this one issue at least. That is, forcing Greece out the eurozone is a very bad idea and the urgent need to do a deal to avoid this requires compromise from European governments and officials, as well as from Greece.\nBut the unrelenting attitude towards the Greek government in Europe is partly driven by the perceived need to avoid setting a precedent of rewarding populist resistance to reform. This is not just about political tensions within Germany and the reluctance of German taxpayers to continue supporting the hapless Greeks.\nThe conservative Rajoy government in Spain, for example, has managed a remarkable economic turnaround and hard-fought budget stability. This has come at a high cost to the population and to its own political appeal as it faces an election by year's end against a surging left-wing populist party, Podemos, which is effectively the Spanish version of Syriza. The last thing Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy needs is Alexis Tsipras being able to declare victory in escaping the fiscal straitjacket imposed by European creditors. This would also risk unsettling market confidence in backing Spain's ability to continue to borrow relatively cheaply to deliver on a combination of economic growth and reform.\nNow that the confrontation with Greece has become so public and so bitter, it makes it that much more difficult to follow the usual pattern of fudging the details and the more obvious contradictions.\nIn a diplomatic netherworld of European unity, it's not necessary to acknowledge that it is impossible for Greece to repay massive debts, for example. They just become \"restructured\", indefinitely delayed by repayment schedules of constantly recycled money and promises. It now seems too late – and too loud – to manage that political confidence trick any longer.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-07-01T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T19:35:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
