Our extensive pipeline system connects our West Texas Permian, southern Oklahoma, Granite Wash, Eaglebine and East Texas systems to our Nederland terminal and now will have enhanced capability to further deliver crude barrels eastward on the Bayou Bridge pipeline into Louisiana.” \nConstruction is underway on the Nederland to Lake Charles segment of the pipeline, which will be 30-inch diameter and is expected to begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2016. The companies will also launch a binding expansion open season to assess additional shipper interest for service with connectivity to existing terminal infrastructure and refineries in and around the St. James area. The results of the expansion open season will be used to determine the size of the pipeline to St. James, which has a forecasted in-service date of the second half of 2017. \nThe binding expansion open season will commence in the third quarter of 2015. Bona fide potential shippers that would like to receive copies of the expansion open season documents, the throughput and deficiency agreement, and proposed tariffs must first sign a confidentiality agreement. More information about the open season will be available on the ETP website at www.energytransfer.com/ops_lc_sj.aspx upon commencement of the open season or by email request to lc_sj@energytransfer.com . \nAbout Phillips 66 \nPhillips 66 is a diversified energy manufacturing and logistics company.
