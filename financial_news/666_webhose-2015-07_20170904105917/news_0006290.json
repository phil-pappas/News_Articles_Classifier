Questions are now being raised about the wisdom of such a sprawling business model, which seemingly discouraged insiders from raising problems before they turned into crises. \nNo, it’s not Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) , but the Japanese group Toshiba that has found itself in the spotlight for using accounting vagaries to flatter its operating profits that it made from selling everything from laptop speakers to nuclear equipment. \nToshiba’s chief executive and two of his predecessors have bowed out, apologising to the world for the second major accounting scandal to hit Japan in the space of four years. More than half of the board have now been felled by the Y151.8bn profit overstatement that can be traced as far back as 2008. \nThe bosses, under pressure from the global financial crisis and then the 2011 earthquake and subsequent Fukushima nuclear disaster, held back losses and impairments from the books in order to inflate profits and hit targets over seven years. The exaggeration was three times larger than Toshiba had first thought, an independent panel found on Tuesday. \n“That a company that represents Japan, to be doing something like this institutionally, was shocking,” said Koichi Ueda, the lawyer who led the panel investigating the firm’s practices. \nJapan, home to more than a tenth of the 2,000 largest companies on Fortune’s global index, was already searching for a way to improve corporate behaviour. before this latest scandal erupted. A £1.1bn boardroom cover-up at the camera-maker in Olympus that emerged in 2011 served to accelerate a government push to improve stewardship. \nToshiba president Hisao Tanaka arrives for a press conference at the company's headquarters on Tuesday \nThe Olympus scandal came to light when its then-boss Michael Woodford was dismissed from his post for daring to challenge his chairman about the practices - a move that was seen as evidence that he did not understand Japanese corporate culture. \nThe fraud at Olympus, like the problems at Toshiba, was not centred around directors trying to sneak bags of cash out of the firm for personal gain. Directors at Olympus were instead found to have covered up losses on ill-judged investments that had gone awry years earlier, by gradually taking them off the books as written-down goodwill to spare the firm’s reputation. The board, stacked with long-serving company men, did not challenge this behaviour; nor did the firms’ various accountants. Shareholder meetings were likened to Kabuki theatre by Mr Woodford, referring to the traditional Japanese charade. \nThis collision of scandal and corporate overhaul is peculiarly Japanese, as displayed by yesterday’s carefully-choreographed show of executives bowing in contrition. But it is a vivid example of how corporate governance, an abstract notion that often strays into dusty concepts and meaningless buzzwords, is wielded in the real world. \nShortly after the Olympus scandal emerged, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government drafted new rules on governance, as part of a much broader push at Japan’s moribund economy. Since June 2015, large Japanese firms have had to appoint at least two independent directors to their boards, or explain why they failed to do so. \nAll of which is encouraging, although as Toshiba’s outgoing boss Hisao Tanaka said yesterday, problems of this sort cannot be solved overnight. \nToshiba already had four external directors, including two former diplomats with global experience, before yesterday’s clearout. The average age of a director was 63, and just one of the 16-strong board was a woman. This is an above-average showing in a country with the worst boardroom diversity in the industrialised world. \nChange could also come from Japan Inc’s increasingly vocal shareholder base. Toshiba investors have seen their shares lose a fifth of their value since the accounting probe was announced in May, even if they did enjoy a 6pc rally yesterday. \nAfter the revelations at Olympus, investors lodged a $240m lawsuit relating to the accounting issues in 2012. That year, one frustrated investor in the banking group Nomura tabled a motion to change the firm’s name to Vegetable Holdings. The plan won support from 5.4pc of the shareholder base. \nActivist investors, comparatively rare in closely-held Japanese firms, have also been pushing for corporate overhauls. Daniel Loeb of Three Point sold out of Sony (Hanover: SON1.HA - news ) last year, booking a 20pc profit, after more than a year of agitating for job cuts and spin-offs. Yoshiaki Murakami, the man credited with making Japan’s first hostile takeover bid in 2000 , has recently returned to the market following a conviction in 2007 for insider trading. \nThe Japanese Exchange has also joined the fray, nudging companies into more profitable structures by creating a new index for firms with strong returns on equity and corporate governance. Toshiba’s main listing was dropped from the JPX-Nikkei 400 in last month’s reshuffle, in a move that analysts said could discourage overseas investors. \nWhether Toshiba can stop the rot and return to Japan’s new index for good-looking companies remains to be seen. That firms should be trying to reach that standard at all is no longer in doubt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T07:58:30.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
