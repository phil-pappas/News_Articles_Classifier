Bloomberg Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro Global investors have been in the brace position, waiting for the Federal Reserve to deliver on its much anticipated rate hike. Fed governors have been at pains to stress that the rise will be orderly and gradual, and for now the market appears to be buying that line.\nBut analysts at QIC's Global Liquid Strategies are contemplating a less orderly world where the major central banks are forced to hit the accelerator on the process of normalisation, which could inflict some major pain for holders of billions of dollars that remain long bonds.\nThey're arguing that \"term premia\" – the extra return investors require for the risk that interest rate moves could inflict losses on their bonds – will return to normal as forces that have contributed to lower yields are unwound.\nOne of the reasons they cite is \"peak foreign ownership\" in the major bond markets as central banks and sovereign wealth funds end a quarter-of-a-century-long accumulation of foreign currency reserves and begin to liquidate them.\nReuters data shows that Chinese foreign currency reserves peaked at about $US 4 trillion in June 2014 and have declined every quarter since, to $US3.7 trillion at June 2015. AFR This means that one of the largest bids in the multitrillion-dollar bond markets weakens, leading to rising yields and a return of the term premium.\nWhat has been behind this enormous multi-decade accumulation of bonds, largely US Treasuries, by governments and central banks?\nThe rise of China's export economy explains a large part. For years it has effectively invested foreign currency proceeds of exports into US treasuries, suppressing a rise in its currency, to keep its exports competitive.\nBut China's economy is evolving. The next phase of its developments requires an opening up of its capital markets and a loosening of control of its currency.\n There's evidence this process has begun. Reuters data shows that Chinese foreign currency reserves peaked at about $US4 trillion in June 2014 and have declined every quarter since, to $US3.7 trillion in June 2015.\nQIC's Katrina King said the data suggests China is drawing on reserves and selling down US treasuries. In addition to official figures declines are also observed in bond holdings in Belgium, where some experts believe China and other investors have recently moved their US bonds, she said.\n\"China is going to have to walk a hard line to defend its currency; if it does widen its band or moves to a more freely floating currency, that will have implications for global bonds markets, but also Australia,\" Ms King told The Australian Financial Review .\nAsian currency crisis There are other reasons aside from China's rise that have resulted in trillions of dollars of savings finding their way to the bond market. One is the Asian currency crisis of the late '90s that led emerging market nations to stockpile foreign currency assets in order to defend their currency if a crisis repeated.\nThen there are the petrodollars accumulated by wealthy oil-producing nations that also could be drawn to maintain spending as the oil price falls.\n\"We saw a lot of those holdings build up in the '80s and '90s as oil producers wanted to build a buffer, but as oil has come off and they will have to draw to fund budgets,\" she said.\n\"Peak foreign currency reserves\" could finally signal a turning point in bond markets that some have warned about for years. But it also could have major implications for the Australian economy.\nIn recent years low US bond rates as a result of extreme monetary policies have forced more of these trillions to diversify into new and high-yielding currencies such as Australia. That has led to a painful flow of funds into the Australian bond market that has pushed the currency higher and reduced its effectiveness as an economic stabiliser when the terms of trade have declined.\nThe return of risk premia in major bond markets as the Fed treads closer to normalisation could make Australia a less attractive destination for those official investors, at the exact moment they're commencing a sell-down.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-07-22T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:05:14.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
