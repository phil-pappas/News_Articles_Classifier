People can buy homes, cars. They can immediately do something otherwise they could not with monthly wages of 3,000-5,000 Turkish Liras ($A1480 — $A2470). It was a good thing; I wish we could have given them more.”\nMr Aydin said he had set a “bad example” for other companies by sharing the money with employees. “They will hate us, but this is the case,” he said.\n“Although we did not have any liabilities or promises, we shared $US27 million of the money we got from the sale of the company with the employees, out of our own share and by also paying the taxes.”\nYemeksepeti.com was founded in 2000 and today receives over 100,000 orders per day and makes more than three million transactions per month, according to Mr Aydin, who said the Delivery Hero deal was the biggest acquisition of a Turkish technology firm.\n“We did this because if there is a success, we have accomplished it altogether,” he said.\nIn May, a Chinese billionaire celebrated his company’s anniversary by taking his 6400 staff on a holiday to France , setting a new world record. Last month, the CEO of an online shopping company put $US1 million of his own money and stocks into paying for his employees’ children to attend university .\nOriginally published as ‘Some cried, some screamed’", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/ceo-hands-out-323000-bonuses-to-staff/story-fn5tas5k-1227461886090", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/chinese-ceo-celebrates-companys-anniversary-by-taking-6400-of-his-employees-on-holiday-to-france/story-e6frfm9r-1227348933735", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/boxed-ceo-offers-to-pay-university-fees-for-employees-kids/story-e6frfm9r-1227402502663", "http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-technology-firm-boss-distributes-27-million-to-employees-after-sale.aspx?PageID=238&NID=85951&NewsCatID=345"], "published": "2015-07-29T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T18:38:11.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
