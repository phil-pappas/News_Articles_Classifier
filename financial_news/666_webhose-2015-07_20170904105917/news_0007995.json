It was down from 66.10 cents at 8am and 66.29 cents on Thursday as weak Chinese manufacturing figures and falling commodity prices weighed on the outlook for Australia and New Zealand's exports. The trade-weighted index fell to 70.21 from 70.50 yesterday, and is heading for a 1.2 per cent weekly gain. The kiwi got a boost on Thursday when Reserve Bank governor Graeme Wheeler lowered the official cash rate 25 basis points to 3 per cent, and dropped his reference to criteria warranting intervention in foreign exchange markets, while reiterating his desire for a weaker New Zealand dollar. Wheeler will deliver a speech on the New Zealand economic outlook next week. \"The wash-up last night basically suggested that the New Zealand dollar was fairly priced into what the RBNZ did - a 25 basis point cut, and further easing bias, but not an overly aggressive one,\" said Sam Tuck, senior FX strategist at ANZ Bank New Zealand in Auckland. \"The kiwi has done its dash for the moment and is relatively happy to consolidate.\" ANZ's Tuck expects the kiwi will continue to decline as falling prices for hard and soft commodities weigh on currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars. Government data on Friday showed New Zealand posted an unexpected trade deficit in the month of June, which is typically a surplus, though bigger export receipts than anticipated helped allay any fears about the figures. The kiwi rose to 90.24 Australian cents from 89.85 cents on Thursday, and fell to 4.0871 Chinese yuan from 4.1161 yuan. The preliminary China Caixin purchasing managers' index unexpectedly fell today, putting downward pressure on commodity prices on fears a slowing Chinese economy will reduce global demand for raw materials.
