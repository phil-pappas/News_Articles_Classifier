We were at the limits of our economy and our banking system, and at the limits of Europe -- where conservative forces, obsessed with austerity, dominate,\" he added. \n- 'We will not be cowards' - \nSome 6,000 anti-austerity demonstrators had protested near parliament ahead of Wednesday night's debate, lobbing a handful of petrol bombs in the direction of the police, who had thrown up a ring of steel around the building after riots during last week's vote on austerity measures. \nKaterina and George Sergidou Kokkinavis, two Syriza members in their thirties taking part in the protest, said they had come because \"the government is no longer listening to the people\". \nAhead of the vote, Vassiliki Georgiadis, a political science professor at Athens' Panteion University, said it would be \"difficult\" for Tsipras's Syriza-led coalition to remain in power if he is forced to rely on opposition MPs to get laws passed. \nShe said the split within Syriza was between hard-left MPs -- \"some of whom have spoken of a Greek exit from the eurozone as the only solution\" -- and those more sympathetic to Tsipras's arguments. \nTsipras was forced to reshuffle his cabinet last week, having sacked three ministers for voting against the first bailout bill. \nGovernment spokeswoman Gerovassili previously said the administration had \"no intention\" of calling early polls, and Tsipras told parliament on Thursday that he would keep fighting for Greece's best interests, adding he would not \"voluntarily abandon\" the job. \n\"The left's presence in government is a bastion for the defence of the interests of the people,\" he said. \n\"We will not be cowards. We will fight the battles we face with determination.\" \nGerovassili said negotiations with Greece's creditors would resume immediately after Thursday's vote. \nThe EU's Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said they were aiming to finalise the deal by mid-August. \nBoth sides are under huge pressure to finalise the terms of the rescue before August 20, when Greece owes the ECB a loan repayment of 3.2 billion euros it cannot afford.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T11:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T12:01:40.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
