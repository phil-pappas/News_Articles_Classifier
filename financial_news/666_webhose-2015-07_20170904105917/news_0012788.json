This view was strengthened by the fact that last week's declines were not catastrophic. \n\"If Greece gets us dead center, it will be short-lived,\" said Johnson. \"It's not a game-changer.\" \n- Strong auto sales - \nMeanwhile the June US jobs report turned out to be a mixed bag. \nWhile the headline number of 223,000 new jobs came in above the key 200,000 benchmark, average hourly earnings were flat compared with May and the Labor Department cut its estimates for job growth in April and May. \nOther new reports included a solid uptick in consumer confidence, a rise in pending home sales and modest growth in manufacturing activity. \nJune auto sales were also a bright spot. Total (Swiss: FP.SW - news ) industry sales rose four percent and hit a seasonally adjusted pace of 17.2 million vehicles, according to Autodata. That is the fastest pace recorded in June since 2005. \n\"We just wrapped up the US auto industry's best six months in a decade, driven by strong demand for pickups and crossovers,\" said Kurt McNeil, head of sales at General Motors (NYSE: GM - news ) . \nMerger and acquisition activity also remained fairly brisk. \nThe week's deals included the $28.3 billion purchase of insurer Chubb by Swiss insurer Ace Limited (NYSE: ACE - news ) ; the $6.8 billion acquisition of Health Net (NYSE: HNT - news ) by rival health insurer Centene; and the decision by US professional services company Towers Watson and insurance broker Willis Group to combine in a deal with an implied equity value of about $18 billion. \nOn the opposite side of the equation, food services company Sysco abandoned a planned $8 billion takeover of US Foods following the opposition of US antitrust regulators. \nAlso, the Justice Department sued to block the sale of General Electric's appliance business to Sweden's Electrolux (Stockholm: ELUX-A.ST - news ) , saying the $3.3 billion deal would harm consumers. The Justice Department has also launched an antitrust probe on whether US airlines have engaged in \"possible unlawful coordination.\" \nAnalysts expect Greece to remain at the forefront in the coming week. The calendar includes the US trade balance for May, minutes from the June Federal Reserve meeting and results from aluminum giant Alcoa (NYSE: AA - news ) , leading off the second quarter earnings season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T02:39:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
