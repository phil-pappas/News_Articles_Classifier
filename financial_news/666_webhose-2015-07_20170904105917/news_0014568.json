Now I think partners are more sophisticated about where they're going to make their money,\" says Mahlab's Victoria Katherine Sampson. Share on twitter by Katie Walsh The million-dollar lawyer with a devoted client following is dwindling as a breed: some partners at the nation's heavyweight firms have seen salaries dive by a third in the past three years, from $1.2 million or more to around $750,000 \"with little prospect of reversion\", a report from leading legal recruiter Mahlab reveals.\nHell still has harbour views , but the seven-figure salary to match is becoming rare as profits in big firms falls and corporates demand more for less while increasing the amount of work dealt with in-house.\n\"There is still, in some pockets of firms, particularly big firms, the misconception that clients will follow them off the end of a cliff,\" said Mahlab Recruitment managing director of Victoria Katherine Sampson.\n\"Maybe 20 years ago clients stayed forever with one firm. But now, they're so cost driven, they're very sophisticated, they know who's who in the zoo.\"\nLawyers feel the pinch as profits fall. The hyper-competitive market made complacency a dangerous strategy, she said.\nSalaries for lawyers are up marginally, by 3.4 per cent on average – down on the 3.8 per cent last year.\nThe trend noted by Mahlab is one that is seeing partners shift away from traditional top-tier firms, to smaller bases, but remuneration falls aren't the only thing triggering movement. The rapid rush of long-standing domestic firms to globalisation has rattled some.\n\"Some partners expressed frustration that decisions are taken by faceless, offshore committees who regard the Australian component of the merged firm as a drag on profitability and something of a disappointment after the heady days of the merger, when a high AUD prevailed and the mining boom seemed endless,\" the report says.\n \"A falling Australian dollar and economic conditions in Australia make for tougher times than when these alliances were formed.\"\nHerbert Smith Freehills, King & Wood Mallesons, Ashurst and Allens are among the old \"big six\" firms to have made global ties in the past few years, varying from full financial merger to alliance. K&L Gates, Norton Rose Fulbright and DLA Piper are among other global entrants formed from mergers with local domestic firms.\nPartners find themselves answering to London headquarters, in the case of Ashurst, or Pittsburgh in the United States, in the case of K&L Gates. Some Allens partners have reportedly found themselves locked out of deals due to conflicts of interest from clients of Linklaters, with which it has an alliance.\nHSF has faired better than many, thanks to Australians taking many of the top management roles globally.\nJoint CEO Mark Rigotti said that the salary slump noted by Mahlab was not the experience at HSF.\n\"Our profit has increased and partners' profit shares have improved in recent years,\" he said.\nProvisional financial results announced for the April 30 year end revealed a 12 per cent annual boost in the firm's profit.\n\"There are certainly those that are more successful than others. The market's become more splintered,\" said Ms Sampson.\n\"A decade ago, the bigger the firm, the more you made. Now I think partners are more sophisticated about where they're going to make their money.\"\nPartners at mid-tiers that were earning around $1 million a few years ago remain at that mark, Mahlab found; further incentivising a move from those at big firms that have seen a drop.\nWhile there was movement in the other direction, towards global or bigger firms, the general trend was away, she said, towards smaller firms – a move that gave partners an arrangement that harks back to the \"good old days of partnership\".\n\"In my experience the stars will move,\" she said.\nDespite relatively stagnant salaries Ms Sampson said that there was increasing flexibility to reward such stars through bonuses and higher equity stakes, rather than sticking to the out dated lock-step model.\nBut she warned against entering a bidding war.\nWhile firms facing profitability pressure weren't necessarily pushing poor performing partners out the door, they were adopting strategies like cutting equity stakes, she said.\nFor lawyers, traditional salary bands are disappearing or have gone already, replaced with remuneration linked to value.\nThere was renewed hiring activity at 80 per cent of larger and 60 per cent of mid-sized firms in Sydney and Melbourne.\nThe story elsewhere is more dire: the mining activity drop-off has seen demand for lawyers in Perth and Brisbane slow by 60 per cent.\nFor graduates, prospects are \"bleak\", the report notes.\n\"The number of law students continues to increase as firms employ fewer trainees,\" it says.", "external_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445419", "https://twitter.com/@katiepwalsh"], "published": "2015-07-30T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:07:29.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
