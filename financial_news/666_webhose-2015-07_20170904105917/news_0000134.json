Mr Osborne said: \"Only when the OBR judge that we have real GDP growth of less than 1pc a year, as measured on a rolling four-quarter basis, will that surplus no longer be required.\" \nMr Chote said there had been six separate occasions since 1957 in which this has been the case. “Four of them involved a full blown recession with GDP falling for at least two quarters. The main exception was the recent slowdown in 2012, which breached the threshold without a full recession,” he said. \nMr Osborne said if the Government broke these rules, it would be required to set out a plan to get the budget back into balance. \n\"The Chancellor of the day will have to set out their plan with clear targets to restore the nation’s finances to health and this House of Commons will test the credibility of that plan and vote on those targets. It is sensible, pragmatic and it keeps Britain secure,\" he said. \nThe OBR chairman has previously branded the Chancellor's goal of a budget surplus as \"ambitious\" and inconsistent with past trends. \nMr Chote said that the government had about a 70pc chance of meeting its current fiscal mandate, which requires the Government to post a cyclically adjusted budget surplus - which accounts for booms and busts in the economy - in 2018-19, and get net debt falling as a share of GDP in 2016-17. \nMr Chote said Britain’s demographic challenge would make future budget surpluses more challenging. \n\"The Government’s ability to deliver budget surpluses further into the future will depend in part on how it deals with the challenges of an ageing population, which will put upward pressure on spending on health, long-term care and the state pension,” he said. “In our Fiscal sustainability report in June we projected that on unchanged policy this would see the budget surplus at the end of our March forecast return to a deficit by the mid-2020s.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T03:07:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
