So innocent. So precocious. Yet as her little girl finger ran along big girl words, like many I had fears. Steve Irwin’s legacy was unquestionably enormous but was it really incumbent on his daughter to shoulder it?\nBindi Irwin has long been a name that polarises. We love her because she is his yet critique her when she tries to be herself. We champion her enthusiasm, her confidence, her omnicompetence but secretly wonder if there’s any seam between Bindi and brand. We want to believe in her because God knows we’re short on true blue heroes. Yet for all the rolling around with crocodiles and the chumming up with snakes, she seems dusted in saccharine Americana.\nWell congratulations Bindi Sue Irwin, because on the eve of your 17th birthday you’ve shut up all of us who have ever doubted you.\nBindi Irwin 0:31 Play video\nBindi Erwin is excited about being a game changer on Generation Nature\nNews Corp Australia 19 Jul 2015 Entertainment To anyone in the business of building girls — and I’m charged with two — Bindi is a blueprint. Sure, we’re not all going to live in a zoo, and star in movies and go on talk shows or even be as nice as she is towards her little bro. But when a kid marinated in the abnormal turns out to be delightfully, inspiringly normal then we should ask why. And how? And what we can copy.\nBindi Irwin was only eight when she read a speech at her father's memorial service, held at Australia Zoo. (Pic: AFP) Source: AFP\n“Grief doesn’t change you, it reveals you,” Bindi posted on Instagram back in February, marking nine years since her dad was tragically killed by a stingray barb. Presumably they’re someone else’s words — Bindi is as exuberant about inspirational Quote: s as she is animals — but you sense every word she posts is a line lived not simply spouted. We’ll never know what she might’ve become as her dad’s khaki-clad sidekick. Famous, undoubtedly. Respected, certainly. Instead we celebrate a girl of her own making. A child anchored in the values of her father and raised by her lioness of a mother, but a girl with her own self-devised character, purpose and smarts. Critically, a girl gloriously free of the cynicism that sullies so many.\nThe longer I raise girls the more I believe it’s that cynicism we need to shield them from. It creeps into their language, hunches their shoulders, turns their colour to monochrome. Caitlin Moran said it best in her novel How to Build a Girl: “When cynicism becomes the default language, playfulness and invention become impossible. Cynicism scours through a culture like bleach, wiping out millions of small, seedling ideas. Cynicism means your automatic answer becomes ‘No’.”\nI see a lot of girls ergo I hear a lot of sad stories: self-harm; eating disorders; early sexualisation; meanness borne of a lack of self-worth. Equally, the strong ones often lack the kindness that could soften the experience for their suffering friends.\nBindi Irwin celebrates her sweet 16th 0:35 Play video\nWildlife warrior Bindi Irwin shares some of her wisdom on her sweet 16th birthday, encouraging others to be themselves and remembering her dad, Steve. Courtesy Channel Nine/The TODAY Show\nnews.com.au 24 Jul 2014 Entertainment The ones that flourish seem to be those with a strong sense of themselves, or the ones embedded in something they love or something with meaning. They’re the ones who will later tell a boy they can’t meet him that afternoon because they have water polo or dance. They have lives beyond their phone and who they fancy.\nBindi is the poster girl for finding your “spark”; for being a girl who does stuff not just says stuff. As her social media attests, she love animals, obviously, but also hiking, reading and fashion. She stills herself with nature but thrills at having a new dress “because it makes you feel good”.\nShe’s also comfortable with us seeing her change, grow and recalibrate her ideas. A year ago she told us girls can be beautiful without make up but last month she posted a pic to Instagram that showed her with smoky eyes and a bold red lip. So far, so teenage, so what?\nBindi Irwin pictured at Australia Zoo for an Australia Day shoot.

But pity the poor guy because her dad once told her that if she wanted to date any suitors would have to prove their worth by swimming across the family’s crocodile pond.\nFor now, days from turning 17, Bindi’s cutting her ties with the khaki safari suits she’s worn since she was born. Superficially it’s simply a preference for more flattering clothes — “it is really fun to try different styles” — but could it also be a step towards furthering her own identity, separate to that she was born into?\nWhatever her future holds, wildlife will be front and centre. Nine years on from her podium promise, it’s obvious Bindi is propelled by passion not expectation.\n“I admire people who choose to shine even after all the storms they’ve been through,” she posted recently on Instagram. So do we, Bindi.
