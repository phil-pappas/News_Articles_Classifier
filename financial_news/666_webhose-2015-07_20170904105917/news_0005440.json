Melco Crown Philippines Resorts Corp., operator of City of Dreams Manila, soared as much as 8.8 percent, halting a three-day slump. Travellers International Hotel Group, which runs Resorts World Manila, headed for its first gain in eight days.\nThe nation’s first-half gaming revenue grew 16 percent to $1.4 billion, Philippine Amusement & Gaming Corp. Chairman Cristino Naguiat said in a telephone interview. There’s a “good chance” it will reach $3 billion this year as he has predicted before, he added.\nChina’s crackdown on graft has weakened gaming revenues in the region, with Macau posting a 37 percent decline in the first half of the year as the campaign kept away Chinese gamblers. Genting Singapore Plc has also been hurt .\n“It’s proof that the Philippines has a good mix of foreign markets and that there are many who really want to come to the Philippines,” Naguiat said. “Bloomberry is raking the numbers in, while Melco has been steadily bringing in the people,” he said, adding that it’s getting tougher to get hotel rooms at the resorts.\nSouth Korea Tourists Tourist arrivals in the Philippines increased 8.2 percent to 2.23 million in the first five months of the year, with most coming from South Korea, who accounted for 24.5 percent of the total, followed by the U.S. and Japan, according to government data. China is the fourth largest source of tourists, with a 7.1 percent share.\nPhilippine gaming revenue could have been higher if not for China’s anti-corruption campaign, Naguiat said. The nation’s gaming revenue rose 14 percent to $2.5 billion last year from 2013.\nPremium Leisure Corp., among Melco Crown’s Philippine partners, advanced as much as 5.4 percent to a month’s high. Alliance Global Group Inc., parent of Travellers, gained 1.1 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T08:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T10:03:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
