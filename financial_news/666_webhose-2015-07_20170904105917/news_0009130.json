Just 10 percent would vote for him.\nLiberal darling and retiring “Daily Show” host Jon Stewart? Sixteen percent. Oprah? 11 percent.\nCurrent First Lady Michelle Obama was second to Bill Clinton with 20 percent.\nFormer Democratic presidential nominees Al Gore and John Kerry were in the 15 percent range. California Governor Jerry Brown and Julian Castro, the U.S. secretary for housing and urban development and a former San Antonio mayor, lingered in the 6 to 8 percentage range.\nBrittany Tomes, a 21-year-old university student from Levittown, Pennsylvania, said some characters in the poll’s “dream team” were unrealistic.\n“They need experience of actually being in the government and handling those issues to be trustworthy,” Tomes said. “For the most part, people who are in television don’t really have that background.”\n“SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS”\nWhen it comes to the actual Democratic primary race, Reuters/Ipsos’ polling shows Clinton attracting 51.5 percent of Democratic support as of July 21 vs. 21.5 percent for Senator Bernie Sanders, her nearest opponent.\nThirty-nine percent of Democrats said they would “enthusiastically” vote for Clinton, while another 21 percent said they would vote for her because they think she would be most likely to win the presidential race in November 2016. Twenty percent said they would “definitely not” vote for her.\n“This is a shrug of the shoulders,” said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, saying the less-than-full-throated enthusiasm reflects a “bubble-wrapped” and overly staged campaign.\nForty percent of Democrats said Clinton is a “great” candidate for president, while 39 percent described her as “adequate.”\nBeth Grimes, 62, of Piedmont, West Virginia, said Clinton is the only Democratic candidate she has heard from so far.\n“I may not even vote because Hillary is the only decent Democrat,” Grimes said. “I don’t really like Hillary. She sways positions too easily.”\nIf Clinton wins the primary, Democrats are apt to become more enthused about her candidacy once she is pitted against a Republican, Sabato said.\n“In this very polarized era, it’s the opposition party that generates more enthusiasm – the fact that you’re not the other nominee, you’re not the other party,” he said.\n 23, 2015 11:37 am", "external_links": ["http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/15/07/USA-ELECTION-DEMOCRATS.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-23T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T14:48:53.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
