We managed to deal with that matter with his lawyers, and it is still pending. This is a separate issue.\" \nBertelsmann's judgment focused on the 2009 bid letters that Aurora submitted to the liquidators in which they claimed that Aurora had the funds and the experience required to take over the mines. \n'Wilful deception' \nBertelsmann tore into their claims, calling them \"the figment of an overactive imagination\", \"devoid of factual content\" and \"a pipe dream\". \nThe court found that the directors had lied from day one, when they placed a bid to buy the mine: \"The respondents either did not appreciate the very grave implications of the offer the directors made, or did not care about the consequences that a fanciful and ill-founded approach to the transaction must have [had].\" \nInitially it appeared that Zuma, who always claimed he was kept in the dark about the problems at Aurora, would be excused as Bertelsmann found that Mandela, Ngubane and the Bhanas were \"guilty of wilful deception by presenting bid documents containing numerous false assertions to the liquidators. They are [also] guilty of reckless management of Aurora's affairs\". \nBertelsmann then turned his attention to Zuma, ruling that \"his failure to act once he knew the dire state of affairs is clearly a reckless disregard of his duties as a director. If he really did not know, it is because he deliberately chose not to be informed. Such an approach constitutes recklessness ... and [Zuma] should therefore be held liable for all losses that were incurred on or after December 1 2009.\" \nNone of the directors were present in court to hear the judgment. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T16:09:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
