Deutsche Bank AG, one of the 22 primary dealers the trade directly with the Fed, now expects the central bank to hold off until 2016.\nAnd it isn’t just global shocks that may support Treasuries. While jobs are back and business confidence is growing, wages remain stagnant. That suggests the weakest expansion in the post-World War II era is still struggling to generate the kind of inflation that causes investors to abandon U.S. bonds. What’s more, the last time that 10-year notes were so cheap relative to short-term debt -- in September -- they rallied over the next three months.\n“There’s a good chance yields are going to crest here,” Tipp, the chief investment strategist in Prudential Financial’s fixed-income unit, which oversees $560 billion, said from Newark, New Jersey.\nSince reaching a peak of 2.5 percent in June, yields on 10-year Treasuries have retreated and ended at 2.38 percent on Thursday. U.S. financial markets were closed on July 3 to celebrate the Fourth of July holiday.\nTantrum Redux Signs of renewed demand comes after Treasuries tumbled 2 percent last quarter, index data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nThe slump was the biggest since the three months ended June 2013, after then-Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke sparked the “taper tantrum” by suggesting that the central bank could end its bond-buying program.\nThe selloff, part of a global rout in bonds, gained momentum in the past month as reports on labor growth to personal spending indicated the U.S. economy was on an upswing, strengthening the Fed’s case for finally lifting rates after leaving them close to zero since 2008.\nTipp says that’s made longer-term Treasuries more attractive. Based on a metric known as the “term premium,” 10-year Treasuries offer 0.5 percentage points more in yield than short-term debt. The last time that happened, the notes returned 3.6 percent in the next three months in the biggest quarterly advance since 2012.\nCapital Flight Global events are also putting a premium on safety and delaying the exodus from Treasuries that almost everyone on Wall Street predicted would be inevitable.\nIn Europe, the crisis in Greece escalated the nation missed a $1.7 billion payment to the International Monetary Fund and voters rejected further austerity measures demanded by creditors, heightening concern that a financial collapse may fracture the euro bloc and spark capital flight from the region.\nInvestors will start to focus on “what’s the next Greece,” Brandon Swensen, the co-head of U.S. fixed income at RBC Global Asset, which oversees $35 billion, said from Minneapolis. “Any event that catches the market off-guard, it’s very predictable that Treasuries are going to rally.”\nThe bursting of China’s stock bubble is also deepening worries about the health of emerging markets, after investors there lost more than $3 trillion in three weeks.\nWhile America remains the bright spot, the potential knock-on effects of higher U.S. rates on the global economy have already prompted both the World Bank and the IMF to call on the Fed to delay any increases until 2016.\nHaven Status Traders are signaling the Fed will heed their advice. Based on Morgan Stanley’s analysis of futures trading, the first rate increase won’t occur until January. In March, the market was anticipating a September rate rise.\n“Given all the uncertainty, this makes it harder for investors to feel confident” about the economy, said Gary Pollack, who manages $12 billion as head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank AG’s private wealth unit. “The safest place to be in these uncertain times is the safety of Treasuries.”\nThe latest labor reports indicate that even in the U.S., the economy remains on uneven footing, giving the Fed room to stay patient. Although employers hired more workers in June, average hourly wages were unchanged at $24.95 an hour from the prior month, a Labor Department report showed July 2.\nAnd the lack of wage pressure is one reason why inflation remains almost non-existent.\nComplacency Risk Annual consumer prices have fallen or remained flat every month this year, and bond traders expect inflation will stay well below the Fed’s own 2 percent target through the end of the decade, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n“The two things that matter most as far as the timing of liftoff is concerned are wage growth and inflation, and right now we don’t have either,” said Ward McCarthy, the chief financial economist at Jefferies Group LLC in New York.\nThe risk, of course, is that investors in Treasuries underestimate the willingness of Fed officials to lift borrowing costs as they anticipate a strengthening economy and faster inflation. On June 30, Fed Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said that while Greece’s potential meltdown would spur demand for Treasuries, it’s unlikely to sway policy makers.\n“It would not change the timing of any rate hike,” he said. “I would say September is very much still in play.”\nIn June, Fed officials maintained their year-end forecast for its benchmark rate at 0.625 percent, which implies two quarter-point increases by December.\nWith inflation so low, the Fed’s fixation on raising rates from rock-bottom levels may actually squelch growth and prematurely cut short any upswing. That may ultimately boost demand for Treasuries, according to Prudential’s Tipp.\n“I don’t think they can be that myopic and say they can tighten with all that’s going on,” Thomas di Galoma, the head of fixed-income rates and credit at ED&F Man, said from New York. “We’ve seen the highs for the year” in yields.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T05:18:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
