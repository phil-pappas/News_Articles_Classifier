Vodafone Ghana appears to have taken a step ahead in this regard. \nBeginning this Tuesday in Takoradi, staff of the unit will set up interactive and service desks in the Takoradi vicinity to interact and provide assistance to SME customers on all their challenging issues. \nThe team will also re-introduce their flagship ‘RED BUSINESS’ product to customers in an effort to entrench their position as the Best in ‘Telecoms Business’– a feat they achieved at the recently held Ghana Telecom Awards. \nThe interactive activity will be replicated across other parts of the Western Region, particularly, Tarkwa and then to Cape Coast in the Central Region.. \nCommenting on this, Angela Mensah-Poku, Head of Vodafone Business Solutions said: \n“The customer is at the heart of the business landscape in the present dispensation. \nThe service-dominant logic is what makes businesses successful and it is something we have unflinching dedication for. \nGoing forward, we want our customers to rest assured that all their concerns will be effectively addressed by us. We want them to know that without them we have no business”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T15:31:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
