The transaction includes P&G's global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. \nP&G Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, AG Lafley, commented: \"This represents a significant step forward in the work to focus our portfolio on 10 categories and 65 brands that best leverage P&G's core competencies. We have leading global brand positions in these categories, consumer preferred products and leading brands in the largest markets. These businesses and brands have historically grown faster and have been more profitable than the balance. We expect these ten categories to grow and create value as we focus the energy and resources of the company exclusively on them.\" \n\"The merger with Coty, a strategic acquirer, will provide an excellent new home for these businesses and brands, as well as for the talented people who are operating them. We look forward to a successful transition and we will work together to maximize value for the shareholders of both companies,\" said Mr. Lafley. \nTransaction Value for P&G Shareholders and EPS Impact \nThe tax-efficient nature of the $12.5 billion offer maximizes value for P&G shareholders and minimizes annual earnings dilution. The transaction will result in a significant one-time earnings gain that will be recorded at closing of the transaction. P&G currently estimates the one-time gain will be in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion depending on the final deal value at the time of closing. \nBeginning with fiscal year 2015-16 reported results, the earnings from the RMT Brands will be reported as discontinued operations (i.e. removed from core earnings per share) in both the current and prior year periods. The specific earnings amount to be restated will be provided at a later date. \nThe core earnings per share impact of lost RMT Brands profit is expected to be completely offset on an annualized basis following the closing of the transaction through a combination of shares retired via the deal structure and offsetting overhead costs that were previously absorbed by the RMT Brands. The Company reiterated its goal of reducing non-manufacturing enrollment by 25 to 30 percent, excluding the impact of divestitures, by the end of fiscal year 2017 compared to its June 30, 2011 base. Including divestitures, total overhead enrollment reduction will exceed 35%. \nThe Company expects modest core earnings dilution of approximately $0.02 - $0.03 per share in the period prior to closing related to transition activities necessary to establish the RMT Brands entity. The majority of transition costs incurred by P&G related to the transaction will be reported in discontinued operations. \n$70 Billion Value Return to Shareholders from Fiscal 2016 to Fiscal 2019 \nP&G is targeting to pay dividends and retire shares worth up to $70 billion over a four year period from fiscal years 2016 to 2019 through a combination of shares eliminated via this RMT Brands transaction and the previously announced Duracell transaction, ongoing discretionary share repurchase and continuing its strong history of dividend payments. P&G is committed to maintain our current credit ratings. \nTransaction Details \nAlthough a final decision has not been made on the form of deal, P&G expects to do a split-off or spin-off transaction. P&G's current preference is for a Reverse Morris Trust split-off transaction in which P&G shareholders could elect to participate in an exchange offer to exchange P&G shares for shares of Coty. P&G shareholders would have the option of exchanging all, some or none of their P&G shares. If executed as a split-merge, P&G would establish a separate entity to hold the RMT Brands, which would be transferred to electing P&G shareholders in a tax-efficient transaction with a simultaneous merger of the new entity with Coty. We expect to finalize the details of the transaction in the coming months and to close the transaction in the second half of calendar year 2016, pending regulatory approvals. \nBased on Coty's current stock price and outstanding shares and equity grants, the value of the transaction is approximately $15 billion. The value is comprised of approximately 413 million shares, or 52% of the diluted equity of the newly combined company, valued at approximately $13.1 billion and the assumption of $1.9 billion of debt by the entity holding RMT Brands. The assumed debt will vary between $3.9 billion and $1.9 billion, subject to other contractual valuation adjustments, within a $22.06 to $27.06 per share collar based on the trading price of Coty's stock prior to the close of the transaction. The final value of the transaction will be known at closing based on Coty's stock price, Coty's outstanding shares and equity grants, and the amount of assumed debt. \nJAB Cosmetics B.V. is the owner of all of the outstanding shares of Coty's Class B common stock. In order to facilitate the transaction, JAB has agreed to convert all such shares into Class A common stock, subject to the completion of the transaction. \nGoldman, Sachs & Co. acted as financial advisor on the transaction; Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP acted as tax counsel; Jones Day acted as legal counsel; and Centerview Partners provided advisory services to P&G. \nConference Call \nProcter & Gamble will host an investor call and web cast this morning, July 9, 2015, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the transaction.
