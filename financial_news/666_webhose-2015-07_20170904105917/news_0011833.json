Advertising Print This Post \nFXPrimus Group has appointed Michael Mirarchi as its newest Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Director of CapMarFX, according to a jointly released statement from FXPrimus and CapMarFX. \nThe new appointment is part of FXPrimus’ continued initiative to foster institutional offerings via its FCA-regulated arm CapMarFX. CapMarFX provides a number of services for FX traders, IBS, and money managers to a global clientele. More specifically, the group specializes in a number of infrastructural upgrades, as well as including turn-key technology solutions and institutional-grade liquidity. \nMr. Mirarchi has joined CapMarFX from ATC Brokers, having worked at the London-based brokerage as its CEO since early 2014. Moreover, he has over a decade of senior level experience in both the retail and institutional realm of FX sales and prime brokerage. Additional sotps include dbFX and CitiFX Pro. \nAccording to Mr. Mirarchi in a recent statement on the appointment, “CapMarFX is an established brand in the FX industry, founded in 1999. We’re now in a great position to build off that legacy and improve our offering geared towards institutions and professional traders.” \n“We continue to offer institutional grade liquidity via a variety of leading platforms such as First Derivatives, Currenex, and MT4 – in addition to recently launching CFD’s via API. We’ll be looking to grow our team in the next few months, which I’m very excited about,” he added. \nEarlier this year, FXPrimus made headlines after it incurred a brush with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) , which mandated FXPrimus to stop providing margin foreign exchange and contracts for difference (CFDs) trading to Australian residents.
