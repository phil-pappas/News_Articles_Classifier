But she also suggested corporations should begin investing more if the U.S. wants wage growth that lasts. \n\"I expect that it will be appropriate at some point later this year to take the first step to raise the federal funds rate and thus begin normalizing monetary policy,\" Yellen said in a speech in Cleveland. \"But I want to emphasize that the course of the economy and inflation remains highly uncertain, and unanticipated developments could delay or accelerate this first step.\" \nOverall, the speech was a dovish look at the U.S. economy that also emphasized keeping interest rates near zero and maintaining a $4 trillion balance sheet is not normal central-bank behavior. Yellen repeated that rates will move up only gradually and that monetary policy will still be loose after the Fed begins to move. \nFor investors, that means bond yields won't rise that much, and principal losses will be small, while the continued low rates will still keep supporting stocks, especially cyclical companies like automakers Ford ( F - Get Report ) and Toyota ( TM - Get Report ) , industrials like General Electric ( GE - Get Report ) and Dow Chemical ( DOW - Get Report ) , and names that rely on confident consumers spending money like Netflix ( NFLX - Get Report ) . \nMust Read: 10 Stocks Carl Icahn Is Buying \nYellen spent a lot of time dwelling on labor-market indicators she says still show the economy has more slack than the 5.3% unemployment rate suggests. The pace at which confident workers quit their jobs for new ones is still well below its mid-2000s peak, and she said the 6.5 million people working part-time for economic reasons is \"notably larger than has been historically typical in a growing economy,\" a point Republican Presidential candidate Jeb Bush has been emphasizing all week. \nBut with Yellen scheduled to testify before Congress next week, her speech Friday also laid some groundwork for talking about other ways to keep the recovery moving. \nThe bookish 68-year-old economist segued from a straightforward statistical analysis about how wage growth is showing tentative signs of acceleration to an argument that you can't have sustained wage growth without much better increases in productivity than the nation has seen since the mid-2000s. Indeed, Yellen said the amount of value the average worker produces each hour has risen less than half as fast since 2007 as in the decade before, when the then-new Internet was driving a productivity boom. \nProgressive Policy Institute economist Mike Mandel likes to say that productivity is where raises come from, and Yellen placed herself firmly in that camp today. \n\"The important factor determining continued advances in living standards is productivity growth,\" she said. \"Over time, sustained increases in productivity are necessary to support rising household incomes. I mentioned earlier the sluggish pace of wage gains in recent years, and while I do think that this is evidence of some persisting labor market slack, it also may reflect, at least in part, fairly weak productivity growth.\" \nThe trouble for Yellen, and all central bankers, is that monetary policy has only a very tenuous connection to productivity growth. The most important way to boost productivity is with new buildings, machines and equipment -- and capital investment has been the most disappointing part of the recovery, as companies plow record profits into historically huge stock buybacks instead. \nThe ideas to fix that will have to come from Congress, where Yellen will be next week. And neither the ideas on offer, nor the behavior of the companies pitching them, are very encouraging. \nLobbies like the Business Roundtable have focused on reducing the federal deficit and cutting the corporate income tax, including a restructuring to let American companies bring back profits earned abroad , without paying U.S. taxes on them. Yet neither the logic nor the history of companies pitching this change suggest it will solve the problem. \nAn analysis I did last year found that only about a quarter of companies on the board of the Roundtable had increased investment in 2012 and 2013. That was true even though Congress raised taxes, cut spending and narrowed the deficit -- the very moves Roundtable leaders like Boeing ( BA - Get Report ) CEO Jim McNerney and Honeywell's ( HON - Get Report ) Dave Cote had argued were needed to restore business confidence. \nOne modest proposal: Any move to let companies repatriate earnings should have strings attached to keep the money from being spent on buybacks. One line of argument about corporate tax restructuring is that it will let companies invest more in the U.S. And that's fine -- if it happens. But the history of the deficit-reduction battles strongly suggest it won't, unless Congress makes it so. \nStrings on buybacks may sound bad for stocks, but they won't be if they push the repatriated money into domestic investment, more jobs, and more profits back home. The only path to lasting growth isn't financial engineering. It's just plain engineering.
