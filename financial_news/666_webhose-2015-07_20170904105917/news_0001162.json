The new schedule will replace some of regional subsidiary Indonesia AirAsia’s A320 services between the two destinations.\nThe new widebody services will replace two existing AirAsia flights, and will add to the IAAX international network of Melbourne in Australia, Taoyan in Taipei, and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia.\nMalaysia-based AirAsia Berhad has also reopened a new schedule to Dhaka in Bangladesh from its base at Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2. Its original service to Dhaka was canceled in July 2011, following reports of low yields from the primarily migrant worker traveler segment.\nAirAsia head of commercial Spencer Lee said the new Bangladesh schedule will allow new connectivity into Southeast Asia for Bangladeshi travelers and will reinforce “strong bilateral ties” between the two countries.\n“Malaysia and Bangladesh have had strong ties, particularly in trade and investment,” he said. The carrier’s recent announcement of Langkawi as a hub could also help expand its network to other destinations on the Bay of Bengal.\nThe new Dhaka service will offer daily A320 services between the two countries catering for what Lee called an “under-tapped market” for both leisure and business travelers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T08:32:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
