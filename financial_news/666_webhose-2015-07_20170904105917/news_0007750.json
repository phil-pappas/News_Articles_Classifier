But being the Constitutional authority and seeing the glaring illegality in the process, this Court was compelled to step in,” the HC in its ruling said adding that no fresh admit cards would be issued.\nOnly those candidates who had enrolled themselves for the initial examination would be eligible for the fresh examination, the Court said.\nFirst Published on July 29, 2015 8:35 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:31:37.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
