What is clear is that he has mellowed significantly and the status quo no longer regards him threatening. \nOf course, Dr Njoroge hasn't said anything publicly yet to betray reformist pretensions. But, like the chief justice, the CBK chief probably knows already that he can only go too far. \nOtieno is Chief Sub-Editor, Business Daily; [email protected]; Twitter: @otienootieno Kenya \nNational Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi and four lawmakers have cautioned US President Barack Obama against asking Kenya … see more » Copyright © 2015 The Nation.
