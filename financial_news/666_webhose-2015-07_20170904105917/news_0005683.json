Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Bill Shorten has said he \"did not believe\" there was a $100,000 a year deal between Thiess John Holland and the Australian Workers' Union in the mid-2000s.\nFronting the second day of the Abbott government's Royal Commission into Trade Union Corruption , he was also reprimanded by commissioner Dyson Heydon for long and overly detailed responses that did not directly address the question.\nThe morning's questions centred on allegations the East Link joint venture between Thiess and John Holland paid the AWU nearly $300,000 when he was national secretary, shortly after the project started in 2005.\nInvoices show the union's Victorian branch accepting payments in instalments from the joint venture for items marked as services.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten appeared before the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption in Sydney on Thursday 9 July 2015. Image from Royal Commission video feed \"My question was to your knowledge did the joint venture agree to pay the AWU $100,000 a year plus GST for the three-year life of the project?\" counsel assisting Jeremy Stoljar said.\n\"I do not believe that this was the case,\" he said.\nHe was then presented with documents showing the AWU invoicing Thiess John Holland for $110,000 in 2007.\n\"Well, I don't recall and I don't believe I would have said a specific amount and also it would have been for services so I believe in user pays,\" Mr Shorten said.\n AWU's Cesar Melhem invoiced Thiess John Holland for $110k in 07. Reversed as TJH wanted to pay in instalments #turc pic.twitter.com/NmRrZlR1rT\nâ€” Ewin Hannan (@EwinHannan) July 9, 2015 Mr Shorten also defended his enterprise bargaining in the East Link deal.\n\"I wanted to change the reputation about doing industrial relations in Victoria because I want construction workers in Victoria to have regular and ongoing work and a climate of investment,\" he said.\nMr Stoljar then asked Mr Shorten why the union's Victorian branch was paid by Thiess John Holland for non-existent advertising in the union's Australian Worker magazine, edited by him as National Secretary.\nMr Shorten said he did not have any knowledge of this, as he was not in charge of the Victorian branch.\nCesar Melhem was the secretary of the Victorian branch at the time.\nMr Shorten did say, however, that the Victorian office of Australian Worker magazine should not have been issuing advertising invoices, as it was run by the national office.\n'A lot of your answers are non-responsive' Commissioner Heydon also intervened to chastise Mr Shorten on Thursday accusing him of giving overly detailed and non-responsive answers.\n\"You...have been criticised in the newspapers in the last few weeks and I think it's generally believed that you have come here in the hope you will be able to rebut that criticism...A lot of your answers are non-responsive,\" Commissioner Heydon said.\nCommissioner Heydon said this was casting a shadow and dragging out his appearance.\n\"What I'm concerned about more is your credibility as a witness,\" he said.\n'I want to keep mushroom picking alive' Before the commission's lunch break, Mr Shorten was also accused of a \"major conflict of interest\" in allegedly overseeing an employment agreement with Victorian mushroom grower Chiquita Mushrooms that lowered wages for workers, while the company made $4000-a-month payments to the union.\nMr Shorten defended his negotiations, saying it was a \"tough\" negotiation as the company was \"shopping around\" for ways to decrease their overheads.\n\"If you're saying we should never do an agreement where we ignore the realities of the employer's balance sheet ...it's just not how it works. Furthermore, what I want to do is keep mushroom picking alive,\" he said.\nMr Shorten said while it was not his \"practice to be issuing and checking every invoice directly\", they were for paid training.\n\"We've been making the claim. It's not a secret it's in our books as paid education,\" he said.\nOn the first day of the commission on Wednesday, Mr Shorten admitted he failed to declare up to $63,777 in payments from a labour hire company that covered the wages of former campaign director, and denied he used his position as a prominent union leader for personal advantage .", "external_links": ["http://t.co/NmRrZlR1rT", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/royal-commission-told-mushroom-pickers-shortchanged-in-union-deal-20140915-10hcas.html", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/shorten_approval_hype/index.html", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016", "https://twitter.com/EwinHannan/status/618942694920863744", "https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/turc?src=hash"], "published": "2015-07-09T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:15:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
