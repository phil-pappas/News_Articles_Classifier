What it'll be, we'll have to wait and see. It's never too late.\" \nThe comments echo a speech he gave last week, in which he confounded his reputation as a \"dove\" on the MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) by saying it was \"likely to be right\" that interest rates rise soon. \nThat speech raised the possibility that August's meeting could see a renewed split among rate setters. Fellow MPC member Martin Weale has also suggested he will vote to raise rates.
