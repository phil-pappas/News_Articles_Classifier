PUBLISHED: 15:55, Wed, Jul 22, 2015 | UPDATED: 16:14, Wed, Jul 22, 2015 GETTY Only one in three people will get the full state pension next year \nAnyone who has paid at least 35 years of National Insurance contributions were promised they would get the full pension payout of Â£148 a week when benefit reforms take effect in April 2016. Yet, it's now been revealed that only 222,000 out of the 600,000 people who will hit retirement age in the 12 months after the changes will qualify for the maximum payout. Just 37 per cent will be able to claim the full amount, a dramatic drop on the number originally forecast, according to Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) figures. Around 100,000 fewer retirees than originally expected will qualify for the full payout in the first ten years of the new benefit, as a result of a trick in missed contributions. \nWorkers who spent any time 'contracted out' are most likely to be affected, after opting out of receiving state second benefits in exchange for paying a reduced rate of National Insurance. Because of the lower contributions these workers could now lose some of their new state pension.
