But it is only a first step and many pitfalls remain on Greece’s path out of the slump. \n• Greece news live: Germany and Austria vote on bail-out talks \nGermany's parliament has approved the bailout, but implementation will be extremely tricky, given that the Greek government does not fully endorse the program and depends on the opposition for implementation. \nTo help the implementation process, positive results have to become quickly visible, including that banks are able to reopen, wages, bills and pensions can be paid in full and public and private investment can resume. The plan is tough, perhaps a little too tough, but it does give Greece a chance to resume growth within a year, perhaps sooner. \nThe experience in Portugal, Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) and Spain is encouraging. I think that indeed ultimately the outcome may be positive and shows that while the European institutions do not work perfectly, they work and this will ultimately enhance the credibility of the common currency. All other possible outcomes would have been substantially worse. \nShould the program include debt relief? Debt sustainability depends crucially on assumptions about growth and inflation. The burden currently imposed on Greece in terms of financial outflows will be accommodated under the program and is manageable. \n• AEP: Greece should seize Germany's botched offer of a velvet Grexit \nEverything else concerns repayments far in the future and do not significantly affect Greece’s chances to recover at this moment. An extension of maturity or a further reduction in interest may be more symbolic at this point than materially affect Greece’s chances. If such a symbolic step helps Tsipras to sell structural reforms at home, it should be taken. \nPerhaps this issue should be revisited in a few years when Greece’s access to private capital markets is back on the agenda. Debt relief in the form of further reductions in principal at that point could indeed be helpful and justified. \nWolfgang Schäuble’s “idea” of temporary exit was a bad idea at the wrong time. What is needed now is a pragmatic approach to solve Greece’s problems, not an ideological one or one driven by personal animosity. The reform program for Greece is not a program designed to “punish” Greece for past bad behavior, but it is probably the only chance to recover within a reasonable amount of time. \nI would have wished that Mr. Schäuble and the German government would have emphasized this point and not floated humiliating ideas. \nA 'No' poster featuring the face of Wolfgang Schäuble on a lamp post in Athens, Greece \nThe proposal was not helpful and is economic nonsense. Personal (LSE: PGH.L - news ) animosity between some of the players that understandably emerged in the negotiation process should not influence sound judgement going forward. Schäuble and Merkel need to put their doubts aside and explain the program to the German population and publicly strongly renew their commitment to Europe and European unification. \nFundamentally, what I like to call the “German confusion” about the euro and the EU needs to be urgently rectified by the government: A majority of Germans thinks that European unification and the common currency are not in their best interest. This is both factually wrong and politically extremely dangerous. \nGermany needs Europe and Europe needs Germans that understand why European political and economic unification was started in the first place. It is high time for Ms Merkel to explain these facts. \nProfessor Reint Gropp is a German economist and President at the Halle Institute for Economic Research", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T16:15:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
