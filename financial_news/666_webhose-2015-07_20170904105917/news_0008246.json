The rise in new business volume marked the fifth consecutive year that businesses increased their spending on capital equipment. The SEFA report, now celebrating its 40th year, covers key statistical, financial and operations information for the $903 billion equipment finance industry, based on a comprehensive survey of 100 ELFA member companies. The report, which includes an expanded executive summary, is available at www.elfaonline.org/SEFA . ELFA will host a web seminar on the SEFA findings on August 5. ELFA also released a companion report to the 2015 SEFA called the 2015 Small-Ticket Survey of Equipment Finance Activity. The report, which focuses on small-ticket and micro-ticket equipment transactions among the SEFA respondents, found that new business volume in the small-ticket space grew by 7.1% in 2014.“We are pleased to present the 2015 Survey of Equipment Finance Activity. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the report, which has grown over the years into the most important source of statistical information available on the $903 billion equipment finance industry,” said William G. Sutton, CAE, ELFA President and CEO. “The data show that the equipment finance industry is healthy and growing, continuing an upward trend since the end of the Great Recession. More recent data collected in 2015 indicate that positive momentum is continuing, with member companies reporting solid new business growth and portfolio performance. We remain cautiously optimistic that demand for capital equipment will continue to drive positive growth for the equipment finance industry.”Survey highlights:Key findings for 2014 as reported in the 2015 SEFA include: Overall new business volume grew 6.7%.
