Reuters Share on twitter by James Chessell Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' campaign to reject eurozone austerity has succeeded with a stunning referendum victory delivered in Athens which will send shockwaves through Europe and push the country into unknown financial territory.\nPredictions of a close result were proved badly wrong from the start of counting on Sunday night with around 60 per cent of Greek voters ignoring warnings about their country's membership of the euro and backing the 'No' campaign against five years of unpopular economic reforms imposed by Greece's eurozone creditors.\nThe margin of victory may be much larger than expected but the outcome means no end to the sense of uncertainty that has engulfed Greece since Mr Tsipras abandoned last-ditch bailout talks with creditors to call the referendum.\nThe No vote makes future negotiations with creditors – which could begin as soon as Monday – more difficult as Greece attempts to prevent the collapse of a financial system which is running out of cash.\nA complete breakdown in trust marred the final weeks of negotiations between Greece and its creditors with many eurozone powers hoping a strong showing for the Yes camp would give it new negotiating partners. Analysts such as Kathleen Brooks of Forex.com and Wolf Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence now predict the chances of a \"Grexit\" as more than 75 per cent. Investors, who were not expecting such a big win, are bracing for widespread turmoil on global markets on Monday.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel will travel to Paris on Monday afternoon to discuss the result of the Greek referendum with French President Francois Hollande, a German government spokesman said on Sunday.\nMs Merkel framed the referendum as a vote on Greece's membership of the eurozone. With most Germans unwilling to support further bailouts for Greece, it is possible Europe's biggest economy may not stand in the way of a Grexit.\nIn a televised address, Mr Tsipras argued Sunday's vote was not \" a question on Europe\" and the issue of saying goodbye to the euro must be taken \"off the table completely\".\n \"Greece has proved that democracy cannot be blackmailed,\" he said. \"Greeks have made a brave choice, and one which will change the debate in Europe.\n\"I understand that voters have not given me a mandate against Europe but a mandate for a sustainable solution.\"\nAs jubilant No supporters spilled into Syntagma Square outside the parliament building in central Athens on Monday night, Greek television reported Mr Tsipras has already spoken with several European leaders, starting with Mr Hollande.\nMr Tsipras' ruling Syriza party will hope the result gives it greater leverage in future negotiations with creditors, which Greek employment minister Panos Skourletis telling reporters: \"the government can go now with a very strong card to continue negotiations [with creditors]\".\nWith Greek banks closed all last week and likely to remain shuttered on Monday, Athens is desperate to restart talks deal with creditors. The eurozone's 18 other members are reluctant to offer Greece a special deal to cut its debt mountain but do not want to see the country to further destabilise the currency union by reverting to the drachma.\nGreece is effectively insolvent after last week becoming the first developed country to default on a payment to the International Monetary Fund. Mr Tsipras wants the eurozone powers to provide debt relief by cutting Greece's €320 billion debt pile by at least 30 per cent and delay repayments for two decades to allow the Greek economy to undergo structural reforms.\nWith Greece's borrowings at an unmanageable 180 per cent of GDP, further negotiations with the creditors are necessary regardless of the result. The IMF puts Greece's total funding requirements at €50 billion for the next three years.\nMomentum for anti-austerity parties The first referendum since Greek emerged from military rule in 1974 occurred against a backdrop of widespread uncertainty, social division and an absolute breakdown in trust between Greece and its creditors.\nThe complicated 72-word question asked voters to accept the terms of bailout proposal that expired last week at the same time Greece failed to make the €1.6 billion payment to the IMF. Instead, the snap ballot took on a broader significance as an in-out poll on euro membership after five years of economic hardship and mass unemployment.\nThe result also threatens to destabilise the continent by giving a sense of momentum to populist anti-austerity parties in other countries.\n\"This 'No' from the Greek people must pave the way for a healthy new approach,\" said the leader of France's anti-immigrant, eurosceptic National Front party, Marine Le Pen. \"European countries should take advantage of this event together around the negotiating table, take stock of the failure of the euro and austerity, and organise the dissolution of the single currency system, which is needed to get back to real growth, employment and debt reduction.\"\nLoss of confidence Unpopular capital controls were introduced last week to prevent a bank run with most branches closed and daily ATM withdrawals limited to €60, forcing Greeks to queue at ATMs and slowly suffocating the economy.\nGreek banks have stayed afloat in recent weeks because of assistance from a European Central Bank emergency liquidity fund. The ECB froze liquidity nine days ago when Greek negotiations with Europe effectively ended and will not provide any more emergency loans before a scheduled conference call of its governing council on Monday afternoon.\nAn estimated 50,000 tourists have cancelled their holidays, according to the Greek Tourism Confederation, while there are reports food staples such as bread and sugar were running low in some shops as suppliers lose confidence they will be paid.\nEarlier on Sunday, Mr Tsipras fought through a crowd journalists and camera crews at a school in central Athens to cast his vote. Mr Tsipras said afterwards his country had the right to determine its own \"destiny\" in Europe.\nMr Tsipras' left wing Syriza party had unsuccessfully attempted to make the focus of the referendum a series of tough economic reforms known as austerity measures such as tax hikes and a tightening of Greece's generous pension system.\nHowever, it has become a vote on Mr Tsipras's handling of often fractious negotiations with the creditors after his party won power in January by promising to oppose further austerity measures.\nSofter stance A Yes vote was expected to end Mr Tsipras' political career and kick-start fresh negotiations with the creditors without Syriza.\nWhile Mr Tsipras argues a No vote will strengthen his hand in further talks, many observers believe it will terminate Greece's membership of the euro and possibly the European Union altogether.\nBut European leaders appeared to soften their stance on Greece's membership of the euro in the event of a No vote on the eve of the referendum.\n\"Even if there is a No vote, our responsibility will be to avoid a Versailles treaty of the eurozone,\" said Emmanuel Macron, French economy minister in a reference to the tough conditions imposed on Germany after it lost the first world war. \"If the No wins, it would be a historic mistake to crush the Greek people.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jameschessell"], "published": "2015-07-06T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T04:11:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
