The economy’s growth rate is estimated to have slowed to 6.8 percent last quarter, while a stock-market rout that at one stage had wiped almost $4 trillion off equity valuations hangs over confidence.\n“The data is a good signal: The economy is recovering on a pickup in investment,” said Shen Jianguang, chief Asia economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. Relaxed local government financing rules “will continue to drive infrastructure investment in the third quarter.”\nChina’s foreign-exchange reserves, also released Tuesday, showed a decline to $3.69 trillion as at June 30. M2 money supply rose 11.8 percent from a year earlier in June, the central bank data showed.\nIn other signs that growth is stabilizing, China’s exports rose for the first time in four months in June and the nation’s consumer-price index increased 1.4 percent from a year earlier, compared with the 1.2 percent increase in May.\nThe PBOC cut benchmark interest rates to record lows last month in the fourth reduction since November.\n“Following the outright easing during the past half of year and given the already abundant short-term liquidity, we believe monetary easing may evolve into a new stage, focusing more on improving monetary transmission channels and directing more funding to the real economy,” economists at UBS Group AG wrote in a note before the data release.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T10:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T06:13:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
