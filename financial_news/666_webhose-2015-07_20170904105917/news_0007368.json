Caleb Kramer, who manages the original fund, will oversee the new pool.\nAlyssa Linn, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles-based Oaktree at public-relations firm Sard Verbinnen & Co., declined to comment on the plans.\nAlternative-asset managers such as KKR & Co., Blackstone Group LP and Apollo Global Management LLC are stepping into the lending void in Europe after banks started shrinking their balance sheets in response to heightened capital standards following the financial crisis. Billionaire Howard Marks, Oaktree’s co-founder and co-chairman, has called Europe the most attractive region for investment because prices are currently lower than for comparable assets in North America.\n“We’re doing more in Europe at the present time than at any other time,” Marks, 69, said in a Bloomberg Television interview this month. U.S. assets “are on the high side of fair or higher -- there’s nothing you can buy today for less than it’s worth.”\nShipping, Property Oaktree has 140 dealmakers in the U.K. seeking investments around Europe, compared with three in 1998, Marks told Bloomberg in a May interview. The company also has offices in Dublin, Frankfurt and Paris.\nThe firm, founded in 1995, gathered 294 million euros ($324 million) for the 2013 dislocation fund, which had drawn about a third of the capital for deals as of March 31, according to its first-quarter earnings statement. Oaktree is targeting annualized returns before fees of at least 12.5 percent for that fund, according to a marketing document obtained by Bloomberg.\nPotential opportunities for the firm include lending to shipping owners and operators, investing in banks’ shipping portfolios, restructuring renewable energy projects, buying and financing U.K. real estate, and funding mergers and acquisitions, according to the document.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T23:49:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
