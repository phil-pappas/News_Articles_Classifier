Shares of Yelp Inc. YELP, -25.37% had plunged 28% and of Twitter Inc. TWTR, -13.93% tumbled 13% in midday trade Wednesday after the companies reported results after Tuesday’s close.\nFor LinkedIn Corp. LNKD, +1.02% which reports after Thursday’s close, the options market is pricing in an 11% one-day move in the stock, which seems appropriate considering it produced double-digit percentage post-earnings after the last four quarterly results.\nOne-day, post-results move in Twitter’s stock for last 5 quarters Quarter of reported results Date of post-results move One-day stock move (%) Q1 2015 April 23, 2015 -2.6 Q4 2014 Jan. 29, 2015 +2.3 Q3 2014 Oct. 29, 2014 -6.1 Q2 2014 July 24, 2014 +5.2 Q1 2014 April 24, 2014 -0.8 Source: FactSet More from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:09:06.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
