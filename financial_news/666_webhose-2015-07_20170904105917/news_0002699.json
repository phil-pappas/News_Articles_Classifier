The meeting will begin with presentations by leaders from each of the twelve workgroups chartered to update Patient Safety Movement’s Actionable Patient Safety Solutions (APSS). The Patient Safety Movements APSS are designed to address the top challenges in patient safety. The group will conclude by identifying new challenges and specifying which will be addressed at their 4 th annual Patient Safety, Science and Technology Summit January 22-23, 2016 in Dana Point, Calif. Current challenges include: Failure to Rescue: Post Operative Respiratory Depression Medication Errors Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infections (CLABSI) Sub-Optimal Neonatal Oxygen Targeting Failure to Detect Clinical Congenital Heart Disease (CCHD) Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) Metrics Integrity “Our midyear meeting will set the direction of the 2016 Summit,” stated Joe Kiani, Founder of the Patient Safety Movement Foundation. “We feel fortunate to have Chapman University School of Pharmacy co-convene this meeting. We have over hundred patient safety thought leaders from around the world joining together at this midyear meeting. Together, we can and will eradicate preventable patient deaths by 2020.” The Chapman University School of Pharmacy (CUSP) is located on the Harry and Diane Rinker Health Science Campus in Irvine, California. The CUSP program helps students focus on the lifelong pursuit of answers to the grand challenges in human health around the world and their role in compassionate delivery of those solutions. Responsibility for the use of medication and the health outcomes associated with such use is at the core of the pharmacist’s role in advancing health. “It is an honor to co-convene this year’s Patient Safety Movement Foundation midyear planning meeting,” stated Ron Jordan, R.Ph.,FAPhA, Dean of the Chapman University School of Pharmacy (CUSP). “Patient safety and getting to 'zero preventable deaths by 2020' is a key component planned into the curriculum of our doctor of pharmacy program. We look forward to working with the leadership team of the foundation to identify both the safety challenges and the solutions that will help our nation’s health care organizations address them. #0x2020” About The Patient Safety Movement Foundation More than 200,000 people die every year in U.S. hospitals in ways that could have been prevented. The Patient Safety Movement Foundation was established through the support of the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation, and Competition in Healthcare, to reduce that number of preventable deaths to 0 by 2020 (0X2020). Improving patient safety will require a collaborative effort from all stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, medical technology companies, government, employers, and private payers. The Patient Safety Movement Foundation works with all stakeholders to address the problems and solutions of patient safety. The Foundation also convenes annual Patient Safety, Science and Technology summits. The next summit will be held January 22-23, 2016 in Dana Point, CA and will bring together our nation’s best minds for thought-provoking discussions and new ideas to challenge the status quo. By presenting specific, high-impact recipes to meet patient safety challenges, encouraging medical technology companies to share the data for whom their products are purchased, and asking hospitals to make commitments to implement Actionable Patient Safety Solutions, the Foundation is working toward zero preventable deaths by 2020.
