The deficit has been made up through library cash reserves, but those will be depleted by 2017. \nCounty contracts with Wall, Keystone and Hill City expire at the end of the year, and the County Commission will have to decide whether to cut funding to rural libraries or pursue a tax increase to maintain services. \n\"They run out of all their savings in 2017,\" Pearson said. \"These libraries have to face it sometime, anyway, or the (commission) has to do something to bring those cash balances up.\" \nPearson said Pennington County currently pays out the library contracts in January and July, but the county will be late on its last payment of the year. And the first check this year bounced without enough library cash reserves in place. \n\"We need large reserves at the end of the year, so we can pay our bills until our first half of taxes come in,\" she said, noting that county tax revenue comes in during April and October. \nIn order to address the shortfall, the county could use its general fund to subsidize the library contracts, but that means Rapid City residents would have to pay two library taxes, Pearson said. \nWall Community Library director Theresa Schaefer said county funding of roughly $16,000 makes up about half of her budget. The city might be able to make up some of the funding gap, depending on how large of a cut it faces, but \"our city monies can't subsidize the county users completely,\" she said. \nSpending for library services was approved by rural Pennington County votes in 1998. \nInformation from: Rapid City Journal, http://www.rapidcityjournal.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T19:22:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
