Ladbrokes will issue new shares to the private-equity owners of Gala Coral Group, after which Ladbrokes investors will own 51.75 percent of the enlarged company.\nThe transaction brings together the number two and three participants in a U.K. betting-shop industry creaking under the weight of Web-based competition. Together, the combined company will control about 45 percent of the 3.1 billion-pound betting-office market, according to estimates provided by researcher Mintel, topping William Hill Plc’s 26 percent.\n“Together, we will create a leading betting and gaming business combining strong brands with an attractive multi-channel offering and an extensive national and international coverage,” said Ladbrokes Chief Executive Officer Jim Mullen, who will run the combined group. He described the deal as a merger.\nLadbrokes also said Friday that it’s placing new shares representing 10 percent of its share capital, and that full-year operating profit will be about 20 million pounds lower than expected. It’s cutting the dividend for the year to 3 pence a share from 8.9 pence a year ago.\nOnline Threat Both companies need to strengthen. Ladbrokes in particular was slow to adapt to the online betting revolution sparked by the emergence of platforms such as Betfair Group Plc, and has seen online rivals grab a bigger share of the market, while also being weighed down by changes in tax laws. Pooling resources provides the scale needed for a fightback.\nWhile the two companies together would have a commanding position in the stagnant betting-shops market, their standing in the fast-growing online segment is much less pronounced: analysts at Exane BNP Paribas estimate that together Ladbrokes and Coral have about 10 percent of the digital market.\nThe merger is conditional on clearance by certain regulatory authorities, including the Competition and Markets Authority, Ladbrokes said.\nGala Coral’s private-equity owners include Apollo Global Management, Cerberus Capital Management, Park Square Capital and Anchorage Capital Partners. The funds have controlled the business since 2010.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:04:00.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
