It is now likely to happen every three and a half years, they said. \nIn Mannheim, Germany, a heat wave like that of the last few days would have been a once-in-a-century event in the 1900s, but is now likely to happen about every 15 years, they said. \nLondon also saw its hottest recorded July day on Wednesday, with temperatures at Heathrow Airport hitting 36.7 Celsius, the scientists noted. \nAs heat waves grow more frequent, \"it does resonate with a much wider audience that this is connected to climate change and we're facing a new normal\", said Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. \nThe heat wave analysis, which looked at five European cities, is part of a World Weather Attribution programme led by Climate Central, a U.S.-based science journalism organisation, and supported by scientists from organisations around the world, including Oxford University, the University of Melbourne, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and van Aalst's Climate Centre. \nThe programme aims to use climate and weather data, forecasting and climate models to show how changing weather patterns are linked to climate change. \nIt hopes to help cities and countries better understand and prepare for more extreme weather like this week's scorching days in Europe. \n'CALL YOUR GRANDMOTHER' \nThe Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics has predicted that on average 200 more people will die in that country each week during a heat wave, a 10 percent rise in deaths. \nDeaths among the isolated elderly are a particular problem, and accounted for a big share of the estimated 70,000 additional people who died in France and other European nations during a 2003 heat wave. \nAt that time, \"people were really caught unawares by the combination of rising risk and changing structure of society\", van Aalst said. \nTraditionally, extended families have looked after the elderly in places like France, he said. But social changes now mean many more older people live alone in cities, with no one to ensure they do basic things like drink enough water in the heat. \nCities facing heat waves are having to adjust the way they deal with the threat, including through simple measures such as sending out social media messages urging people to \"give a call to your grandmother\", van Aalst said. \nIn the Netherlands, television weather presenters now remind viewers when the country's \"heat wave plan\" - put together after a 2006 heat wave there - has been activated, and give them tips on how to stay cool, he said. \nAcross Europe, \"there's been a massive investment in such plans\", he said, alongside a range of efforts to deal with more frequent heat waves, such as adding green spaces in cities.
