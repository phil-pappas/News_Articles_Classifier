But Tsipras and his closest ally Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis have accused them of fear-mongering. \nIn an interview published Saturday the outspoken Varoufakis accused Athens's creditors of \"terrorism\". \n\"What they're doing with Greece has a name - terrorism,\" he told the Spanish El Mundo daily. \n\"What Brussels and the troika want today is for the 'Yes' (vote) to win so they could humiliate the Greeks.\" \nAs tensions rose he was forced to deny a Financial Times report that suggested Greek savers could lose 30 per cent of their bank deposits to shore up the banking system, slamming it a \"malicious rumour\". \nThe British business daily, quoting unidentified bankers and businessmen close to negotiations, reported that Greek depositors with more than 8000 euros ($A11,611) in an account may be force to take a \"haircut\". \nRumours that capital controls imposed by the government were leading to food and medicine shortages were spooking Greeks, as was growing uncertainty over when the country's banks would re-open. \n\"I've heard shops are running out of flour, sugar and salt. I'm really worried, how will we manage if we can't get to our money and there's no food to buy?\" said Lena Antoniou, a 35-year old mother of two. \nNikos Archondis from the Panhellenic Exporters Association (PEA) told AFP \"certain supermarkets are very concerned because they cannot forecast how the situation will evolve,\" adding that stocks of meat, cheeses, fruits and vegetables \"risk running low in the following weeks\". \nA defiant Tsipras told 25,000 cheering supporters at Friday's rally to \"say 'No' to ultimatums and to turn your back on those who would terrorise you,\" adding: \"No one can ignore this passion and optimism.\" \nA rival rally of 22,000 \"Yes\" supporters shouted pro-European slogans and voiced fears of a so-called \"Grexit\" from the eurozone and a return to Greece's former currency, the drachma, if Tsipras got his way. \n\"They cannot pretend any longer that it's not about leaving the euro,\" said a 43-year-old doctor who gave his first name as Nikos. \"Outside the euro lies only misery.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T12:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T23:20:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
