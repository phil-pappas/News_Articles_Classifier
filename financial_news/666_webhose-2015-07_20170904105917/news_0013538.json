Gold for August delivery lost 40 cents to $1,171.40 an ounce by 7:58 a.m. on the Comex in New York.\n“The market seems to be very certain that nothing bad will happen,” Daniel Briesemann, an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, said by phone on Tuesday. “If we do get a Grexit, then we may see some direction in the gold price.”\nWhile a traditional store of value amid crises, gold trading has been subdued even as Greece missed a deadline to repay the International Monetary Fund and creditors rebuffed last-ditch funding proposals. In a sign that Greece may reach an agreement, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras accepted creditors’ proposals as a basis for compromise to end a standoff over its bailout.\nThis year has been characterized by small moves in gold, with prices stuck in a 6 percent, or $70, trading range since March. Bullion for immediate delivery declined 1 percent in the first half, the smallest move since 2005. The metal was little changed at $1,172.46 in London on Wednesday.\nHoldings in gold-backed exchange-traded products dropped for a third day on Tuesday, bringing the second-quarter decline to 1.8 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nPalladium for September delivery in New York climbed as much as 4.2 percent, the most since April, to $700.90 an ounce. It rose a second day, extending a rebound from a two-year low.\nPlatinum for October delivery added 0.5 percent to $1,085.20 an ounce. Silver for September delivery was little changed at $15.59 an ounce, after four days of losses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T17:41:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
