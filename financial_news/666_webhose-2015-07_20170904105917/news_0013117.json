For instance we had some congestion within the Airport residential area in Accra which affected customer experience, since splitting up the traffic and migrating some customers unto the new cell sites, we have received very good reviews on our internet speed and overall quality for voice calls, he revealed. \nHe assured customers that network quality remains Tigo’s biggest priority and reiterated that over the next couple of years the company will double up its efforts to significantly expand its network and improve the experience of customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T02:14:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
