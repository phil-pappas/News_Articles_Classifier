Google does a pretty good job of working out what you're looking for, but the more specific you are the better your results will be.\nUsing operators does just that, so for example enclosing a phrase in quotation marks — \"like this\" — searches for that specific phrase, adding a minus sign excludes that word (salsa recipe — tomatoes) and using OR gives Google a choice, eg. World Cup location 2014 or 2022. You can restrict your search to a single website by using the site: operator, so for example if you wanted to look for Android content on TechRadar you might type android site:techradar.com. The define: operator, as you might expect, gives you definitions — so define:search gives you the dictionary definition of search and synonyms such as hunt, look, scout and dig. You probably already know that Google will carry out sums if you type them in the search box — 4*15 gives you 60, 2*2*3*4 gives you 48 and an on-screen calculator and so on — but it can also convert units and currencies. Convert 200 USD to rupee converts dollars to rupees, and you can also convert measurements such as distance, weight and temperature. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Google+,Google Plus,YouTube,Google Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/TOItech", "https://twitter.com/toi_tech", "http://ad.doubleclick.net/N7176/adi/TOI/TOI_ENT_ROS_ATF_Artical_Photo_300;sz=300x250;ord=", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-07-28T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:44:39.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
