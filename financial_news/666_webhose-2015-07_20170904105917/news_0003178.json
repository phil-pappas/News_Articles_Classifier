Charles Pertwee by Mercedes Ruehl Chadstone and Westfield, not Chullora or Dandenong, come to mind when the latest hot international retailer lands in Australia looking to set up shop.\nBut the industrial sector, historically the domain of warehousing, has received a shot to the arm thanks to the likes of Zara, H&M and Marks and Spencer needing to ship goods to shopfronts and to the homes of consumers, Colliers International says.\n\"This [trend] has a direct impact on the demand for industrial property, as the industrial floor space required to warehouse and manage the logistics for these goods increases accordingly,\" Malcom Tyson, Colliers managing director of industrial, said.\n\"While manufacturing has decreased in Australia, the transport and logistics sector has taken over as the major occupier of our sheds,\" Mr Tyson said.\nOver the year to date the number of leases signed by logistics and transport groups was 54 per cent. Three years ago it was 31 per cent. Even in terms of square metres the logistics and transport sector has made up nearly 40 per cent of leases over the year to date, compared with 33 per cent in 2014. The number of industrial leases signed by those in the manufacturing sector in 2014 shrunk to just 9 per cent.\nIt comes as the latest retail trade figures from the ABS for May show an increase of 0.3 per cent, taking the annual rate of growth to 4.7 per cent. This is the strongest rate of growth since November 2014. Thanks to population growth and increased housing supply the spending is being led by the household goods sector.\nMichael Bate, head of retail at Colliers, said all new retailers, no matter if they had one store or 20, were leasing warehouse space.\n\"These brands are frantically setting up networks of distribution services,\" he said. \"What is emerging is third-party logistics providers like Toll and DHL are increasingly acting as the logistics arm for the retailer in early stages. There is not much point in having a large warehouse if you only have one store in Australia. It is when they reach critical mass that they lease their own distribution warehouse.\"\n Zara, H&M and Uniqlo were some of the biggest users of warehouse space, while groups such as Forever 21 and Sephora were still using providers because their expansion was in the early stages, Mr Bate said.\nBut instead of traditional areas like Botany, these groups wanted facilities in corridors where they could capture employment and have multiple modes of freight transport, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:07:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
