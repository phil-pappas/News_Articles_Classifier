Unions say it would represent a marked change of culture for the toughly managed airline industry. \nCOCKPIT DOORS \nThe EASA task force - drawn from airlines, flight crews, doctors and aviation authorities - did not recommend changes to cockpit doors that were specially strengthened after the Sept 11, 2001, attacks in the United States. \nBut it endorsed a recent EASA recommendation that there should always be two people in the cockpit. \nFrance's BEA air crash investigation agency has found that Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz took advantage of toilet breaks by the captain, both to rehearse the manoeuvre on the previous flight and then to carry out his plan to destroy the jet after locking the captain out on the return flight 9525. \nThe BEA is investigating separately whether cockpit door-locking systems should be changed and how to balance medical confidentiality and safety, a sensitive issue in nations such as France and Germany with a strong tradition of medical privacy. \nThe medical database proposed by EASA would initially only record the dates and places of specialist 'aero-medical' check-ups and whether a pilot had been deemed fit to fly. \nThat would not have helped in the case of Lubitz, who is suspected of concealing notes written by a general practitioner, but would prevent what Ky called \"medical tourism\" or going abroad to get a favourable certificate for the pilot licence. \n\"We don't have evidence that it is a massive problem, but it is a problem,\" he said. \nEASA called for a deeper examination of medical secrecy in all 28 EU nations. Some such as Britain already advise doctors to report any concerns where public safety is at stake. \n\"We know this is going to be the most difficult topic in our recommendations, but we really believe that if nothing is done ... then the risk is still high of having pilots who are medically unfit ... continuing to be pilots,\" Ky said. \n\"When lawmakers see the balance between the right to protect personal information and the right of the public to be safely transported, I am pretty sure there are ways to deal with it.\" \nHe said the introduction of random drugs and alcohol tests for pilots and others with critical roles such as controllers would address a gap in current rules and was \"common sense\". \n(Editing by Georgina Prodhan and Pravin Char)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T16:34:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
