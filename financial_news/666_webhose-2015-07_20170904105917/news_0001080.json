At $1,848 a metric ton, the whole milk powder average is the lowest since July 2009 and close to the lowest since the auctions began in 2008. The New Zealand dollar fell more than half a U.S. cent to a fresh five-year low.\nReserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler has said that weaker prospects for dairy prices will curb farm incomes and delay inflation returning to his 2 percent target. Several economists now predict Wheeler will fully reverse last year’s four increases in the official cash rate to drive down the kiwi dollar and boost inflation from near zero.\n“Dairy weakness reaffirms our view that the RBNZ will cut the OCR to 2.5 percent this year,” Nathan Penny, rural economist at ASB Bank in Auckland, said in an e-mailed note. Still, “we view the weakness of the last two auctions as temporary, relating to Chinese stockmarket and Greek concerns,” he said.\nDairy prices have tumbled amid a global milk glut and waning demand from China, while Greece’s possible exit from the euro has rattled global markets.\nWheeler will lower the benchmark rate by a quarter point to 3 percent at his next policy decision on July 23, according to all 17 economists in a Bloomberg survey.\nFarmer Payout ANZ Bank New Zealand said it now expects Fonterra Cooperative Group, the world’s biggest dairy exporter, to pay its New Zealand farmers NZ$3.75 to NZ$4 per kilogram of milksolids this season. ASB maintained its estimate at NZ$5, while Fonterra has forecast a payout of NZ$5.25.\n“The volumes on sale are set to rise over coming months as New Zealand supply comes on stream, but demand, particularly from China, is conspicuously absent,” ANZ economists said in a note today.\nNew Zealand’s dollar traded at 66 U.S. cents at 9:30 a.m. in Wellington compared with 66.6 cents prior to the dairy auction results being published. The currency has dropped 8.4 percent since immediately before Wheeler cut the benchmark rate June 11 and said another reduction was likely.\nThe falling dollar should help to revive inflation by pushing up import prices.\n“The Reserve Bank will be pleased that the currency is doing some of the work for them, though we suspect they’d like it to do still more,” ANZ said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T01:23:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
