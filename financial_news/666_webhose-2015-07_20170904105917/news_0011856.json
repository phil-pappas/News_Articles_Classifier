PUBLISHED: 13:33, Thu, Jul 30, 2015 | UPDATED: 13:48, Thu, Jul 30, 2015 GETTY Rip-off pension fees could be capped \nThe Government also hopes to make it easier to switch nest-eggs between providers and help savers get the right advice over pensions, the Treasury said today as it today launched a consultation on exit charges and transfers. It comes after outrage over the hurdles faced by savers to access cash despite reforms in April that were designed to provide a more flexible system. Some savers had been charged large fees or been required to pay for financial advice before being able to take cash. Prime Minister David Cameron said: \"Our pension reforms were the biggest in a generation and they offer people much greater choice on how to use their hard earned savings. \n\"The aim has always been to give people more control over their money, not to create a new way of charging people. \n\"That's why we're launching this consultation because we want to ensure that pension providers are not using exit charges and restrictions as a barrier to switching just when the Government is providing pensioners with greater freedoms.\" \nPensions minister Ros Altmann recently said there was \"no excuse\" for the firms' blocking access.Experts said said every pension investor over the age of 55 should be able to access their retirement savings with the minimum of cost and administrative inconvenience.

We need a transparent and competitive retirement market where informed investors are freely able to shop around for the solutions which will suit them best.”The Government is now seeking responses from both pension specialists and consumers about penalties and the transfer process and is due to publish its findings will be published in the Autumn.
