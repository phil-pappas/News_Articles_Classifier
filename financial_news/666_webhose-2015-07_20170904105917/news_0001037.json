Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett City house prices are sharply up – to levels that would have seemed eye-watering just a few years ago. Many locals are alarmed that demand from overseas Chinese buyers is pushing those prices ever higher – and permanently out of reach for a younger generation.\nIn many inner-city residential apartment blocks, the majority of owners now seem to come from the Chinese mainland. That means those apartments are often left empty. Many Chinese see their purchases as a reliable route to investing money overseas, particularly given the rise in value, rather than as homes to move into or even to rent out.\nThe recent meltdown in the Chinese sharemarket may well have accelerated the desire to put money somewhere safer and conveniently offshore . The signs of local resentment about this are simmering already – whether via Twitter campaigns or demands for the authorities to take action to curb the level of foreign investment.\nIt's a new sentiment in what has traditionally been a proudly multicultural city welcoming of high immigration and its appeal as an attractive destination for international talent.\nNo, it's not Sydney or Melbourne. It's Vancouver, Canada. But the pattern of rapidly increasing Chinese investment in the residential market looks similar. As does community concern about the impact on prices.\nIn Canada, however, authorities have been more muted in their response. What rules there are tend to be imposed by provincial (state) governments. Unlike Australia, there are no national restrictions on purchases of existing homes by non-citizens. The Australian government has only just begun to enforce laws banning such purchases. But the Canadians keep no records of the level of foreign purchases of residential housing.\nHeritage concerns That means anecdotal evidence is driving much of the community sentiment in cities such as Vancouver. Everyone seems to have a story of mainland Chinese buying up swathes of their streets or their apartment floors, only to leave them vacant. The Canadians dismiss it as Chinese \"parking their money\" – quite different to the influx of Hong Kong Chinese who came to live in Canada in the 1990s after the British handed back their former colony to China.\n The other common suggestion is that Canada offers too easy a route for Chinese officials to avoid having assets seized as part of the anti-corruption campaign by President Xi Jinping.\nNor can this growing community resentment in Canada be countered by the Australian government's rationale – that Chinese purchases add to the stock of available housing by encouraging new development.\nGreater Vancouver, a pretty city of around 2.5 million, does have a continuing wave of apartment construction fuelling crucial growth and jobs. The number of tall new apartment blocks throughout the inner city and along various waterfronts is striking – even when compared to the fast-changing skylines of Sydney and Melbourne.\nBut many Chinese purchases are also of older houses and apartments. Homeowners talk of being regularly approached by agents and prospective buyers willing to pay generous prices if they are willing to sell. That leads to additional complaints that once-graceful suburbs are being transformed into enclaves of McMansions because of inadequate protections for heritage or traditional housing.\nA recent Reuters report Quote: s real estate agents specialising in wealthy suburbs estimating that 50 per cent to 80 per cent of their clients have financial ties to mainland China.\nPrices up 57pc The median selling price for residential housing in Vancouver is now $C1.1 million ($1.15 million), up 57 per cent over the past five years, according to data compiled by Reuters from the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver. Detached homes have risen 82 per cent over the same period to $C2.1 million, compared to an increase in median household income of 13 per cent.\nThat rate of increase may not be as much as the runaway recent annual increases in Sydney or Melbourne, where prices have gone up by more than 16 per per cent and 10 per cent in the last year alone. According to RP Data, Sydney prices are up 43 per cent since prices started to climb just over three years ago.\nIn Canada, several years of steady annual rises still add up to extremely high prices overall – with no sign of that slowing or suggestions of an unsustainable \"bubble\". Just as in Australia, record-low interest rates and lack of housing supply are driving price rises in key cities like Vancouver. But a poll showed two-thirds of metropolitan Vancouver residents also believe \"foreigners investing\" is a main cause.\nIn both countries, there are political risks attached to being labelled racist or risking offence to Beijing by singling out mainland Chinese. In May, Vancouver's city mayor did ask the British Columbia provincial government to impose a \"speculation\" tax. This was rejected on the basis of insufficient evidence of foreign investment forcing up prices and the potential for a new tax to harm existing owners.\nBut the national government has altered a separate scheme designed to attract foreign investors, almost exclusively Chinese. This allowed people to obtain Canadian permanent residency in return for investing at least $C800,000 in Canada. The Harper government has effectively closed this off by strictly limiting the sort of projects and tightening conditions for investment.\nIn its own significant investor scheme , the Australian government already had a higher threshold of $5 million for foreigners, also almost exclusively Chinese. But under new rules from July 1, investors must put some of that into venture capital and there are now strict curbs on the level of indirect investment in existing residential housing via funds. None of this is likely to stop the level of Chinese interest in the housing market of either country.\nJennifer Hewett was in Canada to attend the Australia-Canada Economic Leadership Forum.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-07-15T14:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:05:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
