You’re in luck!\" \nThe tech giant claims the update will show \"the busiest times of the week at millions of places and businesses around the world\". \nTo use the feature, search for a destination on the Google app on Android or the Chrome and Safari apps on iOS and click the \"more about\" button to open the venue's information card. \nPeople planning to pop in to Flat White, the Soho coffee shop, would do well to avoid its busiest hours: 1pm on a Monday, late afternoon on a Wednesday and pretty much all day on a Sunday. \nThe busiest times of the week at Flat White in Soho \nGoogle has explained in a previous blog post how it collects location data from its users . Smartphones that have GPS settings enabled for Google Maps send anonymous data about their movements to Google, which pools it together and sends it back out to users. \nNot everyone was impressed though. One user commented on Google's blog post: \"Add a feature that shows how fast the line is moving. Hope you added this for Disneyworld lines.﻿\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T13:49:56.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
