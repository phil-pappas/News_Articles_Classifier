The benchmark IPC index rose 0.6 percent.\nChina’s equity meltdown and turmoil in the euro zone helped reduce demand for Elementia’s initial public offering, according to Gerardo Copca, an analyst at Metanalisis SA. Concern eased Friday as the Asian nation intervened to support stocks and global markets signaled growing faith in Greece’s ability to clinch a bailout.\n“Investors wait for opportunities,” Copca said in a telephone interview. “The price of 17 pesos is a good one, and that’s what’s pushing the stock.”\nNot counting an option to increase shares, the company raised 3.4 billion pesos, below the 4.5 billion pesos based on the midpoint of the target range of 20 pesos to 25 pesos.\nElementia said it will use proceeds raised over the next 24 months mainly to bolster its cement division, according to a statement from the stock exchange. An investor-relations official for the Mexico City-based company didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T20:06:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
