We’re now seeing that advertising via social media, particularly Facebook , has become a significant part of this transition. According to a recent SurePayroll Small Business Scorecard survey of small business owners nationwide, 1 in 3 (33%) are spending money on Facebook to advertise their business. And it doesn’t stop there. As SurePayroll reports, 26% reported advertising on LinkedIn; 17% on Twitter; 6% on Instagram and 2.5% on Pinterest, with the latter two networks really in their infancy as far as ad platforms. Perhaps surprisingly, only 14% of small business owners are advertising with Google’s pay-per-click ads. \nWhy Facebook as Ad Platform? \nIt seems that Facebook is a place with a huge, broad audience that small business owners can target in very specific, sophisticated ways. Because of the huge treasure trove of data Facebook has access to, you can serve ads or promote content directly based on geographic area, income levels, hobbies and pretty much whatever niche you can imagine. Along with the 33% already using Facebook as an advertising platform, as many as 58% said they see value in advertising there. Facebook is obviously a site most everyone is familiar with and knows how to use, and the company makes it relatively easy for the average small business owner to promote things he or she has already posted. You can spend as little or as much as you want, and reach a lot of people who could be potential customers. \nThat’s not to say that Facebook is the answer to growing small business revenues, and certainly many are taking baby steps as they measure the return on investment of their spend. However, with 1 in 3 small business owners spending money to advertise on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Pinterest or Instagram, according to the SurePayroll survey, it’s hard to see the trend slowing down when you consider many of these platforms are just beginning to optimize their services. \nThey Would Spend More If They Could \nAdvertising is expensive and that’s especially important for a small business with a few employees, where cash flow is everything to the company. Most small businesses have no choice but to proceed cautiously and judiciously in how they advertise to make sure it’s getting them what they want – leads, website visits, brand awareness, engagement with customers. While only 14% said they spend on Google pay-per-click ads, 19% said they would advertise more on Google if they had the cash. Another 22% said they would spend more on search engine optimization if they could afford it. With 3 in 5 small business owners seeing the value of Facebook advertising, you could see their spending double if they start getting the results they want. But the days of sharing all the social media content your business has to offer for free are pretty much over. You have to pay to play now, as Facebook’s algorithm is only showing even your page’s following a tiny percentage of your posts. Small businesses will have to determine exactly how much budget they can dedicate to this new model. \nTaking the Right Approach to Social Media Advertising \nPart of these efforts are for simple brand awareness – putting your name in front of people, so they know who you are and what you do. The other part of it is driving someone directly to a place where they can buy a product or a service. The latter may be more difficult than the former when it comes to social media, given that people are not searching for something specific on Facebook or Twitter the way they are when they do a Google search. Instead, they’re taking in a stream of information that’s supposed to be tailored to their interests. That means as a business, you need to show them something they’re really interested in (like a great article or video) or have something to offer that is hard to pass up. It’s a delicate balance and small businesses will have to be smart about the way they approach potential customers on social media – giving them something of real value rather than just going in for the hard sell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T17:44:29.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
