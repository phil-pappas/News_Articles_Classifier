The E-1 visa is for treaty traders, and the E-2 is for treaty investors. E-1 and E-2 visas are only available to nationals of countries that have commercial treaties with the United States. \nIn order to provide a higher level of service for all applicants, the DOS is shifting processing of E-1 and E-2 visas away from Mexico City. Effective July 7, 2015, E-1 visa processing will be handled by the Consulates General in Monterrey and Tijuana, and E-2 visas will be handled by the Consulate General in Ciudad Juarez. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City will not process nonimmigrant E visa applications received in Applicant Service Centers on or after July 7, 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:29:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
