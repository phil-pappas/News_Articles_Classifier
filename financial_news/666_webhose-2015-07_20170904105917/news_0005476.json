Bloomberg Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow Navigating a Chinese banquet has always been a challenge for visiting foreigners, but Geoff Dixon has come up with a creative new approach.\nThe former Qantas boss, turned publican , was in Shanghai recently for a farewell tour prior to stepping down as chairman of Tourism Australia.\nEver respectful of a departure, Dixon's Chinese hosts were keen to share what they considered a good time with the outgoing chairman.\nThat's meant baijiu over lunch – and not the cheap stuff either.\nWe're told at one particular banquet the Chinese brought out the Maotai – known universally as the world's most expensive paint thinner (and the stuff that Mao Zedong 's Red Army used to sterilise its wounds).\nTo the untrained eye Dixon was in fine form when it came to the toasts.\nBut as Confucius is always telling us, \" You may know someone by his appearance, but you may never know what he thinks .\"\nWhen the glasses were raised with a shot of the white spirit – which runs at an invigorating 56 per cent proof – Dixon was quick to empty his.\n Then, as is customary, he gave the face a quick wipe with the wet towel placed in front of him.\nBut let's peer into the magician's hat. While appearing to tidy up any spillage, Dixon was in fact dispensing with the biajiu into the wet towel.\n\"My only concern was that if anyone lit up a cigarette the towel would go up and my cover would be blown,\" Dixon told us.\nIt's not the first time Dixon has used this trick.\n\"I always ask for a wet towel when at a Chinese banquet,\" he said.\nFor which we award him points for enterprise, as well as a life-long ban from ever calling himself a publican – much less a former journo.
