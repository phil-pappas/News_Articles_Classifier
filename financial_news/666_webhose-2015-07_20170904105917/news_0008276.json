But the project remains overshadowed by development delays that led to a fresh charge of 551 million euros in February. \nAlonso, formerly in charge of flight test operations, was appointed in January to run the group's military aircraft activities including the A400M, unmanned systems and fighters. \nHaving abandoned its own drone project, Airbus has partnered with Italy's Finmeccanica (Other OTC: FINMF - news ) and France's Dassault Aviation to explore development of a medium altitude/long endurance surveillance drone, MALE 2020. \nFrance, Germany and Italy agreed in March to back a two-year definition phase and the companies hope this will lead to full development and initial deliveries early next decade. \nBut Alonso expressed frustration at lead times involved in developing drones for European market. \n\"Why does it take so long to define what you want? Why does it take 2 years to decide if this MALE has one or two engines, whether it has propellers or jets? Why does it take 5 years before we build it? I am challenging all that,\" Alonso said. \nAsked whether Airbus was looking at other options, he told Reuters: \"We are looking at everything. We won't give up the idea that we should be able to do things more simply and cheaply.\" \nAirbus has denied a recent report that it threatened to leave the project.
