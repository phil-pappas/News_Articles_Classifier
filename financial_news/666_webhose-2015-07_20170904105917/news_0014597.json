Shark!\" to alert the other children and adults swimming nearby to get out of the water. \nThe shark then sank its teeth into Thornton's back. He punched it three times before it let go. \nTo make matters worse, Thornton spotted three other sharks in the vicinity, apparently attracted to the blood in the water. \nInjured, Thornton placed himself between the shark and his son, who couldn't move because he was so afraid. Thornton managed to push his kid toward the beach. \nThen, the shark struck again, sinking its jaws once more into his back. He elbowed the shark in the nose before it released its grip so he could make it back to the beach. \nParamedics arrived and took him to S entara Norfolk General Hospital with puncture wounds in his back and 10 inches of missing skin above his right ankle. On Monday, he was listed in serious condition, the Virginia-Pilot report said. \nThornton was the fifth shark attack victim in North Carolina in June. The sixth attack happened the day after his, according to the report. \nThornton appears to work for JPMorgan in the Charlotte, according to his LinkedIn and FINRA/public records. \nCheck out this cellphone footage from MyFox8 of Thornton being treated on shore: \nAnd here's what another eye witness shared on Twitter: \nI had my directions all messed up #shark attack was just North of #avon pier. pic.twitter.com/x0wI2t7CUi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T19:16:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
