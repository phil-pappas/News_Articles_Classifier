Bloomberg Share on twitter by Tony Boyd Investors in Australian banks will get a shock when they read the latest batch of documents detailing the performance and prospects for National Australia Bank's United Kingdom banking business .\nThose used to the local banking market with its high return on equity numbers, low cost to income ratios, high credit quality and substantial market share across product categories will choke at the sight of the Clydesdale Bank.\nIt has a cost to income ratio of 71 per cent compared to about 45 per cent in Australia and return on tangible equity of about 8 per cent compared to ROE in Australia in the mid to high teens.\nBut the 540 pages worth of material published by NAB on Tuesday, ahead of an insitutitonal briefing in London, contain sufficient positive information to give NAB shareholders confidence they can finally be rid of a long standing problem.\nThe Clydesdale Bank may not reach the high performance benchmarks set by the major banks in Australia but it is lifting its game.\nOver the past three years, Clydesdale has reshaped its loan book and pulled out of commercial real estate. That segment was a source of impaired assets.\nIt has restored the quality of its loans. The ratio of non-performing loans has fallen from 2.48 per cent to 1.6 per cent.\nAlso, it has strengthened its capital and restored profitability.\n There remains uncertainty about the final cost of Clydesdale's mistreatment of customers despite NAB providing £1.7 billion in capital support and £700 million of untilised conduct provisions.\nChief financial officer, Craig Drummond, said on Tuesday that conditions for the demerger and initial public offering of Clydesdale were favourable given the liquidity in markets and institutional interest in bank stocks.\nThe most recent example of a successful bank IPO in the UK was the sale last year of TSB. It was soon followed by a succesful takeover offer from Spain's Banco de Sabadell for £1.7 billion in March.\nClydesdale is worth between $3.4 billion and $4 billion depending on the earnings multple applied to the business, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank. That represents a range of between 93¢ and $1.12 a share for NAB.\nAs a director of the Geelong Football Club, Drummond knows what it is like to have a challenger brand and that is how NAB is marketing the Clydesdale to potential UK buyers.\nDisclosure: The author's super fund owns shares in NAB.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-07-07T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:09:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
