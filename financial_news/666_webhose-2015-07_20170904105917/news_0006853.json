The regionally-focused companies will retain their own brands. \nThe offer values R Cable, which is majority owned by private equity firm CVC (Taiwan OTC: 4744.TWO - news ) , at around 10.9 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), a similar valuation to Euskaltel's stock market listing earlier this month, the company said. \nThe agreement has been authorised by the boards of both companies and is subject to due diligence and regulator approval. \nAnalysts had long expected further tie-ups amongst small companies in Spain's cable market, where Vodafone is the biggest player following its Ono purchase in March. \nTelecable, a cable company in the northern region of Asturias majority-owned by U.S. private equity fund Carlyle , is the last remaining independent player. \nEuskatel's main shareholders are former savings bank Kutxabank, Italian-owned private investors International Cable and Spanish utility Iberdrola.
