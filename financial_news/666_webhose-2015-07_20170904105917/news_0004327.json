Supplied by Craig Tansley Here are five first-class courses you might not have heard of but must play – if only because your workmates probably haven't heard of them either.\nRoyal Isabela, Puerto Rico Built as it is on a cliff-top plateau overlooking the sea, the comparisons to California's Pebble Beach are almost inevitable – but where Pebble Beach is home to three large resort hotels, Puerto Rico's Royal Isabela offers just 20 rooms for visitors. And with fewer than 100 members, the course is always empty – something you won't discover at Pebble Beach. The dream of two Puerto Rican brothers, Royal Isabela is built along clifftops above the Atlantic Ocean in Puerto Rico's north-west, an area more famous for surfing. Golfers can sample some of the Caribbean's best waves – the world surfing tour even came to Isabela in 2010.\nIt's easy to get to Royal Isabela from Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan. But once you're here you're part of an exclusive and close-knit golfing community. Just 20 luxury casitas are built here – they're terraced into the hillside to give each stunning ocean views. There's also a farm, a nursery and hiking and biking trails on the property.\nRoyal Isabela is built on a cliff-top plateau overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. Diana de Lucia The tropical links-style course plays out across the existing contours and natural features of the rugged Caribbean coastline. There's a variety of tee-boxes to make the course as challenging as you want it to be. But with gaping canyons that drop 100 metres into the Atlantic and stunning par-three island greens, don't forget to stock up on golf balls at the pro shop.\nGetting there : Fly to Puerto Rico's international airport in San Juan via Los Angeles with Qantas ( www.qantas.com.au ) and code-share partner American Airlines (www.americanairlines.com), then take a 90-minute transfer to Royal Isabela.\nStaying there : There are 20 luxurious casitas with dip pools overlooking the Atlantic on site, as well as fine-dining restaurant La Casa.\nMore information : www.royalisabela.com\n Mukul, Nicaragua's first five-star resort. Supplied Cape Wickham Links, King Island, Australia Cape Wickham Links could become the most revered golf course in world golf – and yet, you'll find it on an island far better known for its prized dairy cows. King Island – off Tasmania's remote north-west cape – isn't where you'd expect to find the world's most anticipated seaside course. But the global golf community is counting down the days to the opening of Cape Wickham Golf Course on October 30, so book now. Built along 160 hectares of absolute beach frontage, with all 18 holes offering stunning views of Bass Strait, Cape Wickham is set to become one of Australia's best golf courses.\nFew courses in the world play out so closely among the ocean. On the 18th hole the beach at Victoria Cove even comes into play, beside surfers who take to the island's famous waves. Tee shots require confident strokes across thick coastal vegetation or over the ocean itself just to reach the fairway.\nKing Island is pushing to become Australia's No 1 golf destination with the completion of another eagerly anticipated golf course, Ocean Dunes, later in 2015. There's also a third course on the cards – designed by Greg Norman. Famous as a surfing destination – you're only 10 kilometres from Martha Lavinia at Cape Wickham, a wave ranked in the top 10 surfing spots on Earth – for golfers who love to surf there will soon be no better holiday destination on the planet.\nThe par-three No 3 hole overlooking the Bay of Puget Sound at Chambers Bay golf course, Washington. Joe Robbins Getting there : King Island Airlines fly daily from Melbourne, www.kingislandair.com.au or book a charter flight with Air Adventure, www.airadventure.com.au or Flight Group, www.flightgroup.com.au\nStaying there : Book a private beachside house nestled among the dunes, www.kingislandbreaks.com.au\nMore information : www.capewickham.com.au\nThe Bluffs Ho Tram Strip, Vietnam The Kinloch Club is New Zealand's most challenging golf course. Desmond Frith Vietnam is fast becoming the golfing world's new mecca – just a decade ago there was barely a single golf club, but now more than 65 courses are at some stage of development. In 2012 Vietnam was voted Undiscovered Golf Destination of the Year by the International Association of Golf Travel Operators, but now the secret's well and truly out. The best of all new courses in Vietnam – or in Asia for that matter – can be found on the southern coast of the country, two hours drive south of Ho Chi Minh City.\nOpened to the public in December, The Bluffs Ho Tram Strip has fast become one of the world's highest-regarded links courses. Designed by Greg Norman, it straddles the South Vietnamese coastline in Bay Ria-Vung Tau Province. Built on a rugged coastal plateau, it varies in elevation by more than 50 metres, providing golfers with an undulated, complicated lay-out with the kinds of tiered greens that can lead even professional golfers to despair. The Bluffs is as pretty a course as you'll see on the entire Asian continent. Built between the sea and lush surrounding forest, it twists and turns its way across dwarfing seaside sand dunes that swallow tee-shots whole. When the wind gets up there's no bigger challenge in Asian golf.\nAnd there's more than the course to sample – the Bluffs Ho Tram Strip is home to a 541-room five-star hotel, 10 restaurants, and even a casino, so you'll never be starved for night-time options, while Ho Chi Minh City is just 80 kilometres away.\nGetting there : Fly to Ho Chi Minh City with Vietnam Airlines, www.vietnamairlines.com and Bluffs Ho Tram Strip is a two-hour drive from the airport.\nStaying there : Stay in a luxurious suite overlooking the South China Sea, www.thebluffshotram.com/granhotramstrip.html\nMore information : www.thebluffshotram.com\nBandon Dunes, Oregon, US If there's such a thing as Golfing Disneyland then surely you'll find it on a secluded strip of coastline in the north-western United States. Straddling the wild, windy coast of Oregon on the United States' west coast, Bandon Dunes is home to five of the world's best links-style courses – all on the one gigantic property. There's also six restaurants on site, golf-themed lounge bars and luxurious cottages looking across the golf courses and the wild coastline.\nModern golf was born on the wild, wind-swept links courses of Scotland more than five centuries ago, so in keeping with tradition the five courses here are built in homage to Scotland's traditional layouts. You'll have to consider nature on every shot you play at Bandon Dunes, with intricate sloping greens and fairways and a layout that requires careful planning before every stroke.\nStarting with one course in 1999, the site is now home to North America's best links courses, as well as a 13-hole par-three course and an 18-hole 10,000-square-metre putting course. Even the resort's practise centre spreads across 20 hectares and includes a nine-hole par-three practise course.\nGetting there : Fly to San Francisco, then to Southwest Oregon Regional Airport in North Bend with United Express, www.united.com . The course is a 30-minute transfer from the airport.\nStaying there : Stay in a cottage with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking surrounding lakes. There's also fine dining available at Gallery Restaurant featuring Pacific north-west cuisine, www.bandondunesgolf.com\nMore information : www.bandondunesgolf.com\nThe Kinloch Club, New Zealand While Cape Kidnappers and Kauri Cliffs attract the lion's share of plaudits in world golf for their stunning design, New Zealand's most challenging course has always seemed to slip under the radar. And yet it is New Zealand's best links-style course. And it's the only course in New Zealand designed by the world's most celebrated golfer and golf course designer, Jack Nicklaus. And it's just a short helicopter ride (or it's 25 minutes by car if you prefer to stay on terra firma) from one of the world's most celebrated lodges, Huka Lodge.\nThe Kinloch Club is perched right on New Zealand's largest lake, Lake Taupo, in the middle of the North Island. It's rarely busy at Kinloch, so playing here can be a lonely experience out among rolling hills that fringe the course and across pasture land where cows and sheep watch on between mouthfuls of grass and wild geese have right of way across fairways. New Zealand's most accomplished golfer, Sir Bob Charles, calls Kinloch the No 1 course in New Zealand. \"For those unable to play the great links courses of Scotland, Kinloch compares with the best of them,\" Charles says. The course is a tricky proposition, with heavily undulating tiered greens and tee shots that require precision over power.\nThe Kinloch Club aso has a luxurious lodge now that's a modern version of Kinloch Castle in Scotland. Each room has framed views of Lake Taupo and there's a fine-dining restaurant on site.\nGetting there : Fly to Auckland or Wellington, then on to Taupo with Air New Zealand ( www.airnewzealand.com.au ). Kinloch Golf Course is a 20-minute drive from town.\nStaying there : The Kinloch Club offer suites and villas beside the golf course, www.thekinlochclub.com.
