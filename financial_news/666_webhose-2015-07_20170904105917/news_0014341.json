Chile's government said it will inject $225 million in capital into state-owned copper miner Codelco, also the world's top miner of the metal, to help fund its ambitious investment plans.\nIn London and China, copper prices fell around 4 percent in June. Shanghai Futures Exchange copper is now at 42,230 yuan ($6,810) a tonne, up 0.7 percent from the previous close.\n\"Physical demand is low with in-warehouse premiums generally below $20 worldwide,\" said broker Triland in a note.\nAmong other metals, ShFE zinc and lead climbed 2 percent, while ShFE nickel and tin were up more than 1.5 percent. LME tin slipped 0.8 percent after surging 4.5 percent on Wednesday.\nMore buying is waiting at least for aluminium, lead and zinc, whose chart pictures were improving, traders said.\nInvestors, however, remained cautious amid uncertainty over whether Greece can step back from an economic abyss after its debt default to the International Monetary Fund, and doubts over its future in the euro zone.\nA defiant Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has urged Greeks to reject an international bailout deal, wrecking any prospect of repairing broken relations with European Union partners before a referendum on Sunday that may decide Greece's future in Europe.\nPRICES\nThree month LME copper\nMost active ShFE copper\nThree month LME aluminium\nMost active ShFE aluminium\nThree month LME zinc\nMost active ShFE zinc\nThree month LME lead\nMost active ShFE lead\nThree month LME nickel\nMost active ShFE nickel\nThree month LME tin\nMost active ShFE tin\n($1 = 6.2008 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Melanie Burton; Editing by Ed Davies )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T06:36:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
