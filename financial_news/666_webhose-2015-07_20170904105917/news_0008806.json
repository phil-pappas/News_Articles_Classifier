How are Greece's newspapers covering the No camp's win? \nMany Greeks celebrated last night as poll results showed that 61pc of people voted no to the bail-out deal laid out by Greece's creditors. Antonis Samaras, former prime minister and, until yesterday, conservative opposition leader, then announced his resignation. How did the Greek papers cover the momentous day? \n• Follow the latest news from the Greece crisis • Defiant Greeks reject EU demands as Syriza readies IOU currency \n= Kathimerini = \n\"Agreement or Grexit after the strong 'no'\" reads the bold headline on the centre-right newspaper Kathimerini, alongside a chart showing that 61.34pc of Greeks voted against the bail-out conditions, compared to 38.6pc who voted in favour. The right-hand column tells how the curtain fell on Antonis Samaris' political career shortly after 11pm \"under the crushing weight of the results of the referendum\". \n= Avgi = \nThe newspaper of Alexis Tsipras' anti-austerity Syriza party which had vocally encouraged a \"no\" vote and even placed the \"no\" box higher than the \"yes\" box on the ballot paper splashes with the celebratory headline, \"61pc NO to austerity\". \nThe left-wing paper called Avgi, which means The Dawn quotes Mr Tsipras on the front cover above throngs of people waving Greek flags. \n= Typos = \nThe centre-right Eleftheros Typos, translated as Free Press, calls the referendum result \"a great victory\" for the \"no\" camp, cementing Mr Tsipras' place as the most powerful man in the country, but warned that it is \"equally clear that this success will be extremely difficult to manage by the Prime Minister abroad, as our country enters great danger\". \nThe daily Athenian newspaper also reports on Yanis Varoufakis' resignation as finance minister and Antonis Samaras stepping down as leader of opposition party the New Republic. \n= Ethnos = \nThe centrist newspaper Ethnos called the 61.3pc result an \"earthquake\" that has \"formed a new political landscape in the country, giving the prime minister a mandate\". It reports that Mr Tsipras pictured behind the blue curtain of a polling booth has \"started contacts with foreign leaders, recognising that there are no easy solutions and that the mandate of the Greek people was not to rupture but to strengthen the bargaining power to achieve a sustainable agreement.\" \n= Journal of Authors = \nThe Journal of Authors (EtS) took an editorial decision that words were unnecessary. It splashed with a picture of Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the Eurogroup, looking shocked, with the outcome of the vote printed in bold colours. The Dutch politician issued a statement last night calling the results of the referendum \"very regrettable for the future of Greece\". \n= Ta Nea =", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T12:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T13:38:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
