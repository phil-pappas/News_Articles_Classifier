F, +1.75% is responding to surging demand for high-end pickups by introducing a Limited version of the F-150 that will start at about $60,000 and likely top $70,000 when loaded with options.\nFord Slide 2 of 7 The F-150 Limited, which Ford was unveiled in Los Angeles, will go on sale this winter as a 2016 model. Its features include 22-inch polished aluminum wheels, Mojave leather seats and interior accents made of aluminum and fiddleback eucalyptus. Each truck’s production number is laser-engraved in a VIN plate on the center console lid.\n“The F-150 Limited sets a new bar for what discerning customers should expect in a high-end truck,” Raj Nair, Ford’s product development chief, said in a statement. “We’re adding segment-exclusive technology, and features that improve productivity, convenience and capability with distinctive style.”\nFord Slide 3 of 7 Ford offered a Limited trim on the 2013 and 2014 F-150, at a starting price of about $53,000, but discontinued it when introducing the aluminum-bodied 2015 model.\nIn the first half of this year, Ford said 60% of F-series sales were so-called high-series trims: Lariat, King Ranch and Platinum. As a result, the truck’s average transaction price has jumped 9% to $44,100 from a year ago.\nFord Slide 4 of 7 Though the Limited trim isn’t expected to sell in large numbers, it gives Ford another way to maximize revenue from the hugely profitable F-series lineup. Its starting price is about $10,000 more than that of the Chevrolet Silverado High Country, $8,000 more than a Ram 1500 Limited and the same as a BMW X6.\nPricing will be announced later this summer.\nFord Slide 5 of 7 “There’s a lot of people who buy trucks as both a work tool and a status symbol,” said Karl Brauer, senior director of insights for Kelley Blue Book. “You have a lot of wealthy businesspeople who have the money to buy an extremely capable and extremely luxurious truck. It’s not any financial stretch for these people to spend 50 or 70 grand.”\nFord Slide 6 of 7 Ford sold about 190,000 F series for more than $50,000 last year, TrueCar estimated, outselling BMW’s 3, 5 and 7 series combined and the entire Audi brand.\nFord Slide 7 of 7 The F-150 Limited will have a 3.5-liter, EcoBoost V-6 engine, which is a $400 option on the King Ranch and Platinum trims. It will have a unique grille, raised “Limited” lettering on the hood and a satin-chrome exterior accents. The interior contains massaging front seats, a Sony 10-speaker sound system and scuff plates with “ice blue” backlighting.\nThe article “Ford revives high-end Limited F-150 for 2016” first appeared on Automotive News.\nPrev Page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Next Page You Might Like", "external_links": ["http://www.autonews.com/article/20150721/OEM04/150729986/ford-revives-high-end-limited-f-150-for-2016", "http://www.autonews.com/"], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T18:19:31.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
