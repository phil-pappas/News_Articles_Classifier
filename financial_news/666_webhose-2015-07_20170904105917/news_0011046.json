Be warned this is a PDF file with over 100 pages of tables and data, but the one table that caught my eye was Table C7 : Chartered banks: Quarterly classification of non-mortgage loans (I have included a somewhat transcribed version at the end of this article). \nAs with all data, many different lemma, theories and ideas can be implied or inferred, but I will attempt to make two simple comparisons: Borrowed money for investing compared to Car Rentals Investing vs. Funds held on Credit Cards \nHere are two harder to read graphs, that show the trends for the past 10 years (including Q1 in 2015), the big table of the real data is at the end of the article (as well). Car Leases and Credit Cards are what we borrow for (not to build wealth) \nIf you can make out the colours and such, you will see the really big increase in Credit Card and Vehicle Debt over the 10 years and the very small increase in loans to borrow for RRSPs and General investing. I am not really a big fan to borrow to build wealth , and it seems most Canadians don’t think of that, but holy cow, we do want to borrow to buy “things” like Vehicles, Mobile Homes and “stuff” on our Credit Cards. \nThe numbers are telling: Private Passenger vehicle loans in 2005 were about $15,577,000,000 but now they are $72,961,000,000 almost quintupled over 10 years (2 complete doublings) For Credit Cards $38,922,000,000 in 2005 but by 2010 $75,738,000,000 almost 1 complete doubling in 10 years. \nWhat does this really mean? I guess we Canadians love our cars, love our stuff, and are wary of borrowing money to invest? (yes an over simplification, but the numbers do seem to point in that direction. The Big Table from the Bank of Canada \nI do suggest having a look at this data on line as well: Table C7 : Chartered banks: Quarterly classification of non-mortgage loans Millions of Dollars Loans to Canadian individuals for Non-Business Purposes To Purchase Securities To Purchase Consumer Goods and other Personal Services Total", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T00:24:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
