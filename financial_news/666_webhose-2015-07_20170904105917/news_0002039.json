Barclays promises Sir Mike Rake will stay until a new chief is found By Tim Wallace | Telegraph – 14 minutes ago 280.80 +2.7500 \nThe bank reassures investors that their deputy chairman is not going to leave a hole in leadership at the top \nSir Mike Rake is to stay at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) until a new chief executive is found, the bank promised on Thursday, seeking to reassure investors that the deputy chairman is not about to add to the turmoil at the top of the lender. \nSir Mike is taking up a new role as chairman of payments processer Worldpay alongside his position as chairman of BT, and is planning to step down from Barclays after seven years on the board. \nOn Wednesday, it was revealed that Sir Mike would be taking up his new role at Worldpay in September. Barclays also released a statement to the press, denying that he was leaving the lender imminently and would be “a member of the board until at least the end of 2015”. \nHowever, on Thursday the bank put out another statement, this time to the markets, stressing that he would not be leaving until a new chief executive was in place to replace Antony Jenkins, who was sacked last week after almost three years in the job. \n“Barclays wishes to make clear that Sir Michael Rake will continue to serve on the Barclays boards as deputy chairman and senior independent director until such time as a new group chief executive is in post, John McFarlane has reverted to the role of non-executive chairman and a replacement senior independent director is in place,” the bank said. \n“This is to ensure that the highest standards of corporate governance are maintained. Any conflict of interest which may arise in respect of his chairmanship of Worldpay will be managed in the normal manner. \nExecutive chairman John McFarlane said he wants to \"re-energise\" the bank \nMr Jenkins was fired on the day of the summer Budget by the board, led by Mr McFarlane, who has taken up the position of executive chairman. \nMr McFarlane plans to push through a series of organisational reforms in a bid to make Barclays more efficient. He is expected to set out a refreshed set of reforms to the investment banking arm, which has struggled to make good returns in recent years. \nThe executive chairman said last week that this would take some time, and that he was “in no massive rush” to appoint a new chief executive and return to the chairman’s traditional oversight, strategy and governance role. \nAs a result, Barclays is not expected to appoint a new chief executive until next year and Sir Mike will remain at the bank until then.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T17:48:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
