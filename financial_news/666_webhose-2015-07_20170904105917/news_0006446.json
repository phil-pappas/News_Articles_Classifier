With wages showing early signs of a pick-up and U.S. unemployment down to 5.3 percent, he set a high bar for delaying a hike. \nOnly if labour markets unexpectedly weaken, if core inflation starts to drop off, or if the wage gains dissipated, \"those would be the things that would make me want to pause and wait and see whether there is further evidence,\" he said. \nRosengren, who does not have a vote on policy this year, predicted core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation to rise to 1.3 percent by year end, from 1.2 percent now, and for it to hit about 1.6 percent by the end of 2016. \nHe expects gross domestic product (GDP) to rebound to about 2.75 percent in the second half of this year. \"But that could certainly go off track if we get an international shock that changes people's confidence,\" he said. \nThe predictions, he said, show \"only modest\" improvement in inflation and they assume some tightening in labour markets. \"That might make me start tightening, but exactly what the timing of that occurs depends\" on incoming data, he added. \nIf \"international shocks turn out to not to be negative at all that would be very good news,\" Rosengren said. \n(Reporting by Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Diane Craft)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:47:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
