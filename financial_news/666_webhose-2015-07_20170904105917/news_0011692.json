Jeremy Piper Both projects come at a time when Australian business is starting to feel mildly confident about Australia's energy future with the RET deal delivering much-needed certainty to the sector. Moreover, both wind developments play to the country's natural resource strengths.\nWind speeds GE's sales and finance managing director for Australia and New Zealand, Jason Willoughby, says Australia is blessed with great renewable energy resources – both from a wind perspective and from a solar perspective.\n\"I speak to colleagues in the US and in Europe and we compare what the wind speeds in Australia are, and they're amazed that they're so good and well located to where the load is.\"\n Speaking about the RET deal, Willoughby says it is the single biggest factor in providing a path forward for the renewables sector.\n\"Now that we've got that policy certainty and importantly, it's bipartisan support for that policy, it clears a way for Australia to start really making inroads into our renewable energy target.\n\"What will work best is setting the target; taking away the biennial reviews and saying to industry: 'Go figure out the lowest-cost solution to achieve this target.' This will give the private sector the opportunity to come in and innovate. Innovate from a technology perspective and also from a business model perspective.\"\nFundamental change According to Willoughby, the energy sector is undergoing more fundamental change than it has seen in the past 100 years. He says the rapid changes in technology are creating new alternatives and opportunities, and there's also now a real focus around environmental impacts and Australia is well placed to reap the benefits.\nYet while Willoughby is bullish, he says it's very hard to accurately predict exactly what the future holds because we don't know where technology might take the sector.\n\"We don't know where it's all going to end up. For example, no one would have ever predicted $2 gas in the US – that came about as a technological change and the development of shale gas. And no one would have predicted what the price of solar is today – again, through technological change and being able to bring those costs down.\n\"Now we have advances in battery technology and storage, which are still to be fully developed and commercialised.\"\nIndividual markets Moreover, the global energy story is going to play out according to individual markets. Willoughby says there is no global panacea for energy. Each market is driven to an extent by its own natural resources.\n\"In the US, where there is abundant gas and a focus on environmental protection and regulation around coal-fired plants, you're going to end up with a mix of electricity generation that's going to skew towards gas.\"\nAlternatively, he says somewhere like Indonesia, which is bringing on 35 gigawatts of new capacity, is devoting more than half of this new generation to coal.\n\"In Papua New Guinea, where, given their topography and their geography, it's very much a distributor's story. Only 10 per cent of the people have electricity. They're not going to have centralised generation with transmission systems. They're going to have distributed power focused on remote rural areas. And that'll be a different technology solution again.\n\"It's all very much a market by market response.\"\nImportantly for Australia, Willoughby said the renewable energy taregt will unlock upwards of $10 billion of investment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T00:56:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
