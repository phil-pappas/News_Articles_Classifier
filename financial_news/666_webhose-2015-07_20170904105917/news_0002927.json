We have only been strong on the textile front. It's high time we leveraged on the remaining 6400 products that enjoy tax-free access to the US market,\" said Ms Wakiaga adding that Kenya needs to invest in value addition to sharpen its competitiveness even in the absence of such preference treatment. \nKenya's exports to the US stood at Ksh38 billion, attributable largely to the Agoa trade agreement, which was recently renewed for another 10 years. \nThe Agoa window, introduced by former President Bill Clinton's administration in 2000, allows Kenya and other African countries to export more than 6,000 goods to the US without paying taxes. \nLast year, Kenya for first time bought more goods from the United States than it did from the whole of Africa, underlining growing commercial ties that are expected to deepen with the entrepreneurship summit. \nUS exports to Kenya rose to Ksh168 billion last year compared to the Ksh146 billion worth of goods and services that came from Africa, according to data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS). \nThis made America Kenya's third largest source of its imports, behind China and India. \n\"Direct flights to the US will also help increase activity between the two countries,\" said Ms Wakiaga.
