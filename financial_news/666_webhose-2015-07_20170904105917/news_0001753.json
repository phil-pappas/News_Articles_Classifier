In the 53-member Gondia Parishad, NCP had won 20 seats, the Congress 16 and the BJP 17. Cobbling up a quick post-poll alliance, the Congress and the BJP have bagged the two top posts of Zilla Parishad president and vice-president, leaving the NCP out in the cold. Maharashtra Congress president Ashok Chavan has termed the development as \"purely local\" and has sought a report on the Gondia alliance from the party unit in Gondia. On the other hand, Shiv Sena, which is an alliance partner in the state government with BJP has termed, the partnership in Gondia, as a 'miracle' that will affect state politics. The party, in an editorial in its mouthpiece, 'Saamana', said, \"Taking a decision of this magnitude requires a lot of courage. Our ally has shown that it has the courage. We do not have any doubts that Maharashtra's problems like unemployment, farmers' woes will be solved with the blink of an eye.\" \"It seemed that there was no reason to doubt the intentions of this clean, cultured and soft party (BJP) because it took its lessons from the Sangh (RSS),\" the editorial said. NCP in Gondia and Congress in Bhandara had unseated BJP in a comprehensive manner, in the Zilla Parishad elections held on 30th June. In Bhandara, in the 52-member house, Congress won 19 seats, NCP 15, BJP 13 and Shiv Sena won one seat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T17:06:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
