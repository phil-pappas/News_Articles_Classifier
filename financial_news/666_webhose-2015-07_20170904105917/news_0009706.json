Stocks pared their advance after the rating company cited increased political uncertainty amid the country’s largest-ever corruption probe.\n“Investors are just buying stocks that look attractive after the steep decline of the past few days,” Hersz Ferman, an economist at brokerage Elite Corretora, said by phone from Rio de Janeiro. “That doesn’t mean any change in the outlook for Brazil as prospects for the economy remain very negative.”\nThe shares entered a bull market in April, after rallying more than 20 percent from this year’s low, on speculation that government measures would help shore up the budget and avoid the loss of Brazil’s investment-grade status. Since then, they’ve dropped 12 percent as President Dilma Rousseff struggles to tame above-target inflation and stimulate growth amid a widening bribery probe at the state oil company.\nThe stock gauge rose 1.5 percent to 49,477.61 at 1:30 p.m. in Sao Paulo. Lenders Itau Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA advanced at least 1.2 percent after their valuation discount to the Ibovespa had widened to more than 40 percent.\nThe Ibovespa also rose Tuesday as miner Vale SA rebounded from a decade low amid a jump in iron ore. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the oil producer at the center of Brazil’s biggest corruption scandal, climbed for the first time in eight days.\nPulp producers Fibria Celulose SA and Suzano Papel e Celulose SA rallied as a currency slide to a 12-year low improved the outlook for exports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:41:49.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
