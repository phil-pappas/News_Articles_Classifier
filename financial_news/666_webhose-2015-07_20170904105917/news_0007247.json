A European source said, however, that the document was not distributed at Saturday's meeting. \nFears are mounting meanwhile that the results of Friday's parliamentary vote in Athens could have critically weakened the Greek government's ability to quickly legislate on the reforms as demanded by the eurozone. \nTsipras won the backing of 251 out of 300 deputies in the Greek parliament for his reform plans, even though they are similar to the ones that Greeks rejected in last week's referendum. \nBut three senior government figures were among 10 MPs who abstained or voted against, and several others from the ruling leftist Syriza party stayed away, prompting commentators to predict a government shake-up. \nGreece's debt is now worth nearly 180 percent of the country's GDP and on June 30 it became the first advanced economy to default on a payment to the International Monetary Fund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T13:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T13:49:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
