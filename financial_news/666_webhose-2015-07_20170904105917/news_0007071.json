It was announced in the same speech that the Chancellor set out a “triple lock” that would safeguard taxpayers against a rise in VAT, national insurance or income tax for the next five years. \n“Insurance companies collect this tax, so it’s an easy job for the Chancellor to add money to the bottom line without having to lift a finger,” said Graham Trudghill, head of corporate affairs at the British Insurance Brokers' Association. \n“David Cameron has been quite strong on lowering the price of car insurance, but this means it will increase.” \nThe Government said in 2012 it would support the industry to drive down the cost of whiplash claims by introducing tougher regulations on diagnoses and a ceiling on legal costs. In this week’s Budget, the Chancellor went further by announcing a review of claims management companies and a forthcoming cap on their charges. \nIt also backed the Competition Commission’s criticism of the car insurance market in 2013, when it found that providers were charging too much for repairs and hire cars. \nThe cost of comprehensive car insurance has fallen from £726 in 2012 to £530 in the first quarter of 2015, according to the AA, although some insurers have reported pressure to start raising premiums to pay for increased claims. The cost of buildings insurance has fallen from almost £140 to £113 in the same period. \n“The contention that falling premiums somehow justifies the tax increase is outrageous,” said Janet Connor, managing director of AA Insurance. “Premiums are beginning to rise again and the additional IPT burden will make insurers think again about their pricing. I would not be surprised to see an overall increase of 10pc or more by the end of the year and continuing upward pressure into 2016.\" \n“We think this will for the most part be passed through to customers, though it might make it slightly more difficult to lift prices further,” said Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) analyst Oliver Steel. \nProviders of life insurance, which is exempt from the premium tax, were also the subject of a major tax change in the Budget. Adding more details to last year’s overhaul of pensions rules , offering greater flexibility for retirees and their pension providers, Mr Osborne confirmed that tax relief will be tapered off for pension contributions of those earning more than £150,000. \nThe change will generate £260m in extra taxes next year, rising to £1.28bn by 2020. The Government will also consult on broader changes to the pensions industry. \nMr Steel at Deutsche said the change could reduce asset growth at savings groups including Standard Life (LSE: SL.L - news ) and St James’s Place by 0.3pc a year, knocking profits by 0.7pc. However, the drop in corporation tax from 20pc to 18pc is expected to partly offset the effect. Meanwhile, the Government delayed plans to bring in a secondary market for pensioners to trade in their annuities until 2017, following warnings from the industry that rushing the scheme could risk harming consumers. \nThe blue-chip insurance and savings groups were gaining ground on Thursday, outperforming a broadly rising FTSE 100. \nAviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) , which sells general and life insurance, rose almost 4pc on Thursday, building on a 3.5pc increase on the day of the Budget. Wealth manager St James’s Place, Prudential (HKSE: 2378.HK - news ) and Legal & General (LSE: LGEN.L - news ) each rose by more than 3pc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T21:38:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
