It voided the convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson.\nAlexandra Shapiro, a lawyer for Whitman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nProsecutors accused Whitman of trading illegally in Google Inc and video conferencer Polycom Inc based on tips from former Intel Corp employee Roomy Khan. They also said Whitman relied on consultant Karl Motey for tips from insiders at chipmaker Marvell Technology Group Ltd .\nThe 2nd Circuit upheld Whitman's conviction in February 2014.\nBut Whitman, 57, said the Newman ruling undermined prosecutors' theory that he traded on tips to maintain relationships with friends.\nHe said this called into question Rakoff's pre-trial refusal to dismiss the indictment and the judge's instructions to the jury after testimony ended.\nIn rejecting these arguments, Rakoff called Whitman's view of the Newman ruling \"overbroad,\" a view the judge said others challenging their convictions share. Whitman had been \"aware\" that Khan and Motey expected personal benefits by giving him tips, Rakoff said.\nRakoff also rejected what he called Whitman's contention that Carter Phillips, the prominent Supreme Court litigator, may have provided constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel by not raising the personal benefit issue during the prior appeal.\n\"The sheer poverty of Whitman's motion (not to mention chutzpah) is illustrated by the fact that his present counsel is reduced to arguing, without a shred of factual support,\" that Phillips and his colleagues at Sidley & Austin did their jobs poorly, Rakoff wrote.\nWhitman Capital was based in Menlo Park, California. Whitman is housed at a federal prison complex in Lompoc, California and is eligible for release beginning May 29, 2016.\nThe case is U.S. v. Whitman, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-cr-00125.
