That followed a record $113 billion drop in the first quarter. The holdings, which are more than triple the size of any other country’s, shrank in each of the last four quarters as the central bank bought yuan to stabilize the exchange rate. The currency’s 0.05 percent loss against the dollar over the past year is the smallest in emerging markets.\n“The amount of capital fleeing China declined in the second quarter as the yuan remained stable,” said Banny Lam, co-head of research at Agricultural Bank of China International Securities Co. in Hong Kong. “The yuan faces mild depreciation pressures in the short-run as the economy is recovering at a slow pace, but that won’t cause serious capital outflows.”\nChina has been limiting yuan moves to encourage greater global use and deter outflows as it pushes for reserve-currency status at the International Monetary Fund. The exchange rate has held within 0.35 percent of 6.2 per dollar since end-March, a level National Australia Bank Ltd. described as a de-facto peg. The Shanghai Composite Index of shares rose in June to its highest since January 2008, and has since slumped 23 percent.\nEuro’s Advance The yuan fell 0.02 percent versus the dollar in the second quarter in Shanghai, and retreated a further 0.13 percent this month during the equities selloff. The euro rose 3.9 percent over the last three months, the first quarterly advance in more than a year. The gain helped lessen the drop in the dollar value of China’s foreign reserves, which include assets denominated in the 19-nation currency.\nChina has a record of keeping the yuan steady at turbulent times. The currency traded at around 6.8 per dollar during the global financial crisis between 2008 and 2010. The central bank is likely to ensure the yuan is a source of stability rather than contributing to capital outflows for the coming months, Chris Turner, London-based head of foreign-exchange strategy at ING Groep NV, wrote in a July 10 note.\nThe size of China’s foreign reserves means it has an “expendable war chest” of $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion to support its currency, according to Mirza Baig, Singapore-based head of foreign exchange and interest-rate strategy for Asia at BNP Paribas SA. The remainder is sufficient to underpin market confidence and fund multilateral initiatives such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T06:13:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
