Rep. Chris Danou was absent for the early Thursday morning vote. \nThe Senate passed the budget 18-15 on Tuesday with Republican Sen. Rob Cowles joining Democrats in opposition. \nRepublicans have publicly groused about the budget as introduced by Gov. Scott Walker that cut the University of Wisconsin System by $300 million and had other divisive proposals. \nBut during Assembly debate Republicans said they improved the spending plan, which now heads to Walker for his signature and vetoes. \nThink your friends should see this?
