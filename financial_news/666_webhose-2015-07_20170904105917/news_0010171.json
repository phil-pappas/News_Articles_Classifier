Enter Actionstep. 9TO5MAC.COM by Peter Moon There was no difficulty in deciding our financial new year's resolutions this time around. The goal is to be fully location-independent by the end of October.\nWhen our office lease falls due for renewal, we want all the options: maybe stay, maybe go elsewhere, maybe hang out in a serviced office if the right digs haven't turned up, maybe even operate from home if it suits us. What a change from just a few years back, when a professional practice lived in terror of an expiring lease.\nOperation Portability really began five years ago when we switched to cloud-based file storage, backed up by a beast of a network storage station in the office. The Boat, as she became known, was insurance.\nIn practice, all the work has been done through Dropbox and OwnCloud, a self-hostable, open-source, cloud-based file server that can run much faster than Dropbox because you can set it up in a data centre in your own city.\nLast week we retired the Boat in favour of a Mac Mini server teamed with a Drobo 5N disk array. The new gear takes up a quarter of the space and affords 16 terabytes of dual redundant storage, meaning that any two of its five hard drives can fail without resulting data loss, compared with a mere half a terabyte of single redundant storage on the older, bulkier equipment. Since the file back-up isn't required for daily access, it can be housed anywhere that's secure and has a decent internet connection.\nWe chose LibreOffice Writer as our preferred word processor because it's better than Word, not because it's free. But free turns out to enhance portability as well.\nWhen your entire staff use an office computer, a home computer and a notebook, and there's a mix of Macs and PCs, a word processor that can be installed anywhere you like, as often as you like, without budgetary constraints, is liberating.\nOur June 30 technology refresh also saw every PC in the office replaced by an iMac. Any Windows apps we require are being run on virtual PCs set up in VMware Fusion. Not only are the iMacs more compact than traditional Windows PCs, they're also more stable, and they play very nicely with the MacBook Air notebook that defines extreme portability in office equipment.\n 'To do' list at your fingertips A small but vital cog in a flexible working strategy is a task list that can always be accessed, whether on a desktop, a tablet or a smartphone. Across a week, in various places and situations, things to do come up. When we were desk bound, a jotter pad was a feasible way to manage them. Now we rely on Things, a Mac task manager that's with us wherever we go. Windows users can use Outlook the same way.\nThe upshot of 15 years of an increasingly paperless practice, a cloud file system, back-up gear that can fit in a bottom drawer, all-in-one desktop computers and the right apps is that business relocation can be completed in hours, not days. Any one of the team can take their Mac and VOIP phone, plug them in anywhere and resume work. Well, except for one problem that is, and we are optimistic we've solved that.\nForgive us for crying on your shoulder, but when it comes to accounting software, life as an Australian lawyer is pretty bad. In worldwide software terms we're a tiny market, we antipodean lawyers. For decades, specialised legal accounting packages have been over-expensive and under-powered.\nWe've stuck with a cheap and antiquated unsatisfactory product because we couldn't see the point in moving to an expensive and modern unsatisfactory one. But our system can only run on a local network, and mobility demands a cloud solution. So we trialled Actionstep from New Zealand and on July 1 we went live.\nActionstep is a fully featured general accounting system adapted for the legal industry, integrating management modules for sales, customers, documents, matters and email. All we want is its time recording, general and trust accounting tools. Maybe we'll fall in love with its matter and document management capabilities, but time will tell.\nAt $NZ60 ($53) per user per month, the product is worth it to us just to cover our billing and accounting needs. Actionstep will get a full review of its own when we're more intimately acquainted.\nThere's fine-tuning still to do, but we're committed to nailing Operation Portability before they run the next Melbourne Cup.\nPeter Moon is a technology lawyer at Cooper Mills Lawyers. peter.moon@coopermills.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T22:06:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
