A realistic view seems to come into play as you compare the two points of view. Today’s “ green ” campaign seems to look pale against the “green” way of living our seniors took so many years ago. Asking senior Americans what it was like in their day to help the environment many said that conserving was just a form of saving money. It was just something they did. \nA young clerk may suggest to an older citizen that she should bring her own grocery bags because plastic bags are not good for the environment. The older woman may look to the young girl and explain, ‘We didn't have this \"green thing\" back in my earlier days.’ Impatiently the young clerk may respond, “That's our problem today. Your generation did not care enough to save our environment for future generations.’ The older lady in turn could respond to the fact that she was correct, \"Our generation didn’t have the ‘green thing’ in those days, but we had conservation.’ The younger generation seems ignorant to the fact that our older American citizens may not have had a “green campaign” advertised in all the media of that day or talked about in school or college, but they did have a certain ‘way of life.’ \nYears ago the majority of factories had the milk, soda and beer bottles returned to the stores. The stores then sent them back to the plant to be sterilized and refilled, so the same bottles could be used over and over, which is truly the definition of recycling. Metal lunch boxes were taken to school holding a sandwich wrapped in wax paper and not in prepackaged plastic to be thrown away. \nGrocery stores bagged groceries in brown paper bags that were reused for numerous things. Most memorable, besides household garbage bags, was the use of brown paper bags as book covers for school books. This was to ensure that public property (the books provided for use by the local schools) was not defaced by scribbling. Then students were able to personalize their books on the brown paper bags. Crafts were made in art class from the brown bags. Costumes for Halloween often were seen with the brown bags as part of them. \nEveryone walked up stairs because there were no escalators in stores and office buildings. People walked to the grocery store and didn't climb into a 300+-horsepower machine every time they had to travel a few blocks or caught a ride with a friend. Today we call it carpooling.Cloth baby diapers were used and washed because disposal diapers were non-existent. Clothes were dried clothes on a line, not in an energygobbling machine burning up 220 volts. Wind and solar power really did dry the clothes back in our senior American's early days. Children wore hand-me-downs from older siblings, again truly recycling. There was no buying brand names every week to look good to your peers. One TV or radio per home, not in every room and the TV screen was, certainly, not the size of a small building. In the kitchen ingredients were blended and stirred by hand because there were no electric machines to do everything. \nA fragile item mailed through the local post office usually used old newspapers and magazines to cushion the object: again, true recycling. No Styrofoam or plastic bubble wrap for mailing your items. After the package was opened the newspaper might be used for cleaning windows, bird cages, dog pens, and the list goes on. Reused and reused was the theme for the younger days of our senior Americans. A push mower was used by many of our seniors instead of the modern day gasoline engines. Human energy is the greenest power in today’s society. No gym memberships, just hard work in the yard. No electric treadmills. \nNo plastic water bottles given away, just water fountains. Writing pens were refilled, not thrown away and then drive to the local store to buy new ones. Razor blades were replaced instead of disposable, one-use razors. In the city, people rode the streetcar or a bus and children rode their bikes to school or walked instead of using their mothers as a 24-hour taxi service in the family's $45,000 SUV or van. The majority of homes had one electrical outlet per room, not an entire bank of sockets to power several appliances. Especially, no computerized gadgets to receive a signal beamed from satellites 23,000 miles out in space in order to find the nearest burger restaurant. \nThe younger generation needs to be reminded that “green” to a senior American is far different than what it means in today’s society. Pushing the buttons on a cash register and receiving a total is different then manually writing and figuring the totals into a receipt book such as our seniors had to do in their young lives. \nStopping to meditate on what “green” means to our seniors should be thought provoking to our educators today. Green isn’t using less traditional energy, it’s finding ways of doing the job with human energy. The older generation would like to say to the younger generations, “just do without.” \nReal facts and myths about today’s living habits can be found with some interesting statistics as found at this web site, http://www.reuseit.com/facts-and-myths/facts-and-myths.htm . You may find yourself stopping to think about many of the living habits that we are passing on to the younger generations.
