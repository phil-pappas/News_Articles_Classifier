The maker of industrial robots and factory automation equipment said net income will probably be 159.5 billion yen ($1.3 billion) in the 12 months to March 31. That’s 17 percent lower than its April forecast and trails the 198.6 billion yen average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nFanuc said in April it would double its dividend payout ratio and buy back more shares following pressure from New York-based Loeb to share more of its about $8 billion in stockpiled cash with investors. Net income rose 12 percent to 50.8 billion yen in the fiscal first quarter, the company said in a statement, the slowest growth in six quarters.\n“Orders are decreasing rapidly towards the end of the first quarter, and are expected to diminish further from the second quarter on,” Fanuc said in a statement on its website. “The future of the Chinese market is uncertain” with signs of a slowdown in demand for factory automation.\nThe robot maker’s ADRs slumped 8.3 percent in New York trading while its German traded shares fell as much as 11 percent, the biggest intraday drop since April 2011. Earnings were announced after market hours in Tokyo on Tuesday.\nSales gained 21 percent, also the least growth in almost a year-and-a-half, to 197.4 billion yen.\nFanuc shares are little changed this year compared with a 16 percent rise in the benchmark Topix index.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T08:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T03:45:19.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
