The ability to move money easily between the two countries will only increase trade and benefit American companies wishing to do business in Cuba,\" Stonegate Chief Executive David Seleski said in the statement.\nAlthough most U.S. trade with Cuba is banned under an economic embargo dating to the Cold War, there have been some exceptions such as food and medicine sales.\nU.S. President Barack Obama further relaxed parts of the embargo in January as part of his policy of engagement with the Communist-governed island, allowing U.S. financial services and telecommunications limited operations in Cuba while authorizing greater purchases from self-employed Cuban exporters.\nSo far Cuban authorities have not announced granting permission to any U.S. companies to operate in Cuba, nor did they comment on the Stonegate-BICSA agreement.\nObama's executive action allowed U.S. financial institutions like Stonegate to open correspondent accounts in Cuba. It also allowed U.S. credit card and debit transactions, but those have yet to receive Cuban authorization and U.S. cardholders still have no option but to use cash.\n\"This qualifies as a big deal because the agreement must be authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States Department of the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC),\" John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, said in a statement.\nThe deal affirms that Cuba's financial governance \"may be trusted, a substantial marketing benefit to the country,\" Kavulich said.\nStonegate Bank reports $2.27 billion in assets and $1.93 billion in deposits.
