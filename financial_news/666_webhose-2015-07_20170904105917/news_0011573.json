We continue to expand the network to meet the needs of our current and future customers.\" \nAt Tesla's shareholder meeting last month, company CEO Elon Musk addressed the issue directly. \n\"The Superchargers are basically free long distance travel for life, forever,\" Musk said at the meeting. \"Now there are quite a few people who are using it for local supercharging.\" \n“We’ll sort of send them just a reminder note that it’s cool to do this occasionally, but it’s meant to be a long-distance thing.” \nTesla owners could be forgiven for getting confused. When they buy a car, they also buy access to the Supercharger network. Why wouldn't they take advantage of a free fast charging option? This creates a classic problem, of course: if you offer something for free, people will favor it over the non-free options. \nTesla and its owners now appear to sparring a bit over how the Supercharger network will be used as ownership of Tesla vehicles grows.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T23:55:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
