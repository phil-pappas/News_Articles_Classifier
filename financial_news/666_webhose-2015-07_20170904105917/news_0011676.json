Rob Homer Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Smith Unlucky investors caught in the slide at listed law firm Slater and Gordon might still be mouths agape wondering what happened after the stock's 40 per cent fall in recent days.\nWell, stay alert. There could be an opportunity just around the corner for investors to recover some losses.\nAbout $1 billion was wiped off the market value of Slaters following revelations the securities regulator questioned the company's reporting of cash flows, and hedge funds targeted the stock.\nBut for investors following the familiar script of companies that experience this kind of spectacular share price drop, the inevitable short-squeeze could be about to happen.\nEven though Slater and Gordon shares have retraced some of their losses – the stock gained 2.2 per cent to close at $3.77 on Thursday – the share price is still close to half of where it was trading in the final week of June.\nIs this a fair reaction to the accounting errors and the fact the Australian Securities and Investments Commission is having a look at its books, which was announced to the market on Monday?\nOnly time will tell, as investors valuing the stock based on its earnings and future growth potential begin to sift through the detail.\nHowever, in the meantime, it's possible the sell-off and lingering short interest could give existing investors a momentary reprieve.\n After examining the details of short positions in Slaters on Bloomberg , Ord Minnett senior market strategist Craig Turton noted that the stock is now primed for a short-cover rally.\nMarket watchers will have seen this scenario play out many times before – a heavily shorted stock appears to come back to life when holders of short positions are forced to \"cover their shorts\".\nBased on the Bloomberg data, Turton said daily short-selling activity in Slaters ramped up to over 7 million shares on 29 June, when the slide was at its most vertical, and is now back to normal lower levels.\nTurton also said there could be up to 30 million shares still shorted before noon on July 2.\n\"This balance – no new shorts but a large number of existing shorts – leaves the stock vulnerable to a short-covering rally,\" Turton said.\nIt's hard to say what effect a short rally could have on Slaters stock, however, the short-squeeze has a tendency to have the effect of a stock pop.\nLong-term investors will now spend some time figuring out whether this company should be worth roughly half what it was worth a few months ago.\nAnalysts will crunch the numbers on whether they should halve their company valuations just because the share price has halved.", "external_links": ["http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20150629/pdf/42zgpxbvsyp4cn.pdf", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/106575007500984611252/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Matt_JS"], "published": "2015-07-02T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T14:04:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
