It had earlier cut its offering by 0.15 per cent in April, following RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan's hardtalk asking bankers to reduce rate offerings.\n\nThe bank's managing director and chief executive Rakesh Sharma said its latest rate cut will boost investment sentiments, and will specifically help its retail, MSME and export customers.\n\nALSO READ:  Lakshmi Vilas Bank reports 90.54 % growth in profit in Q4 \n\nLVB's larger rivals like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank have each announced two rate cuts this fiscal. The most competitive offering in the system is at 9.70 per cent.\n\nSBI was the first off the block to reduce its base rate earlier this month after Rajan in the June 2 monetary policy statement urged banks to pass through the sequence of rate cuts into lending rates.\n\nSBI had reduced its base rate by 15 basis points to 9.70 per cent. The second largest private sector lender HDFC Bank followed suit last week by slashing its base rate by 0.15 per cent to 9.70 per cent and ICICI Bank tweaked its offering with a marginal 0.05 per cent cut yesterday.\n\nPost the June-2 policy, mid-sized state-owned Allahabad Bank also cut its base rate by 0.3 per cent to 9.95 per cent from 10.25 per cent.\n\nKotak Mahindra Bank had also hinted at a base rate cut.\n\nRajan, who has been pressing hard for the banks to transmit the 0.75 per cent cut in repo rate to the borrowers, has also warned bankers of dis-intermediation by other money market instruments where the rates are lower.\n\nBanks are flush with liquidity and have not seen substantial rise in credit demand, which is forcing them to act on rates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T03:47:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
