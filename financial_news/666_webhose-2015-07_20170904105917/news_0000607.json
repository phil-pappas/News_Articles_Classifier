In April, Google announced changes to its search algorithm that give prominence to websites designed for viewing on mobiles and tablets,” Sensis commercial director Rob Tolliday said.\nWhile Victorian businesses were slow on the mobile uptake they were leading the way in online selling to the world.\nThe report found that in Victoria, overseas customers were targeted by 15 per cent of businesses, compared to an average of 3 per cent nationally.\nThe report said 51 per cent of Australian small and medium businesses are selling online with 66 per cent of those making the majority of sales to customers in their local area.\nOf the businesses surveyed, 3 per cent said they were connected to the National Broadband Network, up from 2 per cent last year.\nThe report, which also questioned 800 consumers about their buying habits, found they loved to shop online from overseas businesses.\n“Nationally, 21 per cent of consumers’ online purchases are coming from overseas, highlighting the growing problem many Australian retailers face from overseas competition. It will be interesting to see what impact the proposed GST on imported goods under $1000 will have on this figure,” Mr Tolliday said.\n“Surprisingly, on the consumer side, men dominated online, spending $6500. This was more than twice as much as women, who spent $2400 for the year. Men bought more video games and takeaway food, whereas women purchased more groceries and cosmetics,” he said.\nJust over three out of 10 businesses said they used social media in their business with most saying they had a Facebook page.\nclaire.heaney@news.com.au\nOriginally published as There’s money in mobile", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/money-to-be-found-in-mobile-for-small-businesses/story-fni0dcne-1227462332681"], "published": "2015-07-30T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T18:49:09.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
