Photo: Pat Scala by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Electronic property settlement business Property Exchange Australia (PEXA) has issued a request for proposal for an independent adviser ahead of a potential $1 billion initial public offering, sources told Street Talk on Thursday.\nRothschild, Lazard, Luminis Partners, Reunion Capital Partners and Highbury Partnership are among firms expected to pitch for the role.\nPEXA boss Marcus Price told The Australian Financial Review in March that the business was on track for a $1 billion float or trade sale in 2016, by which time it also hopes to have made back the $120 million spent to set the business up.\nBy 2019, he predicted 85 per cent of property exchanges will be done through its online portal, a shift that is significantly adding to the demise of cheques.\nMacquarie Group is PEXA's biggest shareholder, having lifted its stake in 2014 to the maximum allowable limit of 25 per cent when the electronic conveyancing firm raised $40 million in fresh capital.\nPaul Little, the former chief executive of transport group Toll Holdings, is also a large shareholder along with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Link Market Services, the share registry business owned by private equity firm Pacific Equity Partners.\nThe other three major banks also have a holding along with arms of the State Governments of NSW, Western Australia, Victoria and Queensland. WA's government-backed land registry office Landgate holds the WA Government's stake.\nPEXA has the imprimatur of the Federal Government after first being set up in 2010 in the wake of a meeting of the Council of Australian Governments which thought it was high time that the nation modernised its antiquated system of paper-based transfers used by land titles offices and conveyancers when property is bought and sold.\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.pexa.com.au/"], "published": "2015-07-16T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:12:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
