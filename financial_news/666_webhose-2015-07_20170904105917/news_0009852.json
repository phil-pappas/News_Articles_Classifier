Google-owned YouTube says its reaches more people in the United States than any cable network among ages 18 to 49, the group most coveted by advertisers.\nNielsen data show traditional TV viewing for 12- to 17-year-olds declined to about 18 hours per week in the first quarter of 2015 from 21 hours a year earlier. Surveys show online stars are more popular with teens than mainstream celebrities.\nAt VidCon which ran Thursday to Saturday, 20,000 fans snapped selfies with idols and attended sessions such as \"What makes a good gaming channel?\"\nNickelodeon also brought in the stars of its new series \"Game Shakers\" including GloZell, a comedian with 3.8 million YouTube subscribers. Online stars \"have a built-in following and our audience are fans,\" said Nickelodeon content development executive Russell Hicks.\nCBS Corp's digital unit talked to Internet personalities at VidCon about potential partnerships, said Jim Lanzone, president of CBS Interactive, which operates websites such as CBS.com, CNET and GameSpot.\nThe company is exploring distributing content from online video creators via its digital brands, he said.\n\"I don't see this as either/or,\" Lanzone said of broadcast programming and YouTube videos. \"It's different content, and both can co-exist.\"\nOther TV networks are trying out online stars.\nPopular YouTube comedian Grace Helbig hosted eight episodes of a talk show this year on the E! network, part of Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal. E! has not decided whether to order a new season, a spokeswoman said.\nBrandy Melana Walker, a 20-year-old YouTube creator, waited to audition for Nickelodeon's casting team.\n\"It's really cool to see the crossover from digital media to actual network television,\" she said.
