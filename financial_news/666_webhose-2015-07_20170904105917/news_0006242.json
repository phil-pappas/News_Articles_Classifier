Platinum Million Dollar Lenders are recognized for utilizing more than five million dollars in GRH Loan Funds. Inlanta was one of only twenty-one lenders in Wisconsin recognized at the Platinum level.\nInlanta Mortgage President Nicholas DelTorto said, “The USDA Rural Housing Program helps families with no down payment funds realize their dreams of home ownership. At a time when credit standards are extraordinarily tight, this program helps our customers not only in Wisconsin, but throughout the Inlanta footprint. We are pleased to participate in the USDA program and provide this loan program for our customers in many rural areas. In fact, one of our originators, Laura Leonhard out of Marshfield, Wisconsin, is among the top USDA originators in the country.”\nThis USDA GRH program assists approved lenders in providing low- and moderate-income households the opportunity to own adequate, modest, decent, safe and sanitary dwellings as their primary residence in eligible rural areas. Eligible applicants may build, rehabilitate, improve or relocate a dwelling in an eligible rural area. The program provides a 90% loan note guarantee to approved lenders in order to reduce the risk of extending 100% loans to eligible rural homebuyers. Applicants must meet income eligibility and subject property must be in eligible area.\nFor more information on the USDA Guaranteed Rural Housing loan program or the Platinum Million Dollar Lender Award, visit the Wisconsin USDA GRH website or find a licensed Inlanta Mortgage loan officer near you at http://www.inlanta.com/locations .\nAbout Inlanta Mortgage\nHeadquartered in Brookfield, Wis., Inlanta Mortgage was established in 1993.
