Owing to the development, the relevant authorities in the country could review prices of petroleum products this weekend. \nAs of 5:26 pm yesterday, Brent crude oil was selling at $53.76 a barrel while WTI crude oil sold at $49.10. \nProjections from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international energy firms further suggest that crude oil prices could even fall further to about $40 a barrel before the end of year. \nThe drop in the prices of crude oil on the world market could lead to a reduction in the price of petroleum products on the Ghanaian market. \nHowever, the Oil Marketing Companies (OMC) would have to make the necessary computations to alleviate the suffering of consumers. \nWith recent forecast suggesting that the Ghana cedi would stabilize in the coming weeks, prices of petroleum products at the pumps could go down substantially this weekend in line with price deregulation. \nThe development is expected to affect government's projected revenue from the sector substantially. \nThe recent drop in crude oil prices, for instance, forced government to revise its expected revenue from the sector from GH¢4.5 billion to GH¢1.8 billion for this year. \nConsumers would have to assess the impact of low crude oil prices on projects that are being funded with the oil revenue and the country's economy in general. \nBy Cephas Larbi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T19:47:38.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
