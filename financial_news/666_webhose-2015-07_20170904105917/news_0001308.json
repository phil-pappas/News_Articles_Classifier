Nic Walker by Tony Boyd At first he is reticent about his love affair with Porsche, for fear of being seen as aloof from the people who fill the seats on Virgin’s fleet of planes. But after considerable persuasion from Chook Roast, Borghetti finally agrees to talk about the relationship he sees between German manufacturing excellence and airlines.\n“The business principles of what Porsche does I admire very much – and I have tried to learn from them, particularly in their marketing,” he says. “They have the highest levels of quality control and strong relationships with staff and unions.”\nThe thing that most impresses him about Porsche and its iconic 911 is the “constant evolution of the product rather than radical changes”. He abhors companies that chop and change their strategies and lurch from crisis to crisis. Constant evolution, according to Borghetti, works well for staff, shareholders and management.\n“That is exactly what we have done with all of our products, all of our branding. I think the overall focus on product improvement, as opposed to new products for the sake of it, is one of the impressive aspects of Porsche.\n“There is no point having a new product just for the sake of it. It’s got to be an evolution. An improvement on what you have.”\nUnder Borghetti’s leadership, Virgin Australia has consistently improved its performance by lifting its penetration of the business and government market, and raised the quality of its core offering. It looks set to beat targets he set several years ago.\nThe target for Velocity members was 7 million by 2017. The number is now 5.2 million, so the target should be achieved easily. There were less than 2 million members five years ago. Another key target is 30 per cent of revenue from corporate and government by 2017. Currently it is more than 25 per cent.\nFinally, Borghetti promised to deliver cost efficiencies of more than $1 billion in five years. He is running ahead of schedule.\n He says Porsche has a singular focus on building public consciousness of the 911 brand. “When you see a 911, even if you don’t know what year it is, you know what it is. It’s the same with Virgin Australia. Once you see that flying lady you know it’s us. You don’t need to have the word Virgin underneath it.”\nBorghetti is impressed with Porsche’s attention to detail and the constant improvement on the last model.\n“It’s exactly what we are doing, especially with our staff engagement,” he says.\nThe leather stitching on the airline’s seat was inspired by Porsche, Borghetti says. But the most important aspect of the Porsche way of doing business is staying on brand.\n“I could pull out a Porsche commercial, a printed ad, from 10 years ago and I could print one out from yesterday and they are exactly the same in layout and messaging. They always have a really good one-liner. They have been doing this for more than two decades.\n“When I say ‘staying on brand’, I can’t think of a company that has done that as well as Porsche. We don’t do it as well as Porsche but their attention to detail is incredible.\n“You know people say – they have a sloping back window with a window-wiper blade but they don’t have a thing that squirts water on it. Why? It adds weight, you have the water, the motor, why do you need it – if it’s raining why do you need it?”\nBorghetti bought his first Porsche 911 when he turned 50 and has since (he will be 60 in August) become a collector. He won’t say how many Porsches he owns, suffice to say he had to build a special warehouse to store them.\nHe understands well the history of the 911 and that it was there to serve two purposes.\n“The 911 started because they wanted to build a car that a gentleman could drive to the shops and also take to the race track on the weekend. They have done that to this day.”\nLike Boss on Facebook . Follow Boss on Twitter .
