He said the relations between Zimbabwe and China have been strong for long, and now it is time for the two sides to focus on strengthening economic cooperation to enhance this historic tie. \nTrade between China and Zimbabwe grew to 1.24 billion U.S. dollars last year, double the figure in just four years. China has been Zimbabwe's top foreign investor for several years. \nIn 2013, Chinese investment to Zimbabwe topped 600 million U.S. dollars, making Zimbabwe one of the top destinations to receive Chinese investment that year. \nMnangagwa said he is going to speed up the implementation of the bilateral cooperation documents signed during Mugabe's state visit to China last year, covering the fields of telecommunications, infrastructure financing, food donation, tourism, and student exchange programs.
