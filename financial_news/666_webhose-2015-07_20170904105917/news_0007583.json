He said $2000 towards the payment was handed over during dinner at a Canberra restaurant.\nOn Monday, Canberra contractor Elias Taleb told the commission that he made the payments totalling more than $135,000 to Mr Kivalu throughout 2012 and 2013.\n Four payments ​Tiling contractor Medwhat Eleaswiy told the hearing he made four payments to Mr Kivalu, including one for $10,000. Another employer, Tony Bassil, said he made payments totalling thousands of dollars to Mr Kivalu.\nMr Kivalu was sacked by the union in 2014 but the CFMEU said his position was made redundant and his dismissal was unrelated to the allegations. Dave Noonan, the CFMEU's construction division national secretary, said the allegations of \"bribery\" were serious and should be referred to police.\nMr He said on Tuesday that a CFMEU representative, who he knew only as \"Johnny\", approached him in June to ask him to pay for 10 union memberships.\nHe said he paid \"a bit more than $2000\" to the union for six employees. \"He (Johnny) said he wants me to put 10 members into the union [and] if this isn't done the boss will not be happy,\" Mr He said.\nThe practice of employers paying for union memberships has attracted controversy, after the commission heard evidence it occurred in the Australian Workers Union when Labor leader Bill Shorten led the union.\n​Builder Robert Rae told the commission that he was asked by Mr Eleaswiy to meet Mr Kivalu and give him cheques.\nEnd any problems \"[Mr Eleaswiy] said it was for the good of the company to win work and it was to end any problems on the job,\" he said.\nMr Rae said he met Mr Kivalu at a McDonald's restaurant in Canberra and Mr Kivalu was angry that the payment was not made in cash.\n\"When I gave him the cheque he was rather upset about it. He expected cash,\" he said.\nIvan Bulum, who has worked in the construction industry since 1967, told the commission subcontractors had told him that they had made cash payments to the union.\nMr Bulum said three men – a bricklayer, a formworker and a concreter – told him separately that the CFMEU had asked them for money but he had no direct evidence of any payments.\nMr Kivalu is yet to give evidence before the commission, which will spend another two weeks examining the conduct of the CFMEU in the ACT.\nCounsel assisting the commission Jeremy Stoljar has said the evidence would \"paint a disturbing picture of the conduct of the CFMEU in the ACT: alleged corrupt payments, standover and intimidation tactics, and the apparent establishment and promotion of cartels for key trades\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:35:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
