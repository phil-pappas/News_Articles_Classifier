Bloomberg News reported earlier that Symantec was nearing a deal to sell Veritas to Carlyle for between $7 billion and $8 billion, citing people with knowledge of the matter. \nThe Reuters source asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Symantec did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Carlyle declined to comment. \nSymantec has been seeking buyers for Veritas for several months but interest from potential buyers had been limited because of a tax burden associated with splitting the company. The company has plans to split in two, separating Veritas from Symantec, by January 2016. \n(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T02:10:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
