The campaign was so successful the company brought them back this year. Restaurant Brands chief executive Daniel Schwartz said Chicken Fries are profitable as well because they have a high gross margin and restaurants sell a lot of them. They are positioned as a snack or meal and cost around $US3. Schwartz declined to say whether customer traffic played a role in driving up sales, or if the increase in sales was drive entirely by people spending more per visit. The company also cited the appearance of its \"King\" mascot at sporting events like the Belmont Stakes as an example of its improved marketing. On a global basis, Burger King's sales rose 6.7 per cent at established locations during the quarter. The figure rose 5.5 per cent at Tim Hortons, which it also owns. The company, based in Oakville, Ontario, opened an additional 141 Burger King locations around the world as well as another 52 Tim Hortons. Restaurant Brands International earned $US9.6 million ($A13.21 million), or US5.00 cents per share. That was down from $US75.1 million, or US 21 cents per share, in the year-ago period. The decline was attributable largely to preferred share dividends. Not including one-time items, the company earned US30 cents per share. That was above the US24 cents per share analysts expected, according to FactSet. Total revenue rose to $US1.04 billion, also topping the $US1.02 billion Wall Street expected.
