PUBLISHED: 21:38, Wed, Jul 1, 2015 | UPDATED: 08:33, Thu, Jul 2, 2015 STUART ROBINSON Paul McGinley with the Ryder Cup at Gleneagle The investment group, led by Hoxton boutique hotels owner Ennismore, bought the hotel for a fee thought to be around £200million. The Guinness group has owned the Perthshire hotel since 1984 and was the scene of Europe’s triumph over the US in golf’s Ryder Cup last year. It also played host to the G8 summit in 2005. In the year to June 2014 it posted an operating profit of £2.6million on revenue of £43.5million. Diageo chief executive Ivan Menezes said: “The hotel is not a core business for us and feel this is an appropriate time to realise value through this transaction.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T15:30:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
