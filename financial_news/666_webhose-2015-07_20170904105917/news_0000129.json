Gold production in the first half of 2015 was 104,283 ounces. \nThe primary contributor to the 2015 gold production guidance increase is the results from the assay program initiated in January 2015, as reported in our news release dated July 6, 2015. The results of the assay program confirm the presence of historic \"zero\" value drillhole intercepts with gold grade above the current Mineral Resources cut-off grade of 0.065 g/t payable gold. The assay data indicate the existence of additional low grade mineralization not contained within the existing Mineral Resources estimate. The result is additional gold ounces expected to be produced in 2015. This is attributed to an increase in ore tonnage previously designated as waste tonnage and is expected to lower the 2015 strip ratio at the Mackay Phase 3 pit. We are continuing with the assay program and will apply the results, where applicable, to the Marigold life of mine plan with results expected to be completed later in 2015 and 2016. \nIn our second quarter earnings release we will advise on cost implications at the Marigold mine resulting from the assay program and revised gold production guidance. \nSilver production guidance at the Pirquitas mine has been increased to 9.5 to 10.5 million ounces, 5% higher than the previous silver production guidance of 9 to 10 million ounces. Silver production in the first half of 2015 was 5.2 million. \nContributing, in part, to the revised guidance at the Pirquitas mine are mining operations, which continue to experience better ore availability and higher silver grade, consistently demonstrating an improved relationship between the Mineral Resources model and mined ore production. As mining has progressed deeper through higher silver grade portions of the San Miguel Phase 2 open pit, fresh sulphide ore feed and process control improvements have positively impacted plant operating performance leading to higher silver production. At the Pirquitas mine, we remain focused on costs and driving further operational efficiencies that will sustain cash flows in a lower silver price environment while pursuing alternatives for mine life extension. \nIn our second quarter earnings release we will advise on cost implications at the Pirquitas mine resulting from our revised silver production guidance. \nQualified Persons \nThe scientific and technical data contained in this news release relating to the Pirquitas mine has been reviewed and approved by Trevor J. Yeomans, ACSM, P.Eng., a Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") and our Director, Metallurgy. The scientific and technical data contained in this news release relating to the Marigold mine has been reviewed and approved by Thomas Rice, SME Registered Member, a Qualified Person under NI 43-101 and our Technical Services Manager at the Marigold mine. \nTo receive Silver Standard's news releases by e-mail, please register using the Silver Standard website at www.silverstandard.com . \nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements: \nThis news release contains forward-looking information within the meaning of Canadian securities laws and forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (collectively, \"forward-looking statements\") concerning the anticipated developments in our operations in future periods, and other events or conditions that may occur or exist in the future.

NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. These standards differ significantly from the requirements of the SEC set out in Industry Guide 7. Consequently, Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources information included in this news release is not comparable to similar information that would generally be disclosed by domestic U.S. reporting companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC. Under SEC standards, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. In addition, the SEC's disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning \"Measured Mineral Resources,\"\"Indicated Mineral Resources\" or \"Inferred Mineral Resources\" or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute \"reserves\" by U.S. standards in documents filed with the SEC. U.S. investors should understand that \"Inferred Mineral Resources\" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. Moreover, the requirements of NI 43-101 for identification of \"reserves\" are also not the same as those of the SEC, and reserves reported by us in compliance with NI 43-101 may not qualify as \"reserves\" under SEC standards. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with U.S. standards. \nCautionary Note Regarding Non-GAAP Measures \nThis news release includes certain terms or performance measures commonly used in the mining industry that are not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), including cash costs per payable ounce of silver or gold sold. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance. The data presented is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements. \nSOURCE Silver Standard Resources Inc. \nNews Provided by Acquire Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T01:45:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
