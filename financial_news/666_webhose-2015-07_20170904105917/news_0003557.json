However, the process would be challenging and it may not address some concerns relating to Openreach - such as service quality, or the timing and level of investment decisions.” \nThe watchdog emphasised that full “structural” separation of BT was just one option it will consider based on responses to the discussion paper. \nBT has asked to switch off its traditional voice calling network \nIt said it could also choose to maintain the status quo, strengthen functional separation with more rules, such as wholesale price controls, or partially deregulate to stimulate competition and encourage network investment. \nOfcom said investment in communications infrastructure was also generally a priority for the review. \nIt said households needed broadband speeds of at least 10 megabits per second to use video streaming services, but noted that 15pc cannot currently get such a service. \nThe regulator will look at how to improve coverage, as well as how it can encourage investment in the next generation of ‘ultrafast’ broadband services, and in mobile network coverage and quality. \nIt will consider BT’s call to be allowed to switch off its traditional voice calling network , while expressing concern that shifting all calls over the internet may affect the resilience of lifeline services needed by elderly and disabled people in emergencies. \nMobile operators such as Vodafone will also be pleased by Ofcom’s recognition that the rise of WatsApp and other unregulated, internet-based competition to their services “may create a case for less regulation on mobile operators, or for extending existing rules to internet-based services”. \nTo help consumers navigate the increasingly complicated market, Ofcom said it will examine new ways to compare services. \nThe impact of the trend towards bundling broadband, home phone, mobile and pay-TV will be examined. Ofcom suggested that competition could be harmed, particularly by pay-TV, arguing that “if a retail provider cannot offer attractive content, this is likely to reduce competition across all services in the bundle.” \nSharon White, Ofcom Chief executive, said: “We want to promote competition, investment and innovation, so that everyone benefits from even better coverage, choice, price and quality of service in years to come.” \nThe next phase of the review will seek evidence and responses to today’s discussion paper until early October, before Ofcom publishes its proposals for the next decade of communications regulation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T11:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T11:19:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
