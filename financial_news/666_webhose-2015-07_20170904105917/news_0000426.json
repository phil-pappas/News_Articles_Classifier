\nTsipras now faces a tough task selling the deal to the Greek people, parliament and his radical Syriza party, which shot to power in January on the back of promises to end five years of bitter austerity under two previous bailouts. \nGreece's public servants are being called to stage a 24-hour strike for Wednesday, the first since Tsipras took power. \nHaralambos Rouliskos, a 60-year-old economist who was out walking in Athens, described the deal as \"misery, humiliation and slavery\". \nThe eurozone creditors \"are trying to blackmail us,\" said Katerina Katsaba, a 52-year-old working for a pharmaceutical company. \nFaced with a deeply distrustful eurozone after five months of tense meetings, the 40-year-old Tsipras had to agree to demands that critics say rob Greece of financial independence. \nEurope's first step will be to push the deal through several national parliaments, many in countries that are loath to afford Greece more help. \nGermany's Bundestag is likely to vote on Friday, provided the Greek parliament rushes through four new reform laws by Wednesday. \nGreece has to make sweeping changes to labour laws, pensions, VAT and taxes, according to the deal document. \nDespite strong opposition, Tsipras also yielded to a plan to park assets for privatisation worth up to 50 billion euros in a special fund. \nSome 25 billion euros of the money in that fund will then be used to recapitalise Greece's cash-starved banks. \nFurther humiliations came in the form of a return of officials from the widely despised \"troika\" of Greece's creditors -- the European Commission, European Central (ECB) and IMF. \nThere is also a pledge to reverse laws brought in by the Syriza government that run counter to Greece's earlier bailout arrangements in 2010 and 2012. \nThe deal contained little mention of relieving a Greek debt mountain worth 180 percent of GDP -- a step recommended by the IMF -- beyond a vague mention that it should be considered later. \n- #ThisIsACoup - \nThe deal triggered angry reactions on social media across Europe, where the Twitter (Swiss: TWTR.SW - news ) hashtag #ThisIsACoup trended. \nThe marathon talks also exposed tensions at the heart of the post-war European integration project, especially between hawkish Berlin and dovish Paris, which has been Greece's biggest supporter during the crisis. \nFrench President Francois Hollande hailed Tsipras for making a \"courageous choice\" despite the political risks at home. \nFrance also led efforts against a German-backed idea for a \"temporary Grexit\" option which was dropped from the leaders statement. Its appearance in an earlier draft marked the first time the idea of a euro member leaving the currency had appeared in black and white. \nThe eurozone must now unite to tackle the immediate problem of finding funds to keep Greece afloat, as the bailout could take months to finalise. \nEurozone finance ministers at a meeting on Monday considered bridge funding to get Greece through coming weeks when it faces several huge debt payments to the ECB and other creditors. \n\"We have not yet found the 'golden key' to solve this issue,\" said Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who was renamed to a second term at the minister talks on Monday. \nThe ECB meanwhile has kept Greek banks afloat with emergency liquidity, but has refused to provide extra funds. \nThe ECB's governing council on Monday held its emergency liquidity assistance for Greece unchanged at around 89 billion euros ($99 billion). \nBanks will stay closed in Greece \"until Wednesday\", the country's finance ministry said in a statement. \nMany cash machines already are running dry despite a 60-euros-a-day ATM limit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T04:02:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
