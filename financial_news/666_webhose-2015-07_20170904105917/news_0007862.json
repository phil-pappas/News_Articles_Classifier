CHINA DAILY by Bloomberg News China's benchmark stock index continued its rollercoaster ride Thursday morning, opening sharply lower for a third day running before soaring back into unfamiliar positive territory as stock index futures surged and the banking regulator again stepped in to arrest the decline.\nThe Shanghai Composite index slid 3.8 per cent to 3,374.32 soon after the market opened as traders continued to unwind margin bets despite half of the equities market being in a trading halt.\nChina's banking regulator said it will allow lenders to roll over loans backed by shares when they mature and adjust collateral requirements, adding to government efforts to contain the financial effects of a stock market rout.\nThe China Banking Regulatory Commission also encouraged banks to support companies' share buybacks by offering them collateralized loans, in a statement on Thursday.\nThe agency loosened requirements for banks to sell stocks that have fallen in value, under agreements with clients of wealth-management and trust products. It encouraged banks to offer loans to China Securities Finance Corp, an agency that helps to supply credit for stock purchases.\nThe market was briefly up more than 2 per cent, before fear again took over. At 10.33am in Shanghai the index was again plunging into negative territory, trading at 3,495.85, down 0.32 per cent.\nEnergy, material and financial shares led declines in early trade. Half of all companies in mainland exchanges were now halted from trading as the government ratcheted up measures to stem a bear market rout. Regulators banned major stockholders from selling stakes in listed companies, while a rising number of firms bought back their shares.\n Margin traders reduced holdings of shares purchased with borrowed money by a record 112.2 billion yuan ($US18 billion) on the Shanghai stock Exchange on Wednesday, according to bourse data.

Investors with stakes exceeding 5 per cent must maintain their positions, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said in a statement. The rule is intended to guard capital-market stability amid an \"unreasonable plunge\" in share prices, the CSRC said.\nData on Thursday showed the nation's consumer prices rose faster than economists forecast in June as commodity prices stabilized, easing deflation pressure at home and abroad.\nThe consumer-price index increased 1.4 percent last month from a year earlier, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. That compared with the 1.3 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey and the 1.2 percent increase in May.
