Sources had previously told Reuters that Cigna was also vying for Humana. \n(Reporting by Rosmi Shaji and Aurindom Mukherjee and Rama Venkat Raman in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Wills) Health Care Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T08:55:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
