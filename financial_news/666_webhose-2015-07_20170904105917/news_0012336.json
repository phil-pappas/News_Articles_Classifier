James Brickwood Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Coalition MPs on both sides of the gay marriage divide believe Tony Abbott risks \"blowing up'' the party and possibly his leadership unless he allows the matter to be resolved.\nAs the Prime Minster affirmed on Tuesday he had no intention of allowing the party room to debate the matter when Parliament resumed in August, his conservative allies inflamed tensions by accusing pro-gay marriage colleagues of colluding with the Greens and Labor to derail the government's agenda and demanding ministers who support change resign from the frontbench.\nCommunications Minster Malcolm Turnbull, who supports gay marriage, refused to buy into the dispute but said the view he stated on Sunday , that there should be a party room debate in August, still stood.\n\"I support a free vote and if there is a free vote I'll be voting for it,\" he said.\nQueensland MP Ewen Jones, who also supports gay marriage, urged the Prime Minister to resolve the issue; otherwise, he warned, it would fester all the way to Christmas.\nConscience vote Another advocate who did not want to be identified said even though a minority of Liberals supported a conscience vote, Mr Abbott had pledged before the election to allow a debate on having a conscience vote should a bill be presented to Parliament, as it will be in August.\nBut the Prime Minister, under pressure from the ever-critical Liberal Party base, has backtracked. There can only be a party room debate if a private member's bill was to be brought to a vote , and the government will use its numbers to stop that happening.\n \"I don't know what games he's playing with the lunatic right but he will blow the party room up if he stops there being a debate. There will be a convulsion,\" the MP said.\n\"There's got to be a free vote and he knows it.\n\"He's thinking more about votes in the party room than votes in the electorate.\"\nA calculation by the gay marriage lobby estimates 62 Liberals oppose gay marriage, 15 are in support and 25 are undecided or undeclared.\nLiberal MP Warren Entsch will introduce a private member's bill on Tuesday, August 11, which will be co-sponsored by Liberal, Labor, Green and independent MPs.\nLiberal Senate leader Eric Abetz said ministers who supported gay marriage should resign from the frontbench.\n\"If you can't support party policy, like I did with emissions trading, you do the honorable thing and I resigned from the frontbench,\" he said.\nSenator Abetz claimed the change would put Australia out of step with the region and lead to \"polyamory\".\nLiberal Senator Cory Bernardi, who once claimed legalised gay marriage would lead to legalised bestiality, accused his colleagues of siding with Labor and the Greens to derail the government's economic and national security agenda. He said they were captive to \"left activism\".\nLow priority for government One Liberal, who opposes gay marriage, said Mr Abbott should honour his promise to colleagues and allow the debate in August. The numbers were there to defeat a push to shift policy from opposing gay marriage to having a conscience vote.\nAllowing it to drag on and fester \"will only hurt us [marginal seat MPs] and further crystallise the view that Abbott is a dickhead.\"\nBut Mr Abbott has dug in his heels, saying gay marriage was not a policy priority for the government.\n\"This government was elected to grow jobs, promote a stronger economy, to secure our nation against the various challenges we face at home and abroad, and that's what we're doing.\n\"As far as I'm concerned that will always be the focus of this government.\"\n.\n.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-02T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T01:01:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
