We have since witnessed a vast improvement as the result of the implementation of our turnaround plan. From April to June, we recorded a GH¢2.4 million loss, 91 percent better than recorded in the first quarter, and in the month of June recorded a GH¢1.3 million profit-after-tax.' \n'We are focusing more on issues such as loan recovery, risk management, effective cost management, and capital rising, among others. I must reiterate that UT Bank remains committed to supporting the SMEs by helping them address the risks that they face.' \nStephen Antwi-Asimeng, UT Banks Chief Operating Officer noted: 'We believe that the worst is behind us and we are excited about the opportunities and prospects going forward as we execute our strategies.' \nGillian Slater, UT Banks Chief Financial Officer, stated that 'we anticipate a reduction of our cost of funds in the second half of 2015 based on improvement in our funding mix. Our capital raising is also underway and will contribute to the lowering of our cost of funds. We obtained shareholders approval to raise capital through the issuance of both preference and ordinary we will conclude on these in a timely manner.' \nA business desk report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:01:46.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
