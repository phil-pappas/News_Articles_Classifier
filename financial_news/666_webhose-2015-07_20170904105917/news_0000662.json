News would only accept change if anti-siphoning laws, which keep sport on free-to-air TV, were scrapped.\nThe government decision hurt the regional broadcasters, the Nine Network and Fairfax Media, publisher of The Australian Financial Review , all of which are stymied by the current laws.\n\"This is the Prime Minster's bloody-minded captain's pick to look after a couple of media mates,\" Mr Hartigan said.\n\"This is playing with people's lives.\"\nRural versus metropolitan Mr Hartigan said the campaign, first flagged by the Financial Review's Street Talk column on June 24, would contend that Mr Abbott's decision would create two classes of citizens – those in regional and rural Australia and those in metropolitan Australia.\n\"The regional community risks losing their voice unless the reforms of media is put back on the table,\" he said.\n\"The only way to secure our future and the future of regional news services is if we update media laws.\n\"That will allow mergers and acquisitions that achieve economies of scale.\"\nMr Hartigan said there would be \"further mass sackings\".\n\"We're trying to keep jobs and we lost the argument because of the interests of two proprietors.\"\nRegional broadcasters face increased competition from unregulated internet-based streaming services, have less ability to integrate advertising into programming, and face growing fees to their metro affiliates.\nCircumvention of rule One industry source who declined to be named said Mr Stokes was happy to let his competitors wither on the vine while News Corp did not need the changes because it had already effectively circumvented the two-thirds ownership rule with Foxtel's acquisition of 15 per cent of Channel 10.\nNews owns 50 per cent of Foxtel and Lachlan Murdoch holds 7 per cent of Channel 10 already. Mr Murdoch also owns radio station Nova FM. This effectively gives News radio, TV and newspapers in the same market, as well as pay TV and online.\nOne source said News had demanded of Mr Turnbull that he scrap anti-siphoning rules that ensure key sporting events stay on free-to-air TV but Mr Turnbull told the company it would never pass the Senate.\nThe current arrangement with Foxtel buying into Channel 10 would allow Foxtel, Channel 10 and Channel Seven to stitch up sport broadcasting by offering a joint platform.\nMr Abbott has told colleagues he does not want the issue revisited but the internal push from his colleagues will intensify pressure to rethink his position.\nIt is understood Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce has spoken to Mr Abbott about the issue.\nDuring last week's party room meeting, when the issue was raised, Mr Turnbull pointed out that WIN had already closed bureaus in Mildura and Mackay and that there was a threat to its operation in Wide Bay, in the electorate of Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss.\nMr Truss expressed dismay, saying WIN could not do that and Mr Turnbull responded:\n\"As a matter of fact Warren, they can and they will.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-01T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T05:58:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
