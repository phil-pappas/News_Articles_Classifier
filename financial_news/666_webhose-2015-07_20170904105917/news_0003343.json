PNI is investigating a potential credit card data issue, and outside security experts are assisting in the investigation,\" said Kirk Saville, vice president, global communications at Staples Inc , which bought Vancouver-based PNI last year.\nSome websites said they had been advised by PNI of a potential breach, while others said they acted because of recent reports.\nCostco Canada and Rite Aid noted that PNI has limited access to customer information since it does not process credit cards, but the photo service sites were temporarily taken down as a precaution.\nCVS and Walmart Canada asked customers to monitor their credit card transactions closely for unauthorized charges.\nTesco's page simply said it was it was unavailable for routine maintenance.\nThe retailers' main websites and other services were not affected by the potential breach.\nCostco shares rose 0.2 percent to end regular trading at $145.04; Wal-Mart shares dipped 0.4 percent to $73.10; Rite Aid fell 1 percent to $8.82; Tesco shares ended 0.3 percent higher at 218.6 pence, and Staples shares eased 0.5 percent to $14.63.
