The catch: setting these seats aside leaves fewer places for other passengers to sit without paying extra. That means mum might end up in row 20, dad in row 23 and junior sitting all the way back in row 30, regardless of age. Airlines say their gate agents try to help family members without adjacent seats sit together, especially people flying with small children. Yet there is no guarantee things will work out. Often, the only way to ensure that the family sits together is to book well in advance, or pay $US25 or more, per seat, each way. Summer is an especially hard time to keep families together. Last July, US airlines sold a record 87.8 per cent of seats on domestic flights, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statics. And that figure doesn't include seats occupied by airline employees flying for free. In other words: virtually every seat was taken. Airlines are predicting that even more passengers will step aboard planes this year: 222 million passengers between June 1 and August 31. That's 2.4 million passengers a day or 4.5 per cent more than last summer. There are still a few things fliers can do to snag seats together without paying extra: - Confirm seat assignments online with the airline. - Set up alerts for seat openings. - Check the airline's website five days before the trip. That's when some elite fliers are upgraded to first class, freeing up their coach seats. - Check in 24 hours in advance when airlines start releasing more seats. - Ask at check-in. Agents can sometimes put families in seats held just prior to departure for disabled passengers. - If all else fails, offer nearby passengers candy or a drink to switch seats.
