Here's What You Need to Know First \nWith its design clean and spare, yet stunningly stylish in its gleaming silver glory and iconic shape, Airstream has long evoked images of wide-open travel and inspired feelings of wanderlust. \nBut with price tags for Airstreams ranging anywhere from $35,000 to more than $100,000, such adventures have long been the rarified opportunity of the well heeled, or those who were able to make such an investment in an infrequently used vacation vehicle. \nEnter RV industry veteran Dicky Riegel and Airstream 2 Go , a new website that is the only renter of the vehicles in the country. Airstream 2 Go is the exclusive, factory-authorized source in North America for rentals of current model Airstream trailers. What that means to you is that for the first time in history, experiencing this quintessentially American travel opportunity is open to anyone. \n\"There are a ton of people who appreciate everything that goes along with an Airstream experience,\" says Riegel, who previously served as president and CEO of Airstream, Inc. and owns two of the vehicles himself. \nSo what exactly goes along with an Airstream experience? \nWhen renting through Airstream 2 Go, the experience includes such amenities as Egyptian cotton sheets, duvets, Wusthof cutlery, a coffee maker, a microwave, a barbecue grill and even a bathroom with a shower. So yes, it has a touch of that over-the-top RV style of camping. \nBut cruising the open roads in an Airstream is about more than just the deluxe amenities, Riegel points out. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:17:19.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
