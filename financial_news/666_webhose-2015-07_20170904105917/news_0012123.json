Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Sally Patten The change in the typical asset mix of typical balanced superannuation funds over the past 15 years is remarkable. For fund members, at least in theory, it is good news. Retirement schemes are investing in a much broader range of assets than they did in the early 2000s, which should help to insulate member returns from ructions in any one market.\nAnalysis by professional services firm PwC shows that 15 years ago balanced retirement funds tended to be invested in Australian and international shares, property, fixed income and cash. Fast forward to 2015 and that universe has expanded to include infrastructure, private equity and alternative investments, such as hedge and total return funds. Furthermore, the way super funds think about property and infrastructure has matured. Some funds place certain property and infrastructure investments in the growth category, while other property and infrastructure assets appear in the defensive bucket.\n\"As super funds have become larger, members have benefited from exposure to a greater range of assets. The ability of funds to invest in alternative assets has increased,\" PwC partner Anthony James says.\nBut while greater diversification is positive for members, the sting in the tail is that there are no rules governing the definition of growth and defensive investments.\n\"Funds can classify [investments] according to their own judgment. There is no consistent terminology,\" James says.\nThe challenge is that if individual assets are not being classified in the same way across the board, fund members have little real insight into the amount of risk being taken by their fund. It is quite conceivable that two funds with exactly the same asset mix might classify their investments differently.\nWhile members have benefited from greater diversification, they also need accurate information on the nature of the investments being made by super fund trustees on their behalf,\" James says.\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission might argue that this lack of classification methodology is a reason to force super funds to disclose their holdings. For the time being, it is worth members trying to glean as much information as possible about a fund's investments to ensure they are comfortable with the level of risk being taken on their behalf.\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/106598404524016074873/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/sallympatten"], "published": "2015-07-03T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T12:26:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
