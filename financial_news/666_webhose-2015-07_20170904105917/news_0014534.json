Supplied by Philip Rich My No 1 rule when buying burgundy is to focus on the producer, which can be challenging given Burgundy has more than 4000 individual domaines, 85 per cent of which are smaller than 10 hectares. Because the region has a vineyard-based classification system, it’s impossible to sort the ordinary wines from the great unless you know your producers, and perhaps even where their plots are situated on the slope. Clos de Vougeot, for example, is one of Burgundy’s 32 grand crus and has more than 80 owners producing 50 different wines each year. The best Clos de Vougeots are sublime expressions of burgundy, but some fall short of the mark.\nOne of the highlights of my pilgrimage to Burgundy in May was visiting Domaine Vincent Dancerin Chassagne-Montrachet for the first time. Vincent Dancer’s wine had been on my radar since the first, very small, shipment of his white burgundy arrived in Australia in 2011.\nWith just 6.2 hectares of vines producing eight whites and four reds, all organic, there is never going to be a huge amount of Dancer wine for sale. It didn’t help that natural disasters ruined much of his 2012 and 2013 crops. Quantity aside, the whites – characterised by their purity of fruit and minerality – are superb and rank alongside other great and more established white burgundy producers such as Leflaive, Bonneau du Martray and Guy Roulot.\nThe Vincent Dancer wines reviewed here sell out fast, but the following restaurants get an allocation: Rockpool Bar & Grill and Sepia (Sydney), Blackbird Bar & Grill (Brisbane), Coda and France Soir (Melbourne).\nPhilip Rich is a wine critic and judge, and co-owner of Prince Wine Store.\nReviews Vincent Dancer\nBourgogne\n Blanc 2013, $60\nA blend of declassified Meursault (planted in 1999) and Puligny-Montrachet fruit, half the wine was fermented in tank and the other half fermented and matured in wood. A great introduction to this domaine, this linear, taut and bright wine can be enjoyed now and over the next two to three years.\nVincent Dancer\nMeursault Les\nGrands Charrons\n2013, $160\nSourced from a 0.29ha parcel planted in 1958, this well-located single-vineyard village wine (a stone’s throw from the premier cru Les Gouttes d’Or) is stunning. Tightly wound, it is wonderfully restrained but with a terrific core of fruit. It just needs another year or two to open up and will still be tasting good in five to seven years.\nVincent Dancer\nTete du Clos\nChassagne Montrachet\n2013, $195\nDancer’s premier cru Tete du Clos is a sub-climate of Morgeot, which has more limestone than in Morgeot proper. This is a beautifully defined example of Chassagne- Montrachet. Fermented and matured in 25 per cent new wood, which is barely perceptible, the layered, mineral-laden wine has wonderful mouthfeel, structure and length.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T10:09:20.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
