Company officials were not immediately available for comment. \nThe industrial conglomerate previously said inappropriate bookkeeping in areas such as highway electronic toll collection systems, power meters and semiconductors likely led to profits being overstated by nearly 55 billion yen in recent years. \nToshiba has not been able to close its books for the year that ended in March while a third-party committee probes its bookkeeping practices. It has also skipped its year-end dividend to shareholders. \nThe investigation is expected to conclude in mid-July. \nPrevious accounting investigations in Japan have included camera and medical equipment maker Olympus Corp's 13-year cover-up of $1.7 billion in losses. \n(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Eric Walsh)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T03:01:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
