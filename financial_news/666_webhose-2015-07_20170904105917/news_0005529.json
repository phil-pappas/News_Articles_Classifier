Sallie Mae has commissioned the annual report since 2008.\nParents were less worried about losing their jobs or about their children not finding work after college, said Michael Gross, head of the higher education practice at Ipsos.\n\"There is a much brighter sense of optimism that the money they spend educating their child is really an investment that's going to pay off in the end,\" Gross said.\nCollege spending peaked in 2010 at $24,097, or $26,271 in inflation-adjusted dollars, before dropping as families worried about a troubled economy, rising debt loads and higher unemployment, according to previous studies.\nThis year, fewer families reported making cost-saving moves such as choosing a college closer to home to reduce transportation costs, having a student live at home, or adding a roommate.\nFewer families chose not to consider some colleges because of cost: 62 percent, compared to 68 percent a year earlier. Students, however, were much more likely than parents to rule out a particular college because of its price tag.\nThree-quarters of the students polled said they eliminated a school from consideration for this reason, against half of parents, said Marie O'Malley, Sallie Mae's director of consumer research.\n\"These are students who aware that maybe Mom and Dad aren't made of money,\" O'Malley said.\nMORE BORROWING\nThe percentage of families who reported borrowing money to pay for college rose to 38 percent from 35 percent last year. That figure peaked at 46 percent in 2010. Families who borrowed spent on average 34 percent more ($28,386) than those who didn't ($21,219).\nEducation debt is primarily the student's responsibility: Undergraduates signed the loans in 83 percent of families. Within the families who borrowed, students were the primary signer for three-quarters of the total debt.\nAlthough not all families borrow in a given year, most college students graduate with debt, said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of the education resource site Edvisors.com and author of \"Filing the FAFSA.\" Seventy-one percent of bachelor's degree recipients graduated with loans, with an average balance of $35,000, he said,\nOn average, high-income families spent $33,260 on college expenses while families with incomes between $35,000 and $100,000 spent $21,375. Low-income families spent a similar amount: $21,036.\nThe average amount spent on two-year public colleges jumped 23 percent to $13,531. Spending on four-year public colleges rose 10 percent to $23,189, while four-year private college spending was up 20 percent at $41,857.\nFor many, the spending won't stop at a two- or four-year degree. About half of all college students, or 68 percent of seniors, plan to attend graduate school.\n\"The undergraduate degree has become so ubiquitous, so it may just be that graduate school is the new college,\" Gross said.
