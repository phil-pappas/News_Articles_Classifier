We are talking to a few content providers and aggregators,\" Xiaomi India hea d Manu Jain said.\nJain explained that Xiaomi's Mi TV will offer a different TV viewing experience. \"When one switches on the Mi TV, it is almost like a mobile interface. You have movies, games, apps, videos etc... and you can watch them through an internet connection without the need for any cable connection, However, some of the content will be paid. Since Our TV launch is getting delayed, we are looking to launch another product - Mi Box - a device that turns your TV into a smart TV this year,\" he explained.\nThe company, which is also the world's third largest smartphone maker, primarily designs three lines of products - smartphones & tablets, TVs and routers. This apart, Xiaomi invests in start-ups who design other devices like air purifiers, power banks and fitness gear, among others, that can become a part of Xiaomi's portfolio.\nJain revealed that the company is scouting for similar 'ecosystem partners' or start-ups in India. However, nothing has been finalised yet on that front. Apart from rolling out new products and investing in tech start-ups, the company is also working towards strengthening its e-commerce platform - Mi India - where it offers its product portfolio.\nThe company has tie-ups with e-commerce majors like Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon, through which it sells its phones. Xiaomi has sold over a million smartphones in the first four months of its entry into the Indian market, he said.\nFollow TOI Tech on Twitter >>> @ toi_tech\nAnd like us on Facebook >>> TOI_tech http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Xiaomi India,Xiaomi Corporation,Mi TV,Mi Box Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/TOItech", "https://twitter.com/toi_tech", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-07-11T12:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T10:47:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
