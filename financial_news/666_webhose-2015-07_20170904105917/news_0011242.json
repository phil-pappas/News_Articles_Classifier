Driver refuses to drive as bus is too packed! Police was called and they just arrived! #tubestrike.\" \nOthers described delays on the roads, with many getting up hours earlier than normal and rerouting their journeys in an attempt to get in on time. \nSome train platforms and buses were reported to be full before 6am. \nThere were also signalling problems at London Bridge, which heaped further misery on passengers. \nAs well as 200 more buses, Transport for London said trams would run a peak-time service all day. \nThe mobile-based service Uber has been criticised by commuters after fares were said to have doubled in some areas during the strike. \nSome users reported rises as high as 200% as they looked for alternative routes to work. \nA spokesman for Uber said its programming means prices are increased in times of high demand to encourage more drivers onto the roads, and customers are made aware of the fare increases before they book. \nThousands of striking workers from the four trade unions involved in the walkout mounted picket lines outside stations. \nThe boss of London Underground, Mike Brown, said the industrial action was \"totally unnecessary\". \nHe claimed LU had put together a \"remarkably fair\" pay offer for the introduction of the night service. \nSteve Griffiths, LU chief operating officer, said: \"We have put forward a very, very fair offer, which consists of an average salary increase of 2%, 1% or RPI (whichever is greater) for next year and the one after, plus a £500 night Tube launch bonus and an additional £2,000 bonus for night Tube train drivers.\" \nMr Johnson said most Londoners would look at the offer and \"find it impossible to fathom why the unions are rejecting it\". \nLU has claimed it did not receive a response to the latest \"fair and competitive\" offer made on Monday, and urged the unions to put it to workers. \nRMT general secretary Mick Cash said the strike had \"rock solid\" support from workers. \nHe said the disruption caused by the strike \"must force the Tube bosses back to the negotiating table to address the issues at the heart of this dispute\". \n\"That means an end to the attempt to bulldoze through new working patterns that would wreck work/life balance and leave staff in safety critical jobs burnt out and stressed out at a time when Tube services are facing unprecedented demand,\" he added. \nTSSA leader Manuel Cortes has called for talks at the conciliation services ACAS on Friday. \nThe Tube strike coincides with a 48-hour stoppage by workers on First Great Western, which caused disruption to trains to and from London Paddington. \nMembers of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union are striking over jobs and buffet facilities on new trains.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T22:08:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
