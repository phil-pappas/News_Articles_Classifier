Economists in a Bloomberg survey had forecast an 8.9 billion-pound shortfall. Government income rose 4.4 percent and spending increased 2.9 percent.\nChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne set out his plan for fiscal tightening earlier this month, implying a smoother path than the Tories pledged before the election. With cuts to government departments set to be less severe than expected, Bank of England officials including Governor Mark Carney have been signaling that the time is approaching to raise the key interest rate as inflationary pressures in the labor market build.\nThe pound was little changed after the report at $1.5576 as of 9:52 a.m. London time, up 0.1 percent from Monday.\nThe increase in government revenue last month was led by taxes on incomes and corporation tax. Both were at record highs for the month. Only stamp duty on property purchases fell.\nIn the first three months of the fiscal year, the deficit stood at 25.1 billion pounds, down 20 percent from 31.3 billion pounds a year earlier. The Office for Budget Responsibility cut its full-year borrowing forecast to 69.5 billion pounds.\nAsset Sales The measure used to calculate how much the Treasury needs to borrow in the financial markets showed a deficit of 17.7 billion pounds in June. The figure includes 2.4 billion pounds from the sale of shares in Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Royal Mail Plc.\nNet debt rose to a record 1.51 trillion pounds, or 81.5 percent of gross domestic product. It was boosted by new data from Network Rail.\nIn a statement, the Treasury pointed out that the budget deficit had fallen by more than a half to 4.9 percent of GDP since the Conservatives took office in 2010, but that more needed to be done to reduce the burden of debt and achieve a goal of generating budget surpluses in “normal times.”\nOsborne, who will address lawmakers on his summer budget later Tuesday, announced this morning that he’s seeking a further 20 billion pounds of savings from U.K. government departments ahead of a spending review.\n“We are still borrowing 1 pound for every 10 pounds we spend and national debt remains at its highest level for 50 years,” he said. “If we do not deal with this debt, we run risks with our economic security.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T12:15:46.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
