T he remainder would come from a \"private pension\", she said. \nWithin the past 48 hours, the Department for Work and Pensions has published a document online explaining the situation. \nIt says many people paid lower National Insurance contributions during their careers - a perk of the old pension system - and these payments will be taken into account under the new scheme. \nCivil servants are preparing to send letters to thousands of people approaching retirement to break news of the deductions and offer explanation. \nMalcolm McLean, of pension consultancy Barnett Waddingham, said: \"The fact sheet [published this week] illustrates the mind-blowing complexity of the arrangements being put in place. \n\"It also gives the lie to the claims made originally by ministers that the new system would produce a more generous simpler flat rate state pension for millions of new pensioners going forward none of these claims would appear to be true at least in the short term.\" \nMost people who reach state pension age within the next two decades have paid lower National Insurance \"at some point\", the DWP document says. \nSince the Seventies people have been able to opt for lower payments by \"contracting out\" of the additional state pension. \nThis is an earnings-related top-up to the basic £116 a week. \nAs a condition of opting out of the top-ups , workers were required to accrue a private pension. Sometimes their National Insurance rebates were paid directly into their private funds; in other cases, people were expected to invest the spare money themselves. \nThe document explains that the Government will make a complex calculation to work out how much someone has managed to build up in private savings from their National Insurance rebates. \nA deduction from the £148 flat-rate will then be made, reducing the state's direct payout. People who would have qualified for a larger payment under the old state pension system will keep their entitlements. \nIn her statement, Baroness Altmann said that the number of people who receive the full flat-rate amount from the state will rise to half in 2020 and then 84 per cent by 2035. \n\"Nearly 90 per cent of people reaching state pension age in 2016-17 would have the full rate of the new state pension, or more, if we include the amount of additional state pension they opted out of or were opted out of when contracted out,\" she added. \ndan.hyde@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T02:22:24.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
