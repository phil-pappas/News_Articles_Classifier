The Greek government sought a three-year bailout loan of at least 53.5 billion euros ($59.4 billion) from the European Stability Mechanism. In exchange, it offered a package of reforms and spending cuts similar to those presented by creditors last month.\nU.S. Treasuries fell for a second day Friday as a rally in Chinese shares fueled speculation a rout in the world’s second-biggest stock market is ending, curbing demand for haven assets.\n“Assuming they put forward something which doesn’t immediately get thrown out then we probably continue with another small bounce in risk assets,” Owen Callan, a fixed-income strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in Dublin, said before the proposals were submitted. “Obviously you have China in the background here too, so it’s not as simple as good Greece news equals a bounce in risk assets.”\nItalian 10-year bond yields fell 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 2.03 percent as of 7:25 a.m. London time. The yield touched 2.01 percent, the lowest since June 3. The 1.5 percent security due in June 2025 rose 1.28, or 12.80 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 95.395.\nBunds Slide The yield on German 10-year bunds, the euro area’s benchmark sovereign securities, climbed eight basis points to 0.80 percent. That narrowed the spread between Italian and German debt by 23 basis points, the most since June 22, to 122 basis points.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index jumped 5.6 percent on Friday, extending its advance in the past two days to 12 percent. The gauge had tumbled more than 30 percent from its peak in June.\nWhile Greece has presented its proposals, it is not out of the woods yet. The package of spending cuts, pension savings and tax increases will face its first hurdle in the Greek Parliament on Friday and officials from across the euro region will meet on Sunday to discuss the measures. The day has been set as a deadline by the European Union for an agreement to be reached.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T09:32:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
