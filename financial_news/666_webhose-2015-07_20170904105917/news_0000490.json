Matt Levey from CHOICE urged consumers to contact Jetstar's chief executive and encourage him to put an end to the \"shonky\" practice. \"Websites shouldn't be designed to trick consumers into paying for extras that they don't want or need. From pricey travel insurance to $5 seat selection fees and sky-high baggage tariffs, Jetstar has you cornered,\" Mr Levey said.
