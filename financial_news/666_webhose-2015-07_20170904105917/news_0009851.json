(Tord Sollie; Flickr.com/CC/BY-NC-ND/2.0 ) \nThe government wants to bring in new laws ensuring a third of super fund trustees are independent directors. The move is widely seen as an attempt by the government to reduce union influence over part of Australia's $2 trillion super savings pool, and the industry super sector is pushing back. Sheryle Bagwell takes a look. \nIt's hard to argue against a law mandating more independent directors on super fund boards. What is industry super's complaint? \nThe body representing not-for-profit industry funds—Industry Super Australia—has released its submission to the government's consultation process, and its claims the drafts laws go further than just requiring more independent directors on boards. \nIt's absolutely clear that the model that industry funds and other not-for-profits have is superior because the funds themselves are aligned only to the interests of members. David Whitely, chief executive of Industry Super Australia \nIt argues the federal government is effectively trying to eliminate the difference between industry funds and the mostly bank-owned commercial retail funds altogether by proposing radical changes to the governance model for not-for-profit funds that has been in place since 1992. \nUnlike retail funds, not-for-profit corporate and industry funds are required to have equal representation on their boards of employer or industry groups on the one hand and employee representatives on the other, which in the case of industry funds usually means unions. \nThe government's reforms would now make that requirement totally voluntary. \nIndustry Super Australia believes this ‘one size fits all’ model will put members super returns at risk. \nHow will it do that? \nIndustry Super Australia claims its governance model works better than the prevailing model in the finance sector. \nIt points to industry funds having delivered higher returns over the past two decades. Indeed, eight of the top 10 performing super funds in the past financial year were industry funds, according to research house ChantWest. \nIndustry funds have also managed to avoid the scandals that have beset the commercial sector, despite most retail funds already having a majority of professional independent directors on their boards. \nDavid Whiteley, chief executive of Industry Super Australia, told RN Breakfast that he believes the government sees the future of superannuation to be the for-profit, bank-owned super model. \n‘It's absolutely clear that the model that industry funds and other not-for-profits have is superior because the funds themselves are aligned only to the interests of members,’ he said. \n‘These funds do not pay dividends or other profits back to parent associations like the banks. They are only focused on delivering better returns to members and have achieved that over the past two decades.’ \nSo what happens now? \nSubmissions to the consultation process ended on Friday, with the government hoping to introduce the new legislation into Parliament in spring. \nSo far, Labor has not shown it's hand as to whether it will support the legislation or not, with the Senate crossbenchers divided. \nIndustry Super Australia and other superannuation groups opposed to the reforms are now hoping to turn up the political heat in much the same way they did when the government proposed to wind back Labor's future of financial advice changes. \nAssistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has rejected suggestions that the government's reforms are ideologically driven and designed to dilute the influence of the unions. \nHe says the changes are designed simply to improve the governance of super funds as the national savings pool grows to a whopping $2 trillion. \nBut given that industry funds already outperform their commercial counterparts, the government might face some difficulties convincing Senate crossbenchers and the wider community that the existing model needs fixing. \nRN Breakfast is the show informed Australians wake up to.
