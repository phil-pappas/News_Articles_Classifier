More Shake-up of pensions tax relief considered \nThe reforms gave savers aged 55 and over the freedom to cash in their savings in a defined contribution fund, with no effective requirement to buy an annuity as was the case under the old rules. \nThe release of the data was timed to coincide with the 100 days of the new pension rules and found that nearly 250,000 payments were made to customers over the eight week period. \n“This is an important reminder that tens of thousands of people are successfully accessing the pension freedoms as intended and on the whole the industry has risen to the challenge of giving customers what they want,” said Yvonne Braun, ABI director of long-term savings policy. \n“We are just three months into the biggest overhaul in pensions for a generation which was introduced in only one year, so some issues remain that need to be worked through, in particular around financial advice.” \nThe ABI figures suggest the government may be underestimating the take-up of the new flexibilities. \nIn last week’s Summer Budget, the government said that more than 85,000 people had taken advantage of the new flexibilities since they came infor force. However, the ABI said that its figure, of 250,000 payments made, could represent individuals receiving multiple payments. \nThe ABI data showed that over the two month period, there were 65,000 cash lump sum withdrawals totalling more than £1bn. The average amount of cash taken out was £15,500. \nA further £800m was taken from pension funds via 170,000 withdrawals from income drawdown, or a pension wrapper where savings are left invested. \nThe figures show a huge swing by consumers towards income drawdown products and away from annuities, which are typically bought at retirement and deliver a secure income for life. \nOver the two month period, 10,300 income drawdown policies were sold, with sales valued at £720m compared with 11,300 annuities, with a sales value of £630m. \nIn 2013, before the radical changes were announced in the 2014 Budget, about 350,000 new annuity products were sold. \nHowever, the ABI data revealed that less than half of those who bought an annuity, or 45 per cent, had bought their policy from a provider other than the one with which they built up their savings. Just over half of those who bought an income drawdown contract, or 52 per cent, had shopped around. \nMinisters recently announced plans to consult “before the summer” on whether action is needed to break down any barriers faced by individuals who want to take advantage of the new flexible access options, such as excessive exit penalties. \nThe government will consult before the summer on options for making the process for transferring pensions from one scheme to another quicker and smoother.
