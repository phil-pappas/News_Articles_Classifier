Almost all of them (95 per cent) own their residence versus renting. Fifty-eight per cent say they have paid off their mortgage and among those that still have a mortgage the average amount they have left to pay back is only about $176,000.\nOn average, wealthy Canadians plan to retire at about age 60 and feel they need an average of $2 million for their retirement. The majority plan to stay in Canada during their retirement and want to spend their time travelling, with family, pursuing their hobbies and volunteering.\nThe majority of affluent Canadians have an average of $2.1 million in their portfolios, which they either hold by themselves or share with their spouse or partner. Nearly one quarter of the affluent have more than $2 million in their portfolios.\nNinety-one per cent plan to use the money in their portfolio to fund their retirement, 42 per cent plan to use it as an inheritance for their family and 23 per cent plan to use it as income. Almost two thirds consider themselves to be balanced investors, 24 per cent say they are conservative and 14 per cent are aggressive investors.\n\"Given that so many affluent Canadians plan to use their investments to fund their retirement or take care of their family in the future, it's crucial that their portfolios are properly structured in order to ensure that their wealth is insulated for the long term,\" says Richard Mason, President and CEO of BMO Private Investment Counsel. \"Having a properly diversified portfolio that takes into account your age, life stage, income requirements and risk tolerance along with your short- and long-term goals is key to successful investing.\"\nStudies confirm that people today are living longer. According to Statistics Canada more than 5.3 million people in Canada are 65 or older, accounting for about 15.3 per cent of the entire population and by 2061 more than 78,000 people over the age of 100 will be living in the country.\nWhile people are living longer, they are not necessarily living longer well.\n\"More and more of us are living longer, which is good news, however the promise of living well longer has not necessarily come true,\" says Gordon Graves, vice president and national director of trust and estate services with BMO Private Banking. \"The (financial) industry generally has put too much of an emphasis on wealth transfer. But what is more important is to look at seniors and how they age because many of us may reach a point where we need the assistance of others to handle our affairs either temporarily or for the long term.\"\nBMO recently launched a program that offers a suite of services for seniors as they age. BMO Continuity is an all-in-one service catered specifically to high net worth individuals designed to address both the financial and non-financial needs as one ages. It includes investment management, cash management and bill-paying services, private banking services, power of attorney for property, estate settlement and wealth transfer, tax preparation and a variety of lifestyle services such as concierge and health and wellness solutions.\nAll services are available for a bundled fee based on the size and complexity of one's estate.\n\"Continuity links your financial care and management to your personal health at every stage of your life ensuring you have a wealth plan that works for you now and later on, whatever might happen,\" Graves says. \"It's good to have this conversation with family, loved ones and advisers earlier rather than later so you are prepared, because you never know when circumstances can change.\"\nTalbot Boggs is a Toronto-based business communications professional who has worked with national news organizations, magazines and corporations in the finance, retail, manufacturing and other industrial sectors.\nCopyright 2015 Talbot Boggs\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T22:11:08.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
