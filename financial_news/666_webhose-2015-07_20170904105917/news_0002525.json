Justin McManus Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Asylum seekers arriving by boat have played a pivotal role in two Labor election losses.\nJohn Howard's exploitation and demonisation of those aboard the MV Tampa in 2001 effortlessly wedged Kim Beazley's opposition and helped engineer Howard's comeback victory that year.\nThe issue played a far greater role not just in Labor's 2013 election loss of government, but in the events that helped precipitate it. Kevin Rudd's relaxation of Howard's border protocols resulted in a renewed influx of boats, which Rudd was powerless to stop.\nThe first doubts – internal and external – about his seemingly impenetrable leadership arose in October 2009 when he was unable to resolve the stand-off with the Indonesian government concerning the group of Tamil asylum seekers refusing to disembark from their rescue ship, the Australian Customs vessel, Oceanic Viking .\nThat stand-off is now commonly referred to as the beginning of the unravelling of Rudd, who was dumped by his colleagues eight months later.\nBy the time Labor lost government in 2013, the situation was completely out of control and was, along with Labor's infighting, a key reason the government was booted out.\nSome 50,000 people, a mixture of refugees and economic migrants, had come by boat in five years. Another estimated 1200 drowned trying to get here.\nDiscomfort over out of control events Even voters who felt sympathetic to the cause felt uncomfortable with how events spiralled out of control.\n'I'm all for them coming here but it feels like they're jumping over my back fence,\" recalled an MP recently of a conversation he had with a constituent.\nLittle wonder that when he retired from the Senate after that election loss, Bob Carr's parting advice to the caucus was to not ever again allow a cigarette paper's difference between Labor and Coalition policy on the issue.\nEmpirical evidence shows Labor cannot win on asylum seekers. Try and show humanity and it gets exploited. No one other than the Greens could ever contend that what occurred under the Labor government was in any way ideal.\nIn that vein, Bill Shorten has done the right thing in taking on the Labor Left at this weekend's national conference in fighting to have the option, if elected, of turning back the boats. That was once anathema to Labor, but so was the Pacific solution, which the ALP also had to embrace when in government to try and \"stop the boats\".\nOf course there are risks. Some of the disenchanted will go and vote Greens despite doubling the humanitarian intake to 27,000 refugees a year and other humanitarian trade-offs. Others who see the issue as a deal breaker will stick with the Coalition anyway.\nBut Shorten needs to neutralise the issue as much as he can in the lead-up to the election and, if he wins, do everything he can to avoid the boats starting again.\nCrazy brave, not weak That he has taken on the issue should quieten some of his detractors who keep claiming he is weak. In fact, Shorten's counterintuitive style of late shows he is anything but. A little crazy brave maybe, but not weak.\nTake climate change. Electorally, a price on carbon is Labor's equivalent of WorkChoices. To the chagrin of the true-believers, the Coalition tossed WorkChoices overboard when it cost it the 2007 election.\nBut after becoming leader following the 2013 rout, Shorten, to the amazement of the Coalition, re-committed Labor to the policy principle of pricing carbon. Hardly spineless or populist.\nAs he announced on Friday when opening the conference, the bulk of the heavy lifting on climate change under Labor would be done by having a 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030. Playing a supporting role would be an emissions trading scheme dealing in low-cost international permits, something business and industry have long supported as their preferred option.\nThe emphasis on renewable energy is politically smart. Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey have made fools of themselves with their unhinged attacks on wind farms. It shows they have yet to learn that voter hatred of the carbon tax was more to do with its association with Gillard, the fact no one ever really understood how it worked and that most regarded it as an economic issue.\nEveryone gets renewable energy and they like it. It's a feel-good thing and it enables Labor to create a populist and simple point of difference with the government over climate change.\nMoreover, those on the Left cranky about boat turnbacks are very happy about the climate policy. It was the high point of Shorten's speech on Friday when people genuinely got out of their chairs and whooped and hollered.\nFired up the base It has fired up the base and it gives it something to fight for, something in which it believes and, in the case of renewable energy, something easy to sell.\nAs Labor starts to detail the policy, it will explain that the new renewable energy target will be reached through a range of mechanisms, which should push back at the power price argument.\nPolitics reaches a tipping point this weekend. The ALP national conference, an event that occurs once each term, is always a make or break event for the leader. It is more important to not stuff up.\nThe 2011 conference was a calamity for Gillard, all of her own making. She hit the fence on the first morning when, in her opening speech, she sparked a leadership war by omitting Rudd as she rattled off every Labor leader going back to the war and lauded their achievements.\nShorten has shown with policy pronouncements thus far that he is not afraid and nor is he going to die wondering. The Left is entitled to kick up a stink over boats but needs also to consider the bigger picture. Is it better to be in government or not?\nBoth Shorten and Abbott are about as popular as boils according to the opinion polls.\nLabor consoles itself with the observation that unlike Shorten, who entered Parliament in 2007 and had been largely unknown until recently, Abbott has been around for 20 years.\nFor the Prime Minister, the voter attitude will be harder shift, but Shorten doesn't need any own goals.\nPhillip Coorey is The Australian Financial Review 's chief political correspondent.\nAt ﻿", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-24T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:03:40.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
