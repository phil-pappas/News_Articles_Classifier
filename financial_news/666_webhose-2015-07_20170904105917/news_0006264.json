Andrew Meares by Fleur Anderson Food manufacturers will be required to include new country-of-origin food labels that will include a bar-chart displaying what proportion of the ingredients is locally grown.\nThe labelling system, which arose from the outcry earlier this year over hepatitis associated with imported Chinese frozen berries, is expected to cost manufacturers and consumers $37 million to introduce. Stock displaying the code is expected to be on supermarket shelves later this year.\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott, Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce and Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane announced the new packaging rules in Canberra on Tuesday.\nCountry of origin for food has gained popularity in the artisan food movement, which encourages consumers to consider the \"food miles\" involved in getting food from farm to table and the provenance of products.\nGovernment opinion polling found more than 80 per cent of consumers were willing to pay 1¢ extra on a $5 food item to ensure accurate labelling.\nOf those, more than 50 per cent were willing to pay an increase of 5 per cent in food costs to ensure better labelling.\nConsumers to meet cost The cost of the new system will be met by consumers who, the government estimates, will see a 1¢ increase on a $5 food item, or 0.5¢ increase on a $2.50 food item.\n \"I should point out that there are already significant labelling costs on Australian businesses as Australian businesses are already required to have the nutritional information,\" Mr Abbott said.\n\"They are often required to have refund information on the packaging, so it is not as if this is unheard of. What we are on about today is not substantially adding to business costs. What we are on about today is substantially adding to consumer information.\"\nThe new government label will include the existing green-and-gold kangaroo and triangle \"Australian made\" icon, with a bar chart showing what proportion of the ingredients is from Australia.\nIt will distinguish between products using overseas ingredients and packed in Australia. For example, \"Made in Australia from 100 per cent Australian ingredients\", \"Packed in Australia, Made in Canada\" and \"Made in Australia from Australian carrots and French peas.\"\nLong campaign Mr Macfarlane said he began campaigning for strong country of origin labelling as a grain farmer 30 years ago after his produce was marketed as made in Australia \"from local or imported peanuts\".\n\"That told the consumers nothing,\" he said. \"That began the journey which has culminated today with a simple straightforward solution to labelling which, as you can see, the consumers don't even have to reach into their pockets and pull out their glasses for.\n\"They don't have to read the text unless they want to, because the symbol will tell them it is made in Australia or processed in Australia.\"\nThe initial rollout of the scheme will be voluntary so there could be changes on supermarket shelves later this year. However, the Commonwealth will need the agreement of the states and territories to go ahead with the mandatory new rules in 2016. There will be a phased implementation period for small businesses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T12:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:59:01.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
