While undoubtedly many households have been hurt by the plunge, many others would have sold and profited.\n \"Importantly, despite the market coming off, on a net basis the SHCOMP index is still 70 per cent higher now than it was in mid-2014.\n\"Third, much of the equity outstanding is held by the government, local governments and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), who now have to shoulder an even larger share of the nominal wealth loss than the private sector.\"\nWhile the Nomura economists admit that the sharemarket crash will make it harder for Chinese entities to raise money for fixed-asset investment, only 2 per cent of China's aggregate financing is generated through equity capital markets.\nLiu says margin calls against investors who had borrowed to buy shares undoubtedly had an impact upon the panic selling of stocks. The process of clearing those margin positions is well under way but may take another few weeks.\nWorth buying some stocks As that process has occurred stocks with strong market positions have fallen to levels worth buying. She gave the example of China Rail Construction Corp.\nLiu says there is an upside to Chinese households' equity allocation with data showing that in the decade to 2013 Chinese households' equity allocation troughed at 6 per cent in 2005 and peaked at 27 per cent in 2007.\n\"We estimate that at year-end 2014, the number was about 17 per cent. We believe that at the peak of our three-year bullish call, household equity allocation may reach 30 per cent,\" she says.\n\"We have noticed that once the shift in household asset allocation sets in, it may take several years to complete,\" she says.\n\"We estimate that this round of shifts may last till 2017. Based on our forecasts, 22.5 trillion yuan ($4.9 trillion) may be redirected into equities over 2015-17. Assuming 25 per cent will flow into Hong Kong equities, this means 5.6 trillion yuan ($1.2 trillion) of new inflows into the Hong Kong stock market.\"\nShe says that rather than focusing on the absolute decline in Chinese equities in the past month, her clients in Europe and the United States were looking at the price earnings multiples which were now less demanding than before.\nLiu says it is noteworthy that the Chinese stockmarket value is much less relative to the total economy compared to other developed economies such as the US, Japan and Australia.\nForces in the market's favour Another commentator with a long-term positive outlook for China is Phat Dragon , Westpac's weekly chronicle of events in China.\nPhat Dragon says forces in the market's favour were: the stance of monetary policy; households being considerably underweight in the asset class; the poor performance of real estate, a key alternative investment vehicle; foreign inflows associated with HK-Shanghai Connect and RQFII quota increases; the local government debt resolution model being relatively friendly for banks; aggregate valuations were not stretched relative to the 2007 episode (albeit certain sectors had managed to ascend to ludicrous heights).\n\"Each of these factors remains valid, with the arguable exception of the Tier-1 housing market (especially in Shenzhen),\" Phat Dragon says.\nWoes in the west Who said ratings agencies have lost their power and influence?\nAs the 90 day deadline looms for a decision by Standard & Poor's on the sovereign credit rating of Western Australia the market is voting with its feet. WA's semi-government bonds, which are rated AA+ with a negative credit watch by S&P, are trading at a 35-basis-point premium to the interest rate of NSW semi-government bonds, which are rated AAA with a stable outlook.\nQueensland's semi-government bonds trade at a 30-basis-point premium to NSW bonds even though its rating is also AA+ from S&P.\nThe difference is that Queensland has a stable outlook.\nWestern Australia was put on negative credit watch by S&P on April 14 which means a decision on its outlook is due next week. There is a 50-50 chance that it will be put on a negative outlook by S&P.\nThat will probably mean a further blow out in the state's cost of borrowing. There is a vicious circle involved in the credit ratings world. Poor ratings outcomes always occur when the sovereign needs to borrow more to meet its expenditures.\nNSW is likely to slash its net borrowings as a result of this year's sale of TransGrid, which owes the state about $2.8 billion.\nWA's problem is that it has been heavily reliant on royalties from the mining industry to meet its revenues. According to Moody's Investors Service its royalties made up 21.6 per cent of revenue in 2014 but that revenue has since plunged.\nWA's fiscal position is deteriorating but the state carries less gross debt than Queensland which has debt equal to 150 per cent of revenue, according to Moody's. WA's debt is about 100 per cent of revenue.\nThe rating agencies could well change their views about Queensland next week after it releases its budget. The state is less vulnerable to the mining downturn as it only relies on royalties for about 6 per cent of its income.\nNevertheless, the Queensland Labor government led by Annastacia Palaszczuk will struggle to reduce the state's debt after abandoning the privatisation of the state's electricity businesses.\nMcFarlane looks for CEO Former ANZ Banking Group chief executive John McFarlane is a man of action as shown by the sudden sacking of Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins . McFarlane, who will become executive chairman of Barclays from July 17, will run the bank while a search is undertaken for a successor to Jenkins, who has only been in the job since late 2012.\nThe favoured internal candidate is group finance director Tushar Morzaria.\nA global search will be undertaken and that must inevitably involve analysis of the potential candidates in Australia.\nOne issue that will go against Australian bankers is their lack of experience with aggressive regulatory intervention.\nAustralian bankers who have worked closely with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission would be ill prepared for the type of intrusive regulation practised in the UK following the financial crisis.\nAs ASIC chairman, Greg Medcraft said on Wednesday, the major banks in Australia are happily using internal lawyers to play games with the regulators seeking information. That would not be tolerated in the UK.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\ntony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-07-08T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:10:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
