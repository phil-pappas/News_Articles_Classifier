British tourists face long queues at cash machines, and there have been reports of hospitals running out of drugs. But even if you have no intention of travelling to Greece, the crisis could still affect your finances possibly even positively. \nHere we answer the key questions. \n= Will ATMs work? How much will I be able to withdraw? = \nCash machines are still operational across Greece and tourists are not subject to the €60 (£43) daily limit being imposed on locals. \nHowever, many machines on the mainland and on the Greek islands are running out of cash thanks to high demand. The banks are restocking the machines, but it takes time to transport cash to isolated areas so some have been empty for a number of days now. \n= Will I be able to pay by credit card? = \nThe card network in Greece is still fully functioning and cards are being accepted by large retailers and hotel chains. But many smaller shops, restaurants and tour operators are insisting on cash payments to help boost their cash flow. The Foreign Office has advised visitors to Greece of the possibility that banking services including credit card processing could become limited at short notice. \n= How much cash should I take? Would travellers cheques or a prepaid card be a good idea? = \nIt is sensible for tourists to take as much cash as they are comfortable carrying. The Foreign Office said travellers should take sufficient euros in cash to cover the duration of their stay, emergencies, unforeseen circumstances and any unexpected delays. There are currently no restrictions on taking unspent euros out of Greece at the end of your stay. \nTravellers cheques could be difficult to cash as bank branches are closed until at least July 6 and other outlets may refuse to accept them. Prepaid cards are still being accepted but, as they work on the same network as debit and credit cards, they may stop working at short notice. \n• I'm buying Greek shares (even though the Athens stock market is shut) \n= Is it dangerous to pay for anything before I travel? = \nIt may be a good idea to book and pay for flights and accommodation direct with your airline or hotel using a credit card before you travel. By doing this you will be covered under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, meaning that if something goes wrong you should receive a refund from your card provider for bookings worth more than £100. If you book through a third party such as a travel agent, or use a debit card to pay, this protection is unlikely to apply. \n= Should I avoid Greek euros? = \nAll euro notes have a one-letter, 11-digit number that indicates which country issued it. Numbers prefixed “Y” are Greek. But all euros are backed by the European Central Bank, and it has insisted that each note is worth the same regardless of the country of issue. \n• MORE: I am going on holiday to Greece should I avoid 'Greek euros'? \n= If the drachma comes back, can I still spend euros? = \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) if Greece reverts to its old currency, euros and other currencies such as pounds sterling and US dollars are likely to be widely accepted for many months. \nWill I be able to get medical care if I fall ill or have an accident? \nThe crisis should not affect travellers’ ability to find and receive medical treatment. There have been no reports of hospitals being overrun or turning tourists away. \nWorried Greeks queue to withdraw their money. Photo: AFP \n= Will I have to pay doctors in cash? Will my travel insurance still cover me? = \nIf you require outpatient treatment you may have to pay bills worth several hundred pounds yourself and then claim back the money. Holidaysafe.co.uk, an insurer, advises customers to pay any bills of less than £500 themselves and claim when the treatment is complete. \nHowever, if hospitals demand cash payments of more than £500 or payments before treatment, you should contact your insurer as soon as possible, so it can liaise with the doctors and deal with the bills directly. \n= Will my insurance cover me if there is social unrest? = \nCivil unrest is covered if you have purchased a “travel disruption” policy option. This provides cover for delayed departure, abandoning your trip, missed departure and accommodation cover in the event of civil unrest. \n= Will my travel insurance cover me for stolen cash? = \nYes, although there will be a cap on the cover. These limits are linked to the level of cover chosen by the customer. \nSome providers have increased the cash limits for Greece; Virgin Money has trebled its cover for lost or stolen cash for a defined period, for example. \n• Greek banks down to €500m in cash reserves as economy crashes \n• Greece: holidaymakers spending as little cash as possible \n• Will a prepaid holiday card work in Greece if other bank cards fail? \n= Will my mobile phone work abroad? = \nYes, the major providers we asked (including EE, Vodafone and Three) said British mobile phones would work abroad as usual. \n= Should I think about buying cheap Greek property? = \nProperty values in Greece have tumbled by about 40pc since the onset of the financial crisis, data from the Bank of Greece shows. But some other eurozone counties saw bigger falls, such as 50pc in Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) . \nBuying immovable assets in a country mired in crisis is a high-risk strategy you could find your Greek home valued in drachmas before long, while the cash-scrapped government could be tempted to raise property taxes. \nShould I buy Greek shares? \nThe Athens stock market has fallen much more dramatically than Greek property by more than 90pc since the financial crisis. If an agreement is reached between Greece and its creditors the market could soar. \nHowever, it’s hard to buy at the moment because the Athens stock exchange, like Greek banks, is closed. Resourceful investors are having to turn to exchange-traded “tracker” funds listed elsewhere. For details see page 10. \n= Will the crisis also affect interest rates in Britain? = \nIf a mass Greek default causes contagion and panic spreads, it could lead to a repeat of the credit crunch and financial crisis of 2007 to 2009. In this scenario, wholesale interest rates would spike higher, and this would mean higher rates on new mortgages, and even increase pressure on banks to increase standard variable rates. \n• How could the crisis in Greece affect UK mortgage rates? \nHowever, if the Greek fallout is enough to rattle markets but without causing extreme contagion, it could, perversely, makes the yields on British government bonds (gilts) and therefore mortgage costs fall. \nThis is because Britain has come to be seen as a relatively safe place to park money in uncertain times. If nervous investors park their money in gilts, the price rises and the yield falls, potentially dragging down mortgage rates. \n• The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T16:12:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
