Photo: Bloomberg\nAs global regulators push the clearing of over-the-counter derivatives through central counterparties, superannuation funds hedging against currency fluctuations face higher dealing costs unless the government changes the law to allow them to pledge their assets as collateral.\nThe Superannuation Industry Supervision (SIS) Act prevents super funds from providing security over fund assets, meaning they are unable to post collateral as security to get better derivative prices from dealers, said Oliver Harvey, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's senior executive leader for financial market infrastructure.\nThe push for OTC derivatives to be cleared centrally is part of the G20's plan to make markets safer and more transparent. Central clearing allows trades to be monitored so regulators can target the build-up of systemic risk. The US, Japan and the European Union have already mandated central clearing for OTC derivatives, which is being considered in Australia.\nBut the global move to central clearing is already pushing up the price of uncleared trades in Australia. \"We have anecdotally heard this is starting to affect some clients in this market,\" Mr Harvey told a conference in Sydney on Wednesday, organised by Global Investor magazine.\nAdvertisement \"Super funds should start to think where dealers are pricing and how their appetite might change, and whether they need to provide access to central clearing to ensure they can continue to trade OTC derivatives at the best possible price.\"\nInternational standards The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority is considering the implementation of international standards for the provision of collateral.\nASIC has told federal Treasury a change to the SIS Act is urgent and necessary in light of the global reforms. \"This is something the industry needs to take on board and push as hard as it possibly can,\" Mr Harvey said. \"We have desperately encouraged the government to do whatever they can to get it up.\"\nThe deputy head of payments at the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mark Manning, said the central bank is expecting a wider range of assets to be pledged as collateral. \"Centralised infrastructure generally can be a significant catalyst for the more efficient and more sophisticated use of collateral in the Australian market, as it is overseas,\" he said.\nPointing to the growing focus on how to manage the billions of dollars worth of cash and securities that will need to be stumped up to back derivatives trades, Mr Manning said the reforms will increase costs for some businesses, creating a \"greater impetus to seek out these efficiencies and look for the opportunities that collateral management in its various kinds can deliver\".\nBob Sahota, the head of fixed income at Challenger, said the company had reviewed all its bilateral agreements to ensure collateral is efficiently managed, and suggested Challenger will expand from providing cash as collateral to also pledging to investment grade credit and equities.\nMr Oliver said the new derivatives data gives ASIC a more granular view of potential systemic risks and is being used in market abuse investigations and to monitor overall exposures of licensees. Data from OTC and exchange-traded markets could ultimately be linked with the equities and futures markets, to provide a broad picture for market surveillance, he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:09:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
