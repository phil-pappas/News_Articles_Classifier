The plan is intended to cut earth-warming pollution from power plants by 30 percent by 2030, setting in motion one of the most significant U.S. actions ever to address global warming. Once completed, the rule will set the first national limits on carbon dioxide from existing power plants, the largest source of greenhouse gases in the U.S. \nCongressional Republicans have vowed to block the rule and some GOP governors have said their states will not comply. McCarthy said she also expects a series of legal challenges to the rule, but said she is confident the administration will prevail. \n\"We're actually very good at writing rules and defending them in court, and this will be no exception,\" she said. \nOn a related topic, McCarthy slammed proposed spending cuts being pushed by Republicans in Congress, saying they could have significant impact on \"the core functions of the agency.\" \nThe House is debating a bill this week that would slash the EPA's budget by 9 percent and block the agency from advancing a host of new rules, including the plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. \nEPA officials receive calls daily from states and localities with questions about enforcement of environmental rules, McCarthy said, adding that the proposed budget cuts could make it difficult to answer those calls. \nIf the EPA can't answer those questions, who will? McCarthy asked. \"Ghostbusters won't answer the phone,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T22:04:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
