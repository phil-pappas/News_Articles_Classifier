New orders and new export orders, which expanded in June, fell this month, according to the survey.\nThe poor PMI survey contrasted with recent data that suggested the world's second-largest economy was stabilizing after the government said annual growth in April-June held steady at 7 percent, slightly better than market expectations.\nContinuing contraction in factory growth is likely to fuel speculation that China will further loosen monetary policy to try to stoke activity.\nEconomists polled by Reuters this month said they expect China to reduce interest rates by 25 basis points before the year-end. The amount of cash that Chinese banks must hold as reserves was also expected to be reduced to keep the Chinese economy growing at 7 percent this year, the slowest pace in a quarter of a century.\nAdditional policy support would make it the most aggressive easing cycle overseen by the central bank since the height of the 2008/09 global financial crisis.\n\"The central bank will maintain its loose monetary policy in the second half this year, and it will continue to apply different methods to control liquidity,\" Zhu Haibin, economist at JP Morgan in Beijing, said on Wednesday.\nChina's Caixin Media Co Ltd is publishing the PMI for the first time this month after replacing HSBC as the sponsor of the survey.
