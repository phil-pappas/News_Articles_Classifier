Photo: Reuters Tsipras, however, was more upbeat. After meeting with European leaders he said he was \"positive\", adding that the goal now was \"to conclude the process by the end of the week, at the latest\".\nHe added that \"the Greek proposals include credible reforms in order to obtain appropriate financing\".\n'Serious proposals' After a resounding victory at Sunday's referendum, the Tsipras government had signalled that Greece would come up with \"new proposals\" in order to reach an agreement with the country's creditors that would keep the debt-laden country within the euro zone. This announcement had raised hopes that a deal could be in sight at last night's meeting.\n Alesix Tsipras has been put on notice that Greece still needed to make longer-term proposals on the reforms it would implement in exchange for fresh financial assistance Yves Herman In a presentation by Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and European Commission head, Jean-Claude Juncker, ahead of the broader summit, Tsipras outlined of the reforms that Athens would implement in exchange for fresh financial assistance.\nThese reportedly represented a slightly modified version of reforms previously rejected by Athens.\nAfter the meeting, Hollande insisted that Greece \"must make serious proposals\". Merkel was even more dismissive of Greece's efforts. \"There is still no basis for negotiations,\" she noted, adding the warning, \"I say it's not a matter of weeks but of a few days.\"\nJuncker also adopted a hardline approach, warning during a press conference overnight that detailed preparations had been made for a 'Grexit' – an organised departure of Greece from the eurozone.\nGreece now faces a deadline on Friday morning to present a detailed reform and financing proposal – which is tantamount to a third bailout for the embattled country.\nIf the eurozone believes that Athens' reforms are sufficient, the country is likely to receive a short-term loan in order to reopen its banks (which have been closed for more than a week), while negotiations for a longer-term financing are held.\nIf, however, Athens' package is rejected, plans will be put in place for a Grexit.\nA new summit of European leaders is now scheduled for Sunday to evaluate Greece's proposals.\nA major stumbling block could be Greece's debt burden, which stands at a massive 180 per cent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Last week, Tsipras was pushing for a 30 per cent write-down on the country's debt, which Berlin has consistently rejected, and Merkel again ruled out overnight. However, Greece's creditors might be prepared to reduce the country's pain by extending maturity dates and cutting interest rates on the debt even further.\nAt an earlier meeting, eurozone finance ministers were also disappointed that although Greece has a new finance minister – with the more pragmatic Tsakalotos stepping into the role formally played by the abrasive Varoufakis – the country failed to come up with new proposals to discuss.\nInstead, Tsakalotos presented a modified version of Greece's previous proposal, which consists of some reforms, a program to boost investment in the country and a restructuring of the country's debt.\nECB deadline Athens has less than two weeks to reach a deal that will allow it to meet a €3.5 ($5.2) billion debt repayment due to the ECB. If the country defaults, it would be extremely difficult for the ECB to keep providing a lifeline to the Greek banks. If that support were withdrawn, most Greek banks would collapse, forcing the Greek government to print its own currency to recapitalise them.\nAlready, the ECB is uncomfortable that it has become the main source of liquidity for Greece's banks. On Monday, the ECB refused a request from Greece to raise the ceiling – which now stands at it €89 billion - on the amount of emergency funding that it provides and instead has tightened the screws on Greek lenders by requiring them to use more assets as security in exchange for emergency loans in future.\nBut France's Hollande promised that the ECB would not cut emergency funding for the Greek banks for now, as Athens had feared.\nAt a press conference after the meeting of European Leaders, Hollande said that the ECB would continue to provide minimal liquidity for Greece until Sunday.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/greece_details_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-08T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T04:05:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
