In earlier electronic trading, the single currency fell as low as $1.1089. It was also at 136.40 yen compared with 136.58 yen in US trade. \n\"Market reaction in the euro is surprisingly muted,\" said Steven Englander, global head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) . \n\"The absence of agreement and toughness of terms are eye-catching, but investors are waiting for the outcome more than trying to anticipate it.\" \n- Shanghai recovery - \nShanghai extending a rebound at the end of last week that came after weeks of extreme volatility, with investors settled by government moves last week to prevent a market crash. \nWhile Greece's future in the eurozone hangs in the balance, attention is also on China. \nChina's stock market rose in the previous two sessions but dealers remain nervous after a month of massive selling that has seen the Shanghai Composite index fall about 30 percent, wiping trillions of dollars off valuations. \nAbout 400 firms began trading again Monday in Shanghai after almost half the market was suspended last week to prevent a further meltdown. \nInvestors welcomed an upbeat trade report that showed exports increased more than expected in June. \n\"Imports improved significantly in June because of lower import duties,\" said Liu Xuezhi, an economist with Bank of Communications Co. in Shanghai, told Bloomberg News. \"Exports are expected to maintain modest growth in coming months to help the economy.\" \nHowever, Monday's figures also showed two-way trade sank almost seven percent in the first half of the year, well off the government's target of growth of \"about 6.0 percent\" for all of 2015. \nDespite the uptick in Shanghai, Sam Tuck, a senior currency strategist in Auckland at ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd., warned: \"It's positive that the authorities didn't feel the need to do anything over the weekend but markets are still clearly nervous and we need to see most of the stock market open. \n\"There's still lots of halts.\" \nThe sell-off spread to other regional markets on fears for the world's number two economy and key driver of global growth. \nOn oil markets, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in August fell 78 cents to $51.96 and Brent dropped $1.01 to $57.72. \nGold fetched $1,161.85 compared with $1,163.50 late Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T08:13:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
