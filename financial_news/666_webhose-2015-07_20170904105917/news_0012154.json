The market will continue to search for more hints on whether it will come in September or later,\" said Shin Kadota, chief FX strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.\nThe data followed the Federal Reserve's cautious but upbeat assessment on the economy on Wednesday, which some traders saw as bullish for the greenback.\nU.S. interest rate futures priced in a higher chance of a September rate hike, with the price of Federal Fund rate futures contracts for September to December all hitting the lowest level in a month and a half.\nAs the dollar held firm, the euro slipped to as low as $1.08935 on Thursday, its lowest level in more than a week. It was at $1.0945 in early Asian trade, up slightly from late U.S. levels.\nThe euro also faced further selling pressure on a Financial Times report that said the International Monetary Fund could not officially join bailout talks with Greece until the debt-burdened nation agrees to comprehensive reforms\nAgainst the yen, the dollar rose to a seven-week high of 124.58 yen on Thursday before stepping back to 123.97 yen in early Asian trade.\nTraders were cautious about pushing the Japanese currency to 125 yen, as Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda had said in June that he saw no reason for further currency weakness when the yen was around that level.\nThe yen showed limited response to mixed Japanese inflation data, which showed nationwide core CPI rose 0.1 percent in June, more than economists' forecast of a flat reading.\nBut July core CPI in the Tokyo area, announced one month ahead of nationwide figures, showed core CPI declined 0.1 percent.
