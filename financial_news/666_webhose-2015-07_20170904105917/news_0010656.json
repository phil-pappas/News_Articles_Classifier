Those are colossal markets in terms of population,\" said Sergei Pigarev, analyst with Rye, Man & Gor securities. \n\"The deal will, of course, allow Rosneft to cement its position there and help to get more market share from Saudi Arabia, though we have to look at the prices, how much is Rosneft is paying?\" \nSaudi Arabia fell behind Russia and Angola as the biggest crude suppliers to China in May. The OPEC kingpin also lost its spot as India's top oil supplier to Nigeria for the first time in at least four years. \nWhile Rosneft sends the bulk of its oil to nine large refineries in Russia, it has interests in German and Italian refineries and is looking to get a slice of the market in China. \nThe European Union and United States have imposed wide-ranging sanctions on Russian companies and individuals, including Rosneft's Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine last year. \nThe sanctions include visa bans and restrictions on access to Western capital, as well as stopping Western firms providing technology or assistance to tap unconventional oil in Russia. \nRussian oil and gas sales, which account for half the country's federal budget revenues, have not been affected by the sanctions so far, though some participants fear the worst. \n\"The rationale for the deal appears to be finding a new long-term market for Rosneft's crude outside of the EU to minimise the risk of disruptions,\" analysts at Russian bank Uralsib Capital wrote in a note.
