Islington and neighbouring Camden council complained that 42% was possible and at a lower rent than proposed by the developer. But the London mayor, Boris Johnson, gave the go-ahead for 120 fewer affordable homes than the councils believed were possible.\n“Developers and landowners have benefited at the expense of essential affordable housing thanks to a viability industry that has got out of control,” said James Murray, executive member for housing at Islington, the Labour council that said it would resist developers’ claims of commercial confidentiality about viability assessments.\n“People are being conned out of affordable housing in some of the biggest developments in London. It has become such a murky process the pendulum has swung too far in favour of developers.”\nOne viability assessment was released last month following a freedom of information battle. It showed a developer considered 25% profit acceptable when the council scrutinising it said 15% was more normal. The difference on the scheme at the Elephant & Castle in south London equated to £100m.\nJerry Flynn, who obtained the figures, welcomed Islington’s move.\n“The viability assessment is the most critical document now in the planning process and we are disabled if we can’t see it and share it among people who understand them better than we do,” said Flynn, a former resident of the Heygate estate at Elephant & Castle, which has been knocked down to make way for a new development.\nSadiq Khan, the MP for Tooting and a Labour candidate for London mayor, has said he would establish “a London-wide standard, which demands that all viability assessments are transparent, honest, and fair.\n“It’s wrong that complicated and secretive viability assessments are being used to protect landowners’ and developers’ profits, and prevent the building of affordable homes,” he said.\nProperty experts have warned that council officers have often struggled to analyse the viability calculations presented to them. Islington is demanding “all viability evidence must be robustly justified and appraisal assumptions should be benchmarked against publicly available data sources” and wants “supporting evidence from applicants and lenders to justify proposed rates of profit”.\nMelanie Leech, chief executive of the British Property Federation, which represents developers, said: “Viability is clearly a matter of public interest and we support an open and transparent process so that everyone can have confidence in the outcomes of the planning process.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T17:40:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
