In his Budget speech Finance minister Matia Kasaija said Uganda would grow by 6.4 per cent in the 2015/16 financial year. \nThe elections, which have already created a jittery economic environment, will come at a time when the country is experiencing volatile fundamentals including a rapid depreciation of the Shilling, rising inflation and prohibitively high interest rates, which have dampened the appetite for business loans. \nCurrently, according to Bank of Uganda, the Shilling has depreciated by more than 27 per cent with interest rates averaging at 24 per cent. Inflation which current stands at 4.9 per cent is slightly below the Central Bank's 5 per cent. \nDr Fred Muhumuza, a former adviser at the Ministry of Finance, predicted difficult times ahead, \"...especially now that interest rates have gone up. This means investments won't do well and we are likely to see some business closures.\" \nHe said Uganda would grow at 5 per cent, emphasising: \"... any economy growing below 8 per cent is not a good sign.\" \nDr Muhumuza said there is need to pray for good weather if Uganda was going to avoid a drastic spike in inflation in the event that there is food shortage. \nWhile releasing the June inflation figures in Kampala recently Uganda Bureau of Statistics said growth in inflation had been slow because of stable food supply. \nDr Suruma urged BoU to come up with measures that would protect the shilling from collapse, given that it has in recent months presented the biggest threat to growth. \n\"BoU should come up with stronger measures to reduce liquidity (money in circulation) however difficult it might seem.\" \nLast week, governor of BoU said the fear of rising inflation had been heightened by the weak Shilling and the presence of too much money chasing a few goods. \nOn his part, Dr Adam Mugume, the BoU director for research, said stability of the Shilling was dependent on several factors some of which are beyond the Central Bank, adding: \"No one can predict the likely trend of the dollar given the current challenges in Eurozone. But Bank of Uganda will continue to take measures to stabilise the currency,\" he said. \nAlready, experts have warned the Shilling risks being bruised further, considering that huge sums of electioneering money have already been thrown into the economy.
