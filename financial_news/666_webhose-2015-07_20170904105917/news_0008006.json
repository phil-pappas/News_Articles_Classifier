The contract had settled at its lowest since April, down 86 cents. \nBoth benchmarks are on track to post double-digit losses this month, in part pulled lower by expectations of higher Iranian exports following a deal over its nuclear programme with world powers. \nU.S. crude is down 17.8 percent so far this month and Brent is down 12.6 percent. \nA weakening dollar (.DXY) supports oil prices as it makes it cheaper for holders of other currencies to buy dollar-denominated commodities. \nOil prices could find additional support if the world's top exporter Saudi Arabia cuts production after the summer in reaction to lower seasonal domestic demand, as stated in a report by an industry publication on Thursday. \nWith a dim outlook for oil prices, the world's top oil companies could be forced into more spending cuts, as they are set to report yet another sharp drop in quarterly profits, according to analysts. \n\"Oil companies are hunkering down for a downturn that will take longer than some initially thought,\" said Martijn Rats, head of European oil and gas equity research at Morgan Stanley. \n(Reporting By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen; Editing by Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T05:53:02.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
