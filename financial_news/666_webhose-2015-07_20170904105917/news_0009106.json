S. Yamoah, Managing Director, Ghana Stock Exchange, said that increased attempts by companies to raise fresh funds through listing of bonds is an attestation that the Ghanaian capital market has picked up. He urged the private sector and the Government of Ghana to take advantage of the current interest from investors to tap the capital markets to finance their projects. \nDr. Adu Anane Antwi, Director General, Securities & Exchange Commission, observed that as more and more professional companies like afb Ghana locally look for capital it augurs well for investors in Ghana. \nThe Director of the Financial Sector Division, Ministry of Finance, Mr Joseph D. Chognuru in his address said, \"The Government is committed to providing a favourable macro-economic environment in Ghana which is conducive for both companies looking for fund and investors whether private or institutional. Such successful listings like that of afb Ghanaâ€™s ensures the deepening of our capital markets.\" \nArnold further added \"afb will predominantly use the first tranche of the bond proceeds to pay off USD debt owed to offshore counterparties. This debt is very expensive, especially given the weakening of the GHS vs the USD over the past two years and the balance will be used to continue expanding the loan portfolio. The successful listing means we can put our exchange risk behind us and confidently continue to grow the business into the future.\" \nafb started its operations in Ghana in 2010 and since then has invested over 20 million USD of capital into the Ghana market. afb Ghana has been growing steadily with over 198 full time staff, over 500 sales agents and has 23 branches catering to over 60,000 customers.
