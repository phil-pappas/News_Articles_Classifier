Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Labor leader Bill Shorten suffered a setback at the end of Labor's three-day policy conference by being forced into a deal in which the party will only grant its MPs a conscience vote on gay marriage for the remainder of this parliamentary term and the next.\nShould gay marriage not have been legislated by then, Labor MPs will be bound to vote for it.\nThe conference ended on Sunday with Labor resolving its most vexed policy dilemmas of climate change and asylum seekers but left it appearing divided at the highest levels.\nThe decision of gay marriage, forced on Mr Shorten by his deputy Tanya Plibersek, the Left, and elements of the Right-leaning National Union of Workers, left gay marriage advocates fearful for their cause in the short term.\nAFR Graphic Prime Minister Tony Abbott is hostile to the prospect of giving Coalition MPs a conscience vote. The Prime Minister could use Labor's decision to bind its MPs as an excuse by Mr Abbott to keep his own MPs bound to vote against it.\n\"There's no doubt,\" said a senior conservative Liberal close to Mr Abbott.\n\"The number of waverers (in the Liberal Party room) are reducing and this will just kill it off.\"\nHours before the ALP National Conference voted for the compromise late on Sunday, Mr Shorten warned that Mr Abbott would be less inclined to grant his MPs a conscience vote should Labor bind its MPs.\n \"I believe a binding vote for Labor in favour of marriage equality risks the Liberals re-binding against marriage equality, it lets Tony Abbott off the hook,\" he said.\nPrivate member's bill Parliament resumes next week and Liberal MPs planning to introduce a private member's bill are hoping for at least a debate on changing their policy from one of opposing gay marriage to a conscience vote.\nAfter the decision, Mr Shorten promised that if he won the election, he would legislate to legalise gay marriage in his first 100 days in office and he asked Mr Abbott to give his MPs a free vote now.\nThe last minute set back on gay marriage soured what had otherwise been a successful conference for the ALP leader.\n​On Saturday, Mr Shorten's plan to enable a future Labor prime minister to turn back boats in return for a raft of humanitarian measures passed but only after he was opposed by Ms Plibersek, Senate Leader Penny Wong and senior frontbencher Anthony Albanese.\nLeft sources said Mr Albanese and Ms Plibersek, both rival leadership contenders should Mr Shorten ever fall, had shored themselves up in their respective inner city seats of Grayndler and Sydney which are under constant threat from the Greens.\nBut out in \"voter land\" they had damaged their prospects by opposing tougher border protection measures.\nCoalition jumps on split Victorian senator Kim Carr, a key figure in the Left who marshalled Left unions away from the faction to help Mr Shorten win on boats, embarrassed Ms Plibersek when he revealed she had argued internally for the boat turnback deal during factional meetings but then voted against it.\n\"Tanya spoke very strongly in support of the shadow cabinet's position at the various meetings I attended,\" he said.\nWhile shadow ministers divided over contentious policy issues is not atypical for national conference, outwardly it was an awkward situation upon which the government pounced.\n\"The fact that Tanya Plibersek, a future foreign affairs minister in a Shorten government abstained from the process and through her delegate voted against Mr Shorten's position demonstrates how fraught this would be if they were to get into government,\" said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton.\n\"If you don't have a foreign affairs minister who is in agreement with a very essential part of the success of stopping the boats and you don't have a frontbench behind the leader it will quickly descend into what Mr Rudd presided over which was complete chaos when it came to boat arrivals and a breakdown in our border protection.\"\nMr Albanese said the debate was hypothetical because if Labor continued the Coalition policy, there should be no boats to turn back.\nThe conference also resolved climate change policy by voting resoundingly to endorse a Renewable Energy Target of 50 per cent by 2030 and for a low-cost emissions trading scheme.\nLabor sources said the opposition now had positions on each issue – both of which played key roles in Labor's 20-13 election loss – and it was up to the leadership to sell them to the people.\n​", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-26T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:50:06.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
