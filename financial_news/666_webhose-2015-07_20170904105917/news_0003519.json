RQFII take-up in Germany and France was higher, but overall European demand remains relatively low, he added.\nAt June 29, $139 billion had been invested in the QFII and RQFII programmes by foreign investors against a limit on both of nearly $300 billion and a net capitalisation of China's mainland stock markets of $11.5 trillion before the crash.\nOne successful RQFII applicant was Swiss fund firm Pictet, with a quota of around $160 million awarded in December.\nAs the share suspension was largely impacting smaller companies and start-ups, Pauline Dan, head of greater China equities at Pictet Asset Management, said her blue-chip bets were largely unaffected.\n\"We think that the current disruption is temporary and hence have no intention to cut back on QFII investment,\" she said.\nA third method of direct access, launched late last year, is the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, a programme that enables investors in each market to trade shares on the other market using local brokers and clearing houses, subject to quotas.\nBut just 126.4 billion, or around 42 percent, was being used as of July 16, data showed, relative to a potential capacity of 300 billion yuan ($48 billion).\nEmerging support for Connect from European regulators could lead to more funds taking advantage of the system, but many may wait until China's mainland stocks are included in indexes run by providers such as FTSE and MSCI.\n\"Until these managers are sort of compelled to include China because of their inclusion in various indices, many of them will just sit back and do nothing,\" said Citi's Aldcroft.
