Photo: Glen McCurtayne\nHow does your local council help home-based business owners, start-up entrepreneurs and other fast-growth ventures in the area?\nIf it's like my council, there's probably a daggy information session on starting a small business, run by consultants seeking work. Or the occasional bank-sponsored mini-bus that hands out small-business pamphlets and tries to flog bank products. It's embarrassingly antiquated.\nCouncils are the last place to foster creativity, collaborative networks or entrepreneurship.\nThere's probably no dedicated, council-owned work space for home-based business owners, no innovation precinct, or council-led network of entrepreneurs. And no strategy to drive innovation and start-up entrepreneurship in the suburbs, or appreciation of its potential.\nI know what you're thinking. Councils are the last place to foster creativity, collaborative networks or entrepreneurship. Some are flat-out innovating a footpath, let alone creating sophisticated open-innovation networks that foster \"born-global\" ventures.\nAdvertisement Councils are supposedly too 'brown cardigan', when innovators need technicolour. Some barely get small business, let alone sophisticated start-ups.\nThey move slowly, are risk averse, have funding constraints, and more important local priorities than providing facilities and encouragement for young and old residents with an entrepreneurial streak – or so the stereotypes go.\nSurely, if entrepreneurs see value in linking with others in their suburb, they can create networks and bypass local councils or stodgy suburban small business associations? Or reinvent their local chamber of commerce.\nWhat's your view?\n· How can we spark more innovation and entrepreneurship in the suburbs?\n· Should local councils play a role?\n· How could your council better support home-based business owners and entrepreneurs, and help others in the area who are self-employed, or thinking about it?\nWith a bit of forward-thinking, local councils could capitalise on an opportunity to spark innovation and entrepreneurship, not just in trendy suburbs or the CBD, but in the outer suburbs and regional economies. Innovation that creates jobs, partly helps replace dying industries, and creates more life in the suburbs for business and residents.\nAs we head into the digital era, home-based work, telecommuting and having a portfolio of micro-jobs and micro-ventures will become the norm for many people. It will be easier for people to be self-employed and develop globally focused ventures from the suburbs.\nAt the same time, technology will kill more industries and displace many jobs. Youth unemployment, sadly, will rise further, as will unemployment among older people who are axed by penny-pinching corporates. Councils, particularly those that have relied on traditional industries for jobs, will need new sources of employment as the population expands.\nIf some councils had half a brain, they would create innovation precincts that bring together established entrepreneurs in the area, or encourage new ones. And use the precinct as an innovation testbed for council ideas and to ensure the council is ready for the digital era.\nIt's not as crazy as it sounds. Imagine having 100 young entrepreneurs working for themselves in council-funded space, and being asked to solve social problems in the area. Bright young people who live in the area and know it well.\nOr the prospect of council-led innovation networks bringing together young entrepreneurs and budding seniorpreneurs, who have experience and capital. People that might live streets or suburbs away and have a natural affinity to work with each other.\nSome councils get it. Those in Ipswich and parts of Adelaide, for example, are creating entrepreneurship incubators and innovation precincts. So are local councils in the UK and New Zealand. They see the potential for councils to foster collaboration among entrepreneurs, small business owners, universities, and other stakeholders in the area, and fund dedicated spaces, education and support for high-growth ventures.\nThey know that incubators or other shared spaces could create businesses, and that more residents who work in the suburbs, rather that commute back and forth to town, means a more vibrant local economy and lifestyle.\nBetter still, these innovation precincts could, in turn, make councils more efficient and innovative, create better and cheaper services for residents, and help future-proof them against myriad threats as populations grow and funding is constrained.\nI'd back 100 young entrepreneurs to come up with social or commercial ideas for a region, over a bunch of well-meaning council workers, whose sprits are often dulled by insane local government politics. The council's job is not to come up with the big ideas, but create the conditions for innovation and collaboration, and let the suburban entrepreneurs do their thing.\nSo much can be done. For example, rethinking how public spaces or old industrial facilities can help entrepreneurs. Or how councils can use technology to create collaborative networks of entrepreneurs in their suburbs. Or how councils can provide better information (or at least some) on entrepreneurship and innovation and bring together universities, venture capitalists and other stakeholders through their initiatives. Or provide incentives for start-up ventures to choose an area.\nI'm impressed that some councils are thinking along these lines, although it is early days. A more innovative culture cannot be confined to office towers and trendy inner-city warehouses, or left only to private firms to develop incubator hubs and shared working spaces.\nWe need grassroots, suburban innovation, and councils understanding their role to foster it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T01:04:59.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
