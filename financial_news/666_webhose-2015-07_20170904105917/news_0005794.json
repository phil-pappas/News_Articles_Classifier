I have a lot of Greek -American friends and family, so their economy has been an ongoing issue we’ve discussed over the last few years as one bailout effort after another has fizzled. (There are a lot of reasons you can read about to get a more detailed analysis of the issue than you’ll get here.) The reason this issue has resonated with me, aside from my Greek compadres, is that I spend a lot of time talking with people who are in their own “personal Greece” right now, but they don’t have a bailout offer on the table. How do we avoid our own personal Greek tragedy?\nSet Goals\nThe first step to not needing a bailout is to have a definite plan for what you want your financial life to look like. What are your goals? Out of the last 25 people I’ve asked “when would you like to retire?” only a few have been able to answer with clarity.\nMost people responded, “I’m not sure, I guess whenever full retirement is…”. It seems like there’s a lot of confusion with what that phrase actually means, and that there is almost a prohibition on retiring prior to “full retirement.” This strikes me as a significant area where education is needed, but that’s a topic for a different blog post.\nThe point is a lack of clarity of goals can lead to the passage of time without making progress. The leadership of Greece over the last few years has had no clear vision for the direction they want to take the country. That lack of direction led to today’s vote. Learn from their lack of vision and set your own clear one.\nLive Within Your Means\nThe next step to stay out of debt trouble and never have the word bankruptcy associated with your name is to have very solid financial behaviors. It may sound like common sense, but it starts with the basic principle of knowing where your money is going. When you KNOW where your money is going rather than simply having an idea about where it’s going, you are then in a position of strength. You can either agree that the current spending patterns are acceptable or you can decide that changes are needed. There are a lot of great tools out there (Mint, Personal Capital, YouNeedABudget, etc.) to help people get to a point where they have the knowledge about their expenses.\nOnce you know where you’re spending your money, look for opportunities to save. Each year, Citizens Against Government Waste publishes a report about wasteful spending in the congressional budget. Apply that to your life. Where are your “pork projects” and how do you eliminate or reduce them? Had Greece enacted this type of review and worked on expense control over the last 20 years, perhaps today’s vote would have been unnecessary.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=why%20did%20greece%20need%20a%20bailout", "http://www.hrfuture.net/editors-note/what-happens-when-you-don-t-set-goals.php?Itemid=401", "http://cagw.org/content/Pig-Book-2014", "http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/05/news/economy/greece-crisis-referendum-results/index.html"], "published": "2015-07-12T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T17:54:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
