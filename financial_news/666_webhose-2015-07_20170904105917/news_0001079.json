This year, it’s down, but only about 3 percent, with a stronger dollar cutting demand for the metal as an alternative, while instability in Greece and China helped to drive a bit of buying for bullion as a haven.\nMiners, by contrast, dropped 16 percent year-to-date, as measured by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold and Silver Index. A rally in gold prices in January didn’t last, while companies face rising costs.\nIs that a sign that gold stocks are oversold? Some analysts expect the metal’s price to regain some ground in the next six months. Morgan Stanley in July upgraded Goldcorp Inc., the index’s biggest member by weighting, citing an attractive valuation.\nOn the other hand, the link between gold prices and miners could be weakening for other reasons. Namely, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, investors are increasingly using proxies such as over-the-counter swaps and exchange-traded funds. To wit, the enterprise value of gold miners relative to their reserves and resources is the lowest in at least eight years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T00:23:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
