France's economy minister said he was reasonably confident a deal can be done. \nTraders said the latest plan had made investors cautiously optimistic a deal could be struck by Sunday's deadline, although many remained wary having seen similar proposals fall through. \n\"The market is taking heart from the fact that it looks like the wheels are moving to get something done. But the devil is in the detail,\" Peregrine & Black senior sales trader, Paul Chesterton, said. \n\"The German authorities will need to ratify any deal, and the Greek parliament also need to sign up to it, so many hurdles remain.\" \nThe top riser on the FTSEurofirst 300 was United Internet AG , which climbed 7.2 percent after the German Internet service provider said it may float its business offering web-hosting and other online services to corporate customers. \nEuropean insurers also rose after Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) raised its target price for several top insurance companies, while Norway's largest bank DNB advanced 5.2 percent after its second-quarter earnings beat forecasts. \nThe FTSEurofirst's rise on Friday moved it further away from a five-month low hit on Wednesday. \nThe FTSEurofirst is up 12 percent since the start of 2015 but remains down more than 7 percent from a 14-year high hit in April, due to uncertainty over Greece and volatility in China. \nToday's European research round-up (Editing by Louise Ireland)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:21:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
