It also accuses de Blasio of being under the sway of the taxi industry, which makes big political contributions. \nThe proposed legislation has also been denounced in recent days by the three big New York dailies -- The New York Times, New York Post and the Daily News. \nUber has challenged de Blasio to an online debate, but the mayor has refused. \n\"I don't debate with private corporations,\" he said. \"Let's be clear ?- Uber is a multibillion dollar corporation, and they're acting like one. They're looking out for their corporate bottom line. They're putting their profits over all other considerations.\" \nThey mayor insisted he was only calling for a temporary pause while Uber's impact was studied. \n\"A few years ago, no one had ever heard of Uber, and now suddenly it has more vehicles than we have yellow taxis in all of New York City. \n\"Obviously, that's had an impact on congestion in the city, particularly in midtown. Therefore, it also has an impact on pollution. It is clear that the growth has been consistent and if it weren't addressed, that congestion problem would just grow and grow,\" he said. \n\"So it made sense to call a pause ?- but not a pure pause, just a pause in the rate of growth ? and to study the situation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T23:21:54.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
