Of course nuclear power, despite its dangers, is also one of the most efficient energy generation technologies on the planet. It is little surprise then that nuclear power advocates are excited about a new area of technology in the industry: miniature nuclear reactors . \nThe basic idea behind miniature nuclear reactors is that by building a small scale reactor in a modular cube, the system allows for cost savings, better flexibility to move power where it is needed, better protection from terrorists and natural disasters, and a simpler operating design. \nThere are a variety of parties working on designing new nuclear reactor types from corporations to government-funded research groups and even periodically, teenagers . Of course, relatively small reactors already exist and are used to power naval vessels like submarines and aircraft carriers. As a result, it’s not a huge leap to imagine a similar approach being successful elsewhere. And there is definitely global interest in the technology. \nWhat remains unclear though is exactly what the new applications for modular nuclear reactors might be. Flexibility in power applications and a decentralized power grid are obvious options. Similarly, expanded use of reactors on naval vessels to power directed energy weapons and railguns clearly makes sense as well. But those applications could be just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. \nWikipedia \nTwo unorthodox applications for modular reactors are in the transportation arena. Russia has announced the development of a nuclear powered train. The basic idea is that a nuclear powered train would not need to be refueled for years at a time. As a result, it would be much better able to operate effectively in remote areas without refueling stations or even electricity. For Russia in particular this makes sense, but other large countries with sparsely populated areas might find the idea useful as well. \nIn addition, Boeing has recently patented a nuclear-powered plane engine. The engine uses laser combustion and, if it could be effectively implemented, the system would allow a plane to literally travel for years without stopping. Of course pilots would need a break periodically and so it’s more likely that the technology would be combined with a drone-style pilot. From a military perspective, this would be an enormous advance, and with Boeing serving as a major defense contractor, investors can bet that the company will be looking closely at this option. \nIn addition to defense applications though, there is also another possible use of a nuclear engine – in a space craft. To the extent that a nuclear power source could be effectively used in a space-craft it might pave the way for cost effective space operations that people have been talking about for years. For instance, asteroid mining and deep space flights could both be a lot more effective if powered by an efficient small nuclear reactor. Again though, as in the defense realm, Boeing is a big player in the commercial space field. \nWith Boeing being pressed hard by Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Orbital ATK, the company will surely be looking for any advantage they can get. It’s still early days in the modular nuclear reactor arena, but it is possible that in a few years, the technology could be a major boon to Boeing and others that can come up with unconventional ways to effectively capitalize on new developments.
