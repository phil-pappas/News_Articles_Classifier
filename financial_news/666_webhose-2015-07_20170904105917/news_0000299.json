Tanya Lake by Ben Smythe The list of offences that could trip up trustees of self-managed super funds seems to grow each year. No doubt DIY fund members have read about trustees who tried to bend the rules their way and ended up in jail.\nFor those 1 million-plus people who have taken the plunge and decided to manage their own superannuation fund, a requirement that is often overlooked is the need for the trustee to \"formulate and give effect\" to an investment strategy.\nBut what does this actually mean? And if you don't do it what are the consequences?\nFirst, to formulate and give effect in layman's terms means to give proper consideration to how you are going to invest your superannuation funds and then stick to an investment plan. In reality, it involves ticking a few boxes as part of the annual audit process, and then filing the document so it is never seen again.\nSo what is the point of the exercise? I would say it is part compliance (that is, it is the law â€“ and there are financial penalties if you don't meet the provisions of the superannuation industry [supervision] act when it comes to formulating and giving effect to an investment strategy) and part best practice (you are the trustee, so you should at least demonstrate you are taking your role seriously).\nHaving said that, I do think there is another important upside in investing the time in documenting your SMSF investment strategy, particularly given the current investment climate. Trustees should have a clear understanding of what risk they are taking on, or are prepared to take on, with respect to their SMSF assets.\nRisk will ultimately be an important driver of the return you should expect, but also equally important is the income that your fund will provide you in retirement. The purpose of an SMSF is to provide an income stream in retirement, so if you don't know how you are tracking or what changes you need to make, then you are guessing.\nWhen a financial adviser asks about risk tolerance, most people have little idea of what he or she is talking about. Throw in terms such as risk profile, asset allocation, diversification and real return and the picture becomes even murkier. For most people, their definition of risk needs to be very personal, and without the jargon. We have been taught to assess risk as losing capital or possibly not earning sufficient income. It needs to go further.\n A client's definition of risk when it comes to their SMSF should also be inherently linked to them achieving their desired outcomes with respect to their SMSF. It makes sense, therefore, to have these outcomes front and centre when you are considering your definition of risk, and document them as part of your investment strategy.\nWith this in mind, and given the significant noise engulfing us in the world of finance, what should you be doing when it comes to setting your personal definition of risk for your SMSF investment strategy?\n1. Stick to a disciplined long-term approach (minimum seven years and ideally 10 years). Don't be taken in by well-written articles highlighting the short-term opportunities for investors created by falling oil prices, quantitative easing, housing bubbles, negative yields, etc. There will be an equally well-written counter argument if you search for it.\n2. Clearly define the outcomes you want to achieve when it comes to your SMSF, then constantly review and update them as your circumstances change.\n3. Determine a realistic time horizon relative to achieving these outcomes, such as: In X years we would like to achieve Y.\n4. Look at different scenarios. Map out what different rates of return (income and/or capital) will mean to achieving what you want from your SMSF within the timeframe.\nOnce you have done that, the last step is to document your plan. Agree on an investment strategy that will maximise the probability of your achieving your outcomes within your set timeframe, and importantly one you are comfortable sticking to for the medium-to-long term.\nUnderstanding your personal position with respect to risk is an important role you take on when managing your own superannuation assets. By investing the time to actually incorporate this into your SMSF investment strategy process, you could surprise yourself with the results.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T11:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T13:07:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
