This works out at just 19pc of their salary, as the chart below shows. \nThe majority of renters (58pc) are aged between 25 and 44, pretty much the same as a decade ago, when the figure stood at 56pc. The biggest shift has instead been an increase in the proportion of 45-54 year olds renting, up from 10pc to 15pc. \nThis is reflected in the chart below, which shows there has been a surge in couples with children renting since 2003. \nOverall the number of people renting has doubled over the past decade from 2.1 million to 4.4 million. \nRoger Harding, director of communications, policy and campaigns at Shelter, said: “As these new figures starkly show, private renters are bearing the brunt of our dramatic housing shortage. The result is an entire generation forced to give up hope of a stable future, and resign themselves to a life-time of expensive rents. \n“To truly get to grips with our housing shortage, investment in genuinely affordable homes is absolutely vital. The autumn spending review is this government’s last chance to prove they’re serious about turning the housing crisis around.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T15:49:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
