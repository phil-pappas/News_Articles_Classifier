But if Merkel failed to get a majority of her conservatives behind her, it would represent a humiliating setback for the chancellor.\nIn the last Bundestag vote on a Greek bailout extension in February, a record 29 conservative lawmakers rebelled, while another 109 signed statements saying they had voted for the extension with reservations.\nEckhardt Rehberg, a budget expert for Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), told Reuters that constituents in his electoral district in the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern were overwhelmingly against further aid for Greece.\n\"I can barely find anyone who still supports helping Greece,\" he said. \"Tsipras and (former finance minister Yanis) Varoufakis, have destroyed all trust.
