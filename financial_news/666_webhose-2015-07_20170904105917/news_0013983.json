The digitisation would increase multiple television channels, offers viewers better pictures and better sound quality. \nKNET Limited is a wholly owned Ghanaian company.Dr. Omane Boamah last year expressed concern about delays in getting funding from the Exim Bank to enable StarTimes to complete the migration process. \nHe said it had been decided a different funding arrangement be sought if in the next few weeks, StarTimes was not able to raise the money for the project from the China Exim Bank. \nThe initial deadline for the digital migration in the country and across the sub-region was December 2014, but no member of ECOWAS has been able to fully migrate into the digital space partly due to challenges related to funding. \nThe migration is expected to free more spectrums for use by mobile telecommunication operators in the country and the sub-region to enable them provide better services to clients.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T02:14:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
