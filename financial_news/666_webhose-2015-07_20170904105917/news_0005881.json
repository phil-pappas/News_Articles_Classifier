The valuation of the company is more like a high-growth tech business than a bank,” he said. “If you have a company growing at 100pc per year, it is a different type of animal to a typical bank.” \nMetro's bright branding has attracted attention on the highstreet (Photo: GEOFF PUGH) \nHe expects the bank to start turning a profit at around the end of 2015, and said the float is designed to raise more capital to invest in the bank’s growth. Mr Hill said he does not know of any existing investors who intend to sell out in the initial public offering. \nMetro’s business is split roughly half and half between consumer and business banking, and wants to increase the number of mid-sized businesses working with the lender. \nThis week will see the first meeting of its new advisory board, a group of business leaders and investors in the bank who will aim to use their own network of contacts to find more clients for Metro. \nThey include Jamie Reuben, a former director of Metro, who has links to the real estate development business, as well as Denzyl Feigelson, who helped Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) establish iTunes and hopes to bring more music and entertainment firms to the bank, and Amit Bhatia, a senior figure in the construction industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T23:44:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
