Katarina Kroslakova by Katarina Kroslakova As far as a covetable piece of furniture, the big squishy leather Jason recliner with the pull-out levered footrest has some shortcomings.\nThe quintessential comfort staple has been immortalised in popular TV series such as Kath and Kim , and for decades has defined the category of ergonomic furniture. Sure, it’s comfortable for a nap or for watching hours of TV, but aesthetically speaking, it’s not really the height of sophistication.\nSo, when you’re a European furniture company making extremely comfortable, ergonomically designed products that are miles ahead in the style stakes, you’re nonetheless up against the consumer perception that your products will be somewhere in the spectrum between nana and bogan in terms of style and desirability. But Norwegian manufacturer Ekornes is tackling this challenge head on. It’s on a mission to show the world that comfort and style don’t necessarily have to be mutually exclusive.\nEstablished in 1934, Ekornes is northern Europe’s largest furniture manufacturer, with nearly 2500 employees and worldwide revenue for the quarter ending March 31 of about $US119 million ($153 million) across four divisions. It’s a company that specialises in ergonomic design, and has won countless awards and prestigious chiropractic association accreditations, including in the United States and Australia.\nTo maintain high standards of workmanship, all Ekornes furniture is manufactured in state of the art factories on the west coast of Norway. Katarina Kroslakova Scandinavia has long been known for its excellence in craftsmanship, especially when it comes to furniture design. But that part of the world is also notoriously expensive – Norway is Europe’s largest oil producer – and when you pride yourself on the Made in Norway story, with that comes high labour costs.\nTo maintain superior standards of workmanship, Ekornes manufactures its furniture in state-of-the-art factories, on the picturesque west coast of Norway. “We are in the most expensive country in the world,” newly appointed chief executive Olav Holst‑Dyrnes tells Luxury . “We’re looking at how to automate production and make it more efficient. In Norway, the challenge is to be competitive, and we work on that here every day.\n“Our DNA is here. We source materials from all around the world, but we strongly believe that we are able to be competitive based on the set-up here in Norway.”\nThe 81-year-old company is in a period of necessary change. Even Holst-Dyrnes acknowledges that, “turnover wise, we have had a bit of flatlining for the last four years, and that’s a challenge”. So, along with a new chief financial officer, Ekornes is transforming.\n Late last year, the company acquired the (debt-free) Internasjonal Mobel Gruppe AS, also known as IMG, a furniture company with offshore factories in Vietnam and Thailand, and sales offices in the Asia-Pacific region. Ekornes already has a presence in the US (to shorten delivery times to one of its biggest markets), but IMG will introduce an additional range of lower-priced products.\nThe Stressless range is the premium offering in the Ekornes family, and that will remain firmly all-Norwegian. There’s no doubt this product range has been extraordinarily successful in its 44-year history: since 1971, over 7 million Stressless seats (in ergonomic recliners and sofas) have been sold in over 40 countries. Every day, about 1650 Stressless seats are produced in the factory in Norway.\nBut times are changing, and along with automation and efficiency being key to the company’s fiscal success (new robots in the factory have the capacity to churn through work 24 hours a day), the design and aesthetics of the products are being re‑evaluated with the aim of targeting a younger, more urban buyer.\nThe goal is to produce the most attractive ergonomic furniture. “If you see the new Metro and City products we launched in the last year, you can see we’re moving in a younger style, trying to reach a different audience,” Holst-Dyrnes says.\n“We want to grow. We want to move towards the under-40 market.”\nThere are two significant new product launches in Australia in the next 12 months. But do the products stack up and justify their four-figure price tags?\nAbsolutely.\nThe products not only offer comfort and support in the upright and reclined positions, but as the Australian managing director John Candi points out, “your body should be totally relaxed when you get out of it”.\nThe recliners have three patents, including a gliding mechanism and an ergonomic adaptation system, which essentially means your body is continually supported, with your body weight causing the necessary adjustments. The chairs are responsive to whoever is sitting in them, constantly maintaining lumbar support. There are no levers, no pop-out anythings, no jarring, no traditional lever mechanism.\nCandi says the Australian market is changing as well. “There are clear signs the market is shifting towards motion furniture,” he tells Luxury .\n“But more importantly, the market is demanding furniture that doesn’t just look good, but that is equally supportive and comfortable to sit in.”\nThe writer travelled to Norway as a guest of Ekornes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T05:43:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
