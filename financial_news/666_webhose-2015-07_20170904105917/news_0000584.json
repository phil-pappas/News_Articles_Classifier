Earlier this month a delegation of Spanish business and political leaders visited Cuba. \n\"Cuba represents a new opportunity for Spanish investments,\" said the government statement. \n\"Cuban and Spanish authorities are actively working to expand their economic, business and financial relations,\" it added. \nCabrisas made his stop in Madrid while en route to Cuba after a visit to Angola, the Cuban embassy said. The last visit of such a high ranking official from the island regime dates to 2005. \nSpain has been criticised for its delay in resuming full relations with Cuba. \nThe Caribbean nation and the European Union have since 2014 been negotiating a normalisation of their relations, talks Madrid hopes to energise after the falling behind the United States' rapprochement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T00:50:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
