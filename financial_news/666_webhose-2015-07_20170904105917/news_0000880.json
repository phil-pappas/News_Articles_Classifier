After all, nearly a quarter of Americans were born between 1946 and 1964 — the typical definition of the Baby Boom generation. That’s more than 75 million people.\nBut Gen Xers (typically described as Americans aged 35 to 49) are close behind the Baby Boomers in terms of age. Today, many of them are closing in on 50. It’s high time Gen Xers start focusing on retirement and their retirement goals as well.\nBut a new study by Northwestern Mutual found that Gen X has some work to do. Of four generations surveyed in the study, Gen X was found to have the poorest financial habits. In addition to comprising the majority of “informal” planners, Gen X also has more spenders than savers compared to other generations and was the least likely to have more savings than debt.\nThe Northwestern Mutual survey also found that two-thirds (66 percent) of Gen Xers expect to have to work past traditional retirement age due to necessity, with 2 in 10 believing they will never retire. Meanwhile, the vast majority (82 percent) of Gen Xers who anticipate needing to work past the age of 65 feel they will need to do so because they will have insufficient retirement savings.\nIn addition, despite citing “insufficient savings to retire comfortably” as a leading financial fear, one third of Gen Xers (34 percent) said they do not know how much income they need to retire and nearly half (47 percent) have not discussed retirement planning with anyone. Gen X is less likely than any other generation —even Millennials—to have sought guidance from an advisor.\nThe good news is, it’s not too late to turn things around. Here are four steps Gen X — or anyone — can take to get started planning for retirement:\nKnow How Much You Will Need\nDetermining what you’ll need is critical to forming a retirement plan that will work for you. But doing so is complicated because there are so many variables — some known, others unknown — that can shape the answer, sometimes dramatically. To calculate your retirement “budget,” remember it’s not necessarily about what you are making today; it’s about what you’ll spend as you transition into retirement, combined with your retirement lifestyle.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["https://www.northwesternmutual.com/about-us/studies/planning-and-progress-2015-study"], "published": "2015-07-19T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T16:40:18.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
