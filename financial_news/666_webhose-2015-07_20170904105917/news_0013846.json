Pursuant to examination of public comments, discussion with industry bodies, stock exchanges, academic bodies and other market participants, the revised provisions for continuous disclosures have been approved by the Sebi board.\nThese provisions are now in the process of being incorporated in the proposed Listing Regulations which are nearing notification.\nThe new system is expected to enable the investors to make well informed investment decisions. Apart from dissemination of information on an ongoing basis, this would also result in better price discovery and reduce the likelihood of manipulation and insider trading in the market.\nBesides strengthening the monitoring of listed companies including implementation of Sebi norms for Corporate Governance, the regulator is also undertaking measures to create awareness amongst listed companies for ensuring better compliance culture.\nFirst Published on July 12, 2015 2:21 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T13:34:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
