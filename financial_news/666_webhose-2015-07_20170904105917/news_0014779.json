IARFC CEO and Workshop presenter Ed Morrow. Middletown, OH\nEd Morrow, RFC® has decades of working with business owners and knows how to get results when dealing with their unique situations. The workshop takes an indepth look at many of the serious problems that all business owners face at one time or another – some that could lead to catastrophic endings. Issues such as loan cancellation, business succession and transfer, business valuation, executive retention and future growth/ expansion are addressed with practical solutions.\n“Many workshops or training seminars tell you what to do to approach the business owner,” relates Morrow. “We give you the practical tools to take home and get started.” Each attendee leaves with a thumb drive of editable files that contain presentations, letters, agendas, articles and certificates that are used to close the engagement with the perspective client. These files are easily customized to mesh with the financial professional’s branding when required.\nThis organized and detailed approach to business owners centers around a process – one that outlines every step from initial meeting to post plan monitoring and follow up. Learning to charge fees for financial expertise and experience is discussed along with a plan for drip marketing to prospects and clients. “The information presented in this BOCW workshop will make it possible for me to begin charging fees,” commented former attendee Robert Decker of St. Petersburg, FL. “Now I know how to present the ideas of fees properly.”\nGetting the Intro is a procedure that places the consultant in front of business owners. Every business needs capital at better terms, or great amounts ($500,000 to $50 million.) The IARFC has partnered with USA Business Lending to bring in more favorable terms.\nWorkshop location is the City of San Mateo Public Library – the Laurel room from 9:30am to 5:30pm. The cost is $395 with preregistration required. All reservations are handled through Charlotte Isbell at the IARFC office in Middletown, OH. Seating is limited.\nFor general information on the Business Owner Consulting Workshop, contact Susan Cappa or you can visit the workshop links on the IARFC website .", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYXJmYy5vcmcvZGlzcGxheW1lbWJlci5hc3A/aWQ9MTg4NzI=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3VzYWJpemxlbmRpbmcuY29tL2Fib3V0LXVzL3N0cmF0ZWdpYy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcHMv", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYXJmYy5vcmc=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYXJmYy5vcmcvZGlzcGxheS5hc3A/aWQ9MTM1", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYXJmYy5vcmcvYm9hcmRvZmRpcmVjdG9ycy5hc3A="], "published": "2015-06-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T03:30:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
