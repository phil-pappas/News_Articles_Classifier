Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Philip Baker Investors are preparing for a fall in earnings led by the resources sector as the corporate reporting season kicks off this week but are still betting that despite the worst outlook for profits since the financial crisis, it won't stop the sharemarket getting to 6000 by the end of the year.\nCost cutting, revenue and sales growth, along with dividends and the affect of a lower Australian will be the major themes this season that some analysts say takes on greater importance than usual, due to the global issues currently facing investors and expectations around how strong the local economy is.\nMorgan Stanley forecasts point to earnings-per-share growth for Australia's top listed companies of minus 1.7 per cent for the 2015 financial year, while it improves to a more respectable 4.6 per cent if the resources sector is taken out.\nThe major S&P/ASX 200 index has fallen 7 per cent since it's April peak but Chris Stott, Â­Wilson Asset Management's chief investment officer has been buying and adding to his portfolio over the past month in anticipation of a move higher, and thinks the retail sector could be a revelation as companies report their latest results.\nAFR graphic \"We are at the mature stage of the bull market for sure but we haven't quite had that last phase where it all just takes off, and this season might not be as bad as everyone thinks and could be the catalyst for a move higher,\" Stott said.\n\"The retail sector could also surprise on the upside thanks to low interest rates, low unemployment and a hot property market that just might make people feel wealthy and spend more,\" he added.\nThe major index closed at 5566 on Friday and hasn't reached 6000 since the beginning of 2008.\nGUD Holdings, Resmed and OceanaGold will be the first companies to report this week, while the pace of earnings picks up significantly next week when Suncorp, Credit Corp, OzForex, Downer EDI, Rio Tinto and Virgin deliver their numbers.\n Downgraded earnings expected Despite a benign \"confession season\" in the lead up to the main game a few well known companies did downgrade their profit expectations including Woolworths , Metcash, Affinity Education Group, Flight Centre Travel Group, SEEK and Arrium.\nBut earning forecasts have been revised lower thanks mainly to the savage sell off in commodity prices.\nEarnings-per-share growth for the resources sector is expected to fall 29 per cent in the 2015 financial year and 14 per cent this financial year, according to analysts at Macquarie Group, while earnings-per-share for 2016 stands at around 4 per cent but does improve to 8 per cent once the resources sector is taken out.\nThe resources sectors has been hit by a dramatic fall in iron ore and oil prices, and BHP Billiton is tipped to deliver it's worst underlying net profit in 10 years.\nPaul Xiradis, chief executive officer and head of equities at Ausbil Investment Management said that although consensus earnings suggests mining earnings will remain sluggish in 2016, his fund is predicting further downside for the miners.\n\"Factor in current commodity prices and witness how quickly earnings fade from forecast optimistic levels as the red ink thickens,\" he warns.\nMacquarie Group's Rikki Bannan noted that with valuations still quite high companies that disappointed would be treated harshly by investors and the extreme moves seen in the previous season, for both good and bad results, will likely be repeated this time around.\nMorgan Stanley has also told clients that earnings growth expectations on a \"next 12 months\" basis is the lowest since the global financial crisis, while the last time investors saw negative earnings growth was during the financial crisis, the commodity slump in 2011/12, and the so called \"near recession\" of 2001.\nGood indication of limited downward risk However, Tribeca Investment Partners portfolio manager Sean Fenton said the reasonably low number of warnings in the lead up to the season is a good indication there isn't too much downward risk for the sharemarket at current levels.\n\"Looking at the domestic economy stocks exposed to housing construction and retail will show a degree of strength, so Dulux, Wesfarmers, Harvey Norman and of course we've already seen Boral upgraded,\" Fenton said.\n\"The weaker Australian dollar will also help but it's really only been against the US dollar not the euro and yen, so it will be very interesting to see how the currency washes through,\" he added.\nFenton also said a key focus will be the high dividend stocks and whether those companies are able to keep paying them.\nAustralia's top 200 companies paid out more than $90 billion in the first-half reporting season, and although earnings grew by about 2 per cent dividend growth was double that.\nGrowth in dividend payouts has now outstripped earnings growth for the past four years, while the payout ratio across the benchmark index rose by about 5 per cent to 65 per cent.\nHead of equities at UniSuper, Simon Hudson said the Australian economy is readjusting with the winding back of years of significant resources investment, which historically it has struggled to do.\n\"And although the domestic economy is far more open and market sensitive than in previous cycles, we expect the operating environment domestically to remain challenging over the next year,\" he added.\n\"Revenue growth continues to be very difficult to achieve across most industries, possibly with the exception of some parts of healthcare and IT,\" he said.\nFor that reason Hudson thinks that any earnings growth achieved will again be predominantly generated by reducing costs.\n\"What will also be interesting in this reporting season is that many cost inputs over the last year have either fallen or are stable , like fuel, the cost of debt and wages growth to name a few. This should help the bottom line, however the issue here is always about sustainability. Companies cannot keep shrinking to greatness\" said Hudson.\nIdeal growth rate lower than desirable Last week the Reserve Bank governor, Glenn Stevens, flagged the possibility that the economy's ideal growth rate may be lower than what most experts think , posing problems for business trying to grow their top line revenue.\nIt comes as signs are emerging the US economy is getting strong enough to cope with rising interest rates by the end of this year as central banks in Europe, China and Japan keep the monetary policy tap on full bore.\nAs the US Fed hikes rates the US dollar will keep rising, which will be more good news for the $A.\nMarcus Fanning, head of Australian equities at Colonial First State Growth's team said this reporting season the fall in the $A will be a key driver in two ways.\nFirst, directly through the earnings line for those with overseas earnings, and then the translation effect.\nHe also said that despite the continuous disclosure rules there will be a number who surprise the market and there will be a mix of issues to deal with.\n\"Retailers revenue might not be strong but margins are likely to be better, cash conversion and quality of the result and the treatment of items below the line will all attract focus. Cost out and FX will be strong features in a low domestic income growth environment,\" he added.\nAs for any move higher Fanning said the overall mood post reporting season will likely hinge more on guidance within the outlook statements rather than the actual results.\nThe local reporting season comes as the latest second quarter profit numbers in the United States disappoint investors.\nDespite most of companies beating expectations, the hurdle rate was set low and the number of companies surprising with good numbers has been lower than what investors have been used to over the past few years.\nCorporate America is also struggling with the rising US dollar as the Federal Reserve gets ready to hike interest rates for the first time in seven years.\nHowever, the European reporting season has been good, although coming from a very low base, with around 57 per cent of companies beating earnings per share forecasts for the June quarter.\nEurope is also likely to post double digit earnings growth during the past three months with the weaker Euro and improving economic recovery helping the bottom line.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-07-26T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T00:04:11.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
