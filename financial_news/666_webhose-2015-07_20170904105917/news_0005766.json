Oil needs to establish a new range and we would see the WTI crude low around $50 with the upside capped at $58.\" \nChina's securities regulator took the drastic step late on Wednesday of ordering shareholders with stakes of more than 5 percent from selling shares for the next six months in a bid to halt a plunge in stock prices that is starting to roil global financial markets. \nThe announcements came after China's stock market, which has lost a third of its value since June, showed signs of seizing up on Wednesday, as almost half of the country's listed companies scrambled to escape the rout by having their shares suspended and the regulators warned of \"panic sentiment\" gripping investors. \nMeanwhile, a surprise increase in U.S. stockpiles despite the peak demand American summer driving season added to global oversupply as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia produce at near record levels. \nIranian exports could also resume at full throttle if major global powers and Iran find a compromise in nuclear talks this week that could lead to a lifting of western sanctions against Tehran. \n(Editing by Joseph Radford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T04:31:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
