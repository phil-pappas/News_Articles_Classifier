Before the abrupt reversal, the indexes had more than doubled since November.\nHong Kong shares, which had held up relatively well during the early weeks of the mainland sell-off, have also fallen sharply in recent days, and were down more than 4 percent on Wednesday.\nDawn State Ltd, a unit of state-backed Haixia Capital Management, raised $816.3 million by selling the Haitong stake at an unusually large 20 percent discount to its last traded price, IFR reported on Wednesday. Shares in Haitong were suspended on Wednesday, but the wide discount prompted investors to dump other Chinese stock brokers.\nInvestors are worried that Beijing's move over the weekend to press 21 brokerages to commit about $19 billion to support mainland stocks could throw their business plans into disarray and hit profits.\nOn Wednesday, Hong Kong-listed shares of Chinese brokers plunged between 10 and 20 percent amid worries the broader China stock market slide is likely to crimp demand for their booming margin finance business. Just this year, Chinese brokers raised about $30 billion to grow their business.\nHaixia Capital, based in the southeastern province of Fujian, managed 32.8 billion yuan ($5.3 billion) at the end of December. It wasn't clear what prompted Haixia to sell the stake, which would result in a loss of 38 percent in six months since it bought the 569.4 million shares at HK$17.89 each.\nDawn State Ltd sold 569.4 million Hong Kong-traded shares of Haitong at HK$11.12 each, the bottom of an indicative range of HK$11.12 to HK$12.00, added IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication. The price is equivalent to a discount of 20 percent.\nUBS was sole bookrunner for the deal. Haixia Capital officials didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
