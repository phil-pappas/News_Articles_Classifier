The European Central Bank raised the pressure before Tuesday's summit by keeping a tight grip on funding to Greek banks. \nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 rose 0.2 percent to 1,503.88 points by 0748 GMT. \nStrategists at BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) said Sunday's referendum results did not mean Greece had to quit the euro zone, but did increase the chances it will leave to 70 percent. \n\"The creditors will require ... a commitment to reform and monitoring of its implementation. However, in light of the referendum, the likelihood of the Greek government acceding to creditors' demands has diminished,\" the strategists said in a note. \nProSiebenSat1 rose 2.8 percent, a top FTSEurofirst 300 riser, after sources said talks over a merger with German publishing house Axel Springer had restarted. \nAxel Springer rose 5.9 percent, even though it said that speculation that its majority owner, Friede Springer, might relinquish control was \"unfounded\". \nSAP (Swiss: SAP.SW - news ) and Evonik both rose 2.4 percent, after UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) lifted its target price for both stocks. \nTechnip sank 7.8 percent after it announced a restructuring programme, booking a 650 million-euro ($719 million) charge and cutting 6,000 jobs. \nRolls-Royce dropped 2.6 percent, following a 6.3 percent loss in the previous session. A raft of brokers downgraded the stock after a third profit warning in nine months on Monday. \nEurope bourses in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/pap87v \nAsset performance in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/gap87v \nToday's European research round-up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T12:48:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
