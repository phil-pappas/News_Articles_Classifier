Triggers such as a regulatory crackdown on margin financing , in which investors borrow money to buy stocks, sent that trend into reverse in June. \nThe government then launched a range of interventions, including limiting short selling and using central bank cash to buy shares. Trading in more than 1,400 companies was suspended for several days. \nWhat was the effect on UK portfolios? \nMost UK investors with broadly diversified portfolios have some China exposure, although much is through Hong Kong-listed shares rather than so-called “A” shares listed on the mainland, to which international investors have only recently gained access. \nOf funds specialising in China, “the managers that have done the best in the year to date are more likely to be doing worse over the past month,” says Wing Chan, director of manager research for Asia at Morningstar. \n“Funds that are defensively positioned, such as First State’s China Growth fund, haven’t done so well in the year to date, but it has done relatively well in the past month.” \nBy contrast, Fidelity’s popular China Special Situations investment trust has fallen 16.7 per cent in share price terms over the past month, but has gained almost 40 per cent over a year, according to FE Analytics. \nDale Nicholls, the manager, says that while the trust’s discount to net asset value widened during the turmoil, his investment strategy has also come into play: “I find a lot of interesting ideas in the small to mid-cap space, and they tend to be more volatile.” \nHow have UK fund managers reacted? \nChinese brokerage firms have been one loser. Douglas Turnbull, head of Chinese equities at Neptune Investment Management, says his funds have been selling Chinese brokers, while Mr Nicholls reduced his weighting this year. \nBoth managers have also seen buying opportunities in the mayhem. Mr Nicholls added to positions in A-shares including home appliance firms, and also in smaller Hong Kong-listed auto dealers and home furnishings companies. \nAre markets set to fall further? \nMr Turnbull says “we may well see further downside before it stabilises”. However, he characterises the crash as “a stock market correction that went too far, too quickly” rather than an economic collapse. \nShould we be afraid? \nChinese markets, still in their emerging stage, are well-known to be volatile. But fund managers say they were surprised by the level of government intervention. \n“It’s delayed the process of [market] liberalisation, which is on the disappointing side, but I think the overall trend is still towards markets opening up,” says Mr Nicholls. \nLaith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says government actions can lead to “perverse outcomes”. “For example, if you suspend half the shares in the market, people who want to leave have to sell whatever shares are still trading,” he said. \nMr Turnbull characterises the current situation as “a tug-of-war between policymakers and a stampeding herd of domestic retail investors”.
