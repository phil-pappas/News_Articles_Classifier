Ekow Ainoo Jnr, the Diocesan Youth Organizer and Brother Kwabena Frempong Fening, the outgoing Diocesan Chairman, both charged the new officers to work harder to move the youth fellowship forward.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T16:53:29.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
