But the contract remained in a downward trend that has been in place since early May and which has seen prices fall almost 10 percent. \n\"Negative sentiment stemmed from an increased U.S. oil rig count (by 12 to 640), after dropping for six months. U.S. shale producers have brought down the breakeven cost from $35 to $20 per barrel,\" ANZ bank said on Friday. \n\"The current U.S. horizontal and vertical rig count across the Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Niobrara shale plays implies that U.S. oil production growth will reach 135,000 barrels per day year-on-year by 4Q15,\" Goldman Sachs said on Friday. \nThe rising U.S. rig count adds to near record production by OPEC and Russia. \nTraders said that Asia's commodity markets were also impacted by reports that China's regulators had opened an investigation into suspected market manipulation after a slump of more than 20 percent in Chinese stocks since mid-June. \nOn Thursday, Shanghai's benchmark composite index (.SSEC) fell below 4,000 points for the first time since April - a key support level that analysts had expected Beijing to defend. They had predicted that more conservative investors would start closing out leveraged positions if the index dropped below 4,000. \n(Editing by Joseph Radford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T05:54:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
