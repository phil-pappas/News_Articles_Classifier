It plans to finance a salvage expedition to \"execute the recovery of of major gold and silver cargoes from two British passenger ships sunk during World War I\", according to Black Mountain's executive director, Peter Landau .\nApart from the need for floaties, it is sheer genius.\nThe mother lode has already been dug up, and refined. And then sunk.\nAn estimated 1.8 million ounces of gold coins and bullion is sitting in the holds of the two ships. Another 6.35 million ounces of silver is also on offer if time permits.\nThe value of the gold cargo on the SS Arabic alone has been estimated at $US1.4 billion.\n\"These vessels were sunk in a major shipping lane in international waters south of Ireland while attempting to deliver bank transfers to North America to finance the war effort,\" Black Mountain reported.\nWhile there have been unsuccessful attempts to salvage the loot from the SS Arabic and TSS Hesperian in the past, the team from Black Mountain's partner, IDM Exploration Ltd, have \"new research\" and the \"latest technology\" to succeed where others got scuppered.\nAnd the good news is that Black Mountain investors will find out pretty soon if the salvage operation is a winner.\nThe salvage crew is heading off next month to make the most of the small operational window that will close by October, thanks to local weather conditions.\nBlack Mountain reports that it has the option of claiming 20 per cent of the salvaged loot by footing the bill for $4 million of costs.\nIt should be a minor hassle for a silver explorer with a $1 million market cap.\nRising ambition He may not have bragging rights to a casino, but cosmetic surgeon turned hotel mogul Jerry Schwartz has beaten James 'Mr Carey' Packer to the punch when it comes to actually watching the first concrete pour on his $360 million hotel at Sydney's Darling Harbour precinct.\nJerry helped smooth the first bit of concrete along with his young son, Dane, watched by NSW Trade Minister Stuart Ayres , who copped an earful about Schwartz's quixotic plans to build a helipad on the roof.\nAnd how else will it ever host a Liberal Party fundraiser.\n\"It's 35 storeys high, who's going to complain – the neighbours?\" he said, referring to the very public failure of his earlier plans for a floating helipad on the harbour.\nWe hope the latest heliport campaign gets a better hearing than his 2013 plans to turn Sydney's disused monorail stations into giant fish tanks.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:20:45.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
