The SSEC index fell 5.8 percent on Friday to end at 3,684 points.\nListed securities companies among the 21 brokerages, along with their major shareholders, also would buy back shares.\nHong Hao, a chief strategist at BOCOM International, said he was confused by the slew of measures announced recently.\nHao doubted the latest plan would be enough to arrest the price slide and said it could sow the seeds of fresh problems in the future by further distorting the market.\n\"Around 120 billion yuan is not enough, but if leverage (more borrowing) is used, it could expand to over 500 billion yuan and that may have some effect,\" he said.\nMoreover, while brokerages were likely to focus on stronger, blue-chip companies, Hao said there would be little interest in saving small and wildly overvalued \"growth\" firms. Such companies are favoured by ordinary investors from cashiers to taxi drivers, but have suffered some of the most savage declines in recent weeks.\nPOLICY CONFUSION?\nJust a few months ago, state media had been exhorting the market's rise, saying China's bull market had just begun and denying that it was in a bubble. Investors big and small took that as a government signal to buy.\nNow, Beijing is struggling to find a policy formula to restore confidence in the market before too much damage is done to the world's second-largest economy.\nWeighed down by a property downturn, factory overcapacity and high levels of local government debt, China's economic growth had already been expected to slow to around 7 percent in 2015, robust by global standards but its weakest annual expansion in a quarter of a century.\nAfter the market close on Friday, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said China would cut initial public offerings and capital raisings and support long-term investors entering the market to help stabilise prices.\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) also rolled over 250 billion yuan of medium-term loans to banks late on Friday to ensure adequate liquidity in the system.\nInvestors say constant tinkering with monetary policy and regulations to try to temper the stock market slide raises wider questions about whether China is ready to open up its capital markets and have more influence in the international financial system.
