They’re also less likely to agree to get their hands dirty when it comes time to sweep the shed.\nThe contracting boss has seen exceptions, of course, but he’s also noted strong trends, and what he’s picked up is in line with the bigger picture — the grim picture that’s emerging of a generation of newcomers to the workforce unprepared for work.\n“I’ve had countless experiences with kids who are just not ready,” he says.\n“They haven’t picked up the skills that you learn by working and that’s often because they haven’t had to.\n“They come in late, they don’t realise that they might have to do things they don’t want to, and they don’t appreciate the job. They think if they don’t like it here they can just pack up and get another job around the corner, keep chasing that almighty dollar without building their skills.”\nMr Trenamen might sound like another disgruntled boss whining about “kids these days”, but what he’s picked up is reflected in national trends.\nEmployers say it’s clear which kids are going to be good workers — and point to kids who’ve grown up on farms as a good example.

It makes them really hard to employ,” she says.\n“General issues are not understanding that a job is about turning up on time every day, not just when you feel like, that it’s about taking direction, and basic things like you’ve got to be well presented and you’ve got to be pleasant.\n“The number of young people not working while they’re in school is one of the problems.”\nMs Carnell says the declining need for kids to work is a symptom of a largely more affluent society, and while it offers young people the luxury of focusing on their studies, it also deprives them of the skills they will pick up in the work force before they take up a full time role.\nAnother part of the problem, Ms Carnell says, isn’t just a lack of enthusiasm for kids to get a job down at the local takeaway or supermarket, but parents encouraging them not to while they focus on their studies.\nGetting a good after school job can even lead to a career with the company.

Instead of turning it around and blaming schools, we should look at other path ways.\n“There are some really good models of how communities can wrap more around schools and bring educators and employers together.”\nIT’S A TWO-WAY STREET\nBrett Schimming is the CEO of Construction Skills Queensland, an industry body that works with schools and young career seekers together with employers providing skilling programs to bridge that gap and equip kids to get in to jobs.\n“What we do know is that if you simply are going to employ a young person and expect them to know what to do on day one, you are more than likely not going to have success and it doesn’t end well for anyone,” he says.\n“We’ve learnt that it’s 50/50 in terms of effort, so we like to increase the chances of matching the right people to the right jobs, and matching people who are each willing to give their 50 per cent and work together.”\nWhile Mr Schimming’s programs aren’t supplied in response to complaints, he says they do help to address issues among employers.\n“There is a level of frustration of how to source good workers,” he says.\n“They want good aptitude and attitude, not the technical craft skills, they can be taught. The key thing small businesses are looking for is that attitude and they get challenged by how best to find that person because they’ve had experience where they’ve hired people and it hasn’t worked out.”\nApprenticeship Support Australia, which covers the recruitment of more than 300,000 apprentices, is another group trying to meet businesses and new workers halfway.\nLast month the federal government-funded group announced a “job-fit test” that would gauge Gen Y job seekers’ work ethic, skills and job readiness before they are approved for an apprenticeship.\nThe performance test was devised in response to the drop out rate of apprentices falling to a shocking 50 per cent, the Herald Sun reported.\nSo there are programs that help, and employers, educators and industry bodies alike believe there should be more, but back at ACCI Ms Carnell says the simplest way to learn skills is for young people to get into the work force as soon as they can.\n“Young people are always conscious of the reputation their generation has, and they should work to break that,” she says.\n“It really, really makes a difference as an employer if you get a CV from a young person and see they’ve been employed during school or university. It’s a huge tick.” Who Do You Want Your Child To Be? 50:48 Play video\nWriter David Baddiel discovers how children think and asks: What are we educating our children for?\nOovvuu 18 Jun 2015 TV/Science TV/Parenting TV/Health TV/Documentary\n ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/generation-unprepared-the-school-and-university-leavers-with-no-skills-to-work-at-all/story-fnkgbb6w-1227440993477?sv=88e7939c69f0a2ff1202cdf9880e622c&title=Generation+with+%26%238216%3Bno+skills+at+all%26%238217%3B", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://videomam.news.com.au.s3.amazonaws.com/generated/prod/06/18/2015/128548/image1024x768.jpg?count=2&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/generation-unprepared-the-school-and-university-leavers-with-no-skills-to-work-at-all/story-fnkgbb6w-1227440993477?sv=88e7939c69f0a2ff1202cdf9880e622c", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Generation+with+%26%238216%3Bno+skills+at+all%26%238217%3B&c=ON+PAPER%2C+they%26%238217%3Bre+more+qualified+than+any+other+generation.+But+when+these+Australians+enter+the+workforce%2C+they+get+a+nasty+surprise.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/generation-unprepared-the-school-and-university-leavers-with-no-skills-to-work-at-all/story-fnkgbb6w-1227440993477?sv=88e7939c69f0a2ff1202cdf9880e622c", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/generation-unprepared-the-school-and-university-leavers-with-no-skills-to-work-at-all/story-fnkgbb6w-1227440993477?sv=88e7939c69f0a2ff1202cdf9880e622c", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/generation-unprepared-the-school-and-university-leavers-with-no-skills-to-work-at-all/story-fnkgbb6w-1227440993477?sv=88e7939c69f0a2ff1202cdf9880e622c&title=Generation+with+%26%238216%3Bno+skills+at+all%26%238217%3B", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/generation-unprepared-the-school-and-university-leavers-with-no-skills-to-work-at-all/story-fnkgbb6w-1227440993477?sv=88e7939c69f0a2ff1202cdf9880e622c&h=Generation+with+%26%238216%3Bno+skills+at+all%26%238217%3B"], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T09:21:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
