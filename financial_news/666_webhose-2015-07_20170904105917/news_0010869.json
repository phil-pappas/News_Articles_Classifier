Beyond this, I do not think it's appropriate for people to use its tax-free status to build incredibly high levels of wealth,\" Brad Cooper says. Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey The head of Westpac Banking Corp's wealth business will call for retirees to start paying income tax on annual superannuation earnings of more than $150,000 in a push to secure changes so the system can meet the retirement and budgetary needs of an ageing Australia.\nBrad Cooper, the chief executive of BT Financial Group, believes the retirement age and the super preservation age should rise automatically with increases in life expectancy to \"allow our system to adapt itself to Australia's changing demographics and not be reliant on the politics of the day to make changes\".\nMr Cooper will on Friday call on the Abbott government to restore the Low Income Superannuation Contribution it abolished and propose lower concessional tax rates for women to compensate for them being paid less. He will argue superannuation should be moved out of the annual budget cycle and in to the five-yearly cycle of the intergenerational report \"to stop super being hijacked by the politics of the day\".\nHe will argue that tax breaks on super needed to be limited. \"The guiding principle should be that tax concessions remain in place as long as they are being used to build savings that generate an income in retirement that affords a decent quality of life,\" he will say in a speech to the Trans-Tasman Business Circle function in Sydney.\n\"Super is meant to be used to generate replacement income in retirement. Beyond this, I do not think it's appropriate for people to use its tax-free status to build incredibly high levels of wealth or serve as a proxy estate planning tool.\"\nMr Cooper will propose that in retirement, income earned from super should not exceed that of twice the average weekly ordinary earnings, currently $75,000 a year per person.\n\"For many households, a single person's superannuation will be funding the retirement of a couple,\" he will say. \"Therefore, in retirement, if a person has a balance high enough to draw an income stream that is twice [average earnings] then I believe this is the point that taxpayer-funded concessions should fall away.\"\nHe said based on current conservative estimates, a $2.5 million super nest egg would deliver $150,000 a year. He said savings achieved by tightening tax exemptions, would allow scope to \"address some anomalies at the bottom\", such as restoring the LISC, which was an annual $500 government payment into the super accounts of those earning less tan $37,000.\n Hockey dismisses suggestions Treasurer Joe Hockey, who has previously flagged linking the preservation and pension age to life expectancy , dismissed the suggestions by pointing out the government was committed to making no changes to super this parliamentary term or the next.\nBut shadow treasurer Chris Bowen welcomed the contribution, saying many proposals were in line with Labor policy. These included putting super on a five-year cycle, reinstating the LISC and putting limits in the tax-free status or earnings in retirement.\nA former Labor superannuation minister and now industry consultant, Nick Sherry, said Mr Cooper's ideas reflected the reality of changes required if the retirement needs of an ageing Australia were to be met and budgetary pressures eased. \"These changes are inevitable,\" he said.\nMr Cooper will contend that super needs to be remodelled from 2025 onwards when the compulsory contribution rate is set to hit 12 per cent. He calls this the mature stage and and says people who enter the workforce from that date should have a legislated super policy which aims to deliver them 65 per cent of their working income.\nChanges could only be made every five years based on long-term forecasts.\nMr Cooper said there would need to be flexibility to accommodate different circumstances until social discrepancies are rectified.\nIndigenous people, for example, still had lower life expectancy and should be able to access their super earlier. Women, who suffer from a 17 per cent income gap, could receive rebates to effectively lower the contributions taxes while they work.\nHe recommends splitting retirement incomes into three phases â€“ accumulation phase, active retirement, which is between retirement and reaching average life expectancy, and a third phase covering reaching life expectancy to death.\nPeople the third phase would need \"pooled products\" such as as insurance and deferred lifetime annuities to meet health and other costs.\nBT Financial Group owns the Asgard, BankSA, Licensee Select, Securitor and St.George Financial Planning brands.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-30T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:04:39.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
