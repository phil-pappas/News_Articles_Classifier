Messenger P2P Payments \nWe're happy to announce that Messenger person-to-person payments are now available to everyone in the U.S.! Add your Debit Card and pay anyone on Messenger in a few taps. Money goes straight from your checking account to the recipient's checking account. Easy and safe. As always, give it a try it and let us know how we can make even better for you! Posted by David Marcus on Tuesday, 30 June 2015 \nV3 has asked Facebook when the service will be extended to territories other than the US, including in the UK, but had not received a reply at the time of publication. \nFacebook has been working on the payment service for some time, and recently opened Meseenger up to anyone, even those without a Facebook account , underlining its desire to reach as many users as possible with its tools. \nThe Messenger comes as more digital payment systems hit the market such as Apple Pay which is expected to arrive in the UK later this month. \nMeanwhile high street bank Barclays' recently unveiled a raft of new physical digital payment tools in the form of a sticker, keyfob and wristband, allowing people to make contactless payment of up to £20. \nMike Saunders, managing director for digital consumer payments at Barclaycard, explained that the bank launched the bPay range to satisfy customer demand and meet the evolution of the industry. \n\"We're in the midst of a sweeping change in the way we pay, with cash-dominated transactions being replaced by ‘touch and go' contactless technology that has made it easier, safer and faster to make low-value payments,\" he said.
