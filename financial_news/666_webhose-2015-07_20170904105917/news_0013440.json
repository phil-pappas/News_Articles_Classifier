The poll found that 62 percent of Americans support the King v. Burwell decision, while 32 percent disapprove. The public's approval of the King v. Burwell decision is higher than that of the Supreme Court's 2012 ruling, which also rejected a major challenge to the Obama-backed health care law. About half, 47 percent, approved and 43 percent disapproved of the ruling in that case, according to a Kaiser Health Tracking poll conducted in June 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T15:47:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
