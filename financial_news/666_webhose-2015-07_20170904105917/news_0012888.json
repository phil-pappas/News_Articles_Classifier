Lost man hours are costly and, just as important, if not more, can result in missed deadlines. \nBookkeepers, particularly, have time constraints upon them. Cashiers have month-end tasks to complete and payroll clerks have monthly salaries to process. \nGet the timing of your accounts submissions wrong and, worst case scenario, you're in breach of the SRA Accounts Rules so have some explaining to do to the Solicitors Regulation Authority. Best case scenario isn't much better either. Fail to pay your workers on time and you've got a mutiny on your hands. What's more, even when the heatwave's over, schools will be breaking up for summer which means your headcount's reduced by holidaying colleagues. \nThere's an easy solution to your short-staffing misery... outsourced cashiering and payroll. \nTemporary or permanent arrangement, long or short-term contract, pre-planned or emergency cover, fixed or undefined end date, our outsourced legal accounting and outsourced payroll services can be switched on overnight. \nEven if your named cashier or payroll clerk is absent from work, your assigned deputy will cover instead. \nTo survive the heatwave and plan for summer, get in touch today. By tomorrow, disruptive absenteeism can be a thing of the past. \nEmail info@quill.co.uk or call 0845 226 2587. \nShare:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T02:29:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
