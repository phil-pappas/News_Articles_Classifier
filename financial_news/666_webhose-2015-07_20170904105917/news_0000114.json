PUBLISHED: 09:50, Wed, Jul 15, 2015 | UPDATED: 10:23, Wed, Jul 15, 2015 GETTY British Gas has cut bills \nThe drop will save households around £35 a year who are on Standard and Fix & Fall tariffs. The cut is to take effect on 27 August and is the second gas price reduction by British Gas this year, meaning customers' bills should be around £72 lower in total. Britain's 'Big Six' energy providers have been criticised in recent months for failing to slash bills despite a collapse in wholesale costs. However, British Gas residential managing director Stephen Beynon denied that today's cut was as a result of political pressure.He said: \"We make pricing decision based on our own costs, and we cut prices whenever we're able to do so.\" Mr Benyon added that today's reduction reflected British Gas' lower projected total costs this year and next. \nMark Hodges, managing director of British Gas, said: \"British Gas is committed to offering competitively priced products, and the price cut we’re announcing today demonstrates that. \"There are a range of costs that make up energy bills, some decreasing and others increasing. \"This reduction reflects our lower projected total costs for 2015 and 2016 and we’re pleased that customers will see the benefits in their gas bills ahead of next winter.\" \nHowever, critics questioned why the cut has not taken place with immeditate effect. \nStephen Murray, energy expert at MoneySuperMarket, said: “Whilst customers have to be notified 30 days before any increase to price, a cut in bills can be brought in immediately, so it’s disappointing to see that this isn’t the case and British Gas is making its customers wait over a month before they see this reflected in their bills.\" \nThe spotlight is now on the remaining five firms - Scottish Power, EDF, SSE, E:ON and npower - to follow suit and reduce costs for households. Earlier this month, the competition regulator said that rip-off energy energy bills are now suffered by seven out of ten homes under Britain's broken market. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had found that between 2009 and 2013, Britain's largest six energy firms had overcharged households by around £1.2billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T11:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T08:25:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
