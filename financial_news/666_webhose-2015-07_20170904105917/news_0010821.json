I think in the end, there will be some sort of a solution (for Greece),\" Stubb told Deutsche Welle in the interview that was conducted on Tuesday evening and aired on Wednesday morning.\n\"We are not throwing Greece out, we don't want a Grexit. But it's clear that everybody has to be prepared for all possible outcomes,\" Stubb added. \"Time is simply running out.\"\nHe underlined that Finland had a similar stance to Germany. \"If we talk about debt cuts, a restructuring of debt or something like that, then that's a 'no go' for the Finnish government,\" Stubb said.
