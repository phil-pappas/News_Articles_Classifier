Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Lisa Murray The Chinese government's aggressive intervention in its stock market did not start with the raft of emergency measures it unleashed this month to counter a dramatic sell-down.\nPolicymakers have been massaging the market all year. Indeed, the market rally to June 12, when both the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets had more than doubled in less than 12 months, was widely believed to be state-sponsored. It was seen as part of President Xi Jinping's \"China Dream,\" a chance to take part in the country's economic evolution. That's why the government was forced to respond so heavily when stocks started falling. Its credibility was on the line.\nChina's bull market \"has just begun\", a website run by the Communist Party mouthpiece, The People's Daily, trumpeted on April 21.\nLess than two weeks earlier, the government had lifted the ban on multiple accounts, allowing individual investors to have as many as 20 open at the same time. This move was all the more significant given retail investors dominate trade, accounting for roughly 80 per cent of daily turnover.\nAgain, the government could hardly stand by and watch the market go into free-fall, having pumped it up all the way to its peak.\nAt first its intervention appeared to fail. An interest rate cut on June 27 was ineffectual. It was only when the government suspended initial public offerings, clamped-down on short-selling and ordered a series of share-buying programs by state institutions, backed by funds from the central bank, the market stabilised.\nOn Monday, China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was headed for its third straight day of gains . The 2.3 per cent increase, as of the lunchtime close, came as more than 400 stocks resumed trading, although over 1000 are still suspended.\nAnd the People's Daily has flagged the introduction of a \"financial stabilisation fund\" to act as a buffer and stabilise prices when the market \"experiences an unreasonable and irrational surge or slump.\"\n The problem with these types of measures is that it creates an expectation the government will intervene to support the market at any cost, which is a belief that encourages \"irrational\" buying in the first place.\nStill, Beijing's response appears to have been successful in countering panic-selling. And this is important for global economic stability. As Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia, points out China accounts for more global growth than the US, Europe and Japan combined.\nRothman believes if China's equity markets did fall further, it would have a \"small but material negative impact\" on GDP growth. The financial sector accounted for 7.4 per cent of the country's GDP last year and that share rose to 9.7 per cent in the first quarter so any drop-off in activity will impact growth in the second half.\nHowever, he says given two-thirds of active trading accounts had less than US$15,000 there would be only a \"modest impact\" on retail sales growth. He is also not too concerned about the rapid build up in margin finance to fund share purchases, because consumer debt is still very low and savings very high. Household bank deposits in China stand at about US$8.5 trillion.\nWhile the government may have hoped the equities rally of the past 12 months would boost household wealth and drive spending, there is limited evidence that has been the case, which dulls the impact of any market falls.\n\"There are limited links between the stock market and the real economy,\" says Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard.\n\"We think the government response was an overreaction because they felt their reputation was at stake having talked up the market on the way up.\"\nSo what happens now? After a rocky few weeks, the market appears to have stabilised.\nTao Dong, Credit Suisse's chief China economist says Beijing's response was not dissimilar to interventions by the Federal Reserve in 2008 and the European Central Bank in 2012 in the face of overwhelming risks to the financial system.\n\"In the early stages, the policy reaction appeared to be not well coordinated,\" says Tao. \"It took them a while to figure out what to do because the market has changed in the last few years. There are more derivatives, leverage is higher and conventional policies didn't work as well.\"\nStill, Tao says the government's actions are a \"set-back\" for China's reform agenda.\n\"The basic function of capital markets is raising funds,\" he says. \"If you change the rules, it doesn't help the confidence of the supplier of capital.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/lmurray75", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/app/basic/117863643605371534837/posts"], "published": "2015-07-13T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T10:40:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
