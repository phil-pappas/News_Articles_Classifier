Please see the Charles Schwab Pricing Guide for additional information. \nImportant Disclosures and Definitions \nAn investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus, which contains this and other information, please contact your financial professional or call 1.855.215.1425. Read the prospectus carefully before investing. \nSprott Gold Miners ETF shares are not individually redeemable. Investors buy and sell shares of the Sprott Gold Miners ETF on a secondary market. Only market makers or “authorized participants” may trade directly with the Fund, typically in blocks of 50,000 shares. \nThe Fund is not suitable for all investors. There are risks involved with investing in ETFs including the loss of money. The Fund is considered non-diversified and can invest a greater portion of assets in securities of individual issuers than a diversified fund. As a result, changes in the market value of a single investment could cause greater fluctuations in share price than would occur in a diversified fund. \nThe Fund is concentrated in the gold and silver mining industry. As a result, the Fund will be sensitive to changes in, and its performance will depend to a greater extent on, the overall condition of the gold and silver mining industry. Also, gold and silver mining companies are highly dependent on the price of gold and silver bullion. These prices may fluctuate substantially over short periods of time so the Fund’s Share price may be more volatile than other types of investments. \nFunds that emphasize investments in small/mid cap companies will generally experience greater price volatility. \nFunds investing in foreign and emerging markets will also generally experience greater price volatility. \nThe Sprott Gold Miners ETF is a new product with a limited operating history. \nALPS Portfolio Solutions Distributor, Inc. is not affiliated with Sprott Asset Management LP or Schwab ETF OneSource. \nALPS Portfolio Solutions Distributor, Inc. is the Distributor for the Sprott Gold Miners ETF.
