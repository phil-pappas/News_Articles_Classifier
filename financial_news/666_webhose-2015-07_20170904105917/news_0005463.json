And there are four key reasons why a depressed oil price could be great news for long-term investors. \nNot worth the effort \nOil costs money to find and extract, and if companies cannot make an attractive return on investment for their efforts, they'll simply leave the oil in the ground. \nThis is already starting to happen. Around $200bn worth of oil projects were cancelled during the fourth quarter of last year. Analysts believe the final tally could top $1trn of projects cancelled. \nAnd with new projects being put on hold, there's a risk that the world could begin to underinvest in oil, which would reduce supply. At the same time, demand will pick up as low oil prices increase consumption. \nCyclical forces driven by rising demand and falling supply will push prices higher once again, possibly even to new highs over the long term. These market forces will take time to establish themselves. \nConsolidation \nLow oil prices are already having an effect on high-cost oil producers. Profits are collapsing, debts are rising and a high percentage of both small and medium-sized players are struggling to make ends meet. \nAs a result, larger players with less leverage can pick and choose the best acquisition targets and make a deal on their terms -- great news for the shareholders of big oil. \nFor example, at the beginning of June oil giant Noble Energy acquired smaller peer Rosetta Resources for $3.9bn, only 12 months earlier Rosetta was worth three times as much. \nDebt defaults \nSix large US shale oil producers have gone to the wall so far this year. The largest bankruptcy was Sabine Oil & Gas, which listed $2.9bn of liabilities but only $2.5bn in assets. \nThese bankruptcies present a great opportunity for larger players with more robust balance sheets to buy up assets at rock-bottom prices. Only a year ago drillers in the US would be paying five or six times as much for land to drill on compared to the land acquired through bankruptcies. It is the traditional buy low, sell high model. \nOnce again, shareholders of the more fiscally prudent oil companies will benefit. \nBusiness cycle \nFor the global economy, low oil prices are a godsend. Low oil prices lead to lower fuel prices, which, in turn pushed down the prices of goods and services. As a result, consumers have more discretionary income to spend, and economic growth picks up. Economic expansion is usually good for markets. \nEstimates and figures vary, but some figures suggest that the low price of oil will boost consumer spending across the Eurozone by as much as 1% during 2015. In euro terms that's around ?14bn of new spending. Moreover, in the UK it has been suggested that the low oil price will lead to the creation of up to 90,000 new jobs. \nSo, while the oil industry struggles, other sectors are reaping the benefits. However, over the long term, as the supply of oil declines and demand continues to increase, oil prices should head higher once again. The long-term investor has nothing to worry about. \nTo help you profit from the low oil price, our top analysts have put together this new report entitled, \"How You Could Retire Seriously Rich \". \nThis is report takes you through the seven essential steps you need to take to become a stock market millionaire. \nWhat's more, the report from explains how spending just 20 minutes a month could help you create a portfolio that could bring you closer to financial freedom for life. \nClick here to check out the report -- it's completely free and comes with no further obligation. \nRupert Hargreaves has no position in any shares mentioned.
