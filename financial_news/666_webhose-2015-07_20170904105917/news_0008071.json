Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Canberra concrete companies allegedly agreed to charge identical minimum rates to customers to make a profit after covering the cost of striking an inflated workplace agreement with the construction union.\nThe Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption is investigating arrangements struck between companies in Canberra and the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union.\nCounsel assisting the commission, Jeremy Stoljar, said evidence would show that the CFMEU encouraged employers to sign an enterprise agreement as a group.\nMr Stoljar said employers were told to agree to minimum pricing in the market to ensure that each of them could sustain a profit after meeting the terms and conditions of the deal.\nHe said the arrangements could substantially lessen competition and inflate the cost of construction work in Canberra.\nClive Arona, a director of concreting company Multi-Crete Australia, told the commission on Wednesday that a group of Canberra concrete firms jointly negotiated a pattern agreement with the CFMEU at the union offices in late 2013.\nMr Arona said the companies agreed to pay the same wage rates to all employees after the union said it wanted a \"level playing field\". He said it was further agreed that the companies would charge $16.50 a cubic metre for a concrete pour and $6.50 a square metre for finishing work.\nHe said he believed the price to be charged to customers was calculated on the basis it could cover the cost of the enterprise agreement negotiated with the CFMEU.\n Elements of agreement expensive Mr Arona said he believed elements of the agreement were expensive, including a requirement that a payment of $90 to $95 a week per worker be paid into a redundancy fund. The commission heard the award rate was between $30 and $40 a week per employer.\nHe said the company also agreed to pay for a union-appointed auditor to audit the business.\nMr Arona said he believed it was necessary for concrete companies to have an enterprise agreement with the union to work in Canberra. Mr Arona said he used to operate a company with contractor Elias Taleb, who has told the commission he paid more than $135,000 to a former CFMEU organiser, Halafihi Kivalu, to work in Canberra.\nMr Arona said he witnessed Mr Taleb handing money in an envelope to Mr Kivalu.\nHe said he had given $5000 to Mr Kivalu but the money had been given voluntarily to attend a fundraiser in support of Tonga. He said he and Mr Kivalu were friends and he agreed the money might have been to help the Tongan population affected by Cyclone Ian.\nApart from Mr Taleb, three Canberra employers have told the commission they allegedly made corrupt payments to Mr Kivalu to get work on building projects in the ACT.\nMr Kivalu is expected to give evidence on Thursday to the commission, which will spend another two weeks examining the conduct of the CFMEU in the ACT.\nMr Stoljar has said the evidence would \"paint a disturbing picture of the conduct of the CFMEU in the ACT: alleged corrupt payments, standover and intimidation tactics, and the apparent establishment and promotion of cartels for key trades\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-07-15T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T17:00:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
