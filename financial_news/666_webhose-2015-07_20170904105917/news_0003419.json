Sales, minus revenue passed on to partners, rose 13 per cent to $US14.4 billion ($19.4 billion). Analysts on average projected $US6.73 a share in profit on $US14.3 billion in sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nOperating expenses climbed 13 per cent from a year earlier, a smaller rise than the 21 per cent jump in the first quarter. The arrival of new Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat in May has assuaged investor concerns that Google boss Larry Page's spending on projects outside the main search-advertising business -- from driverless cars to computerised spectacles -- would keep accelerating without paying off in higher revenue.\nInvestors have been worried about Google boss Larry Page's spending on projects outside the main search-advertising business -- from driverless cars to computerised spectacles.\n\"The focus has been increasingly shifting towards spending and the ability to rein that in,\" said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co.\nStock jumps Google shares rose as high as $US683.65 in extended trading after the report. The stock gained 3.1 per cent to $US601.78 at the close in New York, and has soared 11 per cent since the start of July.\nRuth Porat became the search giant's finance chief in May.

Revenue in the recent period would have been $US1.1 billion higher had foreign-exchange rates stayed constant, the company said.\nThe number of clicks on ads in the second quarter rose 18 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in the first quarter, while the average cost per click fell 11 per cent after declining 7 per cent in the first quarter. Mobile cost-per-click is climbing, Porat said on the call. Watch time on YouTube, the company's video-sharing site, was up 60 per cent, with mobile watch time more than doubling, she said.\nPorat, who came to Google after holding the CFO post at Morgan Stanley, brings extensive experience with Wall Street. She replaced Patrick Pichette, who also had emphasised during recent quarterly earnings calls that the company is committed to managing costs.\nPorat inherited an increasingly complex company that has been slow to break out more financial details about key services, such as YouTube and mobile advertising.\nThe company has expanded its reach through investments in fledgling businesses, such as self-driving cars and Google Glass eyewear, and sometimes-hefty acquisitions like Nest Labs, which makes internet-connected gear for the home. Google also has devoted money to improving its core advertising services, including new tools to enable purchases directly from ads and features that aim to make the buying process simpler for marketers.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T05:38:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
