It is believed that a shoal caused the rip, even though the Fennica was in charted waters.\nThe company is hoping to return to Arctic drilling later this month for the first time since 2012, when it lost control of an oil rig forcing an evacuation of 18 workers in high seas by the Coast Guard. The Kulluk rig grounded and had to be scrapped.\n\"Shell's continuing problems make clear that the company has not remedied the systemic deficiencies made evident in 2012 and the (Interior Department) should not grant further approvals,\" the letter to U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said.\nThe Fennica, one of two icebreakers Shell is leasing, contains a capping stack, or emergency equipment that could contain a blown-out well. Shell is sending nearly 29 ships to the Chukchi and has spent about $7 billion on Arctic drilling. It hopes to start producing oil offshore in 10 or 15 years.\nOn Monday, Shell said it can proceed with preparatory drilling in the Chukchi before the Fennica returns to the region as long as it does not go to the undersea zone that contains oil and gas. The company had no comment on Tuesday about the letter.\nShell needs the two final authorizations, called applications for permits to drill, from the Interior Department before starting this season.
