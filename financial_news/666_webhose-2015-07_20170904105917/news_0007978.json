They have sat at a record low of 0.5 percent since 2009. \nIn June, Haldane said the BoE (Shenzhen: 000725.SZ - news ) was as likely to need to cut rates as to raise them in future. \nYet financial markets expect a rate rise in the first half of 2016 and some economists say it could come as soon as November this year. \nBoE Governor Mark Carney said last week that a decision on when to increase borrowing costs would come into sharper relief around the turn of the year. \nMinutes of an MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) meeting in early July, published on Wednesday, showed a growing number of policymakers felt the decision about when to raise rates was \"more finely balanced\" but the turmoil in Greece at the time was a big factor against a hike. \nMany economists expect a minority of MPC members to vote to raise rates at their meeting in August, ending a period of unity in support of no change which has lasted since January.
