Rob Homer by Lucille Keen The Financial Services Council has called for the GST base rate to be increased to 15 per cent and broadened to cover food, education and healthcare – but not financial services.\nIt says GST reform should be used to pay for a reduction in the company tax rate to 22 per cent by 2020, down from 30 per cent now, and lower personal income taxes.\nFSC director of policy Andrew Bragg said the group did not propose expanding the GST to financial services because it was too hard to do, and financial services providers \"are already part of the GST regime as they are input taxed.\"\nLast month South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill called for the federal government to makes changes to the GST that would see the tax applied to the financial services sector, a debate welcomed by NSW but dismissed by other states.\nThe FSC submission calls for corporate tax rate should be immediately reduced to 25 per cent and a medium term objective set to reduce the rate to 22 per cent by 2020, to \"better align it with the average corporate tax rate in the Asian region\".\nThe group has also called for the removal of state-based property and insurance taxes and have said states should commit to a moratorium on any further tax increases until the tax white paper is finalised, a leading financial industry group has claimed.\nBased on the the reports modelling, prepared by KPMG for the FSC, the abolition of these taxes would cut $28 billion from the budget bottom line.\nHowever, the modelling expects the GST increase and broadening would reap $42 billion in 2015-2016, including compensation for low income earners. The FSC said the leftover $14 billion should be directed towards cutting income tax rates.\n Mr Bragg said the current 30 per cent company tax rate made it \"vastly harder\" to compete with Asia and he regularly sees financial services jobs lost to Singapore, Hong Kong and now New Zealand.\"\nTax reform can be a political graveyard so leadership from corporate Australia is essential,\" Mr Bragg said.\n\"Corporate Australia knows the GST must be the centrepiece of structural tax reform. If business runs scared from GST, it will make meaningful reform impossible.\n\"The dog's breakfast cannot be cleaned up without Canberra and the states agreeing to fix the tax mix. Australia is already a relatively high-taxing nation; therefore increasing the overall tax burden is not the answer. We need to fix the tax mix.\"\nThe design of the current tax system is also slowing economic growth unnecessarily. The mix of taxation is inefficient, with too heavy a reliance on direct taxes such as corporate income tax and stamp duties to raise revenues across both the Commonwealth, State and Territory levels of government. States and Territories, under increasing fiscal pressure due to the vertical fiscal imbalance, are increasingly adopting a piecemeal approach to taxation by raising taxes in the budget cycle – often those that are the most inefficient.\nMr Bragg said: \"We believe that the primary focus of tax reform should be to fix the mix of taxation so that it improves economic growth, improves our international competitiveness, promotes investment and hard work, and raises the productivity of the country.\n\"Such a package of tax reform could be revenue neutral and still improve the medium term fiscal sustainability of budgets of all levels of government.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:52:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
