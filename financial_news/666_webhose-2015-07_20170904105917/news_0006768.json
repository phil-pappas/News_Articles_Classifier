The recent decline in a wide range of commodities, including oil, has weighed on currencies like the Canadian and Australian dollars. \n\"The decline in commodities prices recently is still to be fully priced in to the Aussie,\" said Michael Sneyd, a strategist with BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) in London. \"If it isn't then we think the Reserve Bank (of Australia) will deliver (interest rate) cuts, something which isn't priced in to the market.\" \nSneyd said money market pricing showed only a 50 percent chance of a quarter point cut in Aussie interest rates over the coming months, at a time when policymakers in New Zealand cut this week and signalled more was likely. \nHe forecast the Aussie to fall to $0.70 at the end of the year and by another 5 percent against the kiwi. \nA slightly weaker PMI survey in Germany prodded the euro 0.3 percent lower against the dollar after breaching $1.10 for the first time in more than a week on Thursday. \nThe main trend of this week, however, has been the halting of improvement for the dollar, again casting doubt on how fast the U.S. currency can rally further. \nOn the one hand, U.S. data has been fairly solid and the mood music from the Federal Reserve supportive of a rise in interest rates. But if China continues to struggle, doubts about global growth will grow. \n\"If you believe U.S. rates will go up, the dollar is the choice. But if you do not have confidence in the global economy, the yen will be your destination,\" said Koji Fukaya, president of FPG Securities in Tokyo. \nThe euro fell to $1.0942 after weaker than expected readings from German and euro zone PMI surveys but was still more than a cent above last week's 3-month low of $1.0808. \nThe dollar trod water at 123.92 yen but was 0.3 percent higher against a basket of currencies on the back of the euro move. \nA note from research house Lombard Street returned to the argument, floated by Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) earlier this year, that Europe's enormous current account surplus was increasingly being invested externally - and was likely to weaken the euro. \nLombard economist Richard Batley said at the current rate of 100 billion euros in outflows every quarter it could take 20 years for investment flows to rebalance. \"(This) is large enough to weigh durably on the single currency,\" he said.
