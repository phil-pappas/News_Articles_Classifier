The industry is booming, and $65 billion was loaded onto the cards in 2012, which was more than double compared to 2009, according to a 2014 Pew Charitable Trust Research Center report. \nUsing prepaid cards instead of credit or debit cards for daily purchases such as food trucks or parking decreases consumers’ risk of being defrauded by cyber attackers. More people are using them as the fees are declining. A recent survey conducted by Bankrate, the North Palm Beach, Fla.-based financial content company, found that 26% of 31 widely-held prepaid cards have no monthly fee and 26% will waive the monthly fee if a certain amount is loaded on the card.
