If we will not get, then the DIPP will start the process. By month end we will start doing that,” a senior official said.\nThe DIPP had circulated a set of 285 questions to all the states in this regard. The state governments had to submit the response by June 20.\nThe key objective of the DIPP’s survey is to assess the implementation of various factors enabling ease of doing business in a state.\nThe move is aimed at prompting competitiveness among states to attract investments, the official said, adding that although central government departments are taking steps to improve India’s ranking, the states too have to take measures in this direction.\nThe questionnaire includes queries on land banks available for industrial use, digitised land records at local municipality office and provision for e-filing for commercial disputes at district courts, among others.\nIndia is currently ranked 142nd among 189 nations in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business 2015 study. With the exception of two parameters (getting credit and protecting minority investors), India does not feature in the top 100 in the remaining parameters.\nThe efforts aim at bringing India into the top 50 ranks in the ease of doing business in the next three years.\nImproved ranking will help in attracting both domestic and foreign investments.\nFor Updates Check Economy News ; follow us on Facebook and Twitter\nFirst Published on July 12, 2015 12:25 pm", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress", "http://twitter.com/financialxpress"], "published": "2015-07-12T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T13:45:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
