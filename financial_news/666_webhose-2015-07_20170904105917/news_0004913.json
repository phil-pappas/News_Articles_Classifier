The gap between yields for two-year notes, which are more sensitive to monetary-policy expectations, and 30-year bonds has narrowed for seven straight days.\n“The Fed will be looking to raise rates as soon as September,” said Tony Morriss, an interest-rate strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Sydney.

The price of the 2.125 percent security due in May 2025 was at 98 1/4.\nThe Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE Index, a measure of Treasury volatility based on options trading, fell to 72 basis points on Wednesday, a level unseen since April 27.
