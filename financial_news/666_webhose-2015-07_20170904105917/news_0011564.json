proposal.\nPart of the $4.8 million upgrade to Barrack St, the City had previously pledged $321,000 in a partnership with property owners, who would pay for the remaining $1 million in works.\nThe scheme was believed to already be well under way, with information sent to local building owners and submissions for the funds already accepted.\nHowever, the proposal was deferred after a motion from City of Perth councillors Judy McEvoy, Keith Yong and Jim Adamos at Tuesday night’s council meeting.\nMr Adamos said he didn’t believe in spending that much money in one precinct and thought the funds should be spread more generally around the city.\nReece Harley, the only councillor to speak in favour of the proposal, hit out at the decision saying it was “ridiculous” to suggest the City didn’t have the $321,000 to dedicate to the investment.\n“We have a $207 million annual budget, more than a billion dollars in assets, $85 million in cash reserves and very low debt while the cash rate in Australia is the lowest it’s been for decades,” Mr Harley said.\n“This grant of $321,000 would have brought about a co-investment of $1 million from the property owners which would have benefited the whole street.”\nMr Harley also said he “couldn’t understand” why other councillors wouldn’t support the investment — which proposed the restoration of the entire block of heritage buildings from Hay St to Muarry St Mall West — given most of the money would be paid by local building owners.\n“It makes sense for us to work in a strategic way, precinct by precinct rather than diluting our grants across the whole City,” he said.\n“This money would have seen the restoration of the Salvation Army building and the taking down of the horrible metal mask which has blighted this building and our street for many years.”\nLord Mayor Lisa Scaffidi left the chambers and did not vote on the issue because of her “financial interest” as an owner of property on Barrack St.\nThe plan will now be returned to the Planning Committee.\nOriginally published as Council backs out of heritage restoration ", "external_links":
