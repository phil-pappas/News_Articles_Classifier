That is tiny relative to America's giant banking sector and $17 trillion economy.\nGreece's economy is also very small and the country buys just 0.05 percent of U.S. exports.\nSenior U.S. Treasury officials, speaking to reporters last week on condition of anonymity, said one risk was that the Greek situation would hit the economy in Europe, which is a major U.S. trading partner.\nGreece makes up about 1 percent of the European Union's economy, but a banking crisis or investor doubts on the viability of the European project might weigh on the region in unforeseen ways.\nTreasury officials have stressed to their European counterparts in recent weeks the importance of maintaining financial market stability.
