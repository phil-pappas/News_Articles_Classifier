Advertising Print This Post \nThe receivers of fictitious New Zealand finance company, Arena Capital, today moved into liquidation mode after releasing a report confirming claims that the company has been cheating investors. \nThe Christchurch-based company was set up in 2014, presenting itself to un-suspecting investors as an FX broker, trading under the name BlackfortFX. The company then proceeded to scam up to 1,100 individual clients, soliciting up to $9 million on the promise that clients would receive a profit from FX trading undertaken by Arena, through a Swiss trading entity. \nThe Swiss trading entity, Dukascopy Bank, has subsequently denied having any knowledge of or dealings with the dodgy kiwi broker. Indeed, the receivers claim to have found no evidence that any trading actually took place. \nThe liquidators, KordaMentha, have also revealed that the company’s bank account is left with just $730,000 of the $9 million. In additional to client deposits, liabilities include unpaid wages and payroll tax. \nThe liquidators are pursuing individuals to whom Arena made payments, and have seized all other assets, including a number of luxury cars. \nThe story comes after the Financial Markets Authority (FMA), the country’s financial watchdog, has removed a number of FX brokers from the Financial Services Provider Register (FSPR) following unscrupulous behaviour. Liam Mason, FMA General Counsel, described these firms as “taking advantage of New Zealand’s good reputation for being a well-regulated jurisdiction and a good place to do business.” Got a news tip?
