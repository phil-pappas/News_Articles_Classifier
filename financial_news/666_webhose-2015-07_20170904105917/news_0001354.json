Crisis-watchers can look forward to an interesting weekend.\" \nThe euro briefly rose above $1.12 for the first time in July as investors bet Athens' new proposals will be enough to placate its creditors and get the green light at a weekend EU summit. \nIt later stood at $1.1152, up from $1.1036 late on Thursday. \nChinese stocks meanwhile surged for a second day on Friday as a government rescue plan offered a respite from a month-long rout. \nThe rally also provided some support to regional markets and commodities, which had earlier this week been hammered by fears about a spillover effect beyond the mainland. \nThe benchmark Shanghai Composite Index shot up 4.54 percent, taking its two-day rise over 10 percent after the government announced additional policies to avoid a market crash. \nHowever, the Shanghai market is still down 24.9 percent from its closing peak on June 12. \nUS stocks also pushed higher on Friday, feeding off European optimism over Greece. \nIn midday trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.28 percent at 17,773.67 points. \nThe broad-based S&P 500 rose 1.17 percent to 2,075.25 points, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 1.38 percent to 4,990.37. \n- Ryanair clears way for IAG - \nOn the company front, markets digested news that Irish budget airline Ryanair has accepted International Airlines Group's bid for its near 30 percent stake in Irish rival Aer Lingus (Other OTC: AELGF - news ) , clearing the way for a takeover. \nIAG, parent of British Airways and Iberia, has made a takeover bid valuing Aer Lingus at a total of 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion). \nRyanair was left as kingmaker after the offer was accepted by the Aer Lingus board and given the green light by the Irish government, owner of a quarter of the company, in May. \nIAG shares flew 3.21 percent higher to 531 pence. \nAnother big gainer was InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) which announced the sale of its Hong Kong hotel for US$938 million (837 million euros). \nIHG's share price gained 3.07 percent to 2,686 pence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T19:47:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
