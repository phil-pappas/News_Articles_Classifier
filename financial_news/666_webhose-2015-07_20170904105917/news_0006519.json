The decline was its biggest single-day drop since February 2007, according to Bloomberg News. \nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong tanked 3.09 percent, Tokyo declined 0.95 percent and Seoul gave up 0.35 percent, but Sydney added 0.43 percent. \n\"The variety of reasons why this latest Chinese plunge has had such an effect on the markets captures the reasons why China itself is such a huge, and worrying, figure in the macro-economic landscape,\" said Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell. \n- Dollar weak before Fed - \nThe dollar meanwhile remained weak after a disappointing read on the US housing market, as investors await the Federal Reserve's next monetary policy decision due on Wednesday. \nIn foreign exchange activity in London on Monday, the European single currency rose to $1.1098 from $1.0977 late in New York on Friday. \nWhile the Fed is not expected to raise rates this week, dealers are hoping for some forward guidance, with most analysts tipping a hike in either September or December. \nWall Street stocks also opened lower Monday on the plunge in Chinese equity markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sliding 0.84 percent to 17,420.68 points after seven minutes of trading. \nThe broad-based S&P 500 fell 0.68 percent to 2,065.44, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 1.04 percent to 5,035.16. \nBack in London on Monday, British publisher Pearson (Xetra: 858266 - news ) topped the fallers after revealing Saturday (Shenzhen: 002291.SZ - news ) that it was in talks to sell its 50-percent stake in The Economist Group. \nThe announcement comes just two days after Pearson agreed to sell the Financial Times to Japanese media group Nikkei for £844 million ($1.3 billion, 1.2 billion euros), saying that it wanted to focus solely on the education publishing sector which accounts for most of its business. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) tumbled 4.4 percent to 1,165 pence in afternoon trading. \nOn the upside, household goods firm Reckitt Benckiser (Xetra: A0M1W6 - news ) rose as higher revenues and a brighter outlook eclipsed news of sliding first-half net profit. \nReckitt, which produces Durex condoms, household cleaner Cillit Bang, and Nurofen pain relief tablets, saw its share price gain 2.3 percent to 6,046 pence. \nMeanwhile, rising sales of medical equipment helped drive a 12 percent increase in second quarter net profit at Dutch electronics manufacturer Philips (Amsterdam: PHIA.AS - news ) to 272 million euros. \nPhilips shares jumped 2.9 percent to stand at 24.88 euros in afternoon trading in Amsterdam.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T17:06:37.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
