They&apos;re not the first.\nA traditional impossible trinity is a trilemma of international economics. It is a mix of three things: capital controls, a stable currency, and what the central bank does with monetary policy. It is also a theory that says it is impossible to have all three at the same time.\nWhat is not mentioned is fiscal policy: the insurmountable mountain of debt that is front and center for Greece. A key word in the proceeding is \"mix.\" Greece faces three broad options, all of which have been beaten to death in recent weeks and months: debt forgiveness (see Jeff Sachs here ); debt restructuring , which can include forgiveness on a direct or indirect net present value basis (see Paul De Grauwe here ); and the use of currency devaluation (see Mohamed El-Erian here ). The mix of it all is critical and harkens to that 4 p.m. economics course of yesteryear, when some T.A. brought Venn diagrams and Ballantine Beer to make them go down better. One sat up and paid attention.\nThe brute reality for Greece and all Europe is that they must now consider the right mix of forgiveness, re-profiling, and currency adjustment. Everyone has an opinion as to what the mix should be and how on-top-of-each-other their individual impossible trinities should lie. (Ballantine Beer comes into the discussion as the perfect Venn diagram of purity, body, and flavor, as seen in this epic commerical .)\nConsider Ecuador.\nEcuador faced its own crisis and its own impossible trinity in 1999.\nMarc Chandler, of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., understands the controversy stirred up by the idea of debt forgiveness and restructuring. He looks to Ecuador for an example of what might happen if Greece turns toward devaluation and a new drachma.\nHe suggests that the lesson of Ecuador is that the \"new\" currency (in Ecuador&apos;s case a devalued sucre) will be overwhelmed by the outside might of a better currency (in Ecuador&apos;s case, the U.S. dollar). In other words, Ecuador did not get the benefit of outside investors buying into a cheap-sucre state. Chandler says Athens can&apos;t assume that even a circa-60 percent depreciation will mean that Siemens or Nestlé will invest in a Greek fire sale to create jobs.\nLike Ecuador, outside investors will demand currency stabilization—such as a 2000 dollarization or a 2015 euro-ization.\nSource: Bloomberg This is USD-ECS on a log scale. That means curved lines are not good. The Sucre unravels to a steeper slope in 1999 that collapses to a direct peg to the U.S. dollar. Since then, Ecuador has met at least one of the Impossible Trinity: currency stabilization.\nThe devaluation of the sucre illustrated above is beyond ugly. It is impossible to engender investor confidence amid such devaluation. Ecuador chose to link to the dollar.\nSource: Bloomberg Ecuador Nominal GDP in U.S. dollars.\nThe red box shows the abrupt collapse of economic output in the period leading up to that decision. Dollarization clearly helped get Ecuador&apos;s animal spirits back on track.\nSource: Bloomberg Ecuador inflation taken log, which means slope matters. The slope was grim (yellow) and got grimmer (red). Dollarization has lowered inflation.\nThis is perhaps the most important view of Ecuador. Dollarization worked. Linking to the greenback brought a semblance of stability. Chandler is adamant that the euro will do the same for Greece only if the other two parts of the Venn diagram are met: forgiveness and restructuring.\nDiscuss over a dry-hopped Ballantine Ale.", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/imfMjI4BI5OY/v1/-1x-1.gif\\", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamil_Mahuad\\", "http://www.voxeu.org/article/greece-solvent-illiquid-policy-implications\\", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuadorian_sucre\\", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawling_peg\\", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_trinity\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/ilQfEKqeDK.Y/v1/-1x-1.gif\\", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmPWGUQnxgI\\", "http://americaontap.com/files/2009/01/Ballantine-Pale-Ale-Logo.png?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89\\", "http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/greece-debt-crisis-eurozone-by-jeffrey-d-sachs-2015-07\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iYoI57Dj2jc8/v1/-1x-1.gif\\"], "published": "2015-07-16T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T22:23:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
