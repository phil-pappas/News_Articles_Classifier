The materials index was the lone laggard, down 0.35 percent. \nThe S&P 500 currently trades at 16.8 times forward 12 months earnings, above the 10-year average of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. \nU.S. companies are expected to post their worst sales decline in nearly six years in the second quarter, while profit is expected to have fallen 2.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters estimates. But expectations are low. \n\"What this season confirms is that we are in a modest growth and modest inflation environment,\" said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis. \nNetflix surged 17.61 percent to a record high of $115.42 a day after reporting strong subscribers numbers. \nCitigroup (NYSE: C - news ) reported its highest quarterly profit in eight years and its shares rose as much as 3.9 percent to a six-and-a-half year high of $58.64. \nEBay (Xetra: 916529 - news ) rose 5.2 percent to a record high of $66.71 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit and announcing the sale of its enterprise business. \nBut Goldman fell 1.2 percent after posting its smallest quarterly profit in nearly four years, while UnitedHealth fell 0.5 percent after missing analysts' cost estimates. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,098 to 956. On the Nasdaq, 1,833 issues rose and 929 fell. \nThe S&P 500 was posting 43 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows; the Nasdaq was recording 169 new highs and 55 new lows.
