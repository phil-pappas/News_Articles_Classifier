This new office is expected to be a regional hub for our business operations and project implementation. It will also be a solution showcase for customers as we widen our business footprint in the Africa region,\" Wong said. \nThe firm works with governments from across the world, to develop systems to offer services to government and businesses. \nIn Rwanda, the firm partnered with Rwanda Online Platform Limited, the company developing an electronic governance platform, to build Irembo, a national initiative expected to 'migrate' a number government services to citizens and business from manual to online. \nThe platform was launched last week and offers services such as online trade licence. \nClement Uwajeneza, the Rwanda Online Platform chief executive, said the professionals created through the programme will be of great value to the platform's sustainability and growth. \n\"They will be great candidates for our Third Party Developers programme that will allow any skilled developer to create e-Governance services and connect them to our platform,\" Uwajeneza said. \nThe initial intake of graduates will be recruited from the University of Rwanda and the Adventist University of East and Central Africa with more varsities to be considered as the programme matures.
