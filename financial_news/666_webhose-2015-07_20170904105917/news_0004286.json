EurActiv Greece reports.\nDuring the tough negotiations at the last EU summit (12 July) on Greece’s EU future, Alexis Tsipras was finally forced to abandon his anti-austerity rhetoric and accept a cash-for-reforms deal which has to get through the Greek parliament today (15 July).\nThe adoption of painful reforms has triggered strong reactions within Syriza, with its radical left faction threatens to vote against it and put into question coalition government’s stability.\n>>Read: Tsipras faces Syriza revolt\n‘Bad day for Europe’\nIn an interview with Greece's state TV broadcaster ERT, Tsipras spoke at length about the reasons he finally backed down.\n“Sunday’s EU summit was a bad day for Europe. It was a defeat for Europe,” he stressed.\nThe premier also said that the agreement was the result of strong pressure on a country and on a people who had a different opinion, emphasising that the attitude of the EU partners did not honour the traditions of a democratic Europe.\nTsipras admitted, though, that he has had illusions that \"this Europe can be defeated” and that he was proved wrong that \"the power of a people can defeat the power of the banks\".\nFresh polls published late yesterday by Kapa Research found that 72% of Greeks surveyed thought the Brussels deal was necessary. The shift of mood after 5 July, when over 61% of Greeks voted against the creditors’ proposals, is difficult to explain, but certainly the fear that the banks would remain closed influenced public opinion.\nTsipras said the Brussels deal meant ordinary Greeks' savings were safe, but added that the reopening of the banks - which have been closed for over a week - depended on the finalising of the deal, which could take a month. Not only the Greek parliament, but also the Bundestag, and some other eurozone legislatures will have to ratify the agreement.\nThe European Central Bank has been keeping Greek banks afloat with emergency liquidity, but it could be forced to cut off that aid if Greece misses a huge debt repayment due on Monday (20 July).\nThe drachma plan\nReferring to scenario of returning to the drachma, Tsipras said this was not Syriza's objective.\n“This is not a leftist choice,” he said.\nHe also stressed that Greece had never had alternative funding opportunities outside of Europe.\n“The country does not have foreign exchange reserves for a national currency. Wherever I went these 5 months, in Russia, in the US I talked with President Obama, with the Chinese premier: no one told me 'Go ahead with this option and we will help you',\" he stated.\nIn the meantime, radical members of Syriza met yesterday (14 July) at a hotel in Athens, in an effort to adopt a joint approach to today’s crucial parliament vote.\nPanagiotis Lafazanis, the energy minister who also leads Syriza's radical faction, spoke again in favour of returning to the drachma.\n“Our roadmap is to go to a national currency. This is what we should have already done, or we can do now,\" he said.\n“We can get €22 billion from the Bank of Greece to pay wages and pensions, and in the meantime we can use the time to issue our own currency,\" he added.\nIt remains unclear how such a huge amount could be made available. Media report Greek banks have less than one billion euros left in their coffers.\nCostas Lapavitsas, another influential radical left MP, allegedly said that he had a plan to return to the drachma, which he had already presented to the Greek premier.\nAccording to press reports in Athens, far-left Syriza MPs will either abstain or vote against the EU deal in tonight’s parliament vote. They also made it clear that no one was intending to resign “as they don’t wish the breakup of Syriza”.\nThe day after\nThe EU deal will most probably pass through the Greek parliament with the support of the majority of opposition parties.\nBut the day after the crucial vote on the EU deal in the parliament looks quite uncertain for Greek politics.\nThe centre-right New Democracy (EPP), the centrist Potami (S&D) and the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok-S&D) have announced they would vote in favour.\nSupportive of the EU agreement is Syriza's junior coalition partner, the Independent Greeks party, despite its initial hesitation.\nAnalysts estimate that Syriza may have 30 to 40 defections from its radical faction.\nTaking into account that radical MPs are not intending to resign, and that it’s not in Tsipras’ “culture to delete party members”, Syriza’s unity looks uncertain.\n“I will do whatever is needed to keep the unity of my party,\" Tsipras said.\nTsipras and Panos Kammenos, the leader of Independent Greeks, have also ruled out the scenario of a “special purpose” government, with the participation of unelected and widely accepted people.\nOpposition parties have said that they would be more comfortable with such a government, but made it clear they would not participate in one.\nCivil servants are set to stage a 24-hour strike today, the first such action since Tsipras took power in January.\nEurActiv Greece understands that the opposition parties want to distance themselves from the tough EU deal and let Tsipras assume political responsibility for it.\nA possible scenario is that Tsipras would pass the deal through the parliament, and then proceed to a reshuffle of the government, replacing radical ministers.\nA possible breakup of Syriza during this summer will probably lead to national elections in September and bring Tsipras’s camp closer to S&D.\nForming a pro-EU government with the participation of all Greek left-wing parties has always been a top objective for the European Socialists.\nSyriza has 149 seats out of 300 in the Greek parliament, while its junior coalition partner, the Independent Greeks, 13. The main opposition center-right New Democracy has 76 MPs, centrist (left leaning) Potami and far-right Golden Dawn 17, the Communists (KKE) 15 and the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) 13.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:27:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
