The investors, who need at least 25 percent of a series of notes in order to demand their money right away in a process known as acceleration, are close to reaching that level for one of the bonds, the people said.\nOwl Creek first sought to form the group last year after starting its Argentina Recovery Fund in September. The effort initially gained little traction on concern it would protract a legal battle and derail chances of a quick settlement between Argentina and creditors from its 2001 default led by Elliott Management, whose lawsuit has blocked payments on restructured bonds since June 2014.\nPatrick Clifford, a spokesman for New York-based Owl Creek at Abernathy Macgregor Group, declined to comment on acceleration efforts. Dave Petrou, a spokesman for Jones Day, didn’t return an e-mail and phone call seeking comment. A press official for Argentina’s economy ministry declined to comment.\nIn an August presentation for its Argentina-focused fund, Owl Creek said accelerating the par bonds, which mature in 2038 and are the lowest-priced of the restructured bonds, could provide investors with a windfall profit in a subsequent bond swap. The bonds traded at 53.88 cents on the dollar on July 2.\nThe Argentina Recovery Fund helped lead Owl Creek’s gains through the first quarter of 2015 with an 8.6 percent return over the period, people familiar with the matter said in April. Its main Owl Creek Overseas Fund rose 3.7 percent through March.\nOwl Creek opened a second Argentina Recovery Fund in December and a third in June, according to U.S. regulatory filings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T23:02:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
