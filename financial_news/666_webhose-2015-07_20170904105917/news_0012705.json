Reuters reported in April that the company would explore both an outright sale and an IPO that could value it at as much as $10 billion, including debt. \nSunGard, which has more than 15,000 customers, mainly provides trading and investment management software to financial firms. \nWayne, Pennsylvania-based SunGard was acquired for $11.4 billion in 2005 by Silver Lake Partners LP, TPG Capital LP, Bain Capital LLC, Blackstone Group LP, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners LP, KKR & Co LP and Providence Equity Partners Inc. \nSunGard is the product of one of the largest leveraged buyouts that preceded the 2008 financial crisis. It is now one of the longest-held investments in private equity history. \nSunGard reported a 1.7 percent rise in revenue to $2.8 billion for the year ended Dec. 31. The company posted a net loss of $222 million, compared with a profit of $62 million a year earlier. \nBased in Jacksonville, Florida, Fidelity National Information Services is a provider of banking and payments technology, consulting and outsourcing solutions. It serves more than 14,000 institutions in over 130 countries. \nBloomberg News earlier on Thursday reported that Fidelity National Information was in exclusive talks to acquire SunGard, sending Fildelity shares up 5 percent. \n(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by Andrew Hay) Private Equity & Hedge Funds", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:39:02.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
