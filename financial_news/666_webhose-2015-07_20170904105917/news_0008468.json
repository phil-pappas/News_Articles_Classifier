Defense revenue fell 3 percent, and profit margins dipped less than some analysts had feared, as Pentagon spending remains under pressure.\nDeferred costs on Boeing's 787 program rose by another $790 million, to $27.7 billion, but analysts said that rise was widely expected. The 787 program still loses money on each plane, which has focused investors' attention on cash flow. Boeing expects the plane to be cash flow positive in 2015.\nThe Chicago-based company announced a charge of 77 cents per share related to the tanker program last week. As a result, it cut its full year earnings forecast on Wednesday by 50 cents a share, to $7.70 to $7.90 a share, less than the charge, suggesting it can make up for the tanker costs in other areas.\n\"The tanker charge is still a drag to both earnings and cash this year, and presents risk going forward,\" RBC analyst Robert Stallard wrote in a note.\nCore earnings, which exclude pension and other costs, fell to $1.62 per share from $2.42. But that exceeded analysts' average estimate of $1.37 a share, which included the tanker charge, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe tanker charge is the second Boeing has taken on the troubled project, bringing the total after-tax charges to just over $800 million.
