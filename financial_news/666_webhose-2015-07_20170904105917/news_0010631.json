So, given the substantial price falls, can we now find decent value in the sector? For the first time since the global financial crisis, my response would be a cautionary \"yes\".\nThe entire hybrid space has cheapened up significantly in recent months on the back of a range of factors, including a discounted $5.5 billion equity issue by National Australia Bank; the sale of several wholesale over-the-counter hybrids offering superior margins to their ASX-listed counterparts; risk aversion induced by the never-ending Greek dramas; and the fact that hybrids were extremely expensive in the first place.\nThe current standout among the liquid ASX-listed hybrids is Commonwealth Bank of Australia's $3 billion super-dud, \"Perls VII\" (CBAPD), which has slugged mum and dad investors in the October 2014 issue with an astonishing 9.5 per cent capital loss. That compares with the 11.7 per cent capital gain – excluding dividends – for those who bought CBA's ordinary shares then. To put this in context, it will take first-up Perls VII subscribers almost two years' worth of income on the security to make up for losses.\nFolks who invested in the October 2014 listing accepted a (discretionary) margin of only 2.8 per cent above the bank bill rate, which in today's terms translates to an income return of about 4.95 per cent. Our concern was that this was miles below the dividend yield on CBA's lower-ranking ordinary shares, which is now 7.7 per cent.\nHigher margins The pricing climate for Perls VII is radically different today, with investors demanding a much higher trading margin of 4.5 per cent above the bank bill rate (or 170 basis points more than the October 2014 margin). Given the current 2.2 per cent bank bill rate, which is a shade above the Reserve Bank's cash rate, Perls VII is offering a total income return of about 6.7 per cent assuming no further capital losses. That's within 100 basis points of CBA's grossed-up dividend yield and seems like a relatively attractive entry point of more than three times the cash rate.\nWhile CBA's shares come with the benefits of voting rights and an uncapped claim on future profits, the preferred equity in the form of Perls VII will dilute the shares in the event the hybrid is ever converted into equity.\nThis happens automatically if CBA's common equity tier-one capital falls below 5.125 per cent, which would be possible in a deep recession or if the banking regulator determines CBA needs the extra capital to remain viable.\n It is reasonable, therefore, to think that the returns required on the hybrid might be lower than the equity in a base case, although this is not always so.\nMost of the other listed major bank hybrids are paying margins of 4.1 per cent above the bank bill rate versus Perls VII's 4.5 per cent, which implies expected income of roughly 6.3 per cent compared with Perls VII's 6.7 per cent. (There are also some maturity differences investors should interrogate.)\nTwo other opportunities worth looking into are the less liquid Challenger and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank hybrids, which offer margins of 4.5 per cent and 4.6 per cent, respectively, above bank bills.\nInterestingly, these are above or near the dividend yield on Challenger and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank's underlying shares (see table), which proves the point that dividend yields are necessarily the upper bound for hybrid margins.\nSince the hybrids are legally considered equity (although they rank above shares) and expose you to many downside risks (Perls VII's predecessor, Perls VIII, fell 35 per cent during the GFC), you need to constantly question why you are not accepting the superior returns, slightly higher risks, simplicity and voting rights available on the ordinary shares.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T09:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T06:55:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
