Bloomberg by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell National Australia Bank is believed to have identified two windows to spin-off the $5 billion Clydesdale Bank, in an effort to meet its own 2015 year-end deadline.\nStreet Talk understands the first is straight after the upcoming reporting, which would coincide with Australian investors re-surfacing from a barrage of company results and UK fund managers returning from their annual summer break.\nThe second is in early November, following the bank's full-year results announcement scheduled for October 28.\nBy all accounts, NAB and its team - including a cohort of bankers in London and Melbourne - are trying to make sure the deal is at least ready to go late next month, should the necessary regulatory approvals be in place.\nNAB shareholders are expected to receive 70 to 80 per cent of the company at the demerger, while lead managers Macquarie Capital, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan set about raising the remaining 20 to 30 per cent via an initial public offering. Clydesdale will be listed in London with a secondary listing on the ASX.\nSome fundies were a bit miffed when NAB chose to roadshow Clydesdale in the UK this month, catching the investors before the six-week summer break, and offered only an analyst call for Australians.\nHowever, NAB seems satisfied that locals know enough about Clydesdale - given the burden it has been on the parent stock in recent years - to ensure the only time local fundies will need to meet Clydesdale is once the formal demerger paperwork is released.\nIt will be interesting to see the make-up of Clydesdale's register. While UK investors are the natural owners given their proximity to the underlying business, AMP's Henderson Group showed Aussies don't always want to part with their British spin-offs. Australians still account for up to 60 per cent of Henderson's register some 11Â½-years after AMP set it free.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T23:16:26.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
