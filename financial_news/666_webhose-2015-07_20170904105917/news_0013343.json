Reuters by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell HSBC has signalled it is serious about claiming a piece of the local advisory market, hiring a former UBS banker and creating a new role as head of mergers and acquisitions in Australia.\nEx-UBS banker Scott Couzner has been appointed as HSBC's head of M&A in Australia, reporting regionally to Asia Pacific M&A boss Jason Rynbeck and locally to head of capital financing Sean Henderson.\nCouzner was most recently head of M&A for Southeast Asia at UBS.\nIt's understood the hire comes as HSBC seeks to take a bigger piece of the growing local advisory pie.\nAustralia-targeted M&A is up by 10 per cent over the past 12 months to $US56.8 billion, with inbound activity accounting for 46 per cent of the total.\nHSBC sees an opportunity in the Australian market to utilise its global presence, while having more troops on the ground locally will also help service existing clients\nHSBC has already made some headway this year, jagging a buy-side role on the NSW government's $9 billion TransGrid privatisation.\nHSBC has close links with China's State Grid and is advising the state-owned utility's consortium on TransGrid, along with Macquarie Capital. State Grid has teamed up with Macquarie Group's Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets.\n Elsewhere, short positions in Bellamy's Australia have been building in the lead up to the organic food and beverage company's full-year result. Around $81 million worth of stock will be released from escrow three days after the numbers are handed down.\nBellamy's has been a star performer, surging by close to 400 per cent since its July initial public offering, and driving strong returns for initial investors including AMP Capital, Ellerston Capital and Regal Funds Management.\nBut the number of shares short-sold has grown to 2.3 million, as hedge funds anticipate a sell-down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:14:31.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
