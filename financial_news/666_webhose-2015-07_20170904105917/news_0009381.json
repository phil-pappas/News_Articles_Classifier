For us to succeed, we will be looking up to countries such as the US with more experience to deal with it,\" he said. \nKenyan students and those doing business in the US will see their visa period extended from the current one year to five years. \nMr Obama promised that more goodies would be on the way once he leaves White House, saying the demands of the office could only allow him to do so much. \n\"I will not stop being interested in Africa afterwards,\" he said. \nAcknowledging the role the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEFFA) had played in helping prolong lives of thousands of HIV infected patients, Mr Obama said he had given the kitty a boost by increasing financial allocation to bring more patients on board and eliminate infections among the adolescent as a step towards eradicating it. \nKENYAN ROOTS \nThe President, who traces his roots to Kenya, said his government was working on a programme to hasten the launch of direct flights between Kenya and the US \"very soon\". \nBut he said there were issues that needed to be sorted out before this could become a reality. \n\"I do not want to give a definite time because when we delay you will say I lied. There are certain protocol issues that must be followed on this,\" he said to the gathering of top government officials from both countries and journalists. \nThe development would see more direct foreign investment to Kenya, which is the economic hub of the East African region, a fact acknowledged by Mr Obama himself yesterday. \nThe US government would also pump in more money through the Power Africa Project, an initiative that seeks to connect more households with electricity, particularly those far from the national grid. \nHe also said his government had prohibited the sale of ivory in the US, a statement that would go a long way in helping anti-poaching campaign. \nAware that every move he made affecting Kenya was being closely watched by his opponents back home, the leader of the world's super power said he did not want to be seen as playing favourite to Kenya, explaining why it had taken him six years to come to his father's birth place. \n\"Occasional disagreements is not a rapture of friendship,\" Mr Obama said in response to a question on the Kenya \"look East\" policy. This perception arose from the strained relationship between the two countries over the ICC cases that faced President Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto. \nMr Kenyatta's case has since been dropped while Mr Ruto's awaits crucial decisions. \nDEAL WITH CORRUPTION \nMr Obama reiterated the commitment of his country to help Mr Kenyatta deal with corruption in government, offering technical support towards the same. \nA ceremonial 21 gun salute had earlier been accorded Mr Obama, who is referred to as President of the free world. \nHe also promised to visit his father's birth place in Kogelo, Siaya County, and engage in philanthropic work in the future, explaining that the complex nature of his office had restricted him from doing so now. \nBut Mr Obama also urged Mr Kenyatta to nurture press freedom, pointing out that it was crucial in enhancing democracy. \n\"A free press makes a nation stronger and leaders more accountable,\" he said. \nBeneath the show of solidarity, he also signalled that the war on corruption must not only be fought but seen to be won. \nPresident Obama and his host did not, however, agree on all subjects with discussion about gay rights being the point of departure. Mr Kenyatta insisted that the subject was inconsistent with the African culture and it was thus imprudent to force it on Kenyans. He also reiterated that the subject was not on top of Kenyans minds at the moment. \nDeputy President William Ruto and all members of the Kenyan Cabinet were present at the function. \nThe US President, who is in the country for a three-day visit, was scheduled to attend a state banquet in his honour last evening. \nPresident Obama arrived at State House shortly after 2pm and received a 21 gun salute after which he inspected a guard of honour mounted by a detachment of the Kenya Air Force. Earlier in the afternoon, he had visited the memorial park for the 1998 US Embassy bombing where he laid a wreath in honour of those who died and paid tribute to survivors. \nSpeaking after their bilateral meetings, the two presidents expressed confidence in the direction the Kenya-US partnership was headed. Kenya \nUS President Barack Obama has challenged Kenya to empower women and girls to achieve its development dream faster. see more » Copyright © 2015 The Nation. All rights reserved.
