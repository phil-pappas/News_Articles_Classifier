The applause went on for a long time after she had given a very energetic and enthusiastic presentation,\" he said.\nSome lawmakers remain deeply sceptical.\n\"This agreement increases the already enormous liability risk of European taxpayers,\" CDU lawmaker Wolfgang Bosbach, who has opposed previous Greek bailouts, told Focus Online.\nAn idea floated by Schaeuble's ministry for Greece to take a \"time-out\" from the euro zone gained traction with some conservatives at the weekend, though it has since been dropped.\nIn February, German lawmakers approved an extension of Greece's second bailout but a record number of conservative dissenters underscored the scepticism in Berlin about whether Athens can be trusted to deliver reforms.\nOf 32 \"no\" votes, 29 came from Merkel's CDU and their sister party, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU). Moreover, 109 conservatives signed statements saying they had voted for the extension but with reservations.\nThe Social Democrats (SPD), junior partner in Merkel's coalition, quickly supported the latest Greece deal.\nPeter Matuschek of polling institute Forsa expected the German parliament to vote in favour of the agreement.\n\"Of course there will be the usual suspects in the conservative bloc who already voted against Greek bailouts in the past,\" he said. \"But all in all, Merkel's majority in the Bundestag is so huge that it will be enough.\"\n(Writing by Paul Carrel ; Editing by Giles Elgood )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T16:19:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
