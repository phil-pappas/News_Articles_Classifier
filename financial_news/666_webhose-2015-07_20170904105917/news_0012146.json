The Council itself could not immediately be reached for comment. \nThe court at the same time declined to remove two other companies, Petropars Iran Co and Petropars Oilfields Services Co, from the list because of the larger stakes those entities have in parent group NIOC. \nWhile the decision to remove the two groups was not related to the recent nuclear agreement, a lawyer for the two said she was hopeful the warming relations between Iran and the west would ensure her clients stay off the list of sanctioned companies. \n\"Because this is the first annulment that happened after the Iran agreement ... we are hoping that the council has not appealed in good faith,\" said Pavani Reddy, managing partner of law firm Zaiwalla and Co Solicitors, adding that applying new charges against them would be \"a waste of time and resources\". \nEuropean courts in the past nullified sanctions against the National Iranian Tanker Co (NITC), Iran's biggest tanker firm, only to put it back on the list later.
