Sasha Woolley by Shaun Drummond As two more major banks turned off the home loan tap to investors on Friday, the share price of mortgage lender and loan servicer Pepper Group rocketed 27 per cent above the $2.60 offer price in its $471 million float.\nThe stock first traded at $3.05 after debuting at 11am and closed the session at $3.30. Priced at 10 times forecast 2015 net profit, down from the original offer of 12 times, analysts said its cheap price was the chief reason for the spike.\nBut joint chief executives Patrick Tuttle and Mike Culhane recently noted the company was protected from a clampdown on limit investor loan growth by the regulator because only 15 per cent of Pepper's $4 billion loan book is to investors, compared to up to 45 per cent at the big four. The regulator is also yet to turn its attention to Pepper's investor growth.\nThe pair were unavailable to speak on Friday, but in a prepared statement said they were \"thrilled with the shareholder support for our business\".\n\"We are now focused on delivering our growth strategy through further investment in our customer offering, our people, and targeting new global opportunities in both consumer lending and loan servicing.\"\nBrett McKeon – the managing director of AFG, one of the country's biggest mortgage aggregators with more than 30 lenders offered via its broker platform – said most non-bank lenders, including Pepper, have not made any move to reduce their exposure to investment loans and should see growth in applications from investors that have been turned away by banks.\nHis comments on Friday coincided with Westpac and Suncorp banks becoming the latest to raise interest rates on both new and existing loans to investors.\n\"Investor lending inflows have reduced, but it is still at the long-term average of about 37 per cent of all mortgages,\" he said. \"There is a definite opportunity for second tier lenders to get more business. There is probably head room with a lot of lenders to take some extra volume, but it would then only be a matter of time before they would get rather full and be looking to reprice.\"\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

View full Quote: Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements The company raised $144.5 million from cornerstone investors – including Perpetual, Regal Funds Management, Smallco and Tribeca Investment Partners – prior to its float of 181.1 million shares on Friday, implying an initial market capitalisation of $471 million.\nAround $138 million will be used to pay off debt and the costs of the initial public offering. The remaining $6.1 million will be used to fund an employee incentive scheme.\nThe board and management team's shareholding before the float was 78.5 per cent, with non-executive director Seumas Dawes owning 50 per cent. None have sold any shares, but collectively they have been diluted to 45 per cent.\nHalf of Pepper Group's income – forecast to reach $304 million in 2015, up from $234.9 million in 2014 – comes from lending, primarily to home buyers. The other half comes from loan servicing fees in several countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Ireland, Spain, South Korea and China.\nThe company has forecast pro forma calendar year 2015 net profit after tax of $43.5 million, up from $34.2 million in 2014.\nPepper's float survived a turbulent global market hit by fears Greece would default on its debts and leave the European Union and crashes in Chinese stock markets. At least six IPOs were abandoned while Pepper was seeking investors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T10:08:14.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
