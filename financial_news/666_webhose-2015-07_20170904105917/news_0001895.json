There will be no restrictions on foreign investors.\n\"After the finance minister signed the relevant decree earlier today, the Athens Stock Exchange board ... decided to reopen the markets of Athens Stock exchange on Monday, August 3,\" the spokeswoman said.\nTraders and exchange officials had hoped the exchange would be able to reopen this week after the European Central Bank gave Greece the green light to allow normal operations by foreign investors, with some limits for local investors.\nUnder the ECB-approved plan, local investors would be allowed to buy shares with existing cash holdings, but not to withdraw money from their Greek bank accounts to buy shares.\nSome market participants had warned that unlimited trading for domestic investors would have posed a serious risk for lenders by accelerating capital outflows.\nTechnical glitches at local banks, which will be required to enforce the trading restrictions, had further complicated the exchange's reopening and many securities traders have taken an early summer holiday during the closure.\nTrading in all stocks including banking shares will be allowed and volatility limits will be lowered, the bourse spokeswoman said. Volatility limits on the Greek bourse were previously at plus or minus 30 percent.
