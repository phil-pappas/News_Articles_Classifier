In a rather ruthless and violent approach, the demonstrators said they on several occasions made known their dissatisfaction to Health Authorities over the payment of their Hazard Benefits, but nothing was done to the effect. \nTheir actions created pandemonium on the premises of the Ministry and its environ, and later led to the disruption of normal working activities. Staff of the Ministry were held hostage for several hours; a situation that prompted the intervention of the Minister of Justice through the Liberia National Police (LNP). The healthcare workers, amongst other things, slammed the Ministry for not responding to the issue of their Risk benefits payment and claimed that they have used all available means to have their plight addressed but their appeal fell on deaf ears. In an angry tone, the spokesman of the group lamented that they will continue the protest until their demand is met. Related Topics Liberia: Dr. Sawyer Commended \nIn response to their demand, MOH Deputy Incident Manager, Madam Miatta Gbanyan, in a brief chat with journalists, provided vivid information surrounding the payment scheme of Hazard Benefits and further unveiled plans by the Incident Management Team to conclude the payment of the aggrieved Healthcare workers' benefits by July 31, 2015. She revealed that significant numbers of them across the Country have already received their Hazard Benefits Payment and that her team and the Ministry are currently working on plans to make the final payments for the months of April and May 2015. \nMadam Gbanyan further explained that during the inception of the EVD in Lofa and Montserrado Counties, Healthcare workers were placed in three categories to obtain maximum efficiency and effectiveness in providing services to contain the virus. The first category of Healthcare workers named is the Routine Healthcare Workers which comprised Hospitals, Health Centers, and Clinics, the second category is the Ebola Emergency Treatment Units (ETU) and the third is the Response Teams which include contact tracers, burial teams, supervisors and monitors. \nThe MOH's Official averred that a number of Medical Doctors and Support Staffs with initial benefits ranging from US$3000.00 to US$250.00 were paid before the virus could intensify. This initial payment plan could not be continued due to budgetary constraints and the lack of adequate donors' funding. \nMadam Gbanyan further told news men that during the worst days of the EVD, the World Bank aided Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone by giving direct funding through the EERP to contain the virus. She disclosed that said contribution led to the payment and contracting of more Healthcare workers to provide services at various Health Centers across the Country. \nThe Deputy Incident Manager further revealed that the number of Health Care Workers paid to date through the World Bank- Ebola Emergency Response Program and the African Development Bank funded project, which lasted from September 2014 to June 2015, is about 12,449 persons on average. Of this number, 1108 Healthcare workers were paid on monthly basis at the ETUs from September to December 2014 due to the increase in Ebola cases, while 384 workers were paid from January to April 2015 as a result of reduction in Ebola cases. \nSimilarly, 8551 Routine Healthcare Workers were also paid monthly beginning September 2014. She also pointed out that 1743 response teams were adequately settled from January to March 2015, while 1048 contact tracers, supervisors, and monitors were also paid according to the terms of their contracts. Madam Gbanyan also divulged that they have started making payments of death benefits to 79 families of deceased Health care workers upon submitting death certificates and letter of administration to authenticate the legitimacy of their claims. Others were paid through partners managing ETUs and supporting Response teams, she maintained. \nAs for those who claim to have been left out, Madam Gbanyan described their situation as appalling and quickly attributed it to technical errors in either bank account numbers provided, non-availability of banking institutions in hard-to-reach areas, or ghost names that are not on records maintained by the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP). She also blamed the situation on replaced names that were in conflict with the actual persons' names. \nWhile responding to the issue of not paying risk benefits as claimed by the workers, Madam Gbanyan clarified that the workers have failed to understand that Hazard Benefits is the same as Risk Benefits which have already been paid to a number of them who worked with NGOs like the MSF. The Health Official also identified the failure of Healthcare workers to present a comprehensive listing of those who claimed to have been denied payment as a major challenge to the Incident Management Team in finding lasting solution. \nIn her closing remarks, she recommended that the workers submit a complete listing of all affected persons for proper scrutiny by the MOH and MFDP or the relevant banking institutions in order to remedy the situation. \nMeanwhile, some eyewitnesses at the scene of the strike actions expressed their dissatisfaction over the way the workers were proceeding with their actions and opined that such move was politically motivated, especially when Ebola has just resurfaced in the Country. Some considered their actions as being in direct consonance with their earlier call for Minister Bernice Dahn to be denied confirmation, which is tantamount to sabotage. Such action is unhealthy for the building of a sound and resilient healthcare delivery system and must be curtailed.
