We don't blame it on President Mugabe; we blame it on capital... [It is] because they disagree with him politically, they use their economic muscle to punish the people of Zimbabwe.\" \nIn response, Chihwayi said it was baffling for Malema to defend Mugabe, when he has presided over the country's affairs for the past 35 years. \n\"Malema is entitled to his opinions, but when he makes such inflammatory statements over a situation he does not have a full grasp of, it crosses the line. \n\"It baffles the mind why he would absolve President Mugabe of all blame of Zimbabwe's problems when he and his Zanu PF party have presided over the suffering of Zimbabweans through the mismanagement of the economy, corruption, violence and genocide over the past 34 years. \n\"The country has been reduced to a vending economy due to catastrophic unemployment while millions of Zimbabweans have fled the difficult conditions to other countries, South Africa included, under President Mugabe's watch,\" he said. \nMalema has cozied up to Mugabe since his days in the ANC before his unceremonious exit to form his own political outfit, which has caused a lot of commotion in that country's Parliament. \nThe firebrand youthful leader was also quoted saying Mugabe was the only African leader who continued to stand up against the West and understood what it meant to be a real African. \nChihwayi continued: \"What is so troubling and inexplicable about Malema's remarks is that he makes it clear that democratic practices should only be applicable to South Africa and not any other African country. \n\"For him to say any other African leader with the exception of South Africa can rule for more than two terms is foolish and should not be coming from of a person who aspires to be a President of a country one day. \n\"As MDC we find it quite disturbing that Malema finds it palatable to condemn the rest of Africa to the whims of dictators while fighting against the same in his own country. His statements betray his selfishness, hypocrisy and a blatant disregard for the welfare of the rest of Africa.\" \nChihwayi said the whole continent should push for the democratisation of the continent and not certain countries. \n\"As MDC we believe that as a continent, the day we begin classifying some countries as more worthy than others is the day we abandon our commitment for a just, prosperous and democratic Africa,\" he said.
