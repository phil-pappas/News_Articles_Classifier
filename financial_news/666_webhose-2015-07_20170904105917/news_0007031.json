It estimated 860 crore passengers to travel by trains.\nHowever, if the current trend is not reversed, it would be difficult to meet the target, said the official.\nOn the freight side, the growth is not very encouraging either.\nPrabhu had announced in the Budget that freight traffic would grow from 1,101 MT in 2014-15 to 1,186 MT in 2015-16, an increase of 85 MT.\nIt was expected that the additional 85 MT would come from increased loading of coal, iron ore, cement and foodgrains.\nHowever, barring coal, the loading of iron ore, cement and foodgrains was negative as compared to the last year.\nFor Updates Check Economy News ; follow us on Facebook and Twitter\nFirst Published on July 12, 2015 11:42 am", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress", "http://twitter.com/financialxpress"], "published": "2015-07-12T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T23:59:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
