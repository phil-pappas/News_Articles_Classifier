It added he UK market could be heading towards the market in the US, where six in 10 of all short-term loans are from illegal lenders, or loan sharks. \nIt comes after a difficult year for payday lenders. From January 2, they became subject to tough curbs on interest rates, penalty fees and overall cost. Market regulator the Financial Conduct Authority forced all lenders to apply for licences this year and all approved providers must pay an annual levy. \nThe barriers were designed to make loans fairer for customers. A one-month loan of £100 now costs a borrower a maximum of £24 if they pay it back on time. Most lenders last year charged around £30, and did not compete particularly fiercely on price. \nControversial lender Wonga revealed in April it made a pre-tax loss of £37.3m last year, compared to a profit of £39.7m in 2013, following tougher rules from regulators as well as a hefty fine for customer mismanagement . \nThe Money Shop, which had more than 500 branches at its peak, closed 240 stores this year after the crackdown on payday lenders \nThe recession has changed the way families manage their finances, the CFA said. Consumers are more reluctant to take on long-term debt as the UK economic recovery remains muted, and are instead turning to short-term alternatives for a “financial lifeline”. \nRising house prices, combined with increasing utility bills and travel costs, are all taking their toll on household finances, the CFA’s Credit 2.0 report added. Rail fares have risen by 23pc in the past two decades while house prices have also rapidly outstripped inflation. It now takes 22 years for a first-time buyer on an average salary to save up for a deposit on a house. \nAlmost two thirds of people taking out short term loans are men and the average age of all customers is 35. According to the FCA, 8.1m loans were granted last year, against 8.2m in 2012. The value of the loans also fell from £2,151m to £2,145m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T08:30:01.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
