Alex Ellinghausen / Fairfax Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan South Australian premier Jay Weatherill has said he would give \"serious consideration\" to NSW premier Mike Baird's support for a 15 per cent GST increase, if the extra revenue is spent on health.\nMr Weatherill has previously supported extending GST to financial services and told the Financial Review on Monday that he would consider a GST hike if there was compensation.\nAsked about whether he will support Mr Baird 15 per cent stance on Tuesday morning he told the ABC \"I'll give that serious consideration\".\n\"Mike Baird's done some work and come to a conclusion which we agree with, and that is the size of the problem is even bigger than that,\" he said referring to the health and education funding gaps states and territories face.\nBusiness Council president Catherine Livingstone says bracket creep, negative gearing and a lower company tax rate should be on the table. Cole Bennetts He said he was motivated by pragmatism and fears of the medicare system would be undermined by spending cuts or any move to user-pays healthcare.\n\"I don't have the luxury of opposing for the sake of it, I have a state to run, I have people who actually need their healthcare services...We have a present government we have to deal with,\" he said.\nHe said the country should grab the opportunity of a conservative leader calling for raising revenue to pay for health, and accused Treasurer Joe Hockey of attempting to undermine consensus.\n\"Every time it looks like we are heading towards a constructive discussion, Joe Hockey bobs up to try and to undermine the ability to reach an agreement,\" he said.\n Business pushes for tax cuts, wider reform While state and territory leaders said Wednesday's summit was about finding health and education funding gap solutions, the Australian Industry Group, ACOSS and the Business Council said the hoped the retreat would \"approach the task of tax reform\".\nThe Australian Industry Group said a simple hike in the GST would be \"a comprehensive cop out\" and maintained that any GST increase should feed state and territory tax cuts.\n\"Tomorrow's critical leaders' retreat should view tax reform not as a way to extract more tax revenue,\" Chief Executive of the AI Group head, Innes Willox, saying leaders should \"face up to the challenges of reforming taxation\".\nThe AiGroup says the extra revenue raised by the GST should be used to dump \"harmful\" state taxes such as on insurance premiums, motor vehicles, payrolls and property transfers.\n\"Replacing these taxes with the extra revenue that would be raised by broadening the GST base and raising its rate should be a leading priority for tax reform.\n\"In their current form all of these taxes weigh heavily on the competitiveness of the economy and they carry high compliance and administrative burdens,\" it says.\nACOSS, ACCI and the BCA issued a joint statement bringing up the forthcoming federation and tax white papers and calling for a \"ambitious and far reaching agenda for federation reform\".\nThe trio's agreed \"directions for tax reform\" include:\n- Issues with the personal tax base to be reviewed include the impact of bracket creep, tax shelters, negative gearing, the treatment of capital gains, and effective marginal tax rates for low-income earners.\n- Reduce impediments to economic growth, including an over reliance on a small number of corporate tax payers and a relatively high statutory corporate rate.\n- The most inefficient state taxes should be abolished with revenue recouped through more efficient taxes, such as land tax.\n- The overall impact of tax reform on equity and particularly on low income households should be carefully considered. This should include consideration of 'compensation' where appropriate, taking account of the risks for people on low incomes of over-reliance on 'compensation' for tax changes that would otherwise reduce their living standards.\nQld backs 'alternative' to GST plan Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has backed Victorian Premier Daniel Andrew's plans to increase the Medicare levy as an alternative to increasing the GST.\nAs she foreshadowed a battle with Prime Minster Tony Abbott over the state gaining a fair share of infrastructure funding, Ms Palaszczuk said the federal government was trying to box Labor states into a corner after cutting $80 billion in health and education funding.\n\"I'm going down there with an open mind but I made it very clear in the last state election campaign that I don't support any increase of the GST,\" Ms Palaszczuk said on Tuesday.\n\"However, Daniel Andrew's has raised an issue that I'm prepared to give consideration to and that is about an increase to the Medicare levy. I've have got my department doing some modelling and that could be the way forward.\n\"But, once again, the Commonwealth needs to explain why it cut funding across the nation in health and education. And why do the states have to make that shortfall? Why do the states have to come up with the solution?.\"\nMs Palaszczuk said her state was being punished for not selling assets, saying it had been excluded from the $5 billion asset recycling fund.\nShe said Queensland wanted about $1 billion of from the fund for key projects such as the second stage of the Gold Coast light rail project ahead of the 2018 Commonwealth Games.\n\"How can we, in all good faith, go into negotiations when Queensland is at a disadvantage from day one?,\" she said.\n\"The Prime Minister is not showing good faith in dealing with us about these fundamental issues for Queenslanders.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-07-21T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T09:00:43.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
