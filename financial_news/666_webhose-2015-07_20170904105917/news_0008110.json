Paramount Pictures Share on twitter by Katie Walsh They call it the Streisand effect.\nAs in Barbra, Barbra Streisand.\nAnd it's one that Treasurer Joe Hockey is familiar with now.\nWhat was a story that ran, albeit in a big way, in widely read metropolitan papers more than a year ago, has been dredged up since in traditional and social media over, and over, and over again, amplifying and stretching its first run.\n\"A court is a public forum and you have media interest attracted to that forum,\" Slater & Gordon associate Jeremy Zimet says.\n\"As a result you get an increased viewership of a matter that you wanted previously to be banished.\"\nIn the case of Babs, it was her attempted suppression of photographs of her Malibu mansion in 2003, leading instead to the viral sharing of those images.\nFor Joe, the offending SMH poster and The Age tweets might have been pulled down since from streetside and twitterscape respectively, but the re-hashing in regular reports in the lead-up to the seven-day trial , the culmination until the 120-page judgment, the costs order that followed , and the discussion it has triggered on the state of the nation's defamation laws have kept the story breathing.\n Then there is the fact that the underlying articles on the controversial Liberal Party fundraising organisation were not impugned. And on Wednesday, Justice Richard White dismissed permanent injunctions against re-publication of the offending poster and tweets.\n\"You've got this ongoing echo of the original publication long after the public may have otherwise forgotten about it,\" Zimet says.\n\"It's an interesting phenomenon. That's obviously something that each claimant needs to consider when thinking about commencing proceedings.\"\nStill, for some it's worth it, if only for their say in court, Zimet says.\n\"Your form of words and your reply are equally heard,\" he says.\n\"People who feel aggrieved by a publication sufficiently to bring it to court will not really care about the additional exposure that they are likely to receive as a result of the court proceeding, as long as they're convinced that the eventual outcome will be in their favour.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@katiepwalsh"], "published": "2015-07-23T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T01:10:34.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
