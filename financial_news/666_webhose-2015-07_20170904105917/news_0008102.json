So the underlying issue wasn’t the code, as much as lack of adherence to the code.” \nHe will spend two years with global regulators working on a code which fits the day-to-day operations of traders so they know how to behave in each part of their job, and in their interactions with other traders and brokers. \nThe aim is to “provide more granular guidance to traders that they could follow, and to think about mechanisms to increase the incentives for firms and individuals to adhere to the new global code,” he said. \nTo make sure it works, rogue traders will also face greater punishments . \n“Codes by definition are non-statutory instruments, but that doesn’t mean wrongdoing won’t result in criminal sanctions. The UK authorities made it clear they intend to extend the reach of the market abuse regulations further into FX markets, and they’ll do that in the context of the work which is done on the global code,” said Mr Salmon. \nBank of England governor Mark Carney is shifting his focus onto financial markets, putting Mr Salmon in the spotlight \nAlthough these international negotiations will keep Mr Salmon busy, they are far from the only new development on the executive director of markets’ plate. \nMr Salmon took the job a year ago, just in time for a major pivot in regulatory policy from banks and towards financial markets. He is a long-term Bank staffer, with more than 20 years in Threadneedle Street under his belt. His career includes a stint as former governor Sir Mervyn King ’s private secretary, as well as three years as chief cashier better known as the man whose signature is on all banknotes issued from 2011 to 2014. \nSince the financial crisis, the Bank of England has focused tightly on banks as the core of the credit crunch and as the biggest risk to financial stability. \nBut now banks have built substantial capital buffers and simplified their businesses, the regulator is looking to the markets that connect financial institutions to each other and to the public. \nIt gives Mr Salmon a wide and varied remit, and takes the Bank into areas in which it has had limited previous experience. \nAs a result, he is issuing a call to all parts of the fixed income, currencies and commodities markets to tell regulators where potential problems might be, in any area they want to mention. These will be presented and discussed in what the Bank is calling an Open Forum event in November. \n“The point is to get a diverse range of views about where we need to focus on it would be wholly wrong therefore for the Bank of England to define the agenda and say, this is what we need to focus on. That would be missing the point,” he said. \nBut he is certain that regulations cannot stand still when the structure of markets is changing rapidly. The asset management industry, which is responsible for directing enormous flows of capital, has doubled in size in the past decade to $70 trillion, for instance, while algorithmic trading, which dominates in areas like futures markets, results in lightning-fast market moves that regulators need to track if they are to monitor financial stability. \n“One of the key lessons from the past 15 years is that the infrastructure around markets needs to change as those markets themselves change. We should want innovative markets which can adapt, evolve and change,” he said. \n“But if we’re going to allow that, we need to make sure the infrastructure around them the hard infrastructure, like the trading venues and the rules, and the soft infrastructure around codes of conduct evolves in line with those markets so they continue to operate effectively.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T04:34:58.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
