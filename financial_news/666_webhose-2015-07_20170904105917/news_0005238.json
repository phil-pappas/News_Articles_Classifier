Supplied by Mercedes Ruehl Global law firm Hogan Lovells, is set to formally establish a local arm, with the firm in advanced negotiations to lease space at Martin Place in Sydney and St Georges Square in Perth.\nThe UK and US-strong firm poached Allens partners Nicky Lester and Tim Lester earlier this year to set up a local business. In an interview with The Australian Financial Review in April , Hogan Lovells said it would open offices in Sydney and Perth. No deals have been signed yet but the law firm is poised to lease space at Pembroke's 20 Martin Place and Charter Hall's building at 225 St Georges Terrace, sources said.\nAfter a soft launch in the beginning of July the firm wants to grow to around 10 partners over the next two years.\nGlobal law firms setting up in Australia over the past five years has created a new pocket of activity in the leasing market, particularly Sydney. Some domestics rebranded after mergers such as Blake Dawson becoming Ashurst Australia but there have also been new entrants such as Allen & Overy​.\nIt is understand Hogan Lovells wants to take a floor at 20 Martin Place, which is set to formally be completed within a month. The Boston-based Pembroke acquired the building then stripped it back to its core as part of a more than $100 million redevelopment. Apple has already committed to the building, formally signing a lease last week for 6200 square metres – nearly half the building.\nCBRE's Jenine Cranston and Tim Courtnall​, who handle the leasing for 20 Martin Place, declined to comment, as did Pembroke. A deal to lease roughly the same amount of space at St Georges Square in Perth is also understood to be imminent although landlord Charter Hall Group declined to comment on speculation.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:05:49.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
