It sounds like they are trying to position 2016 as a recovery year,\" Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross said.\nLexmark said the restructuring is expected to generate $2 million savings in 2015 and annualized savings of $65 million beginning in 2017.\nThe company completed the acquisition of customer management software maker Kofax Ltd in a $1 billion deal in May. It also said in September that it would pay about $251 million to buy Sweden's ReadSoft.\nLexmark forecast third-quarter profit, excluding items, of between 51 cents and 61 cents, well below the average analyst estimate of 89 cents per share.\nFor the second quarter, the company reported a net loss of $36.3 million, or 59 cents per share, compared with a net income of $37.5 million, or 59 cents per share, a year earlier.\nOperating expenses jumped 32 percent to $381.3 million.\nThe results were hurt by an 11 percent decline in revenue in its imaging solutions and services business, which includes monochrome and color laser printers and services covering the company's printing products.\nExcluding items, the company earned 97 cents per share.\nAnalysts on average had expected a profit of 82 cents per share on revenue of $896.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nShares of the Lexington, Kentucky-based company were trading at $42 before the opening bell.
