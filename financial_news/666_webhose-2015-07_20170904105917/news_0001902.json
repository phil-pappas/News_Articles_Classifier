Almost a third (29%) of parents confessed to borrowing money from someone they knew, while 16% of children have also done so. \nWhat is more, a quarter of children say they have lent money to someone they know, with 30% saying they've even helped their parents out financially – a 2% increase on last year's survey. \nNow that personal finance lessons are taught in secondary schools – which the 11 to 15 year olds in the survey would have had – it was disappointing to see that the new curriculum has had little impact on a child's understanding of day-to-day finances. \nAsked if they had to explain what a loan was, only 56% of children could do so, while only 36% could explain what a credit card was – both down 1% from last year. There was no change in the number of children who could explain what debt (54%) or tax was (26%). \nOn a more positive note, 90% of children understand that their parents earn money through work, and almost two-thirds would like to know more about current accounts and savings. \nAnd children seem to have picked up the savings habit, with 70% saving some of their pocket money and 10% saving all of it. The traditional moneybox is where 45% of children keep their pocket money, while 42% use a bank account. \nEmphasising the important role that parents play in teaching their kids about money, the survey found that 60% of children would prefer to learn about money from their parents, while 20% believed school was the best place for financial education. \nGiles Martin, head of Halifax Savings, said: \"Parents need to be very aware just how much of an impact their own feelings about money can have on their children's views and habits. While finance is now being taught in schools, children don't want their mum and dad to take a back seat. \n\"Talking about money at home can be a great way for children to start building an understanding of the importance of good money management. Pocket money can be a great tool for parents to teach their children the basic life skills of earning, and saving money.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T13:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T14:33:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
