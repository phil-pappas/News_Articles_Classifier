Supplied by Mercedes Ruehl Privately owned company Sphere Developments sold more than $56 million worth of stock at its new Blacktown apartment project in a matter of hours at the weekend, on the busiest July auction day on record.\nFirst-home buyer Imesha De Silva, 24, was one of the winners at the Altitude Tower's launch, buying a one-bedroom unit on level 10 for about $465,000.\nBy 2pm more than 90 per cent of the apartments had been sold, with the top-selling apartment a three-bedroom unit selling for $775,000.\nMs De Silva said while her decision was about price, being close to work and family was also important.\nMore than 90 per cent of the apartments in Altitude Tower in Blacktown, in Sydney's west, sold in just hours at the weekend. Supplied \"This is going to be a first for Blacktown, so I thought it would be an ideal choice,\" she said. \"I've chosen an apartment overlooking a planned new park, so I really considered the potential for it as an investment property to rent or sell on in the future.\"\nColliers International director David Chittenden said 2000 inquiries were made during the project's four-week marketing campaign, as first-home buyers and investors emerged as the two strongest markets.\nThe majority of the 106 apartments at Altitude Towers fell within the first-home-buyer grant bracket of up to $750,000.\nIt comes as Sydney's average house price soared past $1 million for the first time last week . Growth over the June quarter pushed Sydney home prices up 8.4 per cent to an average of $1,000,616.\n \"People know that to buy something under $650,000 you have to go out a little bit further and there's very little for that price available in Sydney,\" Mr Chittenden said.\nMore than 800 homes were scheduled to be auctioned in Sydney at the weekend, the highest number for July.\nPreliminary figures from RP Data put the city's clearance rate at 82 per cent, compared with almost 80 per cent last week and 75 per cent in the same week in 2014.\nWhile clearance rates had edged lower during July, the busy spring selling season was around the corner, Domain Group senior economist Dr Andrew Wilson said.\n\"August is the entree to the spring market,\" Mr Wilson said. \"The market rose strongly in August last year and that starts next weekend. I think next month will tell the story on whether the market has reached its peak or a turning point.\"\nBuilding record There was rapid-fire bidding from the 50 people who attended the auction for a one-bedroom Mosman home at 504/88 Vista Street, which sold for $770,000 â€“ $70,000 above reserve.\nSelling agents Brad Rogan and Alex Brun, of Belle Property Mosman, said the sale set a building record for one-bedroom apartments by almost $100,000.\nThe preliminary auction clearance rate for Melbourne was 76.5 per cent across 638 auction results. That was one of the lowest Melbourne clearance rates of the year, Mr Wilson said. However, there was still plenty of confidence in the market as spring drew closer.\nOne of the best results for the city was a six-bedroom home in Balwyn North, which sold to a local Chinese family for $3.6 million. The reserve for the 8 Ferdinand Avenue house was $3.3 million. Selling agent Simon Lord, of Jellis Craig Hawthorn, said Melbourne's market was still \"very strong\", with land along the school belt especially sought after.\nOverall auction conditions are still stronger than 2014. The national clearance rate was 77 per cent, compared with about 68 per cent in July 2014.\nMr Wilson said he did not expect a slowdown in investor activity despite two of the biggest banks in the country, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and ANZ Bank, raising interest rates for investors.\n\"I don't think it will discourage investors. If anything it might even add to rents down the track, if the rise is passed on to tenants.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:04:01.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
