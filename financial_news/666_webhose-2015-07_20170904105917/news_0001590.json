Share on twitter by Joanna Mather Draft laws designed to install more independent directors on superannuation boards are deeply flawed and will not prevent union officials taking up such posts, a leading academic and consultant to the Cooper review says.\nThe Abbott government has announced new rules requiring all super funds have a minimum of one-third independent directors on their trustee boards and an independent chair from 1 July 2016 .\nThe government wants to dilute the influence of unions on super boards.\nBut Scott Donald, director of the Centre for Law, Markets and Regulation at the University of NSW and a consultant to Jeremy Cooper's super review, saysâ€‹ the legislation as it is now drafted will not require any changes to non-profit super boards such as industry funds.\n\"If you actually look at the bill it doesn't work,\" he told a conference at the ARC Centre for Excellence in Population Ageing Research in Sydney on Tuesday.\n\"On its face it's supposed to be a response to the Cooper Review and the Financial System Inquiry. In fact, I don't think it addresses either of these particularly effectively.\"\nThe bill says anybody with a \"material relationship\" to a fund cannot act as an independent director.\n\"But actually it doesn't pick up trade unions, it doesn't pick up employer bodies,\" Dr Donald said.\n \"In fact as it currently stands...100 per cent not-for-profit funds are already independent because [directors] work for, or are nominated by, people who do not have a material relationship.\"\nThe draft legislation says the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority will define and monitor what it means to be independent. But Dr Donald is heavily critical of that element too.\n\"That's not just a cop out, it's a clear contravention of the rule of law,\" he said.\n\"To put the regulator in a position where they define [the law], they supervise it and they adjudicate on it means that the rule of law is completely destroyed. You have all three arms of government sitting in the one office.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-07-07T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:57:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
