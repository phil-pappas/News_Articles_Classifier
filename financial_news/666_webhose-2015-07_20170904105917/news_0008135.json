By Kate Palmer | Telegraph – 5 hours ago 18.54 -1.08 \nMoney Makeover : Peter Woodhouse is about to retire with almost half a million pounds in property and cash. But how can he help his adult son and young daughter buy their first home? \nFather-of-two Peter Woodhouse shares an all-too familiar worry with parents of his generation: how and if his children will get on the property ladder. \nIt's a headache for the millions of \"baby boomers\" whose children are reaching adulthood just as housing and rents have never been higher relative to earnings. \nWhile fifty-somethings like Mr Woodhouse have benefited from the property boom, they also face funding their children later into life. The average first-time buyer deposit is now £25,000, already 4pc higher than last year. \nThere's an unusual twist to 58-year-old Mr Woodhouse's quandary. While his grown-up son Darren, 37, wants to buy a home right away, his daughter Keziah is just seven years old. \n• Divorcee with £300,000 savings wants to downsize but her adult children have nowhere else to live \n\"My daughter is the one I really worry about,\" said Mr Woodhouse, who is a single parent. \"Property prices are only going to go up so how do I help her when she eventually moves out?\" \nMr Woodhouse lives in Redhill, Surrey. Prices in the South East have increased by 42pc in the past 11 years. By the time Keziah reaches adulthood in another 11 years, the same level of growth would bring a house worth £100,000 today to £141,630. \nMr Woodhouse wants to treat both siblings equally but fears that Keziah will need more financial help than Darren due to property price inflation. \nThanks to years of disciplined saving, through his job as a technician for the NHS, Mr Woodhouse has more than £150,000 in cash savings to play with, as well as a £220,000 mortgage-free flat. \nAssets Approximate value Property: 2-bedroom flat in Redhill £220,000 Cash Isas and savings £150,000 across cash Isas, savings accounts and NS&I premium bonds Stocks and Shares Isa £70,000 in tracker funds Self invested pension (Sipp) £35,000 in tracker funds In addition to his NHS pension, which will guarantee a salary of around £13,000 when he retires in two years' time, he has a £35,000 self-invested personal pension, held in \"tracker funds\", which mimic movements in the stock market. \nMr Woodhouse insists he'll \"never retire\" and plans a change of career once he takes his pension with the NHS. His is a \"final salary\" pension - typically the most generous type of work pension, where retirees receive a guaranteed income calculated in relation to previous earnings and years of service. \n\"I've always been interested in becoming a teaching assistant,\" Mr Woodhouse said, \"I'd like to work in a primary school. It's not like anything I've done before but I don't want to ever leave the workplace.\" \nHe says the family \"live a very simple life\" with the main expenses being an annual holiday to Somerset, as well as Keziah's trampolining and Irish dancing lessons. \nWhat are the best ways to help both children? He's now considering investing in a buy-to-let property to eventually gift to his daughter, or coming up with a suitable investment portfolio to generate future capital enough for both. \nJonothan McColgan, director of Combined Financial Strategies: \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) is the time to be giving his children's future some thought. But Mr Woodhouse also needs to be sure that any financial plan gives him enough money to live off when he changes jobs and fully retires, as well as leaving enough money for Darren and Keziah. \nMr Woodhouse says that he needs £1,400 to live on each month. When he retires, his pension will give him an income from age 60 of at least £1,000 per month, so there is a small shortfall. The good news is that when he gets his state pension at 66 whether that's the full pension or a reduced amount this should more than cover his income needs. \nUntil then, Mr Woodhouse should keep an emergency fund of £23,000 to cover the income shortfall in case he struggles to get a paid position in his new career as a teaching assistant. \nThe best way to help his son Darren on to the property ladder could be to consider writing off an £88,000 sum he owes from a loan you made years ago. Currently Darren repays Mr Woodhouse £1,000 a month, but he already have enough income to live off - and this money would help Darren save toward a deposit. \nAs for Mr Woodhouse's daughter Keziah, he has considered investing in a buy-to-let property which could eventually become her home. \nDarren and Keziah are 30 years apart but both face buying property in a market that has ballooned in recent years \nBut he should aim to stay mortgage-free if possible ruling out buy-to-let. \nMortgages seem cheap now but the best rates might not be available to him because of his age. Borrowing heavily to invest in a rental property at this stage in life just adds unnecessary risk, for example if rent falls below mortgage costs. \nMr Woodhouse should instead use his pension to provide his daughter with a fantastic deposit for a house or as a way of helping her pay off a future mortgage. \nLet's assume he wants to give her some money when she reaches her mid-thirties, roughly the same age as Darren is now. \nMr Woodhouse should use any excess income he has to invest into his Sipp. Assuming he has a teaching assistant job, Mr Woodhouse will be able to pay £500 a month into his pension, which is currently worth £35,000. At age 66 he will have achieved a pension fund of around £80,000 which could remain invested until he dies. \nHe could keep this pension untouched and nominate his daughter to inherit the money. If he died before age 75, she would receive this as a tax-free lump sum. If he dies after 75, she would pay her marginal rate of tax on withdrawals. \nThis strategy means Mr Woodhouse would still be able to access the pension should he need it during his lifetime and he wouldn't need to take the additional retirement risk of a buy-to-let mortgage. \nDavid Smith, director of financial planning at Tilney Bestinvest: \nIn an age of soaring property prices, children are rarely able to afford a new home without the help of their parents. \nBut the key for Mr Woodhouse is to make sure that helping his children won't leave his own personal finances in peril. \nMr Woodhouse has £150,000 in liquid assets, which sounds like a lot, but he also has his own goals to consider: funding his retirement and retraining as a teaching assistant. \nBuying a house now to provide for a child who is 11 years away from adulthood may not be the best course of action. Inflated house prices, the cost of borrowing, taxes, potential periods of zero occupancy and property management fees can severely reduce the yields on buy-to-let investments. \nI would suggest a more conventional route to help fund your daughter's first property purchase. \nThe capital within Mr Woodhouse's Sipp, as well as his remaining money, should be invested in a suitably diversified portfolio for the medium to long term, with the aim of providing for both himself in retirement and a future property purchase for his daughter. \nMr Woodhouse should preferably invest for seven to ten years or more. During this time, there will be periods when the value of his investments falls due to volatility in the market, but he should resist the urge to \"sell-out\" during these periods. \nThe news from Greece, for example, may drive volatility, but is unlikely to have a direct impact on his investments given its small size in comparison to the rest of the market. \nIn terms of the types of investments you might consider, I would recommend a managed portfolio, rather than a tracker, which typically follows the performance of one market, such as the FTSE 100 Index. \nThe underlying investments you select might include funds and \"exchange-traded\" funds, with the underlying holdings comprising equities, bonds, commercial property and cash. \n= Would you like a Telegraph Money Makeover? = \nIf you'd like to be considered, please send your responses to all the following questions with the header ‘Give me a Money Makeover’ to money@telegraph.co.uk. \nYou'll appear online and in the paper.
