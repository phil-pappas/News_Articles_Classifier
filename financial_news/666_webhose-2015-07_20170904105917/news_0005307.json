The bonds have been tanking along with the price of iron ore, which fell to its lowest level in at least six years on Wednesday.\nFortescue’s bonds traded at 96 cents on the dollar to yield 10.6 percent at 12:27 p.m. in New York after peaking at 107.1 cents on June 12. It was the first day the bonds, which mature in March 2022, fell under their issue price of 97.6 cents. The securities are the most-traded bonds Wednesday, according to Trace, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s bond-price reporting system.\nThe slide represents a rapid turnaround in fortunes for investors. Franklin Resources Inc. and Capital Group Cos. orchestrated the Australian miner’s bond issue, snapping up almost half of the securities in a so-called reverse inquiry, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said at the time. That deal came a month after the company aborted a debt sale in the face of slumping commodity prices.\nFranklin, Capital Group and two other investors reaped an immediate $71.7 million gain in three days after the bonds were issued with one of the highest yields in the U.S. market this year.\nCapital Group spokesman Abbas Qasim declined to comment. Matt Walsh, a spokesman for Franklin didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.\nShares of Fortescue also fell to their lowest level since 2008 as iron plunged below $50 a ton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:09:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
