The FTSE 100 was down 0.17% at 6,524.60 early on with oil and gas stocks out of favour following the recent plunge in crude prices. \nStocks worldwide had slumped on Monday after the Greek public voted a resounding 'no' to creditors' bailout proposals, pushing the country further down the road to a potential Eurozone exit. \nHowever, downside was limited following the surprise resignation of confrontational Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, with analysts hopeful that future negotiations with creditors will run more smoothly. \nEurogroup finance ministers are set to meet at 1200 BST to prepare for a Eurozone leaders summit at 1700 BST. \n\"In a repeat of so many days over the past five months, a EU summit this evening preceded by a Eurogroup get together this afternoon is set to dominant the market discourse and bore investors to tears,\" said Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell. \nFrench President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor have both urged Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to come up with a new plan to restart funding discussions. Hollande said Tsipras must \"offer serious, credible proposals\". \nOil stocks fall, ARM and M&S rise Oil producers and energy services stocks such as BP, Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) , Wood Group, Amec Foster Wheeler (Other OTC: AMCBF - news ) and Nostrum Oil & Gas (LSE: NOG.L - news ) were trading lower after one of the steepest sell-offs in crude this year. West Texas Intermediate fell almost 8% on Monday, while Brent dropped over 6%. \nChipmaker ARM Holdings was a high riser after Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) added the stock to its \"Best Ideas\" list in Europe and upgraded the stock to an 'overweight' rating. \"Past the iPhone 6 upgrade cycle, we like the long duration of the revenue and earnings growth, in a context of slow global growth,\" it said. \nMarks & Spencer (Other OTC: MAKSF - news ) gained after first-quarter sales were better than City analysts had feared, with clothing like-for-like sales down just 0.4% compared with the -1% forecast. \nConstruction and outsourcing firm Interserve (LSE: IRV.L - news ) edged lower despite saying its results were on track after it reported that UK construction conditions were still \"challenging\". \nTechnology group Smiths Group (Other OTC: SMGKF - news ) fell after appointing Andrew Reynolds Smith, the head of GKN 's automotive division, as its new chief executive. GKN (LSE: GKN.L - news ) also fell. \nWeir Group slumped after announcing the acquisition of US-based Delta Industrial Valves for an enterprise value of up to $47m. \nEngine maker Rolls-Royce was extending losses after a profit warning on Monday, as Espirito Santo and JPMorgan (LSE: JPIU.L - news ) both downgraded their recommendations on the stock. \nLloyds gained after Canacccord Genuity raised its rating on the stock from 'hold' to 'buy', highlighting that its capital ratio is \"currently one of the strongest in the UK large bank listed space\". \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,106.45 +0.21% FTSE 100 6,524.60 -0.17% FTSE 250 17,442.11 -0.01% FTSE 100 - Risers ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) (ARM) 1,067.00p +2.99% International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (CDI) (IAG) 495.30p +2.29% easyJet (EZJ) 1,596.00p +1.27% Land Securities Group (LAND) 1,243.00p +1.06% Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY) 85.01p +1.02% Old Mutual (Other OTC: ODMTY - news ) (OML) 205.50p +0.88% AstraZeneca (Swiss: AZN.SW - news ) (AZN) 4,185.50p +0.88% London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) 2,430.00p +0.83% 3i Group (III) 516.50p +0.78% Capita (CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) ) 1,265.00p +0.72% FTSE 100 - Fallers Rolls-Royce Holdings (RR.) 779.00p -2.93% Weir Group (WEIR) 1,629.00p -2.22% Smiths Group (SMIN) 1,122.00p -1.67% BP (BP.) 423.25p -1.46% Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) (AAL) 874.40p -1.00% Glencore (GLEN) 245.15p -0.99% Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO.L - news ) (ANTO) 662.50p -0.97% Associated British Foods (LSE: ABF.L - news ) (ABF) 2,884.00p -0.96% Fresnillo (FRES) 680.50p -0.95% Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) 'A' (RDSA) 1,772.00p -0.89% FTSE 250 - Risers AO World (Other OTC: AOWDF - news ) (AO.) 134.40p +3.38% Big Yellow Group (BYG) 635.00p +1.93% Barr (A.G.)
