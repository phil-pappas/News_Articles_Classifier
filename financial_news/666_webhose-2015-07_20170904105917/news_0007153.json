Photo: CNBC\nChina's sharemarket has stabilised, and Greece is making progress towards a bailout that won't save it but will buy it more time. What's a market pessimist to do? Hunt for new icebergs, of course – and the one that loomed into view this week was the corporate bond market.\nAt a New York investment conference, ageless active-investing rock star Carl Icahn told BlackRock chairman and chief executive Larry Fink that his giant investment management firm and others like it were driving Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen's easy-money bus over a cliff.\nLow rates had opened the spigot for debt issues by low-rated (read: risky) companies that BlackRock and other yield-hungry investors had rushed to buy, Icahn said. The low-grade debt would turn bad when the Fed finally did begin raising rates, he said, adding: \"We are going over a cliff, and you know who's pushing the thing? It's Larry Fink and Janet Yellen.\"\nThe credit rating agency Standard & Poor's this week also issued a report that assessed overall risk in the global corporate credit market as moderate, but identified United States and Chinese corporate bonds as the biggest risks.\nA debt study by McKinsey & Co in February this year found the great global financial crisis of 2008-09 changed the composition of global debt but did not stop it growing.\nBetween 2007 and the middle of last year, global debt grew $US57 trillion, from $US142 trillion to $US199 trillion. The compound annual growth rate was 5.3 per cent, and debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) rose 17 percentage points, from 269 per cent to 286 per cent.\nIn the US, government debt was 89 per cent of GDP in mid-2014, corporate debt was 67 per cent of GDP, and household debt was 77 per cent. In China, household and government debt were relatively low at 38 per cent of GDP and 55 per cent of GDP respectively, but corporate debt was a high 125 per cent of GDP.\nChina's total debt load rose from $US2.1 trillion in 2000 to $7.4 trillion in 2007 and $US28.2 trillion in mid-2014, according to McKinsey. The economy expanded too, but not as rapidly. Debt to GDP rose from 121 per cent of GDP in 2000 to 158 per cent in 2007, and to 282 per cent in the middle of last year.\nMcKinsey pointed out that China has bailout reserves, should a bailout be necessary. It estimated that even if half of China's property loans defaulted and lost 80 per cent of their value, a financial sector bailout from the government would push up government debt to only 79 per cent of GDP, about where it is in the US.\nWithin China, corporate debt is an overfed whale, however. Earnings before interest payments, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) are a proxy for cashflow, and cashflow is the ultimate source of debt-servicing ability. Chinese corporate debts were about 2.5 times EBITDA when the 2008-09 global crisis hit. They are now about four times EBITDA: anything over three times is uncomfortable – and as S&P notes, China's corporate debt market is now the world's biggest.\nChinese companies' financial risk has deteriorated \"about a notch\" on its ratings scale since the global crisis, S&P says, and loan defaults are likely to pick up as the economy slows.\nWhat about the corporate-debt cliff that Carl Icahn says US investors are accelerating towards?\nS&P says highly rated US companies have been hoarding cash since the global crisis, and paying down debt and refinancing debt at lower interest rates. Lower-rated US companies have, however, responded to record low rates by gearing up: about 80 per cent of the new debt ratings that S&P issued in the past three years were on B-rated companies.\nAs higher-rated US companies reduced their balance sheet gearing and lower-rated companies increased it, the result was a wash. McKinsey estimates US corporate debt as a percentage of GDP actually fell by two percentage points between 2007 and 2014.\nS&P says, however, that listed US companies are about half a notch more risky than they were in 2009 on its ratings scale. The risk is skewed to the lower-quality companies that have geared up, and \"the likely rise in US-dollar interest rates makes the high debt load of US leveraged finance borrowers tail risk No. 2 [after China]\", the ratings agency says.\nWhich market is scarier?\nChina's corporate bond market will be pressured even if Beijing holds economic growth at the 7 per cent rate it is clinging to this year, but McKinsey's point about Beijing's bailout capacity is a good one. China's corporate debt market also won't directly mainline a US rate rise: Chinese corporate debt is priced mainly in renminbi, and domestically sourced.\nThere's less bailout capacity in the US, and low-grade US corporate bonds are definitely going to be sold when the Federal Reserve pushes interest rates up. Reserve Bank assistant governor and chief market-watcher Guy Debelle also warned last October that selling when it happened could produce a violent downturn. That risk is raised because the bond market is less liquid than it used to be, after post-crisis regulation forced big banks and other traders to scale back their trading activity.\nThe recent ructions in China and Greece don't appear to have changed the timeline for the inevitable stress-testing of America's corporate bond market, by the way.\nFed chairman Janet Yellen appeared before Congress this week. Rate rises would be gradual, she said, but if the US economy evolved as expected, it would be \"appropriate at some point this year to raise the federal funds rate target\". Most bets are on a rate rise at the end of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:44:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
