My condolences to Julie and the kids. I'll miss him greatly\n— Philip Ruddock (@philipruddockmp) July 21, 2015 It's understood Mr Randall may have suffered a heart attack.\nHe was 62.\nMr Randall was first elected in 1996 as the Member for Swan. An outspoken MP throughout the years of the Howard Government and the Abbott Government, Mr Randall was one of the two MPs who moved the spill motion against the prime minister's leadership in February.\nHe was particularly outspoken on native title issues during the Howard Government. He came under fire more recently over allegations he had mis-used parliamentary entitlements\n Absolutely shocked and devastated to hear about Don Randall. A very good man. My heartfelt condolences to family,friends and colleagues.\n— Joe Hockey (@JoeHockey) July 21, 2015 After losing his seat in 1998, he was re-elected as the Member for Canning and held the seat until his death\nMr Abbott said in a statement last night it was with \"shock and sadness that I learnt of the sudden passing of Don Randall, the Federal Member for Canning\".\n\"On behalf of the Government and the Liberal Party, I convey my condolences and deepest sympathies to Don's wife Julie and their two children\", he said\nThe Prime Minister said Mr Randall was \"an outstanding local member\".\n\"He was a passionate and persuasive advocate in Canberra and a hardworking community leader in Western Australia.\n\"Don made a fine contribution to the Howard Government and particularly to the Coalition during our years in opposition\", he said.\nThe prime minister said Mr Randall was a mentor \"to many and integral to the success of our Party in the state of Western Australia\".\n\"It's hard to credit that this strong voice for Western Australia and servant of our Party has left us so soon.\"\nWA MP Ken Wyatt paid tribute to Mr Randall on Tuesday night, telling Fairfax Media he was \"a man committed to his electorate, to his family and to the people who meant so much to him\". Other MPs have taken to Twitter to offer their condolences.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten expressed his deep sympathies Mr Randall's family and friends.\n\"Don was liked on both sides of Parliament and was counted as a friend by many in the Labor Party\", Mr Shorten said. \"He was a thoroughly good and decent bloke.West Australian through and through, Don was rightly proud of his fierce advocacy for his state and the people of Canning.\"\n\"This sad news will have come as a shock to Members and Senators tonight. This is a moment that puts daily politics in perspective, it reminds us of how precious life is.\"\nFellow West Australian MP Labor's Gary Gray said \"Don's country upbringing and years of service as a teacher helped make him into a highly effective Parliamentarian representing the semi-rural electorate of Canning\"\n\"I shared the City of Mandurah with Don and have seen first-hand how hard he worked for that community\", he said. \"He worked tirelessly for his local community groups, veterans and aged care services, and for improved local infrastructure. He was also a passionate supporter of the horseracing industry\".\"\nI would often sit with Don on the flight back from Canberra and I know how important his wife and his children were to him. Don was a thoroughly decent bloke, a champion for migrants and for his community. He was a friend, and he will be sorely missed.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/WA.Police/posts/1042057739161011", "https://twitter.com/JoeHockey/status/623422055459872770", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/latingle", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/philipruddockmp/status/623429194546987008", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-21/federal-liberal-mp-donrandall-found-dead/6638170"], "published": "2015-07-21T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:07:06.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
