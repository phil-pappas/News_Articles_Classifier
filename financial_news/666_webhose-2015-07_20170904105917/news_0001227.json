The state-owned firm’s advisory board is chaired by the prime minister.\nThe Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported earlier this month that investigators looking into 1MDB had traced close to $700m of deposits into personal bank accounts belonging to Mr Najib, according to documents from the probe.\nReuters has not verified the WSJ report.\nMr Najib has denied taking any money for personal gain and said the corruption allegations are part of a malicious campaign to force him out of office. He is weighing legal options against the WSJ.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T02:04:07.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
