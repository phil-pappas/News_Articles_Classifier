The ECB’s 25-member Governing Council will decide in a conference call whether to keep the 88.6 billion-euro ($97.5 billion) lifeline longer, potentially until Sunday when Greece has been ordered to agree rescue conditions or face euro exit.\nThe ECB has kept Greek lenders on tightly controlled aid since February as their collateral values worsen amid the political uncertainty generated by the election of the anti-austerity Syriza party. Without a bailout agreement with creditors, which would also unlock fresh central-bank cash, the banking system can’t remain viable.\n“The banks will run out of liquidity by the end of the week, even with tough deposit and capital controls in place,” ABN Amro Bank NV economists Nick Kounis and Georgette Boele said in a note. There are “big question marks over whether Greece and creditors will reach an agreement.”\nExit Scenario The ECB will also have to judge whether Greek banks might actually need more ELA, in order to ensure they can maintain even limited operations until Sunday. Policy makers might consider issuing a statement giving Greece a hard deadline to reach a political deal or face ELA being withdrawn, a strategy they used with Cyprus in 2013.\nThe Greek government has been told to submit fresh reform proposals on Wednesday that could form the basis for a third European Union-led bailout. European leaders said late Tuesday that a summit to be held on Sunday will be the last opportunity for them to agree a rescue, otherwise they’ll prepare to throw the country out of the euro.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said she is “not especially optimistic” and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said a scenario for a Greek exit has been readied “in detail.”\nThe finality at the political level may be matched on the Governing Council, which includes the heads of the euro’s 19 central banks and the six members of the ECB’s Executive Board. On Monday, officials stepped up measures to protect their balance sheet by raising the discounts on the collateral that Greek lenders post in return for ELA, even though it makes accessing the funding harder.\nIf “there is no more political accord in sight for a program, then our rules force us to stop completely,” ECB Governing Council member Christian Noyer said on Wednesday. “We’re starting to be very worried. We can see the disaster coming if no decision is taken.”\nThe Greek state is also due to pay 3.5 billion euros to the ECB on July 20, as bonds bought under an earlier crisis scheme mature.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T10:24:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
