How important is it to be successful at all the three all the time? Successful investing using low-cost index funds can be done hundred 100% of the time. Saving a large portion of the income? I would say some years are better than others simply because life happens and some capital expenses pop up time to time. Earn more? I would agree with you that this is the hardest, esp. for someone risk averse like me. Yet still, I have had couple of years in there that were extremely good and few others where the growth was subpar. To say the least, I struggle a lot with this. All my working career we have been overcoming the Great Recession, so I do not know what is supposed to be a good year. I am also learning that I need to get myself in a place of strategic opportunity –“a job that offers more opportunity for achievement at a higher risk, higher growth company” as you said. I am tired of being part of a stay afloat mode of operation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T09:00:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
