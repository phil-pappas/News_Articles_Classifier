U.S. 10-year notes extended losses as a private report showed U.S. employers added more jobs than forecast in June, reinforcing the Federal Reserve’s case to raise interest rates this year.\n“It became clear overnight that Greek politicians are stepping back from the precipice, which is leading to a global decline in bonds,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist in New York at BTIG LLC. “Lost in the Greek headlines is the reality that the U.S. economy is doing quite well in the second quarter.”\nThe benchmark Treasury 10-year yield rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 2.43 percent at 9:09 a.m. New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The 2.125 percent note due in May 2025 fell 5/8, or $6.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 97 3/8.\nThe Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index declined 2 percent in the last quarter, its first loss since the last three months of 2013. It fell 1 percent in June, the worst monthly performance since February.\n‘Last-Minute Deal’ “The uncertainty around Greece is still so huge at the moment,” said John Davies, a U.S. interest-rate strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in London. “You still can’t quite rule out the possibility of a last-minute deal, but you can’t rule out the possibility of a more disorderly outcome.”\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel refused to engage with Greece until after the referendum called by Tsipras.\nIn June, Fed Chair Janet Yellen had reiterated that U.S. monetary policy will be driven by economic data. She said if an agreement on Greece’s debt wasn’t reached “there would undoubtedly be spillovers to the United States” that would affect the Fed’s outlook as well.\n“Domestically, for the last six to 12 months, Treasury markets have focused on when the Fed will be hiking rates,” Davies said. “The U.S. economy seems to be recovering. That has been in a tug-of-war with various international issues, like in recent weeks the intensification of the Greek crisis.”\nPayrolls Focus U.S. firms added 237,000 jobs last month, according to a report Wednesday from payroll services firm ADP, compared with a forecast for 218,000 among economists surveyed by Bloomberg. A separate report from the Institute of Supply Management due Wednesday is forecast to show manufacturing accelerated for a second month in June.\nA more widely followed report on payrolls to be released by the Labor Department on Thursday will show employers added more than 200,000 jobs for the 15th time in 16 months in June, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.\n“It has been noted by the Fed that Greece is an issue even for them raising rates,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a rates strategist at Rabobank International in London. If optimism surrounding Greece lasts “in combination with a positive payrolls number, we could see quite a decent selloff in Treasuries tomorrow.”\nFed funds futures show there’s a 35 percent chance the central bank will increase its benchmark rate from near zero in September, up from 28 percent Tuesday, and a 73 percent chance by December, up from 66 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T17:42:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
