I divorced and the home was awarded to my ex spouse. She later fore­closed on the loan. This hap­pened over 40 years ago. Am I eli­gi­ble for a cer­tifi­cate of eli­gi­bil­ity and re-use a VA Home Loan? \n–Car­los, Washington \nA: You should request a cer­tifi­cate of eli­gi­bil­ity to see where you stand. If the gov­ern­ment suf­fered a loss, in other words they had to pay a claim to the orig­i­nal lender, on your first VA loan—and it sounds like they did–it will impact your access to a VA loan today, even years later. \nTo have full access to a VA loan, you would have to pay back the gov­ern­ment the loss that was suf­fered when you (cour­tesy of your ex) defaulted on the orig­i­nal VA loan. Given how home val­ues (and loan amounts) have sky­rock­eted over the years, this may not be as big as a deal as it seems. \nRequest the cer­tifi­cate of eli­gi­bil­ity and then review it with a lender that works with VA loans and see where you stand and deter­mine whether a VA loan is a pos­si­bil­ity or even the best option. My guess is that you are prob­a­bly in a sit­u­a­tion where even if you’re able to use a VA loan, you’d be required to make a down payment—unless you, as I noted ear­lier, pay back the gov­ern­ment for their loss on the orig­i­nal loan. \nAs with any mort­gage, your abil­ity to get it will be based on finan­cial under­writ­ing (income, debts, credit score, etc.), so you’ll want to have your finan­cial ducks in a row prior to mak­ing your mort­gage appli­ca­tion (VA or not). Good luck. \nJJ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T23:16:35.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
