He has also launched an anti-hunger campaign. \nMexico posted disappointing growth of 1.1 percent in 2013 and 2.1 percent in 2014, well below government forecasts. The administration has lowered the 2015 growth outlook, blaming the drop in global oil prices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T22:10:10.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
