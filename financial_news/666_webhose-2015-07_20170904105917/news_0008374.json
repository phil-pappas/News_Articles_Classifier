Jessica Shapiro by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell With Costa Group's IPO raising wrapped up, attention in equity markets has turned to the near $4 billion worth of stock to be released from escrow agreements this reporting season.\nTop of the list is private hospital operator Healthscope, which listed in July 2014.\nPrivate equity giants TPG and The Carlyle Group retained 38 per cent of the company, worth $1.8 billion. The stock comes out of escrow after Healthscope's full-year result on August 27.\nBut while listed and unlisted investors across the world have been bidding up for hospital operators, making it an opportune time for Healthscope's owners to cash in, local funds largely swerved the IPO at its $2.10 issue price last year. This might make the trade a tough sell at around $2.70, with sources suggesting the stake will be sold down in parts rather than one hit.\nAFR graphic Other companies with large parcels of stock to come out of escrow this reporting season include Regis Health Care, Eclipx, Estia Health, Japara Healthcare, Mantra, oOh!Media and Monash IVF.\nStreet Talk also understands ECM bankers have been pitching to Commonwealth Bank of Australia and ANZ Banking Group in a bid to nab underwriting roles on dividend reinvestment plans.\nBoth CBA and ANZ are expected to pull the trigger on some form of capital raising after the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority said this week the banks would have to carry more capital against mortgages. CBA reports full year results on August 12; ANZ does not report until October 29.\nWestpac Banking Corporation launched a partially underwritten dividend reinvestment plan in May , while National Australia Bank did the same in November and followed it up with $5.5 billion rights issue in May.\n Both stocks underperformed during their respective DRP periods.\nThe problem with DRPs is they are anticipated by the market, which puts pressure on the share price. And with capital moving higher under a global review being conducted by a Basel committee, DRPs may not raise enough capital for what the banks might need.\nThis suggests rights issues may be a more favourable option, given NAB's offer was well-supported and boosted its common equity tier 1 capital ratio to near 10 per cent, the strongest in the sector.
