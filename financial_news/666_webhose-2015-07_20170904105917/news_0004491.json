He is cutting public spending as a share of GDP, trimming corporation tax by another 2p by 2020, cutting welfare and working on new constitutional fiscal rules. But he also outlined a number of more problematic policies. \nAmong the worries are that this was actually a major tax-raising Budget: by 2018-19, the gross tax hike will hit £14.1bn a year, against which £7.3bn worth of taxes will be cut. On balance, net taxes will be up by £6bn to £7bn a year in three years’ time and in subsequent years. Spending is up massively, increasing by £5bn next year and rising all the way to £12bn by 2020-21. A much greater proportion of fiscal tightening is coming from tax increases rather than spending reductions, which will damage the economy. \nThere are also many unanswered questions. Has the Chancellor decided that he wants to eliminate the tax deductibility of interest, for property as well as for all other businesses? His decision to start the process of restricting tax deductibility for landlords is now almost bound to lead to its total abolition in that sector at least. Let us hope that the Chancellor has worked out by how much this will reduce supply in the rented market, and whether the higher rents and reduced accommodation are a worthwhile tradeoff for slightly lower house prices. It would be interesting to take a look at the detailed cost-benefit analysis he has doubtless produced. \nMy big concern was the massive increase in the minimum wage for over-25s, which will price some low-productivity workers out of jobs, and the underlying justifications for it. Out of 28 OECD countries, Britain’s minimum wage is 16th in terms of the adult wage relative to full-time median earnings. By 2020, we would be 8th; the new minimum wage would in effect rise two to three times faster than other salaries. Around 6m people would be affected directly, which means that a massive proportion of the workforce around 20pc will no longer see their wages determined by the free market. Administered prices will have made a return to the UK in a major way. \nMinimum wage workers are concentrated in the North so if the new living wage costs jobs, London will once again emerge the winner, a paradox given Mr Osborne’s Northern Powerhouse ambitions . Sadly, after having rightly spoken out against the mainstream yet bogus definition of a poor household as one that earns less than 60pc of median incomes regardless of whether that is £5,000 or £100,000 the Government now wants to set its so-called living wage at exactly that: 60pc of median hourly earnings. The “living wage” is thus a device to reduce inequality, not one to ensure that people can live without assistance. In any case, the cost of living varies across the country, so any genuine living wage would need to be regionally adjusted. \nThe reasoning underpinning Mr Osborne’s policy goes something like this: tax credits and benefits push down wages and are thus a subsidy to employers. Not only must this corporate welfare be removed, but bosses must be told to pay their workers more. This, proponents would argue, is pretty close to being a free lunch with no downsides: it will merely cut corporate profits slightly, something that can easily be compensated for by trimming corporation tax, and employers will magic up productivity gains. Why didn’t anybody think of this before? \nYet there is zero evidence that benefits push up wages, or that irrational, profit-maximising employers aren’t already seeking to bolster their firms’ productivity. One can figure this out by contrasting countries over time, and also by making international comparisons. The evidence suggests productivity with some minor caveats is the primary determinant of wages. How much welfare nations dole out doesn’t determine salaries. There is no magic solution to improving output per worker, apart from freezing low-productivity workers from the workforce, France-style. The Chancellor’s remedy cutting corporation tax only helps profitable firms. \nAgain, if the Chancellor disagrees with the economic evidence on this (and research isn’t always right) it would be great if he could make his own, carefully worked out analysis public. It would also be nice to know how many extra migrants his policy will attract, by how much consumer prices will be pushed up in retail and elsewhere and crucially the impact on jobs. \nPrices are set according to supply and demand; in practice, workers aren’t hapless creatures at the mercy of monopsonic employers who can grind them down to the lowest possible wage. There is another, crucial reason why employers cannot push down wages as benefits rise: different workers pocket different benefits depending on their circumstances and whether they have children. Aggregate numbers are irrelevant here: bosses can’t and don’t pay those among their workers who enjoy various benefits less than their workers who don’t. \nIf you think that welfare payments inevitably push down pay, then cutting tax credits and other handouts ought to automatically increase wages. There ought to be no need for any further intervention; so why not simply allow market forces to operate? Mr Osborne would never dream of arguing that ensuring poor workers keep more of their own money through tax cuts means that he is subsidising employers. Yet that is another logical conclusion from his argument. \nBy rejecting any kind of sensible economic analysis, the Tories have broken decisively with their erstwhile support for free markets. The great jobs creation miracle of the past few years will grind to a halt, and the UK’s labour market will become far more European. It’s a historic and tragic error. \nallister.heath@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T00:03:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
