Reuters The growing stoush highlights the difficulties posed to governments and institutions such as the ATO by companies such as Uber – which links passengers to private vehicle owners via the firm's smartphone application.\nLabor shadow treasurer Andrew Leigh accused the government of failing to show leadership on the first major dispute in what is often described as the emerging collaborative or sharing economy, which is expanding rapidly here and abroad.\nThe ATO earlier this month ruled that people using Uber to provide rides with their private vehicles should pay GST from the first dollar, as is the case for regular taxi drivers. This is different to most small businesses, which only pay GST once they earn more than $75,000 a year.\nUber director of public policy Brad Kitschke​ said the ATO is applying an interpretation of tax law that was written in 1999 to a 2015 business model \"fundamentally different\" to what was imagined when the legislation was drawn up.\n \"There needs to be a wake-up Australia moment on this,\" Mr Kitschke said.\n\"We've said to government, 'let's have a conversation about this and about how the market is changing and decide what is appropriate'. There are industrial relations, competition and tax issues.\"\nMr Kitschke wrote to Mr Hockey this week urging him to ask the ATO to delay the imposition of GST until October. The ATO ruled earlier this year that August 1 would be the start date for Uber drivers.\nThe company has stopped short of telling its drivers to boycott the tax.\n\"We're saying that every driver's personal circumstances are different,\" Mr Kitschke told AFR Weekend . \"They should seek advice from their tax adviser, and it will depend on whether they're carrying on an enterprise.\"\nHe said the company felt aggrieved because the ATO hasn't ordered users of another fast-growing business, the room-sharing service Airbnb, to collect GST – a distinction the government believes is justified because it is consistent with the principle that rental income is not subject to the GST.\n​The ATO argues Uber drivers must collect GST because they are providing taxi services.\n\"Consistent with the GST treatment of taxi fares, the ATO has determined that fares for transportation via Uber are subject to GST,\" said a spokeswoman for Mr Hockey.\n\"Likewise, the ATO has determined that private rental accommodation provided by Airbnb is GST-free, in exactly the same manner that private rental accommodation provided elsewhere is GST-free.\"\nThe company complained this month that the ATO had been overly influenced by the taxi lobby, which helped formulate the tax treatment of Uber drivers' income, according to Freedom of Information documents obtained by Uber this month.\n\"We think the decision they've taken is motivated by the wrong agenda,\" Mr Kitschke said. \"We've got the deputy [tax] commissioner saying this was about levelling the playing field. No. It should be about the appropriate application of the law.\"\nHe said the ATO's reliance on the taxi industry lobby group – which doesn't represent Uber drivers – was akin to the coal industry being asked to dictate government policy for wind farm or solar companies.\nLabor's Dr Leigh said government ministers had stubbornly refused to get involved and set a clear direction for the sharing economy.\n\"Instead, they are effectively leaving the meter ticking, hoping line agencies will sort out the policies needed to govern these transformative technologies.\"\nDr Leigh said the government needed to map out a plan for the sharing economy. \"Their first step should be to sort out this messy Tax Office dispute which has come about because of their own policy inertia.\"", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/08aug/uber_app_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-07-31T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T11:26:26.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
