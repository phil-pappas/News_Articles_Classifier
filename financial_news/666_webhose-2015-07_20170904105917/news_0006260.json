Regret to see India led by such so-called leaders !!,” Vadra had said in his post.\nThe din created by the war of slogan-shouting forced the Speaker to adjourn the House for the day, minutes past noon.\nEarlier also, the House was adjourned immediately after it met at 11 AM.\nEarlier, Mahajan repeatedly appealed to the members, who were in the Well, to go back to their seats and not show placards.\nFailure to do so would mean that they are not interested, the Speaker added.\nThe BJP members too protested standing in the isle and by showing placards which read: ‘Congress ki raaj jahan, ghotala ki baandh waha (Wherever there is a Congress government, there is flood of corruption), ‘Ulta chor kotwal ko dante’ (Pot calling kettle black).\nThey were demanding probe into the alleged corruption in Assam and Goa.\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley was seen asking the BJP members not to go into the Well.\nLater, Jaitley and Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajiv Pratap Rudy persuaded BJP members to return to their seats.\nRS adjourns twice after verbal duel between Oppn, ruling BJP\nHeated exchanges between the opposition and treasury benches in the Rajya Sabha over modalities for a discussion on the Lalit Modi controversy, today forced two adjournments of the House without transacting any business.\nWhile opposition led by Congress pressed for suspension of business to discuss the issue and seek the resignation of External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj for allegedly trying to help the controversial former IPL head Lalit Modi, Leader of the House Arun Jaitley rebutted it saying the notice given by Anand Sharma (Cong) only sought a discussion without any condition or caveat like resignation of any minister.\nThe treasury benches ruled out the resignation of any minister and said the government was ready for discussion on the issue, while the Opposition demanded that Swaraj, Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje should quit on the issue. They also sought resignation of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan over the Vyapam scam.\nThe ruckus led to adjournment of the House till noon for the first time, and again till 2 PM as similar scenes continued.\nSoon after obituary references were made and papers laid on the table, Sharma and other opposition members including Sitaram Yechury (CPI-M) and Naresh Agarwal (SP) said they had given notice under rule 267 for suspension of business to take up discussion on the issue.\nDeputy Chairman P J Kurien said notices under this rule had been served earlier this week as well demanding discussion and subject to condition that some ministers should resign.\n“Your condition or caveat is something that I cannot implement… I know your notice was with condition but that condition is not within my powers to implement. I can only take note of what is within my powers, that is discussion,” he said.\nThe opposition members rose in protest to press their demand, which was strongly opposed by BJP members.\nAt this, Kurien said “if discussion is not happen, what is the point of this.”\nWhile Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said no minister will resign, while Jaitley said the notice given by Sharma today was without any such condition.\nDisplaying a copy of the notice, Jaitley said “his notice today does not say the ministers must resign. His notice must be admitted and discussion should begin immediately.”\nYechury said it was breach of parliamentary privilege if a member’s notice given to the Chair finds way to the government. Jaitley retorted by saying “please educate yourself on procedures,” saying the secretary general of Rajya Sabha should then make “every effort to circulate it (the notice) to every member” of the House.\n“Mr Yechury’s illiteracy of rules does not make valid argument,” he said demanding an apology from the Left leader charging him with casting aspersions on the Chair.\nKurien said Yechury was free to move a notice on breach of privilege notice if he felt his rights have been breached.\nCongress members remained unrelenting and moved into aisles shouting slogans seeking dismisal of ministers, which was countered by the BJP members.\nAs the ruckus continued, Kurien said he had no option but to adjourn the House and, soon thereafter, adjourned the proceedings till noon.\nWhen it reassembled and took up the Question Hour, Congress members were again on their feet raising slogans as Chairman Hamid Ansari called upon them to maintain decorum.\nAs Ansari started the Question Hour proceedings, Congress members were in the aisle raising the Vyapam scam issue and demanding the resignation of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.\nAnsari asked members not to display posters in the House as he saw Congress member Hanumantha Rao was carrying a poster on the Vyapam scam calling for Chouhan’s resignation. “I request members of the House to allow the Question Hour to proceed,” the Chairman said.\nAs sharp exchanges between opposition and treasury benches and slogan-shouting continued, Ansari adjourned the House till 2 PM.\nWhen the House met after two adjournments at 2 PM, Congress members continued to create a ruckus and were on their feet holding placards and raising slogans.\nOn the other side, members in the Treasury bench were also on their feet shouting, “We are ready for debate.”\nMinister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, “What is the point of order? We will not allow any disturbance. We are ready to debate.”\nAmid din, Yechury raised objection to the reference made by Jaitley day before yesterday.\n“This is an unfortunate reference made by Leader of the House. We don’t raise objections to get television opportunity. This is very wrong…It is injustice to charge us like this,” he said, adding that he had not objected yesterday as he had thought Jaitley’s remarks would be expunged from the records.\nYechury sought a ruling from the chair on this matter saying either the reference should be corrected from Parliament records or Jaitley apologised to the entire House.\nQuoting rules under which the government can take action against Union Minister Sushma Swaraj and some state leaders, Yechury said the Representation of the People Act specified how action should be and can be taken against them.\nAs Yechury pressed for a ruling on these two issues, the Chairman said, “I will go through it. …If you want a ruling, I need time.”\nDeputy Leader of Congress Anand Sharma also objected as to why the notice for suspension of business in Rajya Sabha to hold a debate on scams that he had served to the House, was shared with the government.\nTo this, the Chair said it is a practice that every notice is shared with the Parliamentary Affairs Minister.\nAs the uproar in the House continued, Naqvi kept saying, “They are not prepared for the debate. They need more time to do homework.”\nKurien asked members to calm down and resume their seat. As his pleas went unheeded, he adjourned the House for the day.\n 23, 2015 1:38 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T14:54:50.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
