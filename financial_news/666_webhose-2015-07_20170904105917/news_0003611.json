This improvement to the EFT service is designed to give power generators increased flexibility by granting them ramp-up capabilities and increasing their hourly flexibility, improving their ability to respond to dispatch requests. \n“We have worked very closely with customers, regulators, and industry experts to understand the needs of the power generation market and this service enhancement is the next step in our continuing effort to develop services that satisfy those needs,” said Chris Ditzel, Vice President Transportation and Storage of Enable Midstream Partners. “It is our mission to be a partner in the success of our customers, and we believe this is another great step towards delivering on that mission.” \nWith this service enhancement, EGT will provide EFT shippers the ability to ramp-up generation prior to the start of the gas day and will allow for non-ratable deliveries that can vary throughout the day -- within set parameters -- for accelerated generation needs. Enable Midstream provides services to power generators in the Midwest ISO and the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), and is currently one of the largest natural gas transportation service providers to power plants in the SPP. \nThe new service was recently mentioned by the Eastern Interconnection Planning Collaborative in its report on Gas-Electric System Interface Study as one of the “innovative services” that have been designed to strengthen the deliverability of natural gas to gas-fired generators across the study region. \nThe EFT upgrade took effect July 1, 2015. \nABOUT ENABLE MIDSTREAM PARTNERS \nEnable Midstream Partners is a publicly-traded master limited partnership.
