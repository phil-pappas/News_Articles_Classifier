Luis Ascui by Matthew Stevens The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has found itself in an odd courtroom coalition with the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union in trying to defeat Boral's attempts to access evidence that is pivotal to the regulator's case that the concrete maker has been victim of an illegal black ban organised by the building union.\nBoral has sought discovery of transcripts from 28 individual interviews that were conducted by ACCC officials during an investigation that ultimately resulted in the secondary boycott allegations being levelled against the CFMEU and its officials.\nThose allegations relate to the conduct of an illegal black ban on Boral concrete deliveries to Melbourne CBD constructions sites that both the company and the regulator say has been in force since February 2013.\nAllegations that Boral continues to be the victim of a union organised conspiracy in Melbourne's CBD and its suburbs were presented to, and accepted by, the Royal Commission into Trade Union and Governance in July last year.\nThey subsequently translated into interim recommendations that several leaders of the Victorian branch of the union should be considered for criminal charges of blackmail and the observation that the union had routinely acted in \"wilful defiance of the law\".\nFive months after Boral allegations and its colourful supporting narrative were presented to the royal commission, the ACCC launched secondary boycott proceedings against the union in the Federal Court.\nThe ACCC alleges that the CFMEU told some Boral customers not to take the company's concrete deliveries and advised others that spot safety checks of trucks would be used to delay deliveries at other sites. The point about that little bit of sabotage is that concrete needs to be delivered on schedule or it spoils with the result that it needs to be dumped. And that is exactly what happened in several instances.\nThe ACCC also claims that the Victorian state secretary of the union, John Setka, and his assistant secretary Shaun Reardon, tried to invite Boral into a boycott of Grocon sites. When Boral refused, the union used \"undue harassment and coercion\" in forcing a boycott of Boral deliveries.\n Grocon, of course, sits central to this whole situation. It had been in fairly constant dispute with the building union over resistance of the employment of union appointed safety officers. Boral is the sole supplier of concrete to Grocon sites. The union action was aimed at cutting of the concrete umbilical to Grocon.\nBut in even this bizarre tale of the ugly and the illegal, there have been few developments more surprising than the corporate cop and the CFMEU lining up on the same side of a Victorian Supreme Court in contest against a company that stands the acknowledged victim of a sustained illegal boycott. But that is exactly what happened last Tuesday.\nBoral believes it is entitled to see the necessarily highly confidential ACCC transcripts because they have already been handed over to the union and its legal counsel.\nIt wants to use the evidence to support a claim for $23 million-plus costs that will be heard in the Victorian Supreme Court in August.\nThe ACCC is resisting that idea claiming that Boral's application is unprecedented because it is seeking discovery of documents before their use in the regulator's action against the union and because discovery risks undermining its ability to effectively investigate and litigate breaches of competition law.\nJust for the record, the ACCC case was set down to be heard in November but last month the hearing was moved to March next year. In part that was because one of the union officials named in the ACCC case had booked a holiday in Bali for November to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary. No, I am not kidding.\nAnyway, the union is resisting discovery of the documents because the disclosure it secured flows from an ACCC case rather than the contempt and damages litigation that Boral is pursuing in the Victorian Supreme Court.\nThe union case is that it earned discovery of the transcripts as a necessary and routine part of the defence of the ACCC secondary boycott action, which is being heard in a Melbourne Federal Court.\nThe union position is that the evidence arrived with a set of confidentiality requirements owed to the Federal Court and that, without indulgence from that court and its judge, then Boral simply cannot have access to the documents in question.\nThat the union might resist discovery came as little surprise to Boral. But the idea that the regulator might join the union in active rejection of its ambition did come as a serious shock.\nBut, when you contemplate the principle that the ACCC believes it is defending, then perhaps it should not have. And everyone should expect the ACCC to go to a higher court if it loses.\nIn joining the CFMEU case, the ACCC took a quite different tack to the union. Rather than focus on the boundaries of legal respect owed to differing courts, the ACCC focused on the importance of its compulsory powers and the risk that disclosure would undermine sustaining community confidence in the confidentiality of its examination process.\nIn evidence presented to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, the ACCC said that much of what was usefully extracted in compulsory examinations came from the conversations generated by questions. Witnesses needed to feel confident in the promise of qualified anonymity if those conversations were to continue to be productive, was the proposition at the heart of a statement presented on behalf of the head of ACCC investigations, Marcus Besse.\nAccording to Besse's statement, the compulsory powers extract a certain level of information out of even the most reluctant witness as long as they're going to comply with their legal obligations. But for it really to work well, the ACCC needs co-operation that generates more expansive answers through explanation and clarification.\nAs the ACCC barrister Stephen Donaghue noted on Tuesday, securing this quality of evidence relies in community confidence in the confidentiality of the compulsory examination regime and \"the ACCC's reputation for keeping the transcripts confidential is important to fostering that atmosphere where that kind of material is willingly volunteered in the course of ACCC examinations\".\nDonaghue presented that the ACCC examination powers were \"extraordinary\" in that they compelled witnesses, under force of criminal sanction, to respond to questions even at risk of self-incrimination. The only compensation offered to that risk is that the evidence offered will not be used in a criminal case and a qualified commitment to anonymity.\nThe ACCC view is that delivering Boral access to the documents it wants would offer the company a free ride on the back of ACCC powers that have elicited a quality of evidence that would not normally be available to the company.\nFor its part Boral argues that the appropriate theatre to defend the integrity of the compulsory examination process and its public standing was in the Federal Court where the ACCC should have deflected the union's discovery application.\nTo that end, the Boral position is quite simple. The union and its legal representatives have access to the ACCC transcripts as a result of discovery in the secondary boycott case. But the same union and the same law firm are involved in the Boral case so legal fairness requires that the company be equally armed in its Supreme Court case.\nAll of which seems quite reasonable. But the law is not always about what a normal citizen might regard as simple logic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T16:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:13:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
