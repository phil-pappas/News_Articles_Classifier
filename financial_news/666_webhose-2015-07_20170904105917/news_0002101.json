This suggests lower oil prices may be having an increasing effect on the cost of other goods and services. \nThe BoE expects temporary near-zero consumer price inflation to help the British economy by boosting households' spending power, and to have limited effects on how businesses set wages and future prices, unlike in parts of Europe. \nBritish wages have picked up in recent months, and figures due on Wednesday are expected to show earnings excluding bonuses to record their biggest rise since early 2009. \nHowever, downward pressures on inflation are likely to persist for some months yet. Brent crude oil prices fell by around $2 a barrel in June, and have dropped further at the start of July. \nThe ONS said the downward effect from clothing on inflation was particularly marked because June 2014 saw unseasonable rises in prices, whereas this year saw the start of the usual seasonal sales. \nFalls in food prices were led by goods such as pizzas, which are commonly used to lead supermarket discounts, capping a year of declining prices -- the longest unbroken run since 2000. \nAir fares rose less than last year, particularly for European destinations. \nMany economists say the recent rise of sterling against a basket of currencies may limit the pace of future price rises. \nData also released by the ONS on Tuesday showed that factory gate prices fell 1.5 percent in June, the smallest drop so far this year, but as expected by economists. \nHouse prices across Britain rose by 5.7 percent in the 12 months to May, up from 5.5 percent in April, the ONS also said on Tuesday. \n(Reporting by Andy Bruce and David Milliken)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T11:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T11:47:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
