Our new Creative Director Johnny Coca arrives today to start work with the #Mulberry teams. pic.twitter.com/9GVc6hh7b1 — Mulberry (@Mulberry_Editor) July 8, 2015 \n\"I am thrilled to share my vision with the creative teams in London but it is also crucial for me to spend as much time as possible at The Rookery and at The Willows, our factories in Somerset, as they are the heart of our brand, and craftsmanship is the soul of our products. It is truly an honour to work with the team to start a new chapter of the Mulberry story.\" \nThe British luxury brand has reported a sales revival since making a move towards more affordable leather handbags to make its pricing more \"democratic\". Mulberry had suffered a string of profit warnings after an attempt by former chief executive Bruno Guillon to raise the prices of its designer wares backfired spectacularly. \n\"It is such a pleasure to welcome one of the most talented designers in the industry to Mulberry and it will be exciting to watch the brand develop under Johnny’s creative leadership”, Mr Andretta said. \nFollow the Telegraph on LinkedIn.
