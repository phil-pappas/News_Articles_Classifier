In a volatile session Tuesday, the 50-stock benchmark moved mostly in the green up to 1.29pm. However, after this, Nifty slid down. Its effort to revive failed and finally it closed in the red for the fourth consecutive session. India VIX fell 2.78% to close at 15.9150. NSE recorded a volume of 87.33 crore shares. The 30-scrip S&P BSE Sensex, on Tuesday provisionally closed 102.15 points or 0.37% down. The wider 50-scrip Nifty, too, closed in the red -- 24 points or 0.29% in the negative territory at 8,337 points. Sensex, which opened at 27,630.21 points, closed at 27,459.23 points, down 102.15 points or 0.37% from the previous day's close at 27,561.38 points. The Sensex touched a high of 27,676.65 points and a low of 27,416.39 points during intra-trade. Proposed regulations on foreign funds coupled with worries over retrospective tax and the continuing slide in Chinese markets subdued investor sentiment in the Indian equity markets. Chinese shares dropped again on Tuesday following Monday's collapse and regulators' promise of support for the market.
