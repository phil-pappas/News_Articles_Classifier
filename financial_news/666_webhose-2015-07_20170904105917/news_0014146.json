The stake mostly came from Affinity's largest shareholder Perpetual, sources said.\nG8's aggressive roll-up originally focused on buying out small independent operators, but has recently extended to buying competitors with larger portfolios. The Gold Coast-based company now has 450 sites with spots for more than 35,000 children every day. Affinity has 161 centres and about 12,000 places.\n\"We think we can maximise the position for Affinity shareholders by bringing them to our group,\" Ms Hutson told AFR Weekend .\n\"We have been very disciplined about our acquisition multiple and all our acquisitions of childcare centres have been done at 4-times EBIT [earnings before interest and tax].\"\nThe bid was lower than the 5.91-times EBIT G8 paid for centres from the failed float hopeful Stirling Early Learning in March 2014, she said. \"The market has indicated this transaction is about 5-times EBIT.\"\nMs Hutson said she was \"very confident\" in G8's roll-up strategy, even though market watchers often compare it to ABC Learning, which collapsed in 2008 owing billions. Since then a number of other companies embarking on roll-ups have also run into trouble including Vocation and Slater & Gordon.\nAffinity chairman Stuart James advised shareholders to take no action, calling the bid \"highly opportunistic and highly conditional\". Affinity's shares had slumped 35 per cent on Thursday after the company downgraded its earnings guidance for 2015.\n G8 will offer one share for every 4.61 shares in Affinity, valuing the company at $162 million, based on the closing price of G8 on the day immediately preceding the announcement. The scrip offer represents a premium of 29.6 per cent to Queensland-based Affinity's closing share price of 54¢ on Thursday – the day prior to the offer being made public.\nMs Hutson said the offer is sensible and logical for the industry, and for G8, but not everyone agreed.\n\"People may be still worried about business model and buying a weaker competitor, the stock is down today. There are so many roll-up stories under pressure,\" said one fund manager.\n\"Many companies with roll-up strategies are being forced to pay higher multiples to maintain the growth premium. G8 initially was net cash positive and buying acquisitions cheaply. But they, like ABC Learning, are now using debt to pay for acquisitions. The share price is under pressure and so are their peers and industry is under pressure.\"\nG8 has increased debt levels and in some cases it has been paying higher prices, based on multiples of profits, than usual to build out its network. Last year G8 issued $500 million multi-currency bond program out of Singapore, and it raised $100 million of fresh capital in October.\nG8 shares on Friday fell 2.2 per cent to a new 12-month low of $3.18. Affinity shares rose 16¢ to 70¢, but is trading well below the 12-month high of $1.48 hit last February.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:49:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
