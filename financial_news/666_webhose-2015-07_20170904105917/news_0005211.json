Lend Lease's Building business will design, project manage and construct the project.\nThe international terminal at the Sydney international airport is also undergoing significant change following the appointment of new duty free partner Heinemann.\nThe upgrade will see a transformation of the in and outbound areas, including a newly designed 1200 square metre duty free store in Pier C Arrivals, that will showcase an extensive range of fragrances, cosmetics, wine, liquor and confectionery and has been designed by Gebr, Heinemann's in-house design team, in collaboration with renowned Australian architectural firm Geyer. The project is set to be completed by mid-next year.\nThe retail sector redevelopment comes as advisory group BIS Shrapnel warns that shopping centre income will be soft as consumers remain committed to saving.\nThere is also concern about the performance of some anchor tenants in the wake of strong [overseas] competition, lower margin growth from the low Australian dollar, the continued growth of online retailing, and the quantum of new supply.\nHowever, the ratio of saving has eased off, allowing more cash to be diverted to the shops.\nIn its latest report, BIS Shrapnel's senior project manager, Maria Lee, who authored the data, said the share of household income diverted to savings shot up after the global financial crisis and remained elevated for some years.\nMs Lee said BIS Shrapnel's latest Retail Property Market 2015 to 2025 report shows there was evidence that the amount being saved has started to fall, and is expected to fall further, providing an important boost to consumer spending on retail goods and services.\nThis is good news for retailers and shopping-centre owners.\n\"However, shopping-centre income growth will remain constrained due to a number of other headwinds that are expected to persist into the medium term,\" Ms Lee said.\n\"The falling savings ratio is key. Despite weak growth in incomes, consumers are seemingly willing to loosen the purse strings slightly, reducing their levels of precautionary savings. That's likely a result of record low interest rates and low inflation\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T22:23:51.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
