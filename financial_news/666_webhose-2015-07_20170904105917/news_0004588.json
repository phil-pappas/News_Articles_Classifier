Know What to Expect, Financially \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) - Thanks to robust demand and an ample supply of homes for sale, the U.S. residential real estate market is operating on all cylinders. In fact, Realtor.com calls it the \"best buying season since 2006.\" \"Although demand has been strong all year, in June we're finally beginning to see an uptick in supply as sellers become more confident about home prices,\" said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Realtor.com. Realtor.com also reports that first-time buyers are lining up to buy new homes. 65% of older Millennials (ages 25-34) say they expect to buy a home within three months - up 12% from the start of 2015. The \"hottest\" markets include San Francisco, Denver, Dallas, and Boston, the company states. Additionally, the median list price increased to $233,000, up 7% year-over-year and up 2% on a month-to-month basis. As usual, though, it's buyer beware no matter how strong the housing market. \"Any buyer whose agent says they are in a 'hot market' should be wary,\" says Brad Chandler, CEO at Express Homebuyers USA, in Springfield, Va. \"Buyers should make sure the real estate agent isn't setting them up to jump at the first opportunity presented, without really understanding the client's bargaining power.\" In any given area, there are multiple markets and nuanced metrics that go into pricing particular properties.. \"But the only market that really matters to the buyer is the market in their specific price range and target location, and maybe even style of house, if they are dead set on buying a colonial, for example,\" Chandler said. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T16:36:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
