We remain fully engaged in order to find a solution to restore stability, growth and debt sustainability,\" said Ms Lagarde. \nA report by the IMF said a debt haircut of 30pc of GDP “would be required” to meet the original debt targets agreed in 2012. This could be achieved be stretching out the maturities of bonds to forty years and lowering the interest rate, sparing EMU governments the political pain of having to crystalize direct losses for their taxpayers. \nThe US has clearly lost patience with the Europeans is now bringing its huge diplomatic power to bear , fearing that mistakes in Greece could lead to a geostrategic fiasco and serious damage to the Nato alliance. \n“Greece’s debt is not sustainable,” said Jacob Lew, the US Treasury Secretary . “I think it’s a mistake for the European economy, the global economy, to take the risks that are involved with an uncontrolled crisis in Greece,” he said. \nMr Lew said the two sides were only €2bn a part when talks broke down, yet potentially hundreds of billions are at stake if the crisis spins out of control. He deemed it a bizarre form of risk management. \nFor Berlin, the Greek crisis threatens to mushroom into a much bigger crisis in international diplomacy and Franco-German relations as Paris digs in its heels. \n“France refuses to allow Greece’s exit from the euro,” said Manuel Valls, the French prime minister. \n\"Keeping Greece in the euro and therefore in the heart of Europe and the EU is something of the utmost geostrategic and geopolitical importance. Allowing Greece to leave would be an admission of impotence,” he said. \nYet even if Europe’s leaders to agree to a comprehensive package for Greece on Sunday, any bail-out still has to be ratified by the German Bundestag as well as by the parliaments of Finland, Slovenia, Portugal, and Estonia. \nUp to a hundred MPs from Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrat family (CDU/CSU) have already threatened to vote against fresh money for Greece. \nThis is quickly turning into a make-or-break moment for her own political career.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T23:14:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
