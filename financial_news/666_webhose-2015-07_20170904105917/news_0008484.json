Smartphone makers from China are making a beeline to India, heading to the market in droves. In the last year itself, we have seen over half a dozen brands enter the Indian market, while many more have consolidated their operations and made a wider user base in the country.\nAnd of course, all these brands offer feature-rich smartphones at a fraction of the price of flagship models by Apple, Samsung, Sony etc. Here's our pick of 8 smartphones by Chinese companies that are likely to make their way to India very soon... With the Mi4i and the Mi Pad selling well in India, it’s only a matter of time before Xiaomi decides to bring the Mi Note Pro to India.\nClad in a metal body with a curved glass back, Xiaomi Mi Note Pro sports a large crisp 5.7-inch QHD panel, a larger version of the Mi 4’s stellar display. The smartphone is powered by the Snapdragon 810 processor with 4GB of fast LPDDR4 RAM and packing 64GB of in-built storage, a 13MP rear camera with 6-element lens and two tone flash and a 4MP Ultrapixel front camera.\nThe Mi Note Pro could very well be the phone to continue where the Mi 3 left off in terms of Xiaomi’s sales. The \"flagship killer's\" successor, the OnePlus Two has been hotly anticipated. Expected to have ultra-thin bezels all around the screen, the phone is likely to retain the 5.5-inch screen size at 1080p resolution and 3GB RAM, but get the new Snapdragon 810 processor, 16MP rear camera and 5MP front camera.\nAs always, these are not the final specs and OnePlus is known to surprise, but we dn't have to wait too long, as the smartphone will go official on July 27. With the ZTE Nubia Z9 Mini already out, it’s only a matter of time it’s brilliant big brother, the Z9 hits the Indian market. Sporting a metal chassis, the phone packs a borderless display; the frame actually has an interactive touchpoint that lets you squeeze or slide over to perform actions. The rear camera is an optical image stabilized 16MP camera and with a wide-angle 8MP selfie camera.\nThe 5.2-inch display sports Full HD resolution, is powered by the new Snapdragon 810 processor, packs a massive 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, and boasts of an audio processor for crisp sounds. With these specs, the Nubia Z9 should have been the phone that ZTE should have bought here, to make a big impact. A true winner. With the Huawei Honor 6 Plus and the 4X launched in India, Huawei China has already launched the P8 and the P8 Max, the latter sporting a massive 6.8-inch Full HD LCD display with a 1500:1 contrast ratio and 83% screen-to-body ratio with nearly imperceptible bezels in a full metal body used in aviation construction.\nPowering it is the company's Kirin 935 64-bit octa core processor, 3GB of RAM, 64GB internal memory with expandable MicroSD memory.\nA 13MP rear shooter with optical image stabilization, dual-LED flash and a 5MP front camera. To power the display is a 4,360mAh battery. The phone has a 1W RMS loudspeaker with a massive sound chamber and smart amplifiers directing the sound. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Motorola,Moto X Style,Moto X Play,moto x Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/TOItech", "https://twitter.com/toi_tech", "http://ad.doubleclick.net/N7176/adi/TOI/TOI_ENT_ROS_ATF_Artical_Photo_300;sz=300x250;ord=", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-07-29T03:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:51:15.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
