Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Clancy Yeates National Australia Bank has indicated that it will soon sell its final 28.5 per cent stake in US lender Great Western Bank.\nAs part of chief executive Andrew Thorburn's strategy of focusing more on the Australian and New Zealand markets, NAB has sold down two tranches in Great Western to US share investors over the past year, raising a total of more than $US800 million ($1.08 billion).\nNow it has lodged paperwork with the Securities Exchange Commission signalling its intention to launch an initial public offering for the remaining 28.5 per cent stake, the bank said on Friday.\nIt did not say how much it expected the shares to sell for.\nBank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan are acting as book-running managers and underwriters on the deal.\nThe move comes as Australian banks look to asset sales as one way of raising more capital in the face of tougher regulatory demands.\nNAB has the strongest capital position of the big four, with a core equity tier 1 ratio of 10 per cent, after Mr Thorburn raised $5.5 billion in equity from investors in May.\nMr Thorburn said this week that the bank had done \"most of the heavy lifting\" through the May raising, which he described as \"a prudent, appropriate move\".\n \"We still believe we are well placed, and we still believe we absolutely did the right thing in May to get ahead of that,\" he said on Wednesday.\nAlongside Great Western, the other overseas bank Mr Thorburn wants to sell is Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank in the UK.\nIt is planning to spin off up to 80 per cent of Clydesdale to NAB shareholders and float the rest in the UK by the end of this year.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117021518580315645042", "https://twitter.com/clancyyeates"], "published": "2015-07-17T08:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T05:04:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
