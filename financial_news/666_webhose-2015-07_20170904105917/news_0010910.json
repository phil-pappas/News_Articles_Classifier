Feig and most of the other managers are expected to leave the firm, said the person, who asked not to be named because the fund is private.\nFortress’s macro fund lost 1.6 percent last year as rivals made money. It dropped 7.1 percent in the first five months of this year, hurt in part by the Swiss National Bank’s surprise move in January to remove the cap on its currency. While the fund reported losses of more than 7.9 percent in the first half of January, Novogratz’s portion of the portfolio didn’t lose money in that trade, said people familiar with the firm.\nGordon Runte, a spokesman for New York-based Fortress, declined to comment. Reuters first reported Feig’s departure.\nFortress managed $2.8 billion in the macro fund and separate accounts as of the end of March, down from $3.5 billion a year earlier.\nThe firm hired Feig last year from Citigroup Inc., where he was global head of foreign exchange. Feig didn’t return a message seeking comment.\nFortress, founded in 1998, became the first private equity and hedge fund manager to sell shares to the public when it held an IPO in February 2007. Its shares have since declined more than 60 percent. The company reported a 43 percent decline in first-quarter profit as management fees from its hedge funds declined and it sold fewer holdings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T22:37:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
