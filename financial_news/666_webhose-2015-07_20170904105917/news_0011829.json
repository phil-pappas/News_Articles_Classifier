Firstly price was the most important factor influencing purchasing decisions within all retail tissue categories. Nevertheless consumers are increasingly showing a preference for quality products and thus quality branded products sold at special prices/discounts continued to be the most in demand. As a result of the importance of price brand loyalty was limited within retail tissue in the Czech Republic at the end of the review period.\nCompetitive Landscape\nRetail tissue was led by SCA Hygiene Products sro which accounted for a 15% value share in 2014. The company benefits from its wide range of products and is present in all product categories of retail tissue in 2014 with the exception of napkins and tablecloths. Nevertheless the company was strongest mainly in toilet paper and pocket handkerchiefs where it led sales and in boxed facial tissues where it ranked second in 2014. SCA Hygiene Products competes within retail tissue with its Zewa brand which is well-known and well-established amongst Czech consumers.\nFull Report Details at\n - \nIndustry Prospects\nIt is expected that the emphasis on the quality of retail tissue products will strengthen while the importance of price will weaken in line with the rising disposable incomes of Czech consumers towards the end of the forecast period. Nevertheless despite this tendency price is expected to remain the decisive factor in terms of choosing from products with comparable qualities. As a result of the increasing emphasis on quality demand for multi-ply and more sophisticated and premium products is expected to grow within retail tissue over the forecast period.\nReport Overview\nDiscover the latest market trends and uncover sources of future market growth for the Retail Tissue industry in Czech Republic with research from Euromonitor's team of in-country analysts.\nFind hidden opportunities in the most current research data available understand competitive threats with our detailed market analysis and plan your corporate strategy with our expert qualitative analysis and growth projections.\nIf you're in the Retail Tissue industry in Czech Republic our research will save you time and money while empowering you to make informed profitable decisions.\nThe Retail Tissue in Czech Republic market research report includes:\n * Analysis of key supply-side and demand trends\n * Historic volumes and values company and brand market shares\n * Five year forecasts of market trends and market growth\n * Robust and transparent market research methodology conducted in-country\nOur market research reports answer questions such as:\n * What is the market size of Retail Tissue in Czech Republic?\n * What are the major brands in Czech Republic?\n * What is the performance of pocket handkerchiefs vs boxed facial tissues?\n * What are the key new product launches in the tissues market?\nReasons to Get this Report\n * Gain competitive intelligence about market leaders\n * Track key industry trends opportunities and threats\n * Inform your marketing brand strategy and market development sales and supply functions\nReport Table of Contents:\nRETAIL TISSUE IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC\nEuromonitor International\nJune 2015\nLIST OF CONTENTS AND TABLES\nHeadlines\nTrends\nCompetitive Landscape\nProspects\nCategory Data\nTable 1 Retail Sales of Tissue by Category: Value 2009-2014\nTable 2 Retail Sales of Tissue by Category: % Value Growth 2009-2014\nTable 3 NBO Company Shares of Retail Tissue: % Value 2010-2014\nTable 4 LBN Brand Shares of Retail Tissue: % Value 2011-2014\nTable 5 Forecast Retail Sales of Tissue by Category: Value 2014-2019\nTable 6 Forecast Retail Sales of Tissue by Category: % Value Growth 2014-2019\nKimberly-Clark As in Tissue and Hygiene (czech Republic)\nStrategic Direction\nKey Facts\nSummary 1 Kimberly-Clark as: Key Facts\nCompany Background\nProduction\nCompetitive Positioning\nSummary 2 Kimberly-Clark as: Competitive Position 2014\nMelitrade As in Tissue and Hygiene (czech Republic)\nStrategic Direction\nKey Facts\nSummary 3 Melitrade as: Key Facts\nCompany Background\nProduction\nCompetitive Positioning\nSummary 4 Melitrade as: Competitive Position 2014\nSCA Hygiene Products Sro in Tissue and Hygiene (czech Republic)\nStrategic Direction\nKey Facts\nSummary 5 SCA Hygiene Products sro: Key Facts\nCompany Background\nProduction\nCompetitive Positioning\nSummary 6 SCA Hygiene Products sro: Competitive Position 2014\nExecutive Summary\nDemand for Tissue and Hygiene Starts To Recover in 2014\nPrice Remains A Crucial Factor Within Tissue and Hygiene\nStrong Multinationals and Private Label Retailers Dominate Sales of Tissue and Hygiene\nHypermarkets Remains the Most Important Distribution Channel\nGood Prospects for Tissue and Hygiene\nKey Trends and Developments\nIncreased Willingness of Czechs To Spend Money\nDemographic Development and Changes in Lifestyle Remain Important Factors\nPrice Sensitivity of Czech Consumers Persists in 2014\nMarket Indicators\nTable 7 Birth Rates 2009-2014\nTable 8 Infant Population 2009-2014\nTable 9 Female Population by Age 2009-2014\nTable 10 Total Population by Age 2009-2014\nTable 11 Households 2009-2014\nTable 12 Forecast Infant Population 2014-2019\nTable 13 Forecast Female Population by Age 2014-2019\nTable 14 Forecast Total Population by Age 2014-2019\nTable 15 Forecast Households 2014-2019\nMarket Data\nTable 16 Retail Sales of Tissue and Hygiene by Category: Value 2009-2014\nTable 17 Retail Sales of Tissue and Hygiene by Category: % Value Growth 2009-2014\nTable 18 NBO Company Shares of Retail Tissue and Hygiene: % Value 2010-2014\nTable 19 LBN Brand Shares of Retail Tissue and Hygiene: % Value 2011-2014\nTable 20 Penetration of Private Label in Retail Tissue and Hygiene by Category: % Value 2009-2014\nTable 21 Distribution of Retail Tissue and Hygiene by Format: % Value 2009-2014\nTable 22 Distribution of Retail Tissue and Hygiene by Format and Category: % Value 2014\nTable 23 Forecast Retail Sales of Tissue and Hygiene by Category: Value 2014-2019\nTable 24 Forecast Retail Sales of Tissue and Hygiene by Category: % Value Growth 2014-2019\nDefinitions\nSources\nSummary 7 Research Sources\nAbout Fast Market Research\nFast Market Research is a leading distributor of market research and business information.
