The Process is divided into three phases: Hatch the Plan, Kick off the Plan and Execute the Plan. Most importantly, Boni suggests that leaders communicate progress and results to stay on track, and spread the rewards of wealth and recognition when things go your way. \nAs for the next generation of corporate leaders, Boni said leading companies will likely focus more on how a manager handled a problem than where he or she got an MBA. \nMust Read: Want to Know the Real Problem With the U.S. Economy? \n\"You are going to hear a lot less about convention and pedigree and a lot more about the ability to manage through difficulty,\" said Boni. \"I encourage people to be the tested ship and get into a situation that has a little hair on it and comb that hair.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T01:37:33.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
