Share on twitter by Philip Baker The bounce in global sharemarkets this week must have made investors think what all the fuss of the past month has been about.\nThe Nasdaq is back at a fresh record high, the Dow Jones is less than 200 points from a fresh record high heading into Friday night trading, and the S&P 500 is around 6 points from another new high.\nThe US earnings season is still in its infancy but it's definitely a case of so far so good, and it has played a part in the rebound on Wall Street.\nGoogle shares jumped 12 per cent after market trading on Thursday night, when it released higher than expected earnings per share of $US6.99, up from $US4.99 a year before, and more than the $US6.74 analysts had pencilled in.\nNetflix, Citi perform well Netflix and Citi have also been standouts. The on-demand movie and television provider added more than 3 million subscribers than analysts originally thought in the last quarter. The third-largest US bank by assets doesn't have to spend as much money on litigation any more, so its earnings per share was also higher than expected.\nThe US reporting season is only two weeks old and just 38 companies in the S&P 500 have reported their latest numbers, but most of them have beaten expectations.\nThat has got some investors betting that the rest of the season won't be as bad as the majority on Wall Street had thought.\n Investors had been bracing themselves for the first decline in earnings of large cap stocks since 2009 when the global financial crisis was in full throttle.\nHowever, S&P Capital IQ is still sticking with its forecast that earnings at companies in the broader index will decline by just under 4 per cent when compared to a year ago.\nMeanwhile, the local S&P ASX 200 Index has jumped more than 4 per cent over the past month and is now up 5 per cent this calendar year, after coming within spitting distance of a 10 per cent fall, known as a technical correction.\nThe gains have been made despite talk that the Greek economy will struggle so much this quarter under the new 86 billion euro bailout package that a default is still very much on the cards.\nThrow in some comments on Thursday night from the German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble – that a voluntary exit from the eurozone \"could perhaps be a better way\" for Greece, rather than complying with the new deal – and it's not hard to get the sense the whole issue could flare up again very quickly.\nFurthermore, the slide in the Shanghai Composite Index continued this week and bucked the trend of other global sharemarkets.\nNot even some decent economic data could stem the slide. Only 6 of 39 economists surveyed by Bloomberg correctly tipped that Chinese gross domestic product would rise by 7 per cent for the three months to June, a ratio that cast some doubt on the validity of the report.\nAustralian expectations lower It could all turn out to be a short-lived relief rally, and the accompanying graph from Morgan Stanley's Chris Nicol shows that expectations for earnings here in Australia are being wound back again.\nEarnings growth expectations of around 1 per cent reflect a poor result for the 2016 financial year, and already forecasts for 2017 are starting to taper off.\nAs Nicol notes, it's an awkward time for the market, with valuations still quite high by historical standards but expectations of future earnings growth falling away.\nThat's a nasty nexus, he says.\nThe forward price earnings ratio of the top 200 companies has fallen to just under 15 times, but is still above the long-term average of around 14.5 times.\nCash rate cuts possible Maybe the sharemarket is thinking the Reserve Bank of Australia might be close to another cut in the official cash rate, after the Bank of Canada surprised markets this week when they cut their own cash rate to 0.5 per cent this week.\nSome analysts draw comparisons with Canada and Australia, given both countries are so closely linked to the commodity cycle. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is also poised to cut its target rate next week after some poor data. The line of thinking goes that this will put pressure on the RBA to cut again.\nThe only problem with that theory is that interest rate traders this week went lukewarm on the idea of further rate cuts and adjusted their betting slightly to reflect that.\nSomething has to give.\nMaybe it will be the upcoming earnings season for local companies.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/baker_17_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-07-17T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:05:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
