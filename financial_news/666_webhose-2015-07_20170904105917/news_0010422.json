Jason South by Jared Lynch Frank Costa is urging investors to judge the $1 billion float of his fruit and vegetable empire on its own merits, rather than let it be swept up by the turbulence hitting global financial markets.\nCosta Group's management are overseas, selling the company's initial public offering to investors in Asia, Europe and the US.\nThe roadshow comes as China implements a raft of government-led emergency measures aimed at combating nosediving markets, while Greece's debt crisis continues to weigh on investors.\n\"I think we were always expecting Greece to be a problem but China has been a bigger problem than anticipated,\" Mr Costa said.\n\"If [the IPO] is measured by the public on its own merits, then it should go well. If it doesn't, of course, then I'll have to wait for the advisors, UBS, Goldman Sachs… tell me what to do next.\"\nThe 127-year-old company is hoping to raise $541 million to $637.4 million from public market investors, which will own 76.4 per cent of the listed company. Major shareholder Paine + Partners will retain a 12.4 per cent stake, while the Costa Family would keep 10.5 per cent.\nMr Costa said the business - expected to generate pro forma revenue of $704.4 million this financial year - was solid and had \"put all our ducks in line\" in preparation for the float.\n\"There has been so much work that has gone into it. I hope it goes smoothly because the company is tracking so well.\n \"We are meeting all of our figures, all of our budgets.\"\nCosta Group will also take comfort from Australia's biggest dairy processor, Murray Goulburn, being able to successfully raise $500 million via a partial float amid a tough market.\nUnits in the Murray Goulburn Trust, which are non-voting, have jumped almost 12 per cent since its debut last Friday, compared with the broader market, which is up 2.32 per cent.\nMr Costa said he has yet to hear from Costa chief executive Harry Debney and other executives on the overseas roadshow. \"There's enough pressure on these guys without me ringing them up every five minutes\".\nBut Fairfax Media understands that the company's response from Asian investors last week was positive. It is believed they considered the bottom of the IPO's price range, about $2.20, a discount compared with analyst valuations and a price that acknowledged the current market volatility.\nIt is also understood investors warmed to growth opportunities from Costa's blueberry farms in Morocco and China, which it operates under joint ventures, and its leading market position in Australia.\nMr Costa expected the company's shift to protected cropping, which now accounts for about 75 per cent of its earnings, would be appealing to international markets and investors, which are interested in food quality and reliability of supply.\n\"In this country when you've got droughts and flooding rains… continuously then you are open to the vagaries of the weather. What we have done is try to combat that by getting into as much protected cropping as we could, and it's worked out very well to date,\" Mr Costa said.\n\"There is no doubt that the Australian clean, green image is very attractive to them [international markets], and food security is very important… particularly in the south-east Asian countries. If we can offer protected cropping opportunities for them then that's so much better again.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/greek-debt-crisis-greeces-problems-in-six-charts-20150706-gi6jid.html"], "published": "2015-07-07T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T18:12:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
