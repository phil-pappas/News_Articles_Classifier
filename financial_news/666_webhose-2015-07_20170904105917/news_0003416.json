An Indian embassy spokesman told Reuters he had no information on the matter.\nChinese law enforcement authorities could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe group was on a 47-day tour of the country when they were detained at an airport in the Inner Mongolian city of Erdos. Their tour operator realised something had gone \"horribly wrong\" on Sunday, two days later, the foundation said, when he hadn't heard from them.\n\"These individuals have no terror links, no criminal record in their country,\" said Gift of the Givers, which has negotiated hostage releases.\n\"The families thank the South African government for their unwavering support and call upon the Chinese government to release the detainees immediately.\"\nSeveral of those detained are relatives of Shameel Joosub, chief executive of telecoms company Vodacom Group Ltd., the charity added.
