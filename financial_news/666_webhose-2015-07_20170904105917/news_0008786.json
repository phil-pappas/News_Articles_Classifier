Investment firms have poured money into insurance underwriting in recent years in an attempt to offset low returns in equities and bonds, increasing competition. \n“In London, we are still witnessing downward pressure on rates for large risk and short-tail classes of business, the effect of which has been masked by subdued claims activity,” the firm said. \nBeazley’s own investment returns were just 1pc during the first half of the year, generating $43.5m. The company also improved its profits by releasing $74.5m of reserves that it held back last year to pay for claims that did not materialise. \nBeazley's US health business wrote $13.8m of coverage, in a sign of recovering growth following a slowdown as the Affordable Care Act came into effect. \nThe group raised its interim dividend by 6.6pc to 3.3p per share. \nBeazley said it was still weighing up a return to the UK, having shifted its domicile to Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) in 2009. Andrew Horton, chief executive, said the firm hoped to make a decision in the second half of the year. \"We have to make sure that we haven't missed anything that might prevent us from returning,\" he said. \nAs well as the practicalities of flying to Dublin more than once a month for senior staff meetings, being UK-based \"is helpful from the perspective of the reputation of the company\", said Mr Horton. \nSeveral FTSE companies have moved back to British shores in recent years as corporation tax rates fall, with WPP (LSE: WPP.L - news ) returning from Ireland and Informa coming back from Switzerland. Others, including Zug-headquartered Wolseley and Dublin-based Experian (Other OTC: EXPGF - news ) , remain abroad. Meanwhile, several insurers including Catlin and Randall & Quilter have based themselves in Bermuda, a tax haven and a global centre for insurance. \nMost of the London-listed insurers will report interim results in the coming weeks, including Prudential (SES: K6S.SI - news ) , which will post its first set of figures under new boss Mike Wells, and Standard Life (LSE: SL.L - news ) , which is due to appoint its investment head Keith Skeoch as group chief executive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T16:10:44.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
