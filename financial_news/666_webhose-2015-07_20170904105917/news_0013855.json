The metal used in power and construction ended up 3.4 per cent at $US5,520 a tonne from Tuesday's close at $US5,339.50.\n\"After the significant moves we saw yesterday, inevitably there is profit-taking,\" said Nicholas Snowdon, metals analyst at Standard Chartered. \"But there is still extreme uncertainty with regards to both the Greek crisis and China's stock market, which could still potentially weigh on prices if not resolved in a positive way.\" Greek banks are closed, cash withdrawals rationed and the economy is in freefall. The country has never been closer to a state bankruptcy that would probably force it to print an alternative currency and leave the euro. More than 30 per cent has been knocked off the value of Chinese shares since mid-June. Many fear these losses could infect the real economy, hitting commodity demand. \"Despite the focus on weakness in the Chinese domestic equity markets, we view it as a catalyst and continue to believe that underlying demand weakness, particularly in the commodity-intensive sectors, remains far more important,\" Goldman Sachs said in a note. \"Recent data suggest that investments contribution to GDP growth declined from 50 per cent of growth to 15 per cent in the first quarter, helping to push 'capex' commodities like copper to new lows for 2015.\" One positive came from news that China's government plans to spend 250 billion yuan ($A54.2 billion) to foster growth in areas of the economy most in need of support. \"They will have to do a lot more than that. They need deeper interest rate cuts to stop the rot,\" a metals trader said. Three-month aluminium tumbled to a six-year low of $US1,631.50. It ended at $US1,671 a tonne from $US1,665 on Tuesday, zinc ended at $US1,984 from $US1,930, lead at $US1,786 from $US1,722 and tin at $US14,150 from $US13,850. Nickel gained to $US10,960 from $US10,660.
