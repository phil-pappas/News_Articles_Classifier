James Alcock by Marianna Papadakis Advisers expect a spike in the number of back-door listings on the Australian Securities Exchange in the next six months, before the window for the popular manouevre closes.\nThe ASX has set a deadline of January 2016 to remove companies that have been suspended from trading for a continuous period of three years.\nWilliam Buck partner Robert Whitton expected a spike in the number of reverse takeovers in the next six months.\nMr Whitton said back-door listings were a good vehicle for micro-cap companies and established successful businesses with positive cash flow, but less so for higher risk start-ups.\nHerbert Smith Freehills partner Philippa Stone said there was not much advantage in back-door listing. Jessica Hromas He said typically these types of listings could be a more efficient and cost-effective method, particularly for smaller businesses looking to build their capital base and make strategic acquisitions.\nThe advantage of a back-door listing was that people who invested in and nurtured a business could retain greater control over the process than in a public float.\nTighter ASIC focus Chief executive of Foster Stockbroking Stuart Foster said a back-door listing could be more time consuming and costlier than entering via the front door.\n William Buck partner Robert Whitton expected a spike in the number of reverse takeovers in the next six months. Mr Foster said the progressive tightening of rules for reverse takeovers and IPOs generally in the past four months made the process more complicated and difficult, he expected more companies to revert back to preferring IPOs.\n\"A lot of prospectuses are getting stop orders issued on them,\" Mr Foster said. \"Most of the deals have to have supplementary prospectuses and even though lawyers are diligent, ASIC can find something wrong.\"\nMr Foster said while an old shell already had a shareholder base and ASX listing requirements, it could be difficult for aspiring IPOs to find shareholders.\n\"For very early stage companies a reverse takeover can make sense because you already have a shareholding base whereas with an IPO it will be harder to find support.\"\nHerbert Smith Freehills partner Philippa Stone said there was not much advantage in back-door listing unless the key objective was to secure a listing or access to any assets which remain in a listed shell, rather than where clients were actually trying to raise significant capital.\nThe ASX required full re-qualification for listing in a back-door situation – with full prospectus-type disclosure, compliance with spread requirements and full listing fees.\n\"Really the only thing a back-door listing may deliver is spread without the need to hire an underwriter, but then on the downside if you don't have an underwriter you won't get the benefit of pre-marketing to institutional investors and introduction to the market that an underwriter can provide, particularly if they provide research coverage,\" Ms Stone said.\n\"And if you don't engage market interest then some of the key benefits of listing, such as meaningful access to public capital, may not really materialise.\"\nHigh number of mining shells Allen & Overy partner Meredith Campion said she expected a high number of back-door listings to continue partly because of the number of energy and resources shells available.\n\"While their project might not be viable in the current market, mining and energy companies will look to get some value for their shell, in particular if they've maintained their shareholder spread,\" Ms Campion said.\n\"As a result of ASX policy that it is appropriate to remove a company from the official list if its securities have been suspended for three years, the ability to realise value for a shell will become time critical.\"\nMs Campion agreed the major advantage of a back-door listing was that it generally solved the problems associated with satisfying the ASX shareholder spread requirements as the listed company generally already satisfied this requirement and maintained sufficient spread.\nBut Ms Campion similarly warned that whether the process was cheaper and easier depended on the circumstances.\n\"It isn't always the case because at the end of the day ASX still will require all the admission requirements to be satisfied, that won't be avoided by a back-door listing,\" Ms Campion said.\n\"Sometimes the documents required to effect a back-door listing are more complex than those required for an IPO – and the due diligence may be doubled because you not only have to do due diligence on the start-up but also on the shell.\n\"That might be time consuming and costly.\"\nMs Campion attributed the large increase in back-door listings in the past year not only to the struggling energy and resources industries but also to changes to ASX rules last September that provided for greater flexibility to waive the 20¢ rule.\nThe rule requires companies to have an issue price of at least 20¢ for their shares. This may be an issue for companies that been suspended or whose projects are no longer sufficient to sustain a listing.\n\"The ability to obtain a waiver from the 20¢ rule can avoid the need for consolidation and remove one of the largest constraints small cap companies had with back-door listings,\" she said.\nNot always cheap Technology and medical research companies were continuing their lead in listings of the past year or so taking advantage of old mining shells, of which there were several available, he said.\nThe process typically unfolds with a listed company purchasing the aspiring private company or its assets for shares in the listed vehicle.\nAmong companies William Buck has helped to conduct a recent reverse takeover is technology company YPB which entered via AUV Enterprises.\nYPB founder John Houston said it was an easier path than an IPO, but circumstances always depended on the market conditions.\nMr Houston said he invested $10 million into company which provides brand protection and security systems, to build it up before listing. The back-door listing process was not cheaper, as many often spruiked, with added costs of having to do a sale and purchase agreement and other legal work.\n\"With a back-door listing you can lock a deal in earlier with the owners of the shell and that's a positive,\" Mr Houston said.\n\"You all move forward with an agreed valuation, whereas with an IPO you're leaving yourself up to the conditions of the market at the time the IPO is valued.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:05:45.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
