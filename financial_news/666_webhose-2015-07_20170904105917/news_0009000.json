It gained 3.4 percent in the previous session, having sunk at one point to its weakest since July 2009 at $5,240.\nInvestors remained nervous about Greece as Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras raced to shore up political support for a tough package of tax increases and pension reforms due within hours if Athens is to win a new aid lifeline from creditors.\n\"Metals direction will come down to how much the rout has hit broader sentiment in China. Where do the losses sit? Does this shake people's confidence in the economy and make them not spend? That will depend on how much longer this goes on for,\" said Dan Morgan, analyst at UBS in Sydney.\nIn other metals, tin added 1 percent to end at $14,295 a tonne. Indicating the market might be tightening, cash tin traded at a premium of $48 a tonne to the three-month price CMSN0-3, after touching a premium of $54 on Wednesday, its highest since November.\nThere were also indications of tightening in LME lead after the cancellation of 14,000 tonnes of inventories MPBSTX-TOTAL over the past two days.\nLME stocks are cancelled when an owner of metal gives notice it is about to be shipped out of a warehouse, which means less availability.\nAnalyst Vivienne Lloyd at Macquarie said the move appeared to be coordinated and may be similar to a bigger one earlier this year, when nearly 100,000 tonnes of lead stocks were cancelled, leading to a price rally.\n\"It looks like someone's used the cancellations to squeeze the market. It seems like a mini-version of what happened in March.\"\nLME lead closed up 1.6 percent at $1,815 a tonne after touching a three-week peak of $1,832.
