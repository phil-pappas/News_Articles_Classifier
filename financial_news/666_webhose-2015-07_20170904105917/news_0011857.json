With a few things to keep in mind, however, you can easily make a display that grabs attention and is easy to transport from show location to show location. The following checklist can help you create a custom display that will last for a long time. Or, if that option sounds daunting, this list can help you determine who to have build the display for you and what to look for in a quality custom display. \nTransportation is Important \nThe first thing to consider is how easy the display is to break down and transport. A display that grabs the audience is the ultimate goal. However, if it is bulky and awkward to move around, it is likely to be broken or ruined in some manner while you are trying to transport it to another location. Since trade shows are all about being seen at different ones, it only makes sense to make sure your display breaks down easily for transport. \nMaterials are Key \nNext, it is important to use quality materials. Using less expensive materials may seem to save you now, but in the long run, you spend more replacing and fixing the display all too often. Aluminum is commonly used in the creation of trade show displays. While it is serviceable and can be useful, it is not always the ideal material for your specific display. \nHow Your Display Speaks for You Matters \nAnother aspect of custom trade show displays that is important is the text used. It should be displayed in colors that grab attention, mixed with graphics that increase interest. Having an experienced company create your custom display can mean a significant difference in the amount of interest created by your display. That can mean a difference in the number of new customers and therefore profit loss. \nYou Get What You Pay For \nThis detail is really important when it comes to custom trade show displays. Yes, it can be a significant hit to your budget for the initial investment. You may lean toward the more cost-effective options. However, like the investment in materials mentioned, you will be spending more in a year or two to replace what you buy now if you don't go for the versatile yet long-lasting options. So consider whether you want to be able to focus future budgets on other aspects of the business. If so, it is a good idea to bite the bullet now and pay for a high-quality and long-lasting display. \nA custom trade show display will be your representation to the milling audience. You won't be able to talk to everyone. Therefore, it is important to spend the money and get the quality you need in order to present an accurate representation of your business to the people you don't talk to personally. This is an area where the money invested will make a significant difference in the profits garnered. Think carefully about this investment before moving forward and be satisfied with your decision for years to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T16:41:07.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
