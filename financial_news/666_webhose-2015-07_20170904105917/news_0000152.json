He tells reporters in Brussels: \nWhat’s at stake is Europe. It’s not just about the future of Greece. It’s the concept we have of Europe. There is Grexit or no Grexit. Greece is in the eurozone or out of it. But if it’s out of it, it’s Europe that is shrinking. 14.18 \nUp next: German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who's chosen to wear the white version of her regular single breasted suit jacket today. Is she ready to make peace? \nShe says (in German) that the situation is \"extremely difficult\" and it remains to be seen whether the talks will succeed. She says that tough discussions lie ahead, and Germany will not agree to a new deal at any price. 14.09 \nAlexis Tsipras , Greece's prime minister, has arrived for talks. He tells reporters he is \"ready for an honest compromise\". \nWe owe that to the people of Europe who want to see Europe united not divided. We can reach an agreement tonight if all parties want it. 13.43 \nStatement expected soon. But remember. The \"final deadline\" was supposed to be today and the Greek crisis was meant to be solved after the first bail-out package. \nMoral of the story: expect delays. #Eurogroup statement expected within 60 minutes #Greece — Keep Talking Greece (@keeptalkingGR) July 12, 2015 13.35 \nWoah. The Eurogroup has floated the idea of a temporary Greek withdrawal from the eurozone in a draft statement, according to the Wall Street Journal. The paper said the statement that a Grexit was a \"potential option\" was added at the request of the Germans . \nNothing confirmed though. I will keep you updated. 13.07 \nRussia is considering direct fuel deliveries to help Greece through the crisis, according to the country's energy minister. \nAlexander Novak was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying: \nRussia intends to support the revival of Greece's economy by broadening cooperation in the energy sector. Accordingly we are studying the possibility of organising direct deliveries of energy resources to Greece, starting shortly. \nWhile some have warned that Greece could fall under the influence of the Russian bear if Europe denies it vital aid, the country has problems of its own, and is currently dealing with the impact of harsh sanctions imposed on it by the West. \nNew ally? Alexis Tsipras, Greece's prime minister, talks to Vladimir Putin, Russia's president. 12.50 \nBen Martin rounds up the best of the European papers this morning . 12.47 \nReuters has got hold of extracts of a draft Eurogroup statement , which is calling for the same primary surplus target (revenues minus expenditure, minus debt interest payments) of 3.5pc pf GDP, despite the likely downturn the Greek economy has suffered in recent weeks. This means they want more belt tightening for rescue funds. \nThe Eurogroup say Greece's package of reforms must be \"significantly strengthened and broadened in order to provide for appropriate conditionality for a possible three-year ESM program.\" It also wants a \"scaled up\" privatisation drive with \"improved governance\". \nHere are the top five bullet points (my emphasis): \n• [Greece must] fully comply with the medium-term primary surplus target of 3.5pc of GDP by 2018, according to a yearly schedule to be agreed with the institutions; \n• carry out ambitious pension reforms and specific policies to fully compensate for the fiscal impact of the Constitutional Court ruling on the 2012 pension reform and to implement the zero deficit clause; \n• adopt more ambitious product market reforms with a clear timetable for implementation of all OECD toolkit I recommendations, including Sunday trade, sales periods, over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, pharmacy ownership, milk, bakeries. \n• develop a significantly scaled up privatisation program with improved governance . A working group with the institutions shall provide proposals for better implementation mechanisms; \n• on labour markets, undertake rigorous reviews of collective bargaining, industrial action and collective dismissals in line with the timetable and the approach suggested by the institutions. Any changes should be based on international and European best practices, and should not involve a return to past policy settings which are not compatible with the goals of promoting sustainable and inclusive growth; \nCheer up Wolfgang: French Finance Minister Michel Sapin (left) puts his arm around German colleague Wolfgang Schaeuble 12.34 \nTrust remains an issue with the current Greek government, according to Ireland , the eurozone's austerity poster child. \nSimon Harris , Ireland's junior finance minister, said the Irish people were against debt writedowns, but could stomach a \"reprofiling\", which he said was needed to get Greece's debt pil on a sustainable path. \nIn other words: Ireland is not prepared to sit in the barber's chair and take a haircut (like the private sector did in 2012). \nHowever, it is willing to give Greece more time to repay what it owes. 12.17 \nA backlash against the Schaeuble Grexit plan is building: \nGermany's Green Party , which has been touted as a new coalition party with the CDU should it win elections in 2017, has described it as \"unconstitutional\" German Green Party: \"Schäuble's plans are \"not only unacceptable, but also unconstitutional\" https://t.co/DrXrh3snbv — Edward Harrison (@edwardnh) July 12, 2015 \nMeanwhile, Luxembourg's foreign minister has said that Germany would provoke “far-reaching conflict with France” if it continued to try to push Greece out of the single currency bloc, even on a temporary basis. \nJean Asselborn told Sueddeutsche Zeitung that such as conflict could destroy the bloc's Franco-German axis which “would be a catastrophe for Europe”. He said: \nIt would be fatal for Germany’s reputation in the EU and the world if Berlin doesn’t seize the opportunity now provided by the Greek reform proposals. \nHowever, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel confirmed last night that he backed the plan, although he said Greece would not be forecd to accept the proposal. Writing on his Facebook page, he said : \nIn a difficult situation such as this, every conceivable proposal must be examined without prejudice. This proposal would only be achievable if the Greek government itself views it as the better alternative. 12.04 \nMinisters are warming to the softly spoken Oxford graduate though: #Eurogroup minister: Tsakalotos should have come in February. #Varoufakis ruined everything, we wasted five months — Bojan Pancevski (@bopanc) July 12, 2015 \nOuch. \nHere's a profile of Mr Tsakalotos. 11.51 \nEuclid Tsakalotos , Greece's finance minister, cuts a lonely figure this morning. At least he's not using his hotel paper to write notes on. He's upgraded and brought an iPad with him - in a big red case to shield any notes about triumphalism or anything else from prying eyes: \nGreek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos attends a meeting of the Eurogroup finance ministers \nGreek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos sits quietly as he attends a meeting of the Eurogroup finance ministers \nSecret notes? Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos has brought an iPad with him today, plus two phones \nAt least he has one friend: \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde (L) and Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos talk at the start of a special Eurogroup finance ministers meeting. 11.38 \nPictures from inside the Eurogroup meeting are coming in thick and fast. \nGermany caused a stir yesterday when it mooted a plan that either involved a temporary Greek exit from the eurozone or a €50bn grab of the country's assets to pay off its debts. Greece's would also have to cede control of its public administration to Brussels if it wanted to remain a member of the club in the short term. \nIt was a drastic plan tabled by a minister who has hardened his stance on Greece substantially since its first bail-out in 2010. However, Germany signs the bulk of the cheques, and has enough voting power to veto any third rescue package. \nIn short, if Germany says no deal, there will be no deal. \nMehreen Khan wraps up all the action from yesterday here . \nHere's a snapshot of the plan from Alberto Gallo at RBS: \n...While Schaeuble says the Grexit paper was backed by Angela Merkel , here's what our international business editor Ambrose Evans-Pritchard thinks about it all: \nGerman Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble (R) and French Finance Minister Michel Sapin talk at the start of a special Eurogroup finance ministers meeting (Photo: EPA) 11.29 \nThe pics are coming in from today's Eurogroup.This one is my favourite: \nGreek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde (back C) attend an euro zone finance ministers meeting in Brussels (Reuters) 11.19 \nOn his arrival to the Eurogroup meeting today, Pier Carlo Padoan , Italy's finance minister, said the main obstacle going forward is a “lack of trust.” He told reporters: \nI would like to see the Greek government to take concrete actions starting tomorrow in parliament to implement measures that are needed for Greece in the first place. 11.14 \nEnough is enough, we must reach a deal. That will be Matteo Renzi , the Italian prime minister's message to the rest of the eurozone today. Alice Philipson has more: \nItaly PM Matteo Renzi is to tell Germany that Greece must not be allowed to exit the Euro, according to the Itailan daily Il Messagero, who was quoted in the newspaper as saying \"enough is enough\" and that \" we must absolutely sign a deal\". \nHe said that Italy did not want Greece to leave the Euro and that \"humiliating a European partner after Greece has given up on just about everything is unthinkable\". \n\"Now common sense must prevail and an agreement must be reached,\" he said. \"Italy does not want Greece to exit the euro and to Germany I say: enough is enough.\" 11.08 \nTo give you an idea of just how (un)happy this eurozone family is at the moment: here's just one of the rumours swirling around the Greek and Italian press this morning: Brussels correspondent for @amna_news claims Eurogroup adjourned after Schaeuble snapped \"Don't take me for a fool\" at Draghi #Greece #euro — Nick Malkoutzis (@NickMalkoutzis) July 12, 2015 \nTensions: Wolfgang Schaeuble (left), Germany's finance minister, reportedly snapped at Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB 10.59 \nFinland's prime minister Juha Sipila has been speaking to reporters in Finland this morning. \nWhile his finance minister (and predecessor) Alex Stubb insisted this morning that \"no-one is blocking a deal\" ( see 09.43 ), Mr Sipila is keeping his cards close to his chest. He described Finalnd's stance on Greece as \"confidential\", and not necessarily the toughest around the table. \nHe did, however, say that Greece's proposal was \"not at all sufficient to start talks\". I see this rolling on until July 20, when Greece must repay €3.5bn to the ECB. 10.39 \nJust to remind everyone of today's events. \n• The meeting of the 19 finance ministers of the eurozone is underway. It started at 10am BST and will continue for most of the afternoon. \n• At 3pm BST , the heads of the eurozone will arrive - so Angela Merkel , the German Chancellor and Francois Hollande , France's president, will meet Alexis Tsipras , Greece's prime minister. \n• Leaders will \"take stock of the situation and set out the political guidelines for the next steps\", according to a press release sent out this morning. \"President Donald Tusk confirmed that the euro area authorities were ready to do all that is necessary to ensure financial stability in the euro area,\" it said. 10.21 \nNext to arrive is Pierre Moscovici . He says he is still hopeful that a deal can be reached, but sugggests the ball remains in Greece's court. \nGreece needs to commit to reforms, he tells reporters. 10.13 \nChristine Lagarde , the head of the International Monetary Fund, has also just arrived. No words from her this morning. 10.08 \nOne of the most vocal opponents of a new Greek bail-out is Slovakia . Its finance minister Peter Kažimír has been speaking to reporters this morning - reluctantly. \nIn reference to the special Sunday summit, he joked: \nI cannot speak to media because I'm Catholic and I don't work on Sundays. \nAsked what he expected to happen today, Mr Kažimír said: \nNothing. It's not possible to reach a deal today. \nNot hopeful of reaching a deal: Slovakia's finance minister Peter Kažimír 09.58 \nMario Draghi , the head of the European Central Bank, has just arrived in the back of a grey Mercedes Benz. He didn't stop to talk to reporters. 09.56 \nSajid Javid , the UK business secretary, has been speaking to Andrew Marr about Greece this morning. Asked about the cancellation of the EU leaders summit this evening he said: \nIt certainly sounds like they don't have a deal yet, that's certainly clear. It's also a reminder of just how difficult it's been for the Greek people for a number of years. For any country to go through a decline of GDP of 25pc , the Greek people are really suffering. \nWe want to see a resolution to the solution to this as soon as possible, but clearly it's got to be something that comes from within the eurozone. I hope they can reach a deal as soon as possible. \nI've always said the euro was a flawed proposal right from the start. It was always gonig to lead to these types of problems. I think it was entirely predictable, and countries that are in the eurozone - they have to draw lessons and realise if they want to have a single currency, have to have a single country to go with it. 09.43 \nFinland , which has always been uneasy about Greece's bail-out, insisted this morning that \"no-one is blocking a deal\". Mr Stubb said: \"We are all constructively trying to find a solution in a very difficult situation. \"We are very far away from the conditionality that we need. More from Mr Stubb : \nIf this was a negotiation from one to 10, I think we’re still standing somewhere between 3 and 4. So making progress but not there yet. \nThere are basically three litmus tests here. Number one is the stability of the euro zone and Greek finances. Number two is debt sustainability and then number three is basic financing. \nIf we get those right and we link those to very tough conditionality which has to do with pensions, which has to do with VATs, which has to do with structural reforms, etc, then we might find a deal \nNo one is blocking a deal, we’re all constructively trying to find a solution in a very difficult situation. The conditionality that has been presented by the Greeks is simply not enough at this stage. \nWe need to have clear commitments, clear conditionality and clear proof that those conditions will be implemented at the end of the day. 09.32 \nYou can read all about events yesterday here . \nEurozone finance ministers have already started to arrive for day two of crunch talks. \nHans Jörg Schelling , Austria's finance minister, says there are still \"many differences\" between the Eurogroup and Greece . Alexander Stubb , his Finnish counterpart, also told reporters this morning that the 19 nation bloc was still \"very far away\" from reaching a deal. \nGreek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos arrives for the start of a special Eurogroup meeting on Sunday 09.20 \nGood morning and welcome to our coverage of the Greek debt crisis . Today was meant to be the day when the crisis was either solved or Europe prepared for a Grexit. \nJust days after Donald Tusk , the president of the European Union, said \"loud and clear that the final deadline ends this week\" , he's just announced that a summit of the 28 leaders of the European Union - including UK prime minister David Cameron has been cancelled. He's just tweeted: I have cancelled #EUCO today. #EuroSummit to start at 16h and last until we conclude talks on #Greece — Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) July 12, 2015 \nIn short: it ain't over yet.
