However, in this highly competitive rate environment, pricing on new and renewed credit remains difficult. This pressure has prevented the Company from significantly improving its loan yield compared to 2014. However, due to increased loan balances, the Company has increased its total earning asset yield during the quarter to 4.11% as compared to 4.10% during the same quarter in 2014. \nInterest expense - On the liability side, over the last several years, significant efforts to grow lower cost core deposit relationships have been successful and allowed for reductions in wholesale funding reducing the Company’s cost of funds. During the last few quarters, however, opportunities to reduce the cost of funds have been limited. The average cost of funds for the quarter remained unchanged at .81% as compared to the same quarter in 2014. Going forward, the Company will utilize a cost effective mix of retail deposits and non-core, wholesale funding to fund its organic asset growth. \nProvision for loan loss expense and allowance for loan losses –Based on its reserve analysis and methodology, the Company did not record a provision for loan loss expense during the quarter, a decline from the $325,000 recognized during the prior year quarter. \nThe allowance for loan losses as of June 30, 2015 was 1.30% of gross loans outstanding (excluding mortgage loans held for sale), a slight decrease from the 1.34% as of December 31, 2014. Management believes the allowance for loan losses is at a sufficient level to provide for potential loan losses in the Bank’s existing loan portfolio. \nNon-interest income – Non-interest income increased $649,000 during the quarter primarily due to the Company’s gains on sales of loans and investment securities. First, the Company’s gains on sales of fixed-rate loans in the secondary market increased $114,000 compared to the prior year quarter. Fixed-rate mortgage volume of $13.6 million for the quarter was an increase of 23% compared to the prior year quarter. \nSecondly, the Company executed a structured transaction during the quarter selling $4.0 million of Small Business Administration (“SBA”) guaranteed loans and $5.8 million of investment securities for a combined gain of $488,000. With those proceeds, the Company prepaid a $10 million repurchase agreement (bearing annual interest of 2.61%) incurring a prepayment penalty of $464,000. This prepayment has allowed the Company to significantly reduce higher cost, non-core funding liabilities on its balance sheet and eliminate future annual interest expense of $261,000. This transaction will improve the Company’s cost of funds as well enhance other liquidity and capital performance measurements. \nNon-interest expense – Non-interest expense increased $890,000 over the prior year quarter primarily due to a few significant items. \nFirst, salaries and employee benefits have increased $256,000 due to the addition of several key officers during the last two quarters. The Company continues to strengthen its depth in the areas of technology, marketing, commercial and retail production in order to position itself for future growth and expansion. Also impacting compensation were mortgage commissions which have increased due to the mortgage volume noted above. \nSecondly, included in non-interest expense during the period was a $464,000 prepayment penalty on the structured transaction discussed above under “Non-interest income”. Excluding the structured transaction, the Company’s efficiency ratio would have been 64.91% for the quarter, rather than 67.08%. \nProvision for income taxes – The increase in the provision for income taxes for the quarter is a direct result of the Company’s increase in taxable income. Capital – At June 30, 2015, stockholders’ equity increased to $64.0 million compared to $61.5 at December 31, 2014. First, equity increased due to $2.9 million in net income for the six months. Secondly, as a result of changes in market rates, the Company experienced a decline in the value of its investment portfolio during the six month period. The equity portion of the Company’s unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities increased $251,000 at June 30, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014. \nFrom a regulatory capital standpoint, all capital ratios for both the Company and the Bank remain strong and above regulatory requirements. Nonperforming assets – The Company reduced its nonperforming assets to $7.6 million as of June 30, 2015 as compared to $8.5 million at December 31, 2014. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was 1.17% as of June 30, 2015 compared to 1.35% as of December 31, 2014 and 1.97% as of June 30, 2014. Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP) Financial Measures \nIn addition to the GAAP financial results presented in this press release, the Company presents non-GAAP financial measures discussed below. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance. Additionally, Company management believes that this presentation enables meaningful comparison of financial performance in various periods. However, the non-GAAP financial results presented should not be considered a substitute for results that are presented in a manner consistent with GAAP. A limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented is that the adjustments concern gains, losses or expenses that the Company does expect to continue to recognize; the adjustments of these items should not be construed as an inference that these gains or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Therefore, Company management believes that both GAAP measures of its financial performance and the respective non-GAAP measures should be considered together. \nOperating Income Operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts net income for the following non-operating items: Gains on sales of available-for-sale securities Gains on sales of SBA loans Losses on foreclosed assets held for sale Prepayment penalty on repurchase agreements Provision for loan loss expense Provision for income taxes \nA reconciliation of the Company’s net income to its operating income for the quarters ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 is set forth below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:37:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
