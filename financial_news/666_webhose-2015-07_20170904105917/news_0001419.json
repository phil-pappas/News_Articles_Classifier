Don't expect a living room By Katie Morley | Telegraph – 9 minutes ago 19.35 +0.88 \nWith thousands of living rooms being advertised as bedrooms Katie Morley discovers communal living space is fast becoming a luxury renters are expected to forgo \nIn May my flatmates and I received news we'd been dreading. We are being evicted from our flat. \nOur landlord has finally been granted planning permission to knock it down and build a penthouse in its place. \nOvernight, we became a London cliche. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) we're just another bunch of young professionals being cleared out to make way for millionaire types. \nLike most renters our first move was to trawl sites like Rightmove (LSE: RMV.L - news ) and Zoopla to see what's out there. At first glance some of the places in our price range actually looked all right - a pleasant surprise considering there's supposed to be a housing crisis. \nI started off looking at three bed flats and found this one in Highbury. It's nothing fancy but its in a great location, and at £733 a month each, is just about affordable for average earners in London. \nBut anyone looking for a three bedroom flat is going to be left very disappointed by this advert. \nScroll down and you'll find this is in fact a two bedroom flat - with the living room converted into a third bedroom. Most adults paying a big chunk of their salary on rent want a proper home - not one room to eat, sleep and socialise in. For that reason communal living space is essential - not optional. \nSource: Rightmove \nBut seemingly landlords, estate agents and property websites do not agree. \nFor a room in this flat with no living area (as suggested by Rightmove) three tenants could pay £733 a month (£8,796 a year). If two people were sharing (as could be reasonably expected) they'd pay £1,110.50 a month (£13,326 a year). \nAccording to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, housing is considered unaffordable if it takes up more than a third of someone's take-home pay. \nThat means two people would need to earn £60,000 a year each to comfortably afford to share this flat. \n= Advertised overcrowding is a wide spread issue... = \nIt has been widely reported that renters are squeezing into ever more cramped conditions, but until now it has always been assumed that this was spurred by their active decision to cram into smaller and cheaper accomodation to save a few quid. \nBut with thousands of London rental homes being advertised in this way it now appears that the trend is being propelled by landlords and agents. \nAs I trawled through adverts galore, I found that this practise of misleading advertising is commonplace. Every other listing is a houseshare with no living room making it harder to find somewhere to live. \nAs I wasted hours looking at \"three bed\" homes which only actually had two bedrooms, I wondered whether the problem might be concentrated to rentals with a certain number of bedrooms. So I started to search for four bedroom houses. My heart sank when I found most of the decent looking ones actually had three bedrooms and a lounge. \nThis four bedroom mainsonette caught my eye with apparent rent of £644.50 per person per month. \nBut surprise surprise it only has three bedrooms and a living room and therefore would cost £859.33 a month.... \nSource: Rightmove \nAnd if you think this is bad there is worse out there. \nSome estate agents have gone even further by turning kitchens into bedrooms. Despite its tiny size, this apartment was advertised at £737 a month and was quickly snapped up by a tenant. \nThis shameful practice is encouraging overcrowded living and driving up prices for millions of renters who I firmly believe deserve better than this. \nIn this day and age it should be illegal to misleadingly advertise rental properties and encourage tenants paying market rent to go without a living room or a kitchen. \nSneaky practises as demonstrated by these examples are masking London's escalating housing crisis. When young professionals with good jobs are being cattle hearded into box rooms in run-down hovels with no communal living space, there is something very wrong with the system. \nA clear minimum standard for renting must be enforced without delay. \nkatie.morley@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T12:58:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
