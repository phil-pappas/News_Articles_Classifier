It is not yet known whether most of the redundancies will come from the carrier’s head office near London Gatwick airport or will be spread more evenly over its network.\nThe airline said in a statement that, having returned to the black in 2014, it “is now working to grow to record levels of sustained profitability by 2018.”\nThe cuts will be made in non-customer facing roles, notably among managers and support staff.\nThe aim is to “structure the business in a simpler, more efficient way with fewer management layers, bringing the entire business closer to the customer.”\nThe reductions will be achieved through a combination of natural attrition, redeployment and redundancies and take place over the next few months, with the aim of completing the program by the end of the year.\nThe statement added that the reduction aimed at making the airline more competitive, allowing it to invest in the overall Virgin Atlantic customer experience.\n“To truly position Virgin Atlantic for long-term and sustained success, we need to be a more efficient and agile organization that has the ability to invest even more in the areas that make Virgin Atlantic’s customer experience unique,” CEO Craig Kreeger said.\n“As a people-oriented business, these are extremely tough decisions to take, but we know they are necessary to secure our future. We are committed to supporting our people as we deliver against these plans.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T21:06:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
