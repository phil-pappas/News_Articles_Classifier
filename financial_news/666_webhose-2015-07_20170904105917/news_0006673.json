Supplied Share on twitter by David Ramli NewSat, the listed Australian company that raised hundreds of millions of dollars to launch satellites into space, has fallen back to earth with its project scrapped and assets sold to its rival, SpeedCast.\nAs first flagged last month by The Australian Financial Review , NewSat's teleport business has been sold to Hong Kong-based satellite service provider Speedcast for $12 million. The division operates satellite dishes in Western Australia and South Australia that send and receive signals into space.\nThe sale is one of the final nails in the NewSat coffin. While it still has its listed shell on the Australian Securities Exchange and a launch slot with French rocket provider Arianespace, it is unlikely these will sell for much - especially given the latter is linked to the exact specifications of NewSat's satellite.\n\"The assets include the land & buildings at NewSat's teleport facilities in Adelaide and Perth and the associated plant and equipment,\" Speedcast said in a statement. \"Speedcast is also retaining 20 key employees, in the operations & engineering department and in sales.\"\nNewSat's receivers, McGrathNicol, were unable to get all parties to agree to terms for selling the teleport assets along with the 75 per cent-built Jabiru-1 satellite, which would have at the very least seen the $620 million project launch under a different owner.\nBut US satellite builder Lockheed Martin did not release the bird and a $US200 million to $US250 million bid by Malaysian company Measat to buy the entire company failed to launch.\nNewSat's administrators, PPB Advisory, will now complete an investigation into whether the directors acted appropriately or traded while insolvent. Some NewSat personnel face allegations of over-spending and improper transactions, which they in turn have denied.\nThe report will be published in the coming weeks and can then be referred to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission if any wrong-doing is identified.\n The relatively small amount raised from NewSat's sale will go towards covering the Receivers fees and staff entitlements, which means that shareholders who ploughed over $200 million into the company won't see a cent back from their investments. The US Government-backed Export-Import Bank that issued a $US300 million to the company has also lost out.\nIndependent shareholders have raised the prospect of litigation against the company's directors. But sources close to the sales process said there was little prospect of recovering funds from the assets of NewSat's directors.\nSpeedCast said the new assets made $22 million in revenue during financial year 2015 with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of $1.7 million. It will pay $12 million for the deal and an extra $700,000 in stamp duty as well as other taxes.\nIt said the deal has been funded using available cash and the company's existing debt facilities with no need for any change to its lending terms.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Davidramli"], "published": "2015-07-10T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T06:03:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
