Essentially it allows HMRC to play both judge and jury with little or no external oversight. \n“In our view this undermines due process without independent, judicial oversight and is a step too far.” \nPaul Aplin, chairman of the tax faculty at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales, added: “Ministers have given assurances that the power would be subject to the toughest scrutiny and oversight possible and we will be looking closely at the draft legislation when it is published next week to ensure that the safeguards are clearly and fully set out.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T04:33:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
