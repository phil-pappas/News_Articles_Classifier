A 20 percent downturn is considered by many traders to constitute a bear market. \nChina's factory sector contracted by the most in 15 months in July, a preliminary private survey showed on Friday, a worse-than-expected result that follows a stock market slide that began in June. [MKTS/GLOB] \nBrent September crude was down 74 cents at $54.53 a barrel at noon EDT (1600 GMT), near its $54.40 intraday low, the lowest front-month price since early April. \nU.S. September crude was down 25 cents at $48.20, with the $47.96 session low the lowest price since April 1. \nOil traders awaited fresh oil rig data from Baker Hughes Inc around 1700 GMT on Friday, to see if the price declines continue to curb drilling activity. \nThe world's top oil companies are set to report second-quarter earnings showing another drop in profits that could force more spending cuts, according to analysts. \n\"We feel that U.S. production could begin to show significant slippage while oil rig counts post new lows,\" Jim Ritterbusch, president at Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a note on Friday. \nThe dollar's strength also applied pressure, as a stronger U.S. dollar makes greenback-denominated oil more expensive for consumers using other currencies. [USD/] \nBrent and U.S. crude have posted double-digit losses in July. With U.S. crude off more than 18 percent, it could challenge the 19.4 percent loss in December. \nDecember's slide was the biggest monthly slump since the financial crisis in 2008. \nSigns of economic slowdown in China have pressured oil and metals, with industrial feedstock copper slumping to the lowest levels in six years. [MET/L] \nDemand for gasoline has been strong, keeping refineries churning at high utilization rates, but front-month August U.S. RBOB gasoline futures made a decisive move below its 200-day moving average of $1.8514 a gallon on Friday. \n\"This looks like profit-taking as the end of the U.S. driving season gets closer,\" said Gene McGillian, analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. \nSet for a 5 percent weekly drop, it would be gasoline's biggest since mid-March and a sixth consecutive weekly slide, most since the seven weeks ending Jan. 9. \n(Additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London; Editing by Marguerita Choy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T20:03:50.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
