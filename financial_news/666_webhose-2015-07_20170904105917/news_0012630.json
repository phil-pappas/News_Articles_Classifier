Everybody is doing their work. If we work together, only then will the country progress,” Arvind Kejriwal told reporters.\nThe chief minister was responding to a question on whether his relationship with Jung would improve in the coming days.\nEarlier, Arvind Kejriwal embraced Jung with a warm hug after the latter was ushered in by Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, much to the delight of the media at the venue in Central Delhi’s Chanakyapuri.\nThe duo have been involved in a protracted tussle over several issues since the AAP government assumed office, including over the control of the Anti-Corruption Branch of the Delhi government.\nIncidentally, at the event, Kejriwal was seen engrossed in a chat with TMC MP Derek O’Brien.\nWest Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee had yesterday tweeted her acceptance of Kejriwal’s invite to which the Delhi chief minister had responded saying, “@MamataOfficial Thank u Mamta Di. I wish u cud come. We will miss u.”\nKejriwal said he had invited leaders cutting across the political spectrum, unlike other “VIP Iftars”.\n“VIP iftars are of one type and our iftar of the other. Even VIPs felt good about the presence of common people at the event. We had called people cutting across party lines, including BJP , Congress , JD(U), TMC,” he said.\nKejriwal took turns in sitting beside Ansari, Dikshit and Jung at the elaborate setting, where a sumptuous spread was on offer for the visitors.\nApart from Basit, a number of other diplomats also attended the iftar, as did all the Delhi Ministers, a bunch of AAP leaders and representatives from the minority community.\n“Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and Christians. Everyone will have to work together. The message of love is the same in Gita, Quran, Bible and the Guru Granth Sahib,” Kejriwal said in his message to the people.\n 13, 2015 10:05 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:16:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
