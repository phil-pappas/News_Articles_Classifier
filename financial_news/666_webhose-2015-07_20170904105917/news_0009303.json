The Commerce & Industry ministry has said that it must be remembered that the logo and other related proprietary material are valuable assets of DIPP. Accordingly, the policy for use of the logo by various government, semi-government and private authorities has been approved by the competent authority of DIPP. Here are 10 points to watch out for:\n1. All central and state government programmes conducted in association with industry bodies like CII and FICCI will be considered on the basis of these guidelines on merit and approved by a Joint Secretary level officer.\n2. By using the logo, in whole or part, the user is acknowledging that DIPP is the sole owner of the trademark and promising that she/he won’t interfere in DIPP’s rights and will not harm, misuse, or bring into disrepute the logo.\n3. The use of the logo will be allowed without any permission for all establishments, offices and officers of the DIPP, all central government ministries/departments and departments of state governments/UT administrations for use in programmes directly organised by them.\n4. Requests for use of the logo on publications, websites and portals will be taken up only if these are related to approved sectors under ‘Make in India’. Requests for use of the logo for programmes in electronic media such as debates, discussions or any other will be considered on merit, going by the nature of the programme, profile and track record of producers and the target audience.\n5. Requests for use of the logo by individuals would be considered if such requests promote the ‘Make in India’ cause.\n(With inputs from PTI)\n 23, 2015 1:19 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T14:21:45.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
