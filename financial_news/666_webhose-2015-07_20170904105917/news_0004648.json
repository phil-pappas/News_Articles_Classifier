Cramer said that while he doesn't care for either Fannie Mae ( FNMA ) or Freddie Mac ( FMCC ) common stock, \"the preferred certainly has a much better court case than the common.\" The discrepancy between the common and preferred shares \"is a battle of standing, and the common has the lowest standing,\" he said.Tweet stock questions to @jimcramer using #CramerQ.
