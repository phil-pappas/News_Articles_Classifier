Operating income of $122.3 million increased 16.3% over an operating profit of $105.1 million in the prior-year quarter.\nBaldanza said there is “very little overlap” in terms of passengers carried between major US network carriers and Spirit, adding that Spirit would press ahead with its fast-paced growth plan even as more airlines look to match its low fares . “The overlap between us and them is just not that large, though of course there is some overlap,” he said. “We would have had a much worse year this year if we hadn’t grown. We’re pushing CASM down with that growth.”\nEarlier Friday, American Airlines president Scott Kirby said American is “all-in now in matching ultra-low cost carriers everywhere,” adding, “We’ve won back some market share we had lost by not being price competitive.”\nBaldanza maintained the current pricing environment in the US “does not really bother us … If this environment stays for a while, then we’ll be OK.” But he acknowledged the pricing actions of other US airlines were responsible for 40% of Spirit’s 14.8% second-quarter year-over-year RASM drop to 10.62 cents.\n“We’ve got a generally smart industry run by generally smart people,” Baldanza said. “It’s a very aggressive environment right now and that environment is why we’re operating 21% to 23% margins and not higher.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T12:30:01.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
