The cost of this uncertainty is borne solely by the creditors and in time reduces the value of the assets that are recoverable by the liquidator and hence value recoverable to the creditors,\" the creditors said. \nThe committee said it recognised that the reconstruction of TIB was possible and would possibly give the best outcome for creditors. \nHowever, creditors said given that TIB was presently trading at a loss, the cost of the Scheme of Arrangement and the Provisional Judicial Management were being borne solely from the assets of TIB. The assets were the only source of value available to creditors to recover their value. \nCreditors said the costs of running the bank was being met from the assets. \n\"The objective of initiating a forensic examination is to improve the potential for recovery of assets and the accountability for assets and the recovery of value for the creditors,\" TCG said. \nCreditors said while management, directors and shareholders had indicated that the Winsley Militala report was flawed and inaccurate, they had neither engaged the creditors with an alternative source of information nor refuted the detail which the Provisional Judicial Manager (PJM) had reported. \n\"The absence of a response and information of the 'flaws and inaccuracies' creates the impression that the PJM's report carries a semblance of the truth even if one discounts some of the detail.
