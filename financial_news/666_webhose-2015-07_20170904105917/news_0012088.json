Not so long after that the witch hunt started with a carefully orchestrated campaign in The Post Newspapers. Fast forward to when the immunity was finally removed there was again that awkward yet regular braggadocio posture of M'membe at State House saying, \"I can't believe I have RB in my palm right now. I will finish him off,\" stunning a cluster of reporters that were attending a swearing in ceremony. \nSo went the script until it was time to tie up the case in court-where it mattered most and the state horribly or rather incompetently pulled an amateurish show. They could hardly muster any serious witness to tie up their allegations and in the end it could only end in the manner it did. Maybe someone should be paying for the amount of time it took to the nation through worthless process that was a scheme of selfish individuals whose only interest was vindictiveness. It was not even enough that Banda lost power and never made a fuss about conceding defeat and handed over power peacefully. The only outcome they could dream about was having Banda shackled to prison and humiliated but then for the lawyers they claim to be it is tough luck to them and maybe it is true that he who laughs last laughs loudest. \nWhile the laugh could be as loud, there is still cause to worry about this infamous cartel and the so called corruption fight it wedges. If Zambians ever cared about their reasons, this is the time to start asking questions. \nTaking president Banda to court for a poorly engineered case has just rattled national coffers. Those resources Mutembo Nchito secured through wasting time prosecuting the case should have gone to build a classroom block in Shangombo or Ukwimi. \nThe funds used on the trip Mutembo undertook to Nigeria alongside the likes of Major Richard Kachingwe in search of alleged evidence to fix president Banda should have gone towards stocking drugs in our health sector. \nThat Nigerian witness imported in the country should never have come because the money used on him could have been channeled elsewhere to benefit our poor population. Countrymen and women, corruption is not combated through a hate styled campaign. It's the systems that need working on. How can Mutembo and his cartel account for the so much money spent on these bogus corruption fights? \nThe country should move in a certain direction, not in the direction M'membe and company wants it to go. What though we should never forget is that M'membe and Kabimba will one day be investigated for this abuse of the court process. The case the brought against president Banda was so weak that it didn't require a legal mind to determine it was headed to a ditch. Yes, the cartel are justified to have expected this outcome because it was indeed a useless case that should never have been entertained.
