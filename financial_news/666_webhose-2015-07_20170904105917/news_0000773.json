PUBLISHED: 17:21, Sun, Jul 12, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:41, Sun, Jul 12, 2015 GETTY Beware of pill scams \nThis is a particularly risky time of year as people trying to lose weight in the run-up to the holiday season order diet pills. It is the word ‘trial’ in the advertisements that draw people in. Most, understandably, assume this to mean a one-off order, and happily sign up. However, a few clicks later and little scrutiny of the terms, and they have unwittingly contracted to a recurring payment agreement where goods are sent every month. Worse still, their accounts are often double debited by companies they have never heard of. This last fact only adds to the customer’s confusion and can lead to them mistaking debits on their statements. The internet is full of angry customers condemning the deals as ‘scams’ and ‘cons’. But shoppers continue to get sucked in. This is often because websites do the bare minimum to stay within the law, or operate from overseas which makes refund attempts difficult. In March, Vivienne Wheeler, 40, paid £4.95 for a supplements trial. Later, two companies, Lifestyle Market and Fit Boutique, which she believes are based in north America, sent her more pills and debited her account several times. “Over two months, they took hundreds of pounds from my John Lewis credit card,” says Vivienne, who immediately asked her card provider to stop the payments. “I was happy to pay for the trial tablets but they did not suit me so I had no intention of buying any more,” she told Crusader. “ The thing I did not realise though was that I had agreed to a regular supply. It is so underhand the way the trial is sold.” Vivienne had paid for a batch that she had not received, and that might have entitled her to make a claim under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, which offers consumers extra protection if goods or services are bought on a credit card.
