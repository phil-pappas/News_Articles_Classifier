Philip Gostelow by Jonathan Barrett Victor Kailis owes a lot to his seafaring Greek heritage, so the thought that his parents' homeland might leave the eurozone and suffer an immediate, catastrophic economic shock is hard to bear.\n\"We are very sympathetic to what the Greeks are enduring,\" said Mr Kailis, 69, who brandishes one of the country's most famous seafood names.\n\"If they vote 'no', it's going to be diabolical. Who knows what suffering will occur?\"\nGreeks go to the polls on Sunday to vote \"yes\" or \"no\" to conditions being placed upon them by creditors, in a vote that is being translated in the agora as a referendum on eurozone membership.\nIf Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has misunderstood high stakes game-theory – he is trying to balance a political promise to reject key reforms and remain in the currency union – there is only one direction and speed a re-introduced Drachma would travel in the crisis economy. Down. And fast.\nMr Kailis said his extended family and friends were divided on how Greeks should vote on Sunday, with some believing a \"no\" vote could trigger a Herculean effort for Greece to go its own way and beat the odds.\n\"They see that as gutsy,\" Mr Kailis said. \"If Tsipras pulls it off, he'll be a hero.\"\nBut is that hopeful mythology? The ancient nation has already become the first developed country to default on the International Monetary Fund; and it must repay more than €3 billion in bonds held by the European Central Bank later this month or face a second default.\n South Australian independent Senator Nick Xenophon, who is of Greek and Cypriot descent, said he feared the geopolitical ramifications of Greece moving away from the Eurozone, towards Russia.\n\"I worry for the stability of Greece; I worry that the Greek government will cosy up to Vladimir Putin.\"\nSenator Xenophon said that while he did not agree that Greece should have originally adopted the Euro, it would now be very difficult to leave the currency union.\n\"My view was that it was always going to end in tears,\" Senator Xenophon said. \"But any transition now to the Drachma would be painful.\"\nGreece's leaders have told voters that a \"no\" vote would not result in a Grexit. Rather, according to Mr Tsipras, it would bolster the country's negotiating position from Monday onwards.\nWhile a majority of Greeks might yet vote \"no\" on Sunday, polling also shows most want to stay in the currency union. If voters do believe a \"no\" vote will lead to the re-introduction of the Drachma, it could push them towards a \"yes\".\nEvan Kakulas, who co-owns the Kakulas Brothers store in the Perth suburb of Northbridge, said that even though austerity measures hadn't promoted economic development and job growth in Greece, the alternative was \"scary\".\n\"If there's a 'yes' vote it will mean austerity; if they say 'no' there will be a collapse,\" said Mr Kakulas, who is the national chairman of the Australian Hellenic Council.\n\"It's one of those situations where you need to suck it in and bear it.\"\nHe said that more uncertainty in Greece caused by a return to the Drachma would destabilise a country that was already suffering from a \"brain drain\" of its professionals, and lack of job opportunities for its youth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:50:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
