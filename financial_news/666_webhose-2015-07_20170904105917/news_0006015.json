Investigators are leaning towards the theory of a voluntary act,\" another informed source said. \nPolice, with gas masks hanging around their neck, set up road blocks to stop anyone from getting near the site, and more than 100 firefighters were in action at the scene.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T16:36:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
