Photo: Nicholas Rider\nThe Australian dollar has been caught up in a heavy commodity currency sell-off, testing a fresh six-year low, but whether the mood for further stimulus motivates the Reserve Bank of Australia to cut rates again is not so clear.\nCurrencies traded emphatically on Wednesday night in a session dominated by headlines from US Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen's congressional testimony, more eurozone rumblings and a rate cut in Canada that was seen as only a 50-50 chance heading into the meeting.\nA shock outcome from New Zealand's dairy auction, where prices fell 10 per cent, sealed a savage session for the New Zealand dollar too.\nA 10 per cent drop in prices at New Zealand's online dairy auction derailed the Kiwi.

The Fed chairwoman has been consistent in her communications this year but markets have seen the chaos created by the Greek rescue as giving the Fed further cause to wait.\nThat may not be the case.\n\"The fact she kept up her rhetoric last night in such a formal setting\" underscored the Fed's seriousness, Mr Yetsenga said.\nA US dollar rally could step up the currency relief for the Reserve Bank of Australia at a time when the grinding rout in hard and soft commodities is suppressing commodity currencies.\nDino Spinelli, UBS head of foreign exchange sales in Australia and New Zealand, observed how the currency was caught in a \"downdraft\" as commodity-centric economies shifted course. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand started reversing its tightening cycle with June's rate cut; only months ago the NZ dollar was headed for Australian dollar parity.\n\"The turn of events in the last month to six weeks from the central banks in the commodity sector has created this heightened volatility,\" Mr Spinelli said.\n\"The RBA have been reluctant cutters as we're aware. There's been a period over 2015 when a lot of their peers in Asia have all been easing, and the markets like to think, 'Well, their peers are easing in Asia, surely they're going to be enthused and ease as well'.\n\"To think about what Canada did last night and assume the RBA's likely to cut in the next few months because of that is a dangerous game,\" he said. \"They're still reluctant cutters, they really are.\n\"It's an argument for them to wait and see.\"\nWith a US rate rise potentially two months away, that could be a reason for the RBA to stay on the sidelines, Mr Spinelli said.\n\"We're very close and closer than we have been for last two years that the Fed might do something. That's another argument for not cutting rates.\"\nOn Thursday, financial markets were pricing in a more than 60 per cent chance of one-quarter of a percentage point rate reduction to 1.75 per cent by the end of 2015.\nNational Australian Bank currency strategist Emma Lawson said the NZ dollar bore the brunt of market turmoil on the dairy outcome \"that was abysmal really\".\n\"It just adds to what we already knew, there is pressure there on the terms of trade for Australia and New Zealand,\" Ms Lawson said.\nShe said the foreign exchange market's response to the rate cut in Canada and the plunge in dairy prices was \"fairly normal\" because both situations delivered negative outcomes with somewhat of a degree of surprise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:47:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
