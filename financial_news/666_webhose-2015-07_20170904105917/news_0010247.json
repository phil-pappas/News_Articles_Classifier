Greg Nash By Kevin Cirilli - 07/23/15 06:00 AM EDT Donald Trump says he’s the best presidential candidate to help millennials, promising jobs for students drowning in student debt. “One of the biggest questions I get is from people in college [about student loans],” he told The Hill in a wide-ranging interview. “They’re in college — they’re doing well but they’ve got student loans up to the neck. They’re swimming in these loans.” ADVERTISEMENT The 2016 contender said that college students swarm him at campuses where he speaks asking him for jobs. He criticized the federal government for earning a profit from federal student loans, a point Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) frequently raises. “That’s probably one of the only things the government shouldn’t make money off — I think it’s terrible that one of the only profit centers we have is student loans,” Trump said. “I’ll see so many young people and they work really hard for four years. They borrowed money. Their parents don’t have much. They work all together and they mortgage their future,” the real estate magnate said. “They get good marks — I’m not even talking about the ones that are at the bottom, I’m talking about the ones at the top,” Trump said. “They can’t get jobs and they don’t know what to do.” He wouldn’t go into specifics, but promised he would create jobs if elected president. “I don’t want to raise the minimum wage. I want to create jobs so people can get much more than that, so they can get five times what the minimum wage is,” said Trump.
