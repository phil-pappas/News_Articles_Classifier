Glenn Hunt by Lucille Keen Victoria's militant construction industry officials are facing legal action after allegedly threatening a manager that if police were called the company would be \"starting a war\" that would no be no different from that faced by Boral chief executive Mike Kane.\nIn its case filed in the Federal Court, Fair Work Building and Construction alleged that Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union officials Mark Travers and Adam Hall broke union official right-of-entry laws at the $45 million Taxi Lane Replacement Project at Melbourne Airport.\nThe men were told they must give 24 hours notice to access the site but Mr Travers replied they didn't have to. According to the regulator, he claimed he was catching up with his \"mate Rod\" as they were discussing a \"safety issue\".\nNo safety concerns had been raised with the project manager, the site supervisor or with the Australian Federal Police when they arrived in response to the project manager's call.\nWhile Mr Travers and Mr Hall were still on the site, the operations manager made a telephone call to Ralph Edwards, president of the CFMEU's Construction and General Division Victoria/Tasmania Divisional branch, asking him to intervene and instruct Mr Travers and Mr Hall to comply with the law.\nMr Edwards allegedly refused to do so. \"If he calls the police I won't leave, I'm just here to talk to Rod – another five minutes and we will be leaving,\" Mr Travers allegedly told the operations manager.\nRequests to leave ignored After numerous requests to leave the site were ignored, the two officials were told the police would be called. Mr Travers then told the manager, \"if you do that you are starting a war and it will be no different to what we have done with Kane,\" the regulator alleged.\n The CFMEU has been embroiled in a bitter dispute against cement giant Boral, with the company's chief executive Mike Kane outspoken on the secondary boycott he says has cost the company more than $10 million.\nSince February, 2013, the union has allegedly black-banned Boral, blocking deliveries and having construction companies turn away concrete trucks because it was supplying concrete to construction giant Grocon, which was in a dispute with the union.\nThe alleged the secondary boycott remains in place after almost two years, the company said, despite the Victorian Supreme Court issuing an injunction against the union, and the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission launching legal action in November against the union and some officials.\nThe union has continued to refuse to confirm or deny the secondary boycott was in place and is under investigation by the Royal Commission into trade union governance and corruption.\nA CFMEU spokesman said he would not comment on Mr Travers and Mr Hall's case as it was before the court. However, he added: \"The increasing levels of absurdity surrounding prosecutions of this nature should have taxpayers asking how long they're prepared to shoulder the burden of a political police force rolling out this ideological agenda.\"\nFWBC director Nigel Hadgkiss​ said reports of threats of retaliatory conduct were \"particularly concerning\".\nThe pair are accused of breaking the law on four occasions and if found guilty will face maximum penalties of up to $10,200 for an individual and $51,000 for a union per breach.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:08:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
