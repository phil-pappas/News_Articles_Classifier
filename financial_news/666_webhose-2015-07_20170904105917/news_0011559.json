Our customers, employees, and local communities around the world believe that American Apparel is an iconic brand that deserves to succeed. My job is to make that a reality.\" \nAdditionally, the company announced the appointments of Christine Olcu as general manager of global retail and Brad Gebhard as president of wholesale to help execute its global retail and wholesale turnaround strategies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T22:12:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
