The country also steeply devalued its currency, the manat. \n- Welcoming foreigners - \nIn a guide available in English, Russian and Turkmen provided to visitors of Konye-Urgench, a message from Berdymukhamedov reads: \n\"Our duty in front of our forefathers is not only to preserve these riches, but to make them accessible to the whole world.\" \nLocated 480 kilometres north of the white marble-clad capital, Ashgabat, Konye-Urgench was a seat of power for the medieval Khorezm kingdom, whose Muslim rulers controlled much of Central Asia in the 12th century after emerging from the shadow of the mighty Seljuk empire. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) after Ghengis Khan's armies razed the city in 1221, Konye-Urgench became one of the most important economic hubs along the Silk Road trade routes carrying riches from China and India to markets in Europe. \nUNESCO credits the government of Turkmenistan with generally good conservation practises, and calls Merv, another listed settlement in the country, \"the oldest and most completely preserved of the oasis cities along the Silk Roads in Central Asia.\" \nLittle is done, however, to ease access to the historic sites for foreign visitors. \n-'Intractable visa regime'- \nThe most commonly-issued visa for visitors to the country is a five-day transit visa, with longer stays generally requiring a state-endorsed tour and guides such as Amanov, who stick to the script and steer clear of politics. \n\"Ultimately, only a more open Turkmenistan might aspire to be a tourist destination,\" said Luca Anceschi, a Central Asia expert at the University of Glasgow, who called Turkmenistan's visa regime \"one of the most intractable on earth.\" \nBut Anceschi said Turkmenistan is unlikely to follow the lead of Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, two other Central Asian states that recently introduced visa-free regimes for citizens of developed countries. \n\"Breaking the isolation will certainly be equated by regime veterans as a source of instability,\" he told AFP. \nAside from the country's Silk Road heritage, tourism officials in Turkmenistan are also hoping to pique international interest in Avaza, a multi-billion dollar resort on the Caspian Sea, as well as a crater of burning gas located in the middle of the Karakum desert that local residents nicknamed \"the door to hell.\" \nThe crater, which resulted from a Soviet-era drilling rig collapse in 1971, is attracting a growing trickle of curious sightseers, a tourism official told AFP on condition of anonymity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T07:09:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
