The single currency was also at 134.41 yen against 134.89 yen. \nThe dollar was at 122.24 yen against 122.55 yen. \nOn Wall Street the Dow added 0.55 percent, the S&P 500 jumped 0.62 percent and the Nasdaq rose 0.11 percent. \nHowever, US-listed Chinese stocks -- including Alibaba and Baidu -- took a hit as the shockwaves of the rout in Shanghai reverberated globally. \n\"China?s stock market rout now spreading to other financial markets, creating a sweeping sense of panic and liquidity crunch,\" Zheng Ge, an analyst at Wanda Futures Co., said. \nThere are now fears that the hammering to stock markets will hit the wider economy, the world's second biggest, which is already struggling with slowing growth. \nWednesday's falls came despite the government announcing new measures to support the market, while Bloomberg News reported that the recent slump has led at least 1,249 companies to halt trading in the mainland, accounting for 43 percent of total listings. \nMainland Chinese markets have lost about a third of their value in just over three weeks as spooked investors cash in after a more than 150 percent rally since last summer. \nOn oil markets US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for August delivery was up seven cents to $52.40 a barrel, and Brent crude for August climbed six cents to $56.91 in morning Asian trade. \nGold fetched $1,156.06 compared with $1,165.74 late Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T06:39:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
