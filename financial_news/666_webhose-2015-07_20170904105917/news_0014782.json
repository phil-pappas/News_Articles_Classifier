Lonmin had revenue of $965 million and underlying costs of $913 million.\nImplats also has potential cash problems. During the ramp-up from the strike, the cash reserves on its balance sheet fell to R2.7 billion at the end of 2014 from R4.3 billion six months before.\nAmplats has said it expects first-half earnings to be at least 20% higher, but that is compared to the period last year when most of its mines were shut by the strike.\nAnd Lonmin may be pressured to spend more on accommodation after an enquiry into the slaying of 34 striking workers by police at its Marikana mine in 2012 found the company had failed to comply with its housing and social obligations.\nCan’t cut jobs, sell assets\nThere is little space for meaningful restructuring.\nProduction cuts could boost prices, but would require layoffs – politically all but impossible in South Africa’s charged labour environment, where union militancy has been on the rise.\nAmplats plans to offload labour-intensive assets around the platinum-belt town of Rustenburg.\nInvestec’s Rossouw said the current environment points to consolidation. “You have got to ask why platinum companies are still sinking new shafts if you can buy existing companies at a fraction of the cost of growing organically,” he said.\nBut sellers in a buyers’ market are holding tight. Sources have said the Anglo American unit will almost certainly float the mines it wants to divest because the offers it has received are too low.\nMuch of the platinum extracted in South Africa, home to more than 70% of global reserves, is mined at deep and dangerous depths, one of many factors pushing up costs.\nThe more viable operations are those that are shallow.\nPlatinum Group Metals is set to start production in the fourth quarter at its Western Bushveld Joint Venture project, in which it owns an 83% stake.\nThe partly mechanised operation has shallow depths and high grades, reducing costs to such an extent that it can make money, Chief Executive Michael Jones told Reuters.\n“Our operating cost estimate is $655 an ounce so, based on our current guidance, we can be profitable,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T14:31:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
