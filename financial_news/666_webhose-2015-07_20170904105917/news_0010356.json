Co-founder and chairman Jack Dorsey is serving as interim CEO. \nMr Dorsey said on Tuesday night that while the results show \"good progress in monetisation\", the company is \"not satisfied\" with the growth of its audience. \nOn average, Twitter had 316m monthly active users in the second quarter, up 15pc year-over-year but up less than 3pc from the first quarter of this year. \nTwitter's finance chief, Anthony Noto, said in a conference call that the company doesn't expect to see \"sustained, meaningful growth\" of its user base until it reaches the mass market. He did not say when that would be, only that it would take a considerable amount of time. \nJack Dorsey \nWhile many people are familiar with Twitter, the company has not been able to convince people that they need it. Twitter also \"remains too difficult to use\", Mr Noto said in the call, which was broadcast on Twitter's live-streaming service Periscope. \nThe assessment hammered Twitter's stock in after-hours trading. After jumping in the first minutes following the release of the earnings report, the stock did an about-face and shed more than 10pc to $32.88. \nSan Francisco-based Twitter posted a loss of $136.7m, or 21 cents per share, in the April to June period. That compares with a loss of $144.6m, or 24 cents per share, a year earlier. \nAdjusted earnings were seven cents per share, above the five cents that analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research had expected. \nRevenue jumped 61pc to $502.4m from $312.2m. Analysts had expected lower revenue of $487.4m. \nUser growth has been an ongoing challenge for Twitter, as it tries to make its service a widely-used product rather than a niche short-messaging service popular with journalists, celebrities and young people. \nFor the current quarter ending in September, Twitter said it expects revenue in the range of $545m to $560m. Analysts surveyed by Zacks expected revenue of $563.9m. \nThe company expects full-year revenue in the range of $2.2bn to $2.27bn. \nTwitter had no updates on its CEO search. \nTwitter shares have increased roughly 2pc since the beginning of the year, and have been trading near a 52-week low. They closed Tuesday at $36.54, a decline of nearly 4pc in the past 12 months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T04:36:45.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
