WPRT is expected to report second-quarter 2015 results on Jul 29. In the last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 22.86%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. \nFactors Influencing this Quarter \nWestport Innovations regularly launches new products to boost sales. The company also has strategic relationships with three of the world's top four engine producers. These relationships allow the company to utilize its collaborators’ manufacturing plants, supply chains, back office systems, and distribution and sales networks, thereby aiding significant cost savings. \nMoreover, Westport Innovations regularly makes investments and acquisitions related to technologies and businesses that complement or help in commercialization of its products. In Dec 2014, it acquired Netherlands-based Prins Autogassystemen Holding B.V., a developer of high-quality alternative fuel systems. This acquisition will expand Westport Innovations’ product portfolio, boost sales volume in Europe, Asia and North America, help it enter into new markets such as Turkey and Africa, and provide cost efficiencies. \nHowever, Westport Innovations has been incurring losses over the past several years. The company has witnessed a declining revenue trend in the recent past, and revenues are projected to decrease in 2015, thereby leading to expectations of a drop in the second quarter as well. \nEarnings Whispers \nOur proven model does not conclusively show that Westport Innovations is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: \nZacks ESP: Westport Innovations’ Earnings ESP is 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at a loss of 26 cents. \nZacks Rank: Westport Innovations carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. \nWe caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. \nStocks to Consider \nHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: \nGentherm Incorporated THRM has an Earnings ESP of +3.70% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company’s second-quarter 2015 results are scheduled to release on Jul 29. \nThe Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company GT has an Earnings ESP of +4.05% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company will report second-quarter 2015 financial numbers on Jul 29. \nO'Reilly Automotive Inc. ORLY has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company will report second-quarter 2015 financial numbers on Jul 29. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.
