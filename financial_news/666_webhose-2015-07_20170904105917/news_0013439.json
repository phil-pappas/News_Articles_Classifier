Uber applied for licences in New Delhi but kept operating while approvals were pending. \nOne of the fastest-growing sharing-economy companies, Uber operates in 57 countries, with an estimated value of more than $40 billion. It has also tangled with transportation authorities across the globe, along with attorneys seeking to deem Uber drivers employees entitled to benefits. \n(Reporting by Shivam Srivastava in Bengaluru; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T04:29:27.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
