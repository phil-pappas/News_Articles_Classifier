It calls to question how transparent the management of the excess crude revenues has been.\" \nTill the end of his tenure, Mr. Odaah, who later claimed reconciliation was ongoing with the Finance Minister, did not reveal his findings. \nHowever, several months later, Mr. Oshiomhole stirred the controversy afresh last week with the allegation that the former minister was economical with the truth about the country's finances. \nMr. Oshiomhole had lambasted Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala over her claims that Nigerians knew what the three tiers of government usually collect through the State Finance Commissioners who usually attend the monthly FAAC meetings. \nThe power to take money from the ECA, Mr. Oshiomhole argued, is vested in the NEC, an institution created by the constitution, and not State Finance Commissioners, who are not known by the constitution. \nIn disowning Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala, the Commissioners' Forum pointed out that the law setting up FAAC, which predates the ECA, \"cannot approve withdrawal and has not done so in the past.\" \nIf anything, the Commissioners said, records of FAAC meetings show that members have always queried the activities on the ECA, and therefore did not decide any withdrawal. \nAlthough the Commissioners said they observed the withdrawal of $2bn from the ECA in December 2014, the then Minister of State Finance and Chairman of FAAC, Mr. Yuguda, had explained during plenary that approval came from former President Goodluck Jonathan. \nThe withdrawals were to help pay subsidy claims to oil marketers, who had threatened to stop importing petroleum products. \n\"FAAC did not and could not have approved, nor took the decision to withdraw the sum of Two Billion U.S. Dollar ($2,000,000,000.00) from the Excess Crude Account,\" the Commissioners said.
