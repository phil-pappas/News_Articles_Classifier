The Dow 30 DJIA, +1.21% gained 0.2%, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.23% declined less than 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.53% slipped 0.2%.\nS&P 500 earnings are expected to decline by 4.4%, which would be the first decrease in earnings since the third-quarter of 2012, according to Butters.\nThat, however, is just in the sweet spot for the average lowball for earnings over the past four years. Since 2011, the average underestimation of earnings for the S&P 500 was been 4.5%, according to Birinyi Associates. The first quarter was expected to see a similar earnings drop, only for it eke out a slight gain by the end of the season.\nBirinyi Associates Expected loss? No so fast.
