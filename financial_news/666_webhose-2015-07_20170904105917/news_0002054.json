They had fallen 17 percent in the same period a year earlier. \nBarbie sales, however, continued to disappoint, falling 11 percent to $130.3 million. \nThe company reported a net loss of $11.4 million, or 3 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $28.3 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier. \nExcluding items, Mattel earned 1 cent per share, beating the average analyst estimate of a loss of 4 cents. \nNet sales fell 7 percent to $988.2 million, below the analysts' estimate of $995.4 million. \nMattel's shares closed at $25.15 on Thursday, having fallen 18.7 percent this year. \n(Reporting by Nayan Das in Bengaluru; Editing by Simon Jennings) Consumer Discretionary", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T02:00:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
