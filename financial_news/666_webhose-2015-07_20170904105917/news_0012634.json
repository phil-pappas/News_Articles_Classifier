The bid is still being examined by regulators, including the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which has asked interested parties to comment on whether supply competition may be affected by the amalgamation of Shell's and BG's interests in Queensland, including its 50 per cent interest in Arrow Energy.\nOnce the QCLNG venture reaches full capacity, 10 LNG tankers a month will be loading at BG's Gladstone project, exporting about 8 million tonnes a year. Since production from the first LNG train started in late December, 27 cargoes have been shipped.\n\"We have already shipped more than 1.5 million tonnes of LNG from Queensland and train 2 will add significant further volumes and flexibility to our LNG shipping and marketing portfolio,\" BG global chief executive Helge Lund said in a statement on Monday.\nMuch of the LNG from the first train at QCLNG is being shipped to BG's biggest customer for the project, Chinese oil major CNOOC. However CNOOC doesn't have a stake in the second train, which will supplement BG's global portfolio of LNG supplies.\nThe ACCC is set to announce a decision on the Shell-BG merger on September 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T18:34:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
