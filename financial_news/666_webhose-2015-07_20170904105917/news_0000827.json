For many, the data suggested a rate hike as soon as September.\nThe dollar index composed of the euro and five other currencies traded against the greenback touched a high last seen on May 27 and was last up 0.50 percent.\nThe euro, which had inched up briefly after Greek legislators signed off on tough bailout terms, was last down 0.70 percent against the dollar at $1.0875. The euro zone common currency had dipped as low as $1.0857, a level last seen in late May.\nThe euro also fell against the yen and was last off 0.35 percent to 135 yen.\n\"The Greek saga has crowded the euro for a long time,\" said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac in New York. \"And now that it's moving to the sidelines, it is letting the positives of the dollar and the negatives of the euro come to the fore.\"\nEuropean policymakers battling slow growth are lowering rates and buying bonds, even as Fed officials overseeing an expanding economy are nearing rate increases that make U.S. assets relatively more lucrative for investors.\n\"Now that Greece is somewhat resolved, the argument has shifted back to monetary policy divergence between the euro zone, UK and U.S.,\" said Tobias Davis, corporate hedging manager at Western Union in London.\nHe pointed to rises in the cost of dollar two-month forward swaps for euros as evidence of firming expectations that U.S. rates are heading higher.\nThe dollar was ahead 0.30 percent against the yen at 124.13 yen and down 0.50 percent against sterling, which has rallied in recent days, in part because UK officials have been hinting at raising interest rates.\nWeak New Zealand inflation numbers added to pressure from a closely watched auction that showed global dairy prices slumped to a 12-1/2-year low, pushing the New Zealand dollar as low as $0.6498, its lowest since 2009.
