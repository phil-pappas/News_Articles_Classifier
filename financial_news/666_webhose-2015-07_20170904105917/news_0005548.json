The plea resolves the criminal prosecution against him.\nAll told, nine defendants were charged with participating in one or both schemes; seven have pleaded guilty thus far.\nThe fee scheme involved boiler rooms in four countries, where the defendants called penny stock investors and convinced them to pay advance fees that the defendants promised would allow them to sell their shares and recover any losses, prosecutors said.\nInstead, the fees were simply pocketed, prosecutors said.\nLocal authorities in Thailand arrested Winick there in 2013 and he was extradited to the United States. He faces up to 20 years in prison when he is sentenced.\nHis defense lawyer did not respond to a request for comment on Friday afternoon.
