HYDERABAD | BENGALURU: For Aditya Agarwal, owner of T-shirt brand Campus Sutra, receiving a return parcel made him as frustrated as an online shopper who received a dish-wash bar in lieu of a phone. Behind the glamour of being a micro-entrepreneur within the burgeoning ecommerce ecosystem is the handwringing process of tallying and reconciling payments, taking into account returns and transaction charges, keeping fingers crossed that the ledgers end up balanced. \"There have been times when we have been charged Rs 1,500 for shipping a package weighing less than half a kilo,\" said Agarwal, who now retails on 15 marketplaces. The seller recently received a computer spare part in a return parcel, and he was unsure how to account for it. As marketplaces race to woo sellers to their platforms, a serious evaluation of billing and payment systems is under way. Each marketplace follows its own settlement processes, and to complete a cycle, it can take from a week to as much as two months in case of returns. Delays in settlements can seriously hurt the sellers. \"It's a question of working capital that merchants need on the run to replenish â€” some sellers can afford (to wait), but it hits medium and small sellers the most,\" said Ganesa G, a former Flipkart employee who cofounded Sellerworx, a management platform for online merchants. Aishwarya Tiwari, who owns women's clothing brand Fuchsia Women, confirmed this. \"I use my profit accruals to fund the set of orders as payment cycle takes time to close,\" she told ET. Flipkart and Snapdeal refused to comment, though sources said both are in the process of overhauling their billing mechanisms. Online payment wallet Paytm , which launched its ecommerce platform in February, and Amazon India own their payment gateways, which gives them more control on the settlement process than those who don't have their own systems. \"Payments are obviously critical in helping sellers. They receive their payments in seven days (from Paytm),\" said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder and chief executive of One97-owned Paytm. For platforms that make use of payment gateways like Citrus Pay and PayU, the amount is credited in a day's time. But the ball rests with the marketplace to release the payment from escrow, depending on the successful delivery of the product by the seller. \"The delay happens as different teams in a marketplace do the accounting, adding costs for shipping. Owning a payment gateway will not change the turnaround time,\" said Nitin Gupta, CEO of PayU. \"Having our own payment gateway gives us more control, but does not necessarily shorten the payment process since there is also an external dependency on the clearing and settlement infrastructure,\" said Ram Papatla , director of seller product management at Amazon India. Currently, most of the seller control panels do not have the option to check the amount to be credited in the coming settlement cycle. Payment gateway Citrus Pay has received multiple requests from major marketplaces over the past three months to streamline the process of seller payments for real-time tracking and transparency, said Founder and Managing Director Jitendra Gupta.
