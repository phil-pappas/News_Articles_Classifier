() ET SPECIAL: Love visual aspect of news? Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! NEW DELHI: The finance ministry is seeking support of Indian embassies to draw investors for its massive disinvestment programme that has barely moved four months into the current financial year. For this, the ministry has identified two countries, Australia and Japan, where it sees heightened interest towards India. The disinvestment department is in touch with the Indian missions to generate interest among local institutional investors, a senior finance ministry official said on the condition of anonymity. \"Following the visits of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to some of these countries, there is a huge interest to participate in the Indian growth story. We want to capitalise on that,\" the official said. Some discussions have already been held with pension funds and other institutional investors in both Australia and Japan on the government disinvest programme.The government has a target to raise Rs 69,500 crore through disinvestment in this fiscal year and Rs 41,000 crore of this is estimated to come from sale of stakes in stateowned companies. The disinvestment department in the finance ministry has Cabinet approvals for selling shares worth about Rs 50,000 crore in around 20 companies. \"This (seeking support of foreign missions) is in addition to the consultations that we do through merchant bankers, which is typically followed by roadshows before the stake sale. The idea is to generate interest among such institutional investors and be in constant dialogue, which was earlier limited to roadshows,\" the official said. TWO BASKETS The government is close to appointing merchant bankers for selling stakes in 10 companies, bundled into two baskets. Bankers have been asked to bid for managing the share sale of all the companies in a group. \"In a similar fashion, we will hold the roadshows. All stocks of one category will have a roadshow simultaneously in different locations. The idea is to keep the market guessing on which issue may come up first, and also reduce the time and expenses,\" said another finance ministry official aware of the deliberations. The first basket comprises OIL India, where the government intends to divest a 10% stake, Container Corporation of India (5%), NMDC (10%), MMTC (15%) and ITDC (12.03%). At current market prices, the Centre may be able to raise around Rs 9,800 crore by selling shares in these firms. The second basket has NTPC (5%), Engineers India (10%), Bharat Electronics (5%), National Aluminium Co (10%) and Hindustan Copper (15%). These deals could fetch Rs 9,600 crore. The finance ministry expects to launch an issue as early as end-August. \"By then, we will have appointed the bankers and done some roadshows. So, if market conditions are conducive, we should be having an issue each month starting early September,\" said the first official. The government also has approval for selling a 10% stake in the country's biggest refiner and fuel retailer, Indian Oil , besides a 5% stake in Oil & Natural Gas Corp. It is also close to launching the second tranche of the CPSE-Exchange Traded Fund, which comprises shares of state-run companies. Any mechanism to further market the government issues is a welcome step, experts said. \"Despite concerns, the market is still strong. The government should take advantage of the current market situation and restart its programme,\" said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of fundamental research at Karvy Stock Broking.
