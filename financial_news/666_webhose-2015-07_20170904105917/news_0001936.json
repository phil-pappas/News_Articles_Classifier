I saw three managers come and go in two years for similar reasons.”\nThe stress was so bad many former retail assistants and managers complained of losing weight from it. In some cases harassing calls from head office were constant throughout the day.\nAfter the controversial job ad that said staff had to be have specific body measurements, this week founder and designer Lorna Jane Clarkson defended her business by saying her staff came in “all shapes and sizes”. But ex-staff say that isn’t correct.\nLorna Jane Clarkson at a business breakfast, signing her book.
