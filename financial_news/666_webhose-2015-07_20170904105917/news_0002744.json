The auto lending industry's choice is to have a regulator \"in their business constantly\" or take the steps outlined in the Honda agreement to respond to concerns that minority consumers are charged more for credit, he said.\nAutoNation on Wednesday reported second-quarter net income from continuing operations of $115 million, or $1.00 a share, up from $101 million, or 83 cents a share, on a comparable basis a year ago.\nThe results fell short of some analysts' forecasts, and the company's shares dropped 4 percent.\nJackson said the company chose to spend more during the just-ended quarter to speed the rollout of its AutoNation Express online shopping services, completing by the end of June work the company had said would take all year.\nAutoNation will invest in its online commerce efforts and reduce reliance on independent car-shopping websites, Jackson said. AutoNation earlier this month severed ties with auto shopping site TrueCar Inc.\n\"If you go through third parties, you are paying to build their brand,\" Jackson said. \"We are going to invest to build our brand.\"\nIn the latest quarter, those investments contributed to higher expenses than some analysts had anticipated, Jackson said.\n\"I am not going to get nailed down and lose my flexibility by giving a micro-roadmap for how we are implementing this big, complex initiative,\" Jackson said.
