Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of 4 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nSecond-quarter output from continuing operations, excluding Libya, was 1.595 million barrels oil equivalent per day (boed), an increase of 39,000 boed compared from a year ago.\nConoco said it was on track to achieve the higher end of its 2015 production growth target of 2 percent to 3 percent, helped by higher output from U.S. shale fields.\n(Reporting by Anna Driver ; Editing by Alden Bentley and Bernadette Baum)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T15:09:53.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
