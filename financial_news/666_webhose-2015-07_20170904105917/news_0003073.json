Jonathan Wheatley and Jude Webber ©Bloomberg \nWhich way would you play the Mexican peso? The country that is seen by many analysts as one of the few bright spots in the emerging world is also home to one of its worst performing currencies this year. \nThe peso hit an intraday low of more than 15.83 to the US dollar on Thursday, its weakest since the currency’s revaluation in 1993. It has been on a slide since the middle of last year, when it was trading at about 13 to the dollar. More Gulf nations show promise in outbound FDI \nAnalysts say several factors are at work. Most obviously, as an exporter of crude, Mexico was hit by the steep fall in the oil price from June 2014. Last year’s slide may also have been exacerbated by a view on markets that the US Federal Reserve would move more aggressively than previously thought to tighten monetary policy. \nJosé Isaac Velasco, senior economist at Banco Ve Por Más, says the proximity of a Fed rate rise has contributed to the peso’s recent falls, along with market turbulence from the Greek crisis and the possibility of a nuclear deal with Iran that could see its return to oil production. \n“The effect [of Greece] on the peso has been stronger than on other emerging market currencies because the peso is used as a hedging instrument in the region because it is more liquid,” he said. \nBernd Berg, currency strategist at Société Générale in London, expects this underperformance to continue. On May 8, when the peso was at 15.24 to the dollar, he recommended borrowing pesos to buy dollars. At the time, he expected the peso to fall towards 16 to the dollar, generating enough profit on the position to justify its negative “carry” — the difference between funding costs in Mexico and the US — of 0.23 percentage points a month. \nOn Wednesday, with the peso at 15.79 to the dollar, he put out a note saying the trade had made a profit of 3.5 per cent net of the carry cost and reiterated his recommendation, now with a target rate of 17 to the dollar. “MXN remains one of the EM currencies most vulnerable to renewed stress in EM over the next month once Fed fears resurface,” he wrote. \nBut not everyone thinks the peso will keep falling. \n“I think it’s very premature to be talking about those levels [17 pesos to the dollar],” said Mr Velasco at Ve Por Más. He noted that a recent poll of 26 banks by Banamex, a big bank, found a median prediction of 15.09 to the dollar at the end of this year, although in a wide range between 14.30 and 16.50. \nBenito Berber, currency strategist at Nomura in New York, takes the opposite view to Mr Berg at SocGen. He sees the peso trading this year in a range of 15.00 to 15.60, which he says it has broken out of temporarily as the Greek crisis has been transmitted to Mexico through the channel of falling US share prices (Mexico’s economy being intimately linked to that of the US, where it sends 85 per cent of its exports). \nBut the peso will recover, Mr Berber says: the government’s reform programme will bear fruit and, specifically, plans to auction 14 oil and gas exploration blocks on July 15 in the same area as recent big discoveries will buoy Mexican assets. \nAccordingly, he recommends betting on the peso’s appreciation — but not simply against the US dollar. He and his colleague João Pedro Ribeiro this week recommended borrowing Brazilian reals to buy Mexican pesos — at a carry cost of about 0.87 percentage points a month. \nThe trade uses a three-month forward rate of 4.91 pesos to the real at its inception, with a target of 4.71. The spot rate, at about 5.05 when the trade opened, would have to reach about 4.86. (It was 4.64 in March, Mr Berber notes.) \n“The carry is so huge, this trade has to work in the next few weeks or we’ll get killed on the interest rate differential,” Mr Berber admits. \nWhy would it work? On one side of the trade, says Mr Berber, is Mexico’s positive outlook. On the other is the negative one in Brazil. \n“There is clearly political risk in Brazil,” he says. “We think Moody’s [the rating agency] will downgrade the country, and its economy needs a macro adjustment that requires a much weaker nominal exchange rate.” \nThe Brazilian real fell sharply against the US dollar over the past year as the extent of its economic malaise — and of a multibillion dollar corruption scandal — became clear to investors. It recovered somewhat after the crisis passed its initial peak. \nWhy not simply play the real against the US dollar? The carry cost is a bit less, the difference between Brazilian and Mexican interest rates being about 10 percentage points a year, compared with about 13.5 between Brazil and the US. And Mr Berber believes the peso will strengthen against the dollar, adding to the position’s upside. \nPerhaps Mr Berg will take the other side of his trade. \nFollow us on Twitter @em_sqrd Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
