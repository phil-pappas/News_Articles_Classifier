You can't say you weren't warned,\" stressed Beulin. \nAlthough agriculture only accounts for two percent of French gross domestic product, farming provides nearly one million jobs directly or indirectly and politicians pay close heed to the industry's mood. \nThe dairy industry has suffered a triple shock from the Russian embargo on Western products over the Ukraine crisis, a dip in Chinese demand and the end in April of European milk quotas. \nAccording to recent figures from the French agriculture ministry, the price of milk bought from the producer plunged by 12 percent in May compared with the same month the previous year -- to 303 euros per 1,000 litres. \nMeat producers have also been hit by the Russian embargo and are battling strong competition from neighbouring countries such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands. \nValls has also stressed that \"the government cannot act alone\". He called on \"everyone to live up to their responsibilities\", including retailers and the food processing industry. \nHollande has also insisted that consumers play their role, calling on them to \"eat French-produced food as much as possible.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T14:50:12.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
