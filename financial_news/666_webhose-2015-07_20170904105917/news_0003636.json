Louie Douvis by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Boutique brokers are lining up to pitch for work on the $100 million initial public offering of Class Super planned for later this year.\nClass Super chairman Barry Lambert has already appointed Addisons Lawyers, who handled the legalities when he listed Countplus in 2010 and sold Count Financial to CBA in 2012.\nGrant Thornton were also engaged a few months ago. Morgan Stanley knows the IT business well, having taken it out on a pre-IPO beauty pageant to fund managers in 2013.\nBut with the free-float tipped to be no greater than $25 million, the deal will likely be too small for any of the major investment banks to pick-up.\nBrokers will face a hard sell to win the job, with the hands-on chairman questioning whether the board even needs to appoint one following early indications that demand for a preference offer will be strong.\nElsewhere, Street Talk understands Baby Bunting has appointed Morgans as a co-manager for its upcoming initial public offering, in addition to sole lead manager Morgan Stanley.\nBaby Bunting plans to launch its management roadshow in mid-September and lodge its prospectus at the end of that month.\nFinally, Beston Global Food Company is understood to have secured firm commitments for more than $100 million, which was the minimum raise required to proceed with the company's initial public offering.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T19:05:39.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
