The target’s shares closed that day at 108.60 pence.\nThe new bid puts pressure on Bwin.party, whose board agreed to support 888’s bid even though the offer for the Gibraltar-based company was lower than GVC’s. There’s been a series of acquisitions in the online gaming industry in recent years, driven both by the growth of the online gaming industry and the increased regulation of it as governments raise taxes and seek to reduce crime. Bwin.party was formed by a 2011 merger and Chief Executive Officer Norbert Teufelberger has been considering a sale since at least November.\nThe global online gaming market is set to grow 8.7 percent a year to $48.6 billion by 2018, 888 has said, citing H2 Gambling Capital estimates.\nGVC would finance the bid with new shares and a 400 million-pound senior secured loan from Cerberus Capital Management LP. The company also plans to raise about 150 million pounds by selling new GVC shares to fund restructuring costs and the refinancing of existing Bwin.party debt. GVC earlier proposed paying 110 pence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T10:03:50.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
