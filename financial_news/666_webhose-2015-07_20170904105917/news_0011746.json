The word “bankrupt” derives from banco rotto , meaning “broken bench”. Italy’s contemporary bankruptcy laws are less violent (though until 2006 debtors lost their right to vote, and had their mail read by liquidators). But the system is painfully slow, and usually ends in liquidation rather than restructuring.\nItaly’s justice ministry has appointed a commission to come up with plans for a comprehensive overhaul. It is due to report in December. In the meantime, the government last week introduced an emergency decree aimed at unblocking a backlog of bad loans. The hope is that this would allow banks to lend to more deserving companies instead and so boost the economy, which after three years of recession grew by 0.3% in the first quarter.\nIn this section Cornering the markets Right back where we started A Caribbean fuse Small is ugly Beautifying bankruptcy A middle-class mirage Credit where taxes are due Business Companies Corporate bankruptcies Europe Italy\nItaly’s slow and inefficient civil-justice system is one of the biggest constraints on growth and investment. The World Bank’s “Doing Business” report ranks Italy 147th out of 189 countries on the ease of enforcing contracts. The process typically takes 1,185 days, compared with a rich-country average of 540. Italy fares better on resolving insolvency: it comes 29th. But that still puts the country far behind most advanced economies.\nBankruptcies take more than six years on average—down from nine in 2008—and foreclosure lasts four-and-a-half, longer than almost anywhere in Europe (see chart). This has become especially problematic as the financial crisis has caused the number of companies in distress to soar: annual corporate insolvencies rose from around 6,000 in 2007 to more than 14,000 a year in 2013 and 2014. The result is a mass of impaired loans—€325 billion ($360 billion) as of December—weighing down banks’ balance-sheets. That is 16% of all loans, up from 5% in 2007. Roberto Nicastro of UniCredit, Italy’s biggest bank, says bad debt is so common that some firms avoid creating receivables for fear they will not be paid, choosing instead to sell only to those who pay straight away.\nThese bad debts stay with the banks for reasons both of supply and demand. On the one hand, banks are reluctant to sell them or write them off because they do not want to acknowledge the losses involved. Write-off periods have slowed to more than six years, compared with four before the crisis. On the other hand, there are few buyers because restructuring is so hard. Mediobanca, a Milanese investment bank, estimates that buyers typically offer 25% less for dud loans than banks are hoping to receive.\nThe emergency decree aims to speed things up and increase the amount creditors recover. In bankruptcy proceedings, deadlines will be imposed that, if unmet, will result in the liquidator’s dismissal. In the case of a concordato preventivo , Italy’s equivalent of America’s Chapter 11, creditors holding at least 10% of the overall debt will be able to file competing restructuring plans (until now creditors could only approve or reject the debtor’s plan). These will then be submitted to the creditors for a vote and the most popular plan presented to the court. The decree also introduces a scheme by which a restructuring plan can be approved if at least 75% of the creditors agree on it. In addition, credit losses will now be tax-deductible in a single year rather than over five, which should make admitting them more attractive.\nThese measures are intended to increase the value of Italy’s impaired loans and facilitate sales. Lorenzo Stanghellini of the University of Florence thinks they might speed foreclosures by about a year and bankruptcy proceedings by two. But their impact will not be seen for a while, since most of the rules apply only to new cases. Moreover, Mediobanca estimates that shortening recovery periods by a year would reduce the gap between banks’ expectations for bad debt and buyers’ offers by only three percentage points.\nMore dramatic successes will depend on the sweeping reforms to be unveiled later this year. Tommaso Foco of Portolano Cavallo, an Italian law firm, says that bankruptcy is still a source of shame in Italy, so that by the time entrepreneurs admit they are struggling it is often too late to save the company. Taking the stigma out of bankruptcy may be just as hard as streamlining the proceedings it involves.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/print-edition/20150704_FNC820.png", "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/290-width/images/print-edition/20150704_FNP005_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T05:08:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
