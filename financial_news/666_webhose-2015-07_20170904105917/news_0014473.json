This was stronger than June's reading of 14pc. \nOptimism about future growth also remained high, with a positive balance of 27pc of companies expecting stronger growth over the next three months . \nIt came as GfK’s UK consumer confidence index fell in July, with three of the five measures used to calculate the index registering decreases. \nJoe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK (Swiss: GFK.SW - news ) , said: “Concerns about the general economic situation in the UK for the next 12 months appear to be weighing heavily on consumers’ minds at present. \n\"However, on a more personal level, consumers remain resolutely upbeat about their own financial situation for the coming 12 months.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T08:44:58.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
