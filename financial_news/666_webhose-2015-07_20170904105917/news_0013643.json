New software could be written to encrypt the traffic in future devices, but the technology is already embedded inside popular hardware without that functionality and no clear way to install it.\nGlobalstar representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\nMoore said his work would be easy to replicate and that organized crime, intelligence agencies or others may already be eavesdropping on the network.\nTracking-system devices using the Globalstar network are handy for monitoring shipments, sending longitude and latitude coordinates through dozens of low-earth orbiting satellites. They can also carried by travelers and used for search-and-rescue missions.\nSome devices send additional binary signals, for example reporting whether whether an alarm has been tripped, which can also be intercepted and decoded or imitated with false information.\nMajor oil and gas companies are among Globalstar's customers. Moore said he did not know how many other satellite networks could have similar vulnerability to eavesdropping or faked traffic.
