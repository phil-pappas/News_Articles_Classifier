We need to continue along this path.\" \nAmong the euro member states, Greece had the highest rate at 25.6 percent and Germany the lowest level at 4.7 percent. \nThe EU's executive Commission has been pushing hard to create job-boosting measures and as of this fall, the European Investment Bank will start selecting projects to invest in using a 315 billion euro program that seeks to create some 1.3 million jobs. \nGreece also had the highest level of youth unemployment at 53.2 percent in April, the last month for which it had statistics available. That's more than twice the eurozone average of 22.5 percent. \nMeanwhile, the eurozone's annual inflation rate was 0.2 percent in July, the same as the previous month and still well below the European Central Bank's target of 2 percent. \nEconomists have warned of the risk of a prolonged period of low or negative inflation rates, as that can discourage investment and spending. The ECB this year launched a massive monetary stimulus program to bring up inflation, but it is expected to take months for the rate to rise significantly, particularly since a drop in oil prices is still weighing on the overall level of consumer prices. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T16:07:31.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
