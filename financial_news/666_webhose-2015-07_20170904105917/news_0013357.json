That would be preferable only if the value of the business is depressed at the time of the IPO, he said.\n“We are focused most intensely on a one-step process,” Huntsman said.\nHuntsman in October paid $1 billion for the pigment assets of Rockwood Holdings Inc. and combined them with its own titanium dioxide assets. Its plan to separate the business by the end of 2016 follows DuPont Co.’s July 1 spinoff of Chemours Co., the world’s largest maker of titanium dioxide, a paint ingredient known by its chemical formula TiO2.\nBy selling at least half of the business, the volatile financials associated with TiO2 would no longer be included in Huntsman’s financial statements, boosting the value investors place on the remaining businesses, the CEO said.\n“We would like to deconsolidate it as quickly as we can,” Huntsman said.\nThe company, which is based in Salt Lake City and run from The Woodlands, Texas, is also considering spinning off the pigment unit to shareholders, or merging it with another TiO2 business, he said.\nReady Tomorrow “If there was a merger opportunity that would improve the value of our stock and would be the right decision longer term for our shareholders, I’d be doing it tomorrow,” Huntsman said. “There is nothing magic about waiting until the end of next year.”\nTiO2 prices, which are near a four-year low, are poised to improve because customers’ inventories are shrinking and many producers are struggling to make a profit, he said.\n“I personally think that a year from now, a year and half from now, we will see a much healthier market for TiO2 than now,” Huntsman said.\nThe company earlier today posted second-quarter earnings of 63 cents a share, beating the 55-cent average estimate of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
