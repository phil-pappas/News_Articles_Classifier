However, with voters rejecting the conditions of the country's paymasters, the ECB is almost certain to keep ELA frozen at nearly €88.4bn prolonging the squeeze on the financial system. \nFinance minister Yanis Varoufakis is due to discuss extending capital controls measures with the Greece's senior bankers on Sunday night. Greek stock markets have also been suspended since last week. \nThe prolonged period of uncertainty is expected to roil European equities and see investors flock to safe haven assets such as US and German government bonds. \nAhead of the vote on Friday, Europe’s leading blue-chip index, the Stoxx 50, plunged 4.96pc its lowest level since last December. \nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) now estimate the index will will drop by as much as 10pc following the 'No' result which is set to guarantee another period of protracted negotiation between both parties. \n\"Look initially for a general sell-off in global equities, along with price pressures on the bonds issued by Greece, other peripheral eurozone economies and emerging markets,\" warned Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz. \nAs it happened: The morning of Greek Referendum Day \nBritain's benchmark FTSE 100 it set to open 2.2pcpc lower by 150 points according to IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) . Germany's DAX was expected to fall 4pc when markets opened on Monday morning, with US stocks in the red by 1.3pc. \nThe euro dropped by 1.2pc against the dollar as results showing a 60pc majority for the 'No' vote trickled in. \nAmong the beneficiaries from the sell-off will be the Swiss franc which saw fresh inflows following the decision to announce a referendum last week. It forced the Swiss National Bank to intervene to hold down the value of the franc as the spectre of a Greek exit draws ever-closer. \n\"Grexit\" has now become the base-case scenario for a number of economists. Analysts at Teneo Intelligence put the liklihood at 75pc. \nThe ECB however is expected to wait until July 20 - when it is owed €3.5bn from the Greek government before pull ELA. Should the governing council decide to take such action, Greece will be on the inexorable path of a disorderly eurozone exit, warned Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) . \nAEP Defiant Greeks reject EU demands as Syriza readies IOU currency \n\"This situation could not last more than a few days, beyond which the Greek government would have to decide to take back the control over the central bank of Greece and force it to provide liquidity support to Greek banks, therefore printing de facto another currency,\" said Francoi Cabau at Barclays. \nPrime Minister David Cameron will meet with Chancellor George Osborne and governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney on Monday discuss the fall-out from the referendum on Britain's financial stability. \nAhead of the vote, European Parliament president Martin Schulz warned a 'No' decision would mean Greeks could no longer use the euro, forcing them to print IOUs to pay public sector salaries and pensions. \n\"If they say ‘no’ they will have to introduce another currency after the referendum because the euro is not available as a means of payment,\" said Mr Schulz. \n\"The moment someone introduces a new currency, they exit the eurozone.” \nSmall businesses in Greece have already resorted to the use of private currencies to alleviate the liquidity crunch and continue operating in lieu of payment. \nA 'No' vote is now set to trigger a flurry of diplomatic activity across Europe's capitals. \nAthens' Hard Left government has promised to continue dialogue with its creditors having been given a vote of confidence by the electorate. The European Union will hold an emergency meeting of finance ministers and leaders on Tuesday. \nBefore that, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to meet with her French counterpart Francois Hollande in Paris on Monday to discuss how to proceed with negotiations following the 'No' vote. \nJeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the eurogroup, described the vote as \"regrettable\". \n\"This result is very regrettable for the future of Greece. For recovery of the Greek economy, difficult measures and reforms are inevitable. We will now wait for the initiatives of the Greek authorities,\" said Mr Dijsselbloem. \nGoverning member of the ECB Benoit Coeure said the institution stands ready to take additional measures to quell market anxiety about the reversibility of the euro. \n\"In the current circumstances of great uncertainty in Europe and the world, the ECB has been clear that if we need to do more we will do more. We will find the necessary instruments,\" said Mr Coeure ahead of the referendum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T03:07:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
