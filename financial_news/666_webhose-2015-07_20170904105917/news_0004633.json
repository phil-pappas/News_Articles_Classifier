Or exceedingly loud, in both sound and appearance?\nProbably not, but I still have the rest of the page to fill. And there are automotive nuances, even at the extremities.\nSo let's start with the appearance. It looks like … well, you've probably seen by now, but no photo quite sums up just how extrovert those avant garde, geometric lines look when mingling with Corollas and Commodores.\nInspired by the angularity of stealth fighter jets, this is the car that can make the same company's smaller Huracan model look almost understated.\nIt can cause other cars to speed up or slow down to get a better look, force pedestrians to do a double take and, most surprisingly of all, impel young men in twin-cab utes and old Falcons to attempt ludicrous overtaking moves or deep dives into the braking zone to prove, well, I'm not quite sure.\nIt can even draw a crowd in a 110 km/h area, I discovered. A multiple vehicle pile-up had stopped traffic across all three lanes for 55 minutes. Everyone left their cars and a surprising number of them gathered around \"my\" bright red, road-going missile.\nThose that tapped on the window to talk were knowledgeable and enthusiastic. Those who merely looked may have been tempering their frustration at the delay with just a little schadenfreude : \"See, my 2008 Impreza has covered just as much distance over the past hour as that $900K supercar.\"\n Supreme capabilities They would be right, of course. Having such supreme capabilities and 700 brake horsepower (that's the 700 in the fully named Aventador LP 700-4) confers almost no advantages whatsoever most of the time. And a 2008 Impreza is roomier and easier to get in and out of.\nBut to rationalise like that is to miss the point.\nThis is a car aimed at those who admire outrageous engineering and traditional, large-capacity supercar engines, who will probably rent a racetrack occasionally, and who aren't planning to sneak up on anyone.\nSuch people possibly have a spare quid or two as well.\nThe Aventador was first sold in late 2011, replacing the Murcielago​ at the top of the Lambo totem.\nSince then there have been various updates, some of them involved in pulling it up to Euro 6 emissions compliance.\nThe power output has remained the same, though a \"750\" has just supplemented the standard model in Europe, with extra power and lower weight.\nThe car's name comes not from the combination of \"a vent\" and \"a door\", both of which can be found on the side profile but, in keeping with Lamborghini tradition, from the world of bull-fighting.\nAventador was the name of a beast that apparently put up such a heroic fight in 1993 he was awarded a special title of valour. For all the good it did him.\nThe car is almost comically wide and just 1.136 metres tall. It is built around a lightweight carbon-fibre monocoque.\nAccess via the scissor doors is not too bad, and they are quite compact in the way they open, enabling you to park in tight spaces, if you are game enough.\nFrom the driver's seat you are looking through the largest flattest windscreen imaginable. The A-pillars are long and wide while the rear three-quarters view is pretty miserable.\nRear-most visibility is surprisingly good, however, with the (optional) glass slats covering the massive, mid-mounted engine. This view changes slightly as the rear spoiler rises and falls automatically according to road speed.\nIt is also surprising how much you can see through the big, outrigger external mirrors.\nThe wraparound seats are comfortable and keep you in place. Luggage space is minimal, restricted to a small \"boot\" in the nose and the hint of a parcel shelf behind the two seats.\nThe biggest disappointment is that the intruding wheel arch gives slightly offset pedals. This leaves you (or at least me) in a slightly twisted position and brings to mind the ergonomics of earlier Italian cars.\nIt's probably fine in the left-hand drive cars (and in the right-hand drive Huracan), though that's not much consolation. Then again, you do get used to it.\nThere are three driving modes: Strada, Sport and Corsa (street, sport and racing), selected with a switch on the centre console. Deciding Corsa wasn't appropriate for the strada, I stuck with Sport.\nThere is an almighty growl during acceleration in this mode and a gushing, crackling response to any lift off the throttle pedal.\nLane changes are never hard, not with 6.5 litres of V12 at your disposal.\nSounds surround It isn't only the engine that creates a racket. The cabin noise on course bitumen can be enormous, the ride is very firm and the race-car style pushrod suspension is also vocal on uneven bitumen.\nThe ceramic brake rotors grind quite a bit around town.\nBut, hey, if you wanted a luxury car you wouldn't have bought an Aventador. And those rotors sure pull the big coupe up.\nThe gearbox can be pretty rough at low engine speeds, though the obvious solution is to stick with high engine speeds, where the changes take a heartbeat or less. This is an engine that loves to spin; the maximum power occurs at 8250 rpm, which is right up there for a V12.\nAt 110 km/h the engine is ticking over at just 2400rpm in seventh gear.\nRest to 100 km/h is claimed as 2.9 seconds, a figure aided by the standard all-wheel drive system.\nBy any road car measure, that's seriously quick; anything under 3 seconds is moving from supercar to hypercar territory.\nAs if to demonstrate how much power is needed when playing the 0-100 game, the new 750 model pulls that acceleration time back just one-tenth of a second, despite its power and weight advantages.\nTop speed of the 700 is 350km/h.\nThat engine is a beautifully presented in its glass \"display box\"; the general quality of the fit and finish – and the car's overall solidity – is high.\nThe price of our car was $761,500 and about $78,000 worth of accessories were fitted including those glass slats over the engine ($14,800) and a parking sensor/rear camera combo at $9600.\nFACT BOX\nLamborghini Aventador LP 700-4 coupe\nPrice (excluding on road costs): $761,500 (as tested $839,900)\nEngine : 6.5-litre V12 (petrol)\nPower/torque : 515 kW/690 Nm\nFuel economy (combined cycle): 17.2 L/100 km\nCO2 : 398g/km", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T01:04:58.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
