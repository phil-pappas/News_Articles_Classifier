The country’s currency strengthened.\nThe National Bank of Hungary will keep its benchmark at 1.35 percent “for a very long time,” Matolcsy told reporters in Budapest on Tuesday, after the central bank cut the rate by 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, earlier in the day. The reduction was more than the 10 basis points forecast by the majority of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.\nPolicy makers have taken the main rate to its record low from 7 percent in the past three years, including a pause between July last year and March. The monetary authority continued easing after eastern European countries including Poland and Romania ended reductions as they eye the start of tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Hungarian rate setters earlier cited moderate inflation, the desire to lower sovereign-debt financing costs and the need to boost economic growth for continuing with cuts.\n“We think we were able to create one of the most favorable business environments of Hungarian economic history with these two rate-cut cycles,” Matolcsy said.\nThe forint strengthened as much as 0.9 percent against the euro to 307.45, its strongest since May 25, and traded at 307.66 as of 2:51 p.m. in Budapest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on Hungary’s three-year government bonds rose eight basis points to 2.22 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T16:04:10.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
