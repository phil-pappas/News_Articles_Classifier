Photo: Glenn Hunt\nThree years ago the then managing director of Hugo Boss Australia photographed a strange-looking plant and pondered how he might be able to retrieve information on any object once it was captured.\nThe moment made such an impression on Eric Fink that he quit the high-end fashion chain and started work on Snaploader, a mobile app which uses advanced visual recognition technology to reveal relevant information about inanimate objects.\nHe is seeking $500,000 mostly to help his team sell it to the bigger agency networks.\nThe mind boggles as to how this could be applied. Photograph a car in the street and get the stats, price and local dealerships. Snap a famous building or monument and instantly call up its entire history. Fink opted for what he saw as the best commercial application: snap a house for sale and retrieve all the relevant information and photos and add in a 3D image of its internal structure.\nDavid Newton: \"It's almost too easy.\" Photo: Jazz Stephens\nAlready nine agencies in the Sydney area are offering Snaploader to their clients. At a cost of $160 to the vendor, it is added to normal advertising costs. Agents using it say it has revolutionised information flows between buyers and sellers. \"It's almost too easy\", says David Newton, principal of Newton Real Estate in Sydney's Sutherland Shire.\nAdvertisement Snaploader does not only offer instant images. Newton says the app automatically updates viewing and auction times and any changes to the status of the house. It can alert interested parties if an offer has been made or deliver the results of an auction.\nIt works in several \"theatres\" – photograph an actual property, a signboard photo, a newspaper image or even a website graphic and the information arrives. \"If offers more than just a website – the relevant details come up immediately and are stored,\" Newton says.\n\"The buyers will also know what's going on with any property because the app updates them. Our vendors have had no problems paying for this.\"\nFink, 43, laughingly calls it \"Shazam for property\" but the idea has been three years in the making. The technology matches the photo's dark and light shadows and their relative positioning from the platform's internal graphics files. Fink admits it's not perfect and the glare of sunlight can distort the photos leading to inaccuracies. \"The tech always needs more work, but our strike rate is 90th percentile,\" he says.\nFink says he has been privately funded but intends to use angel networking firm Pitch Partners for a first serious fundraising round from investors. He is seeking $500,000, mostly to help his team sell it to the bigger agency networks.\nFink knows these big agency networks are the mother lode for this kind of app and admits he's hardly been able to put a foot in the door. \"It's to be expected – they probably get 1000 people selling apps to them all the time,\" he says.\nWhen Fairfax asked McGrath Estate Agents to comment on Snaploader, they were patently unimpressed.\n\"It's not something we'd like to comment on as we don't regard this as revolutionary technology,\" said McGrath's spokesperson Terri Sissian.\nBy contrast, Ric Serrao, a principal of Raine and Horne, says it is one of the best new apps he has seen in years. \"And I see about four to five new apps every week,\" he comments.\nSerrao witnessed a demonstration of Snaploader at a Gold Coast real estate event and was immediately taken with the technology. \"I suggested to my tech man we should look at this and get in on the ground level – it's a really good platform. As the tech improves it will get better and better. It is already a great enhancement to what's out there at the moment.\"\nNewton and Serrao agree that Snaploader is infinitely superior to Quick Response (QR) barcodes which can be scanned by mobile phones on signboards or newspapers, directing the phone to specific content online. \"QR codes are already old hat and virtually nobody uses them,\" Newton says. \"They take you to a website – but it saves nothing. This puts it in a library of snaps which are easily referenced.\"\nSerrao says the market is looking \"for easier and easier and faster and faster: It saves people going online to track down the details of a particular property. I can see Raine & Horne Corporate doing a deal with Snaploader.\"\nFink says there are other possibilities which can be added – using the app to upload historic sales data and relevant lending data, as well a features such as home loan calculators and recommended solicitors and tradespeople.\nHe also recognises that this type of app will no doubt be emulated. There are a number of patents on the technology, but these are often prohibitively expensive to renew. \"It will take a long time for others to catch up with us. We'll be the first to market. We want to be the innovators – not one of the copiers,\" he says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T22:06:53.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
