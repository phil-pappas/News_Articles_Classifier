Numis analyst Douglas Jack said: “We suspect the morning promotion will take time to increase breakfast trade, and we question whether the resultant volume growth will be sufficient to offset the inevitable hit on margins.” \nFollowing last week’s Budget announcement on the national living wage, the outlook does not look bright either, according to Peel Hunt’s Nicholas Batram, who said that “given the slim operating margin, [the living wage] announcement could lead to some tough decisions”. \n= Economics = \nWhile all eyes remain on Greece, the economic calendar is packed with a slew of data releases and Treasury committee appearances this week. \nOfficial data on Tuesday are expected to show inflation fell back to zero in June, after edging out of deflation in May. Jobless numbers are also out this week. Traders will be watching pay growth figures closely, together with policymakers at the Bank of England. \nMark Carney, the Bank’s Governor, will be grilled by MPs in an all-day session covering the Bank’s recent Financial Stability Report as well as its quarterly health check of the economy in May. Expect him to be quizzed on Grexit and Brexit. \nRobert Chote, the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Government’s fiscal watchdog, will also face questions from MPs on last week’s Budget. The OBR chairman described the Chancellor’s mix of policies as the “most significant package of measures in any fiscal event” since at least 2010. Official house price data will also give an indication of the strength of the housing market. \n= Monday July 13 = \nBiomaterials business Collagen Solutions (LSE: COS.L - news ) will publish its preliminary results today and analysts say we can expect a few surprises at revenue level. \nIn a trading update in March, the management team noted that after their recent acquisition of Southern Lights Biomaterials, they had taken significant steps towards expanding the group’s revenue-generating potential. \nHowever, they also warned in the year to March 31 there had been a slippage in revenue, which is expected to be in the region of £360,000. \nMike Mitchell, of Panmure Gordon, remained optimistic, telling investors: “Collagen’s international footprint provides an excellent base for long-term growth.” Analysts expect full-year revenue of £1m. \nFull-year results Collagen Solutions, Conviviality Retail (LSE: CVR.L - news ) Economics Treasury Budget Statement (US) \n= Tuesday July 14 = \nRecruiter Michael Page is set to continue riding the recovery wave, just like its peers. Both Hays and Robert Walters (LSE: RWA.L - news ) reported last week that net fee income had increased this year as the UK jobs market continued to pick up. Analysts at Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) are forecasting an 11pc growth in net fee income for Michael Page. \nThe white-collar recruiter is also reaping the benefits of stripping out costs and adding more fee-generating positions, so could even benefit more from the economic recovery than some of its competitors. \nThe market will be watching for the scale of improvement in net cash given that management is expected to provide detail on a capital distribution. Chief executive Steve Ingham said three months ago that the company, which has about £100m in net cash, would probably return some capital to shareholders in the second half. \nCity watchers will also be monitoring how the permanent recruitment market is developing in Europe. \nInterim results: ITE Group (LSE: ITE.L - news ) Trading update: First Group, Michael Page International (LSE: MPI.L - news ) \n= Wednesday July 15 = \nInterim results: Severn Trent (Other OTC: STRNY - news ) , Workspace Group (LSE: WKP.L - news ) Trading update: JD Wetherspoon, RPC Group (LSE: RPC.L - news ) , Burberry Group (Other OTC: BBRYF - news ) \n= Thursday July 16 = \nDixons Carphone (LSE: DC.L - news ) is on course to reveal a bumper set of maiden annual results since its merger to create Britain’s biggest electrical retail giant last year. The chain, which now incorporates Currys and PC World, is expected to unveil sales of more than £10bn. \nDixons Carphone is also forecast to report pre-tax profits of around £377m on Thursday on the back of a sharp increase in sales of ultra-high definition televisions and kitchen appliances over Easter. \nThe City is also waiting for an update on the company’s estimates of cost savings from its merger. The retailer has previously indicated that there should be a minimum of £80m of synergies, although Bank of America Merrill Lynch has forecast that £110m should be achieved by 2017. \nFull-year results Dixons Carphone, Sports Direct International (Other OTC: SDIPF - news ) Interim results Experian \n= Friday July 17 = \nHomeserve (LSE: HSV.L - news ) has already come a long way from its days of mis-selling, which last year cost the home insurance repair company £31m in fines. On Friday, the company will ask shareholders to approve a £97m special dividend and a pay rise for top executives on the back of growing sales. \nIn May, the firm posted a 3pc rise in yearly revenues to £584m, as its growing international business offset continued sluggish turnover in the UK. The firm now has two-thirds of its customer base outside the UK, with a marketing push in the past year helping it to crack the US. \nAs well as voting on their own special dividend, investors will be asked to support a rise in maximum long-term bonuses for executive staff, from 150pc to 200pc of their salaries from 2016. \nInterim results DCC (LSE: DCC.L - news ) , AGM, Homeserve Economics Housing starts (US), Consumer Price Index (US)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T11:31:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
