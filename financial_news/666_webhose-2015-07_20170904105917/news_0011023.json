Whether that's sustainable or not that's another question. \n\"If you take out the North Sea effect, growth would have been about 0.5%.\" \nThe Chancellor George Osborne gave his reaction to the figures on Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) : \"GDP growth 0.7%. Shows Britain motoring ahead with economy producing as much per head as ever before. We must stay on road we've set out on.\" \nMore follows...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T12:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T12:51:04.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
