At best it's a diagnosis that comes with a three-year life expectancy.\nJohn Collett: Traps for the dying in easier super access But, as she points out, things have not been going well. \"I've got rid of a tumour but I've got three more,\" she says. \"The cancer is in my lungs; my liver; it's in between my kidneys and my bowel. I really struggle.\"\n‘‘I really struggle’’, says Linda Young who is dying of cancer. Photo: Eddie Jim\nYoung, who lives on the Mornington Peninsula to the south of Melbourne, had to stop working in the physically demanding aged care industry and now lives on a $492 weekly disability support pension.\nAdvertisement It's a financial situation that's at odds with her $150,000 in superannuation and income protection cover.\nShe submitted an income protection claim in February and she's yet to receive any benefits. And until this month, accessing her super early on the grounds of terminal illness was not possible unless a specialist and a doctor were willing to certify that she had less than 12 months to live.\nMeanwhile, the medical bills keep coming. Because she is on a pension, the cost of X-rays and scans are covered but there are still out-of-pocket expenses associated with doctor and oncologist appointments.\nHer oncologist recommended a drug that cost $15,000 for initial treatment (at the time it wasn't on the PBS schedule). \"I thought: I'll get my super out because I'm a very independent person,\" she says. But accessing it early on compassionate grounds would have meant paying 20 per cent tax. \"I even contemplated getting a personal loan because it actually worked out cheaper for me to do it that way,\" she says.\nLiving with a terminal illness is not just a time of physical and emotional turmoil, it often comes with the extra burden of financial worries.\nYoung wants to take her children on a holiday; to prepay for her funeral; and pay for in-home medical care when it's needed.\nFortunately, the rules on accessing superannuation early have just changed. From July 1 people living with a terminal illness have been able to access their super when they have a life expectancy of less than two years. The access will be tax-free.\nIt's a rule change that the Breast Cancer Network Australia had been campaigning for on behalf of its 100,000 members for several years. In 2013 it surveyed 580 women with secondary breast cancer and found 170 (29 per cent) of respondents had tried unsuccessfully to access their super early.\nChristine Nolan, the network's chief executive, says many were struggling to meet day-to-day expenses including out-of-pocket medical expenses.\n\"The last thing we want people worrying about at that stage in life is how am I going to pay the mortgage; how am I going to put food on the table and how am I going to pay for my expenses; my treatment costs?\"\nAlongside these day-to-day financial challenges, there is a need to put financial affairs in order.\nA Palliative Care Australia survey last year found many people are lagging on that front. Of the 1000 Australians who had recently lost a loved one only 50 per cent of the deceased had a will; 27 per cent had made a file of important documents; and 10 per cent had a funeral plan.\nIf you, or a family member, are living on borrowed time it's important to prepare.\nMake an information file As a starting point, Wally David, financial planner and author of smartmoney.com.au , suggests this: \"Have one folder with all your important documents: birth and marriage certificates, investment details, superannuation details, any insurance policies and your will.\"\nIncreasingly, it also means collating lists of usernames and passwords and social media account details. Liz Callaghan, the chief executive of Palliative Care Australia, says: \"There's lots of stories of people's pages that have their personal data stolen after they've passed away or people have broken into their accounts.\"\nCheck insurances \"People may not realise they have [total and permanent] disability (TPD) or even income protection insurance packages attached to super that they've forgotten about,\" says Nolan. Check super fund statements for details.\nAnnemarie Gambera an insurance lawyer at Slater and Gordon, says these insurance policies are not changed by the new regulations so people should seek advice if they are planning to access super early.\n\"Each insurance policy is different, but often they allow the life insurance benefit to be paid as a terminal illness benefit if someone is diagnosed with a terminal illness and has a life expectancy of less than a year.\n\"These insurance benefits can be worth tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on the fund and may not be available once the super funds are withdrawn and the account shut down,\" she says.\nSome of the questions that may need to be answered include: \"Are you entitled to make a TPD claim if you are no longer able to work? Would you be better off making a terminal illness claim? Do you want to leave some money in your super account so that you continue to have life insurance coverage for your loved ones?\"\nConsider accessing super early David says the decision to access super early will be based on a range of factors. \"It comes down to what their immediate needs and requirements are from a financial perspective; how they intend to use the remainder of their time and what other assets they have available.\"\nThe ideal strategy will also be shaped by your age and who you are leaving behind. For example, Brian Hor who specialises in superannuation and estate planning with Townsends Business and Corporate Lawyers, says if both people in a couple are, for example, over 60, it can be more tax-effective to leave super in the fund and set up a pension for the surviving spouse because any investment earnings generated through the super fund and being paid out with the pension are tax-free.\nThere are different ways to access super early, including specified compassionate grounds\n Breast Cancer Network Australia is developing resources to help people living with a terminal illness better understand their options.\nNolan says people sometimes receive misinformation. \"Sometimes they are being directed to the financial hardship provisions where you need to have been on Centrelink for six months to be able to access those,\" she says.\nPauline Vamos, chief executive, of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, says the industry is addressing the issue. \"There's an enormous amount of training that goes on now with call centre people in terms of handling sensitive calls,\" she says. \"The last thing we want people to feel is to make a claim they've got to go to a lawyer. It's OK to ring up and talk to somebody from the fund.\"\nMake or update your will Even if your financial affairs aren't complicated, Hor says you should have a will. \"If nothing else, it will specify who their executors will be and that can save a whole lot of time and money for their beneficiaries.\"\nThose with a significant estate might need to review how they want beneficiaries to receive their assets. For instance, says David: \"If there's children involved do you want them to receive a lump sum or do you want to restrict how assets or an inheritance are received to a certain age or in a certain form?\"\nVamos says people should be aware that super is not distributed as part of your estate. \"The fund's obligation is to pay it to the beneficiaries or whoever claims on it.\"\nThose who choose not to access their super early should ensure their will and any binding death nominations on their super are consistent and up-to-date (you need to update or confirm them every three years) as a recent case in the Court of Appeal in Western Australia has underlined.\nFrancesca and Augusto Conti were married and were both trustees and members of their self-managed superannuation fund. Francesca had four children from a previous marriage. According to a will she made in 2005, she wanted her super to go to her children and specifically stated she did not want it to go to her husband.\nBut according to two binding death nominations made in 2002 and 2006 she wanted her super to go to her husband.\nAfter Francesca's death in August 2010, Augusto saw the 2006 binding death nomination had expired in 2009 and that under the terms of the deed he, as the surviving trustee, could decide who should receive the $648,586 death benefit. Despite what was contained in her will he decided it should be paid to him.\nFrancesca's children challenged his decision and lost both at the first instance and on appeal.\nPut an enduring power of attorney in place An enduring power of attorney legally allows someone to take care of your financial affairs if you lose capacity as a result of your illness, says Hor. This is different to an enduring guardian who would make medical decisions on your behalf.\nConsider funeral costs David says prepaying for your funeral or making sure there are funds available to cover the cost can sound like a small detail. But left undone it can have a big impact. He points to a client whose husband died leaving the bulk of their money in an account in his name rather than their joint account. \"When she received the bills from the funeral director it was quite a stress because there wasn't money available in joint accounts to pay that cost,\" he says.\nMoney from super benefits and investments won't be immediately available when someone dies. \"There's generally some documentation that needs to be submitted before the money is released. Even something like the death certificate can take some weeks to be received,\" David says.\nAccessing super early on compassionate grounds An alternative way to access super early is under specified compassionate grounds. The application is made to the Department of Human Services rather than to the super fund.\nYou can apply on one or more grounds including: to pay for medical treatment for yourself or a dependant or to pay for transport to the treatment; and to pay for palliative care for yourself or a dependant with a terminal medical condition.\nThe early release of super must be necessary and meet the minimum expenses required and you must show that you cannot pay for the expenses any other way such as savings or assets.\nIn 2014-15, a total of 16,091 applications were made for the early release of super on the grounds of medical treatment and transport; mortgage costs; funeral and palliative care and multiple grounds. A total of 11,736 were approved in full or part resulting in the release of $147,926,129 of super in the 10 months to the end of April 2015.", "external_links": ["http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/money/traps-in-new-rules-for-terminally-ill-to-access-super-20150707-gi3hxx.html"], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T05:03:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
