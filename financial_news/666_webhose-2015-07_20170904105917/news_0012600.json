Policy makers will announce their decision Friday at about 1:30 p.m. in Moscow.\nWith developing nations alert to the risk that higher U.S. borrowing costs may spur capital outflows, the window is closing for Russia to ease policy as it tries to shake off a recession after its slump intensified last quarter. Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina in June mentioned a possible tightening by the Federal Reserve as one of the biggest threats to her country’s inflation outlook.\n“If the Fed really hikes, the central banks of markets suffering from elevated political risk -- such as Russia -- will find it much more difficult to expand their monetary policy,” said Wolf-Fabian Hungerland, an economist at Berenberg Bank in Hamburg, Germany. “Market participants are prepared to see another cut or two. So why should the Russian central bank wait? Waiting would largely be a quite risky bet on the Fed delaying its hike.”\nThe Bank of Russia has already lowered borrowing costs by a cumulative 5.5 percentage points in four steps this year. A cut to 11 percent on Friday will leave its key rate half a percentage point short of a full rollback of an emergency increase in December.\nRate Bets Derivatives traders extended their bets on a decline in borrowing costs after the central bank halted its interventions from Tuesday. Forward-rate agreements are signaling 28 basis points of decreases in the next three months, compared with 13 basis points before the announcement. Government bonds rose, sending yields on five-year notes down 32 basis points, the most since April, to 10.86 percent on Wednesday.\nFed Chair Janet Yellen has said that she expects the first increase in U.S. rates since 2006 this year, with market speculation focused on a move as soon as September. The Russian central bank will review borrowing costs Sept. 11 , less than a week before the Fed holds its two-day policy meeting .\n“The situation in the world is very unstable, and in subsequent months there will most likely be no opportunity to cut the key rate,” Natalia Orlova, chief economist at Alfa Bank in Moscow, said by phone. “Considering that inflation is set for a further slowdown, I wouldn’t rule out the possibility of a negligible rate cut at the meeting on Friday.”\nRuble Outlook Also at stake is the stability of the ruble after it’s gone from best to worst among its peers, heaping pressure on Nabiullina to avert another currency collapse that would spill over into the economy and threaten inflation.\nThe ruble has lost about 16 percent against the dollar in the two and a half months after the regulator started buying foreign currency to replenish reserves on May 13. It gained 2.3 percent after the central bank said it was suspending the program.\nPrice growth slowed to 15.3 percent in June from a year ago after touching a 13-year high of 16.9 percent in March. After decreasing the key rate by one percentage point in June, the central bank warned that inflation risks will hinder further easing.\nGiven the magnitude of rate cuts at each meeting this year, the central bank “won’t necessarily act in such big steps and not necessarily at each meeting,” Nabiullina told reporters in Moscow after last month’s decision.\n“By just delivering a smaller cut this time they can show the market that they do look at ruble developments, but at the same time show the banks and the real sector that the cutting cycle isn’t over,” Eldar Vakhitov, an economist at BNP Paribas SA in London, said by e-mail. “A majority of Russian companies and banks would prefer very much to see the rate below 10 percent.”", "external_links": ["http://www.cbr.ru/eng/dkp/?PrtId=cal_mp\\", "http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm\\"], "published": "2015-07-30T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T13:04:51.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
