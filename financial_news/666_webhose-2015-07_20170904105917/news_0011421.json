The pound, meanwhile, strengthened after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, signaled that a U.K. interest-rate increase may come sooner than investors anticipate.\nCanada’s dollar, known as the loonie, tumbled to its lowest since March 2009 against the greenback after the nation’s central bank cut interest rates. Commodity producers are struggling as global demand for resources slows.\nThe New Zealand dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, declined to a six-year low as a milk auction showed lower prices for dairy products, a key export.\nThe kiwi is also at its its weakest since January 2014 versus the euro.\nAustralia’s currency slid to its lowest since May 2009 on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, Mexico&apos;s peso approached an all-time low versus the dollar.
