It's a very big focus in Asia.\" \nMr Simonet has also spent 11 years with global luxury goods conglomerate LVMH in Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, UK and Scandinavia. \nHe was also international general manager of Wonderbra owner DB Apparel and international director of women's swimwear chain Seafolly. \nKathmandu's former chief executive Peter Halkett resigned in November 2014 amid declining sales growth and a profit downgrade. @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook EU summit on Greece scrapped AAP \nA planned meeting of European Union leaders has been cancelled as crisis talks continue about Greece's place in …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T18:56:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
