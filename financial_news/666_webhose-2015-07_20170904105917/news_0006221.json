Important for institutions to consider these in their assessment.\" \nThe heads of all 28 EU member states will discuss the proposals at a \"decisive\" summit on Sunday. \nGreek PM Alexis Tsipras and his cabinet spent the day drafting a package of tax rises, pension reforms and economic liberalisation measures that could decide their country's future in the EU. \nThey have offered to increase tax on shipping companies, end tax breaks for the Greek islands and raise VAT for restaurants. \nIn return, it is asking for a €53.5bn (£38.5bn) bailout from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the EU organisation that provides financial assistance for eurozone members. \nThe three-year loan would enable Greece to cover its debt obligations, the Greek finance ministry said, preventing it from defaulting and ensuring it does not have to drop out of the euro. \nThe Greek parliament will vote on the reform plan on Friday. \nAn official said lawmakers would be asked to authorise the Syriza-led government to negotiate a list of \"prior actions\" it would take before any fresh aid funds are disbursed - a key step to convince sceptical lenders of its serious intent. \nThe plan was put forward as Germany, Greece's biggest creditor, appeared to make a small concession by acknowledging Athens would need some debt restructuring as part of any new bailout programme. \nThe hardline German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble suggested there could be movement on Greek debt as the deadline approached on Thursday night. \nEurozone leaders decided at an emergency meeting earlier this week that Greece should have one more chance to present a credible rescue plan. \nBanks in Greece are staying closed until at least next Monday and cash machine withdrawals are limited to €60 (£42) per day as the country teeters on the brink. \nThe country has had two bailouts worth €240bn from the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund since 2010, but its economy has shrunk by a quarter, unemployment is more than 25% and one in two young people is out of work.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T02:24:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
