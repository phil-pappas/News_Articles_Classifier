Barclays did not respond to requests for comment. \nThe halving of oil prices over the past year has forced oil and gas companies to slash spending and scrap and delay around $200 billion in deepwater oil projects and huge gas plants so far this year. \nOMV in 2013 increased its stake in Rosebank to 50 percent as part of its $2.65 billion acquisition of Statoil (Xetra: 675213 - news ) assets aimed at increasing its focus on exploration and production and to make up for output losses in volatile countries such as Libya or Yemen. \nThe Austrian company had put Rosebank's estimated peak production at 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and had previously estimated the costs of developing Rosebank to reach $10 billion. [ID: nL6N0QI2WI] \nOMV's exploration chief said in May that the process to reduce OMV's stake in Rosebank had started. \nOMV's exploration chief Jaap Huijskes has said OMV wants to reduce its stake in Rosebank by around 10-20 percent. \nChevron is currently reviewing the economics and engineering of the project, whose final investment decision (FID) is not expected to be decided before the end of 2015, according to analysts. \nChevron has said in the past it was \"premature to make any statement on FID date for the project.\" \n(Additional reporting by Shadia Nasralla in Vienna; Editing by Veronica Brown and William Hardy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T16:43:57.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
