None of our shipments to China have been rejected on this basis,\" said a spokeswoman.\n\"We are working as an industry to identify if any process improvements can be made to assist all parties.\"\nWhile the number of Australian ships understood to be turned around remains at the one Anglo American vessel, industry speculation suggests there have been more, with producers in South Africa and Canada also affected.\nAustralian producers believe the trend is motivated by a desire to protect struggling Chinese coal miners, rather than protect the environment, and ICIS China energy analyst Deng Shun agreed.\n\"I think the environment issue is a secondary reason, the most important issue is that China's coal market over-supply is too serious,\" he said.\n\"A lot of Chinese coal suppliers, because of this over-supply, have seen their prices drop and suffered serious losses. Many companies have incurred such serious losses that they can't pay employee wages.\"\nBut the clearest impact of the new testing regime lies in the volumes of coal bypassing China for other markets.\nChinese imports of coal in the first five months of 2015 were 38.2 per cent lower than the first five months of 2014.\nThe import slump was particularly stark during the month of May, when China imported 37.6 per cent less Australian coal compared to the same month in 2014, and 25.6 per cent less than in April.\nThose reductions came despite Australian coking coal production rising over the past 12 months and Australian thermal coal production falling by less than 1 per cent.\nMinerals Council spokesman Greg Evans said Australian miners were concerned that Chinese coal producers may not be subject to the same tests, and were frustrated by the extra costs and delays that came with the tests.\n\"The main problems relate to the variability in the testing regime, inadequate allowance for commercial remedies and the delays it is subjecting shipping to, there is no doubt each of these factors adds to cost and increases risk,\" he said.\nMr Deng said some Australian miners were now sending samples of their coal to China ahead of time in a bid to make sure their cargoes would not be turned-back at the border.\n\"You can say that ISO is the international standard but the fact is China is [one of] the biggest buyers. So there's not much you can do,\" said Mr Deng.\n\"If Australia wants to sell coal in China, at the moment, they'll just have to adhere to the local rules.\"\nMr Evans said the council was working with the Australian government to broker a resolution to the testing.\n\"Australia is looking for a practical and speedy resolution and is working with our government to that end. It would seem sensible for both governments to agree to cease or suspend the operation of the quality regime and now take stock, this could allow for possible solutions such as conducting internationally accredited testing in Australia prior to shipments taking place,\" he said.\nâ€“ with Peter Ker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T16:15:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
