The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index also advanced 1.6 percent.\n\"The Greek vote has helped the market post early gains. Over the next few weeks, we see the focus shifting to the results season where we expect the newsflow to be supportive,\" Robert Parkes, director of equity strategy at HSBC Bank, said.\nSTOCKHOLM STOCKS STAR\nSwedish stocks were among the best performers in Europe.\nSwedish engineer Alfa Laval surged around 10 percent after a bigger than expected rise in earnings, while Atlas Copco also jumped around 10 percent after the compressor and mining gear maker forecast higher demand.\nSwiss watchmaker Swatch Group rose nearly 5 percent, as an upbeat outlook reassured investors even though the company posted lower first-half net profits.\nSome analysts said stocks could come under pressure in the coming weeks because so much concerning Greece's debt problems remains unresolved, and from speculation about the timing of the first U.S. interest rise in eight years.\nHigher interest rates can hit stocks as they typically boost investment returns on bonds and cash.\n\"Buy the rumour, sell the news,\" Koen De Leus, senior economist at KBC in Brussels, said. \"All eyes are now on the European Central Bank and whether it will give the Greek banks some extra breathing space.\"\n\"The stock market may be heading for more calm waters in the coming weeks, but investors' focus will gradually shift to the timing of the first rate hike in the United States after 6 years of a zero interest rate policy.\"\nFederal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said on Wednesday that the U.S. central bank remained on track to raise interest rates this year.\nThe FTSEurofirst 300 index is up nearly 20 percent so far this year.\nEurope bourses in 2015: link.reuters.com/pap87v\nAsset performance in 2015: link.reuters.com/gap87v\nToday's European research round-up (Editing by Tom Heneghan/Ruth Pitchford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T13:28:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
