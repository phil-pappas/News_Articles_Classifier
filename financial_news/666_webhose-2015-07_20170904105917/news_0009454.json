That's going to mean change, and that kind of change is going to be disruptive,\" he told reporters.\n\"I think the serious question that comes out of the market is, what does it mean in terms of China's resolve to continue with the reform program?\"\nLew said the Chinese government will have to balance economic theory with the pace of change they can implement.\n\"I hope for the sake of China's economy and the world economy that they stick to the reform agenda,\" he said.
