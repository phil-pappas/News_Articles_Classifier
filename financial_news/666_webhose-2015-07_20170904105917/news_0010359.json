I have nothing but fondness for Donald and wish him the best of luck on his campaign. Incidentally, I think he would make an incredible president.”\nThe Daily Beast posted a story on Monday night rehashing the rape complaint, which Ivana made during ­divorce proceedings and which was included in a 1993 book, “Lost Tycoon.”\nAfter the book was published, Ivana issued a statement — which was printed on the first page of the bio — saying she wasn’t using the word literally, but instead ­implying that she “felt ­violated.”\n“[O]n one occasion during 1989, Mr. Trump and I had marital relations in which he behaved very differently toward me than he had during our marriage,” she said at the time.\n“As a woman, I felt violated, as the love and tenderness which he normally exhibited towards me was absent. I referred to this as a ‘rape,’ but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.”\nIvana Trump has endorsed her ex-husband’s presidential campaign, hosing down talk about an uncomfortable sexual encounter. Source: AP\nAfter being contacted by the Daily Beast about the ancient claim, Michael ­Cohen, special counsel to Trump and an executive vice president at The Trump Organization, went into a tirade — blasting the site via e-mail for targeting “a private individual who never raped anybody.”\n“By the very definition, you can’t rape your spouse,” he argued. “It is true. You cannot rape your spouse. And there’s very clear case law.”\nIn fact, marital rape is illegal in all 50 states.\nShortly after being published, Cohen’s comments went viral and sparked outrage online — leading him to issue an apology on Tuesday.\n“As an lawyer, husband and father, there are many injustices that offend me but nothing more than charges of rape or racism,” he told CNN in a statement.\n“They hit me at my core. Rarely am I surprised by the press, but the gall of this particular reporter to make such a reprehensible and false allegation against Mr. Trump truly stunned me. In my moment of shock and anger, I made an inarticulate comment, which I do not believe and which I apologise for ­entirely.”\nIvana has three children with Trump: Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric, all of whom work with their father in The Trump Organization.\nThis article originally appeared in the New York Post.\nOriginally published as Ivana Trump recants ‘rape’ claim", "external_links": ["http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/27/ex-wife-donald-trump-made-feel-violated-during-sex.html", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227462/040621-65fabc2c-35bd-11e5-a34b-af8954b82b5f.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/ivana-trump-talks-down-rape-furore/story-fn5tas5k-1227462038876", "http://nypost.com/2015/07/29/ivana-trump-donald-didnt-rape-me-and-hed-be-a-great-president/", "http://nypost.com/2015/07/28/donald-trumps-lawyer-apologizes-for-saying-you-cant-rape-your-spouse/"], "published": "2015-07-29T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T18:42:51.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
