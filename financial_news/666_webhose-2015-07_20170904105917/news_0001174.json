NAB economist James Glenn said the lift was lead by the service sectors, which continue to outperform. \"Confidence is now positive in all industries except mining, which is currently zero,\" he said on Tuesday. Business conditions also improved in June, the NAB survey showed, lifting five points to its highest level since last October at 11 points. \"Improvements in both confidence and conditions over recent months are starting to suggest a more convincing turnaround in the non-mining sectors is underway,\" Mr Glenn added. But Mr Glenn said the sluggish rise in employment remained a hurdle, with the jobless rate ticking up to six per cent in June from 5.9 per cent the previous month. He said it was difficult to asses the effects of recent international events such as volatility in the Chinese share market and concerns of a Greece eurozone exit. \"The big picture is still one where the domestic economy is struggling to offset the impact of sharply lower mining investment,\" Mr Glenn said. But lower interest rates and a sagging Aussie dollar, paired with the housing boom and a post-budget kick in confidence appears to have boosted business outcomes, he said.
