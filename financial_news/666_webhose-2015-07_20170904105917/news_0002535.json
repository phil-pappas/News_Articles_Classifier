Darrian Traynor by Catie Low The ABC will consider possible compensation for franchisees hit by the sudden closure of the broadcaster's retail network, which includes 78 franchisee-run ABC Centres.\nIn a letter to franchisees seen by Fairfax Media, ABC Retail head Regina Hoekstra said the ABC would enter into \"negotiations with individual franchisees to assess possible reimbursement under the ABC Centre Licence\".\nThe franchisees were informed of the national broadcaster's plans to pull down the shutters on its retail network – which also includes 50 stores operated by the ABC – at the same time as the media on Thursday morning.\nThe ABC has not revealed whether the ABC Centres, which are inside bookstores and newsagents and sell ABC books, CDs, DVDs and other merchandise, would be able to continue selling ABC products beyond February 2016.\nHowever, the broadcaster revealed it was working on a \"new model\" that would operate outside the existing distribution model behind the ABC's soon-to-be-closed network of 50 branded stores.\nThe ABC could not yet say when this model would be finalised.\nHowever, ABC Commercial director Robert Patterson said it would work with \"some pace\" to assess potential models.\n\"We are looking to a new model that is sustainable without the network of 50 ABC shops and the scale which that brings,\" Mr Patterson said.\n One franchisee, who did not wish to be identified, said he was shocked by the ABC's decision to terminate his franchise agreement and revealed he would be seeking compensation.\n\"I'm shattered, especially as I am a relatively new franchisee,\" he said.\n\"To establish the fixtures and signwork it was just under $40,000, it's a lot of money and then there's the stock.\"\nPeter Searl has sold ABC books, CDs, DVDs and merchandise out of his newsagency, Searl's, for 14 years.\nHe said he was surprised by the ABC's decision to shut down its retail division, and it was yet another blow for his own business.\n\"It's very tough in retailing at the moment, lots of little things are getting taken away from our range,\" Mr Searl said.\n\"We've gone into some giftware, just trying to work out what people want. They're not buying papers, and magazines are going online.\"\nRevenue from ABC Commercial, which captures the broadcasters' retail business, has been in sharp decline in recent years.\nAccording to the 2014 annual report, ABC Commercial contributed $19.19 million to the ABC's net revenue in 2005-06 but this plummeted to $1.5 million in 2013-14.\nThis fall was put down to sharp declines in DVD sales, as well as a broader decline in returns from retail.\nThe ABC would not reveal how much the retail operation contributes to ABC Commercial's net revenue but it's understood that it's 10 per cent or less in the present retail conditions.\nDillons Norwood bookshop owner Ross Dillon has worked with the ABC for 15 years now and he's optimistic he can negotiate a way to keep selling its \"iconic\" merchandise.\n\"Two years ago there were a string of rumours that they were attempting to sell their network to a major book retailer,\" Mr Dillon said.\n\"It's sudden but to me it's not surprising, the ABC has a lot of experienced people and I've had the franchise for about 15 years.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T14:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T17:02:58.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
