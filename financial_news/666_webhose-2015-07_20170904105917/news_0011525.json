Kate Geraghty Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Opposition Leader Bill Shorten was forced to deny he used his position as a prominent union leader for personal advantage after admitting he failed to declare up to $63,777 in payments from a labour hire company that covered the wages of former campaign director.\nMr Shorten admitted to the Abbott government's Royal Commission Into Trade Union Governance and Corruption he had only instructed the Labor Party this week to declare the 'donation' from the company, Unibilt, to the Australian Electoral Commission. A credible appearance by Mr Shorten at the commission was seen as crucial to his position as Opposition Leader.\nDuring five hours of cross-examination of Mr Shorten about his years at the Australian Workers Union, the inquiry heard that Unibilt executive Ted Lockyer agreed to pay the wages of Mr Shorten's campaign director Lance Wilson from February to November, 2007, but that an employment contract was drawn up to describe him as a \"research officer\" with Unibilt.\nThe employment arrangement for Mr Wilson, who later worked as an adviser to Mr Shorten, was changed in May 2007 when he became an employee of the Australian Workers Union but the AWU invoiced Unibilt for his wages.\nIllustration: David Rowe David Rowe The payments by Unibilt to Mr Wilson occurred during a period that the company was negotiating a new workplace agreement with the AWU.\nIn a letter to the Victorian Labor Party on Monday, tendered to the commission, Mr Shorten said financial disclosures by his campaign staff for the 2007 election had been \"incomplete\" and he wanted to disclose undeclared payments from Unibilt and the AWU between 2006 and 2008.\nOf the money paid by Unibilt for Mr Wilson's wages, an initial $12,587 was paid directly by Unibilt to Mr Shorten's campaign. A second amount of $8222 was paid by Unibilt to the AWU before being passed on to Mr Shorten's campaign.\nQuantum He said a third amount of $42,968 was provided by Unibilt in 2007, but he said he had \"relied on the higher quantum in the information provided to me\". It is likely the amount paid by Unibilt to Mr Wilson, who was also provided with a laptop by the company, would be less that the $63,777 stated in the letter.\nMr Shorten's letter disclosed a previously undeclared payment of $11,774 from the AWU's national office that was used to employ an unidentified second worker on his 2007 campaign. Another payment was received by the campaign from the union's national office which was below the $10,500 disclosure amount.\nQuizzed by counsel assisting the commission, Jeremy Stoljar, Mr Shorten said he had only discovered his campaign declarations for the 2007 election had been \"incomplete\" while preparing to give evidence to the commission. \"I take ultimate responsibility for that,\" he said.\nMr Shorten took umbrage when Mr Stoljar asked him whether he had used his position as the AWU national secretary, a role he held from 2001 to 2007, to \"gain an advantage for yourself\".\n\"Absolutely not,\" he said.\nMr Shorten said he could have asked an AWU employee to draw up Mr Wilson's contract, but he would not accept he asked him to be described as a research officer for Unibilt. \"The term research officer is not correct. I agree with that point,\" he said.\n\"If I had realised the disclosure hadn't been completed at the time or any time since, I would have made those inquiries at that point,\" he said.\n\"But I also have to say here, it's not unknown in the history of electoral disclosures by political parties, for candidates and members of Parliament to update their disclosures as they realise information comes to light or hasn't been completed,\" he said.\nMr Shorten was grilled over controversial agreements negotiated between the union and the company Cleanevent when he was leading the AWU. He was questioned exhaustively by Mr Stoljar over whether the pay rates in the agreement were below the industry award.\nMr Stoljar sought to highlight Mr Shorten attending a Cleanevent marquee in the birdcage at Flemington during the Spring Racing Carnival in 2006. Mr Shorten made light of the issue, saying he might have stopped by for a drink.\nMilitant Outside the commission, former Labor minister Greg Combet, said Mr Shorten had \"acquitted himself very well today\" and it was \"the first time I have seen a union official grilled for not being sufficiently militant\".\n\"Usually these royal commissions are getting stuck into union officials for going too hard and I think that sort of hypocrisy just underlines the political nature of this royal commission,\" he said. \"This is the third Labor leader [including Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd] within a year to be dragged before a royal commission. Tony Abbott is using these royal commissions as a political weapon against his opponents.\"\nMr Combet, a former ACTU secretary who is part of Mr Shorten's 'team' at the commission, acknowledged that \"overlooking donations was always a difficult issue for politicians\" but he believed Tony Abbott had once overlooked a donation.\nHe said it was not unusual for political candidates to receive money from employers for their political campaigns. \"It is not at all unusual in my experience as a trade union official or as a politician for companies to make donations either as cash or in kind, for example, contributing to the cost of a campaign.\"\nMr Shorten will be cross-examined for a second day on Thursday and his evidence is expected to go for most of the day.\nHe is expected to be cross-examined over the payment of union dues by builder Winslow Constructors as well as his representation of jockeys and netballers while he was at the AWU.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-07-08T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T00:55:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
