Photo: Carla Gottgens\nChinese miner MMG believes development of Australia's next base metals mine will be completed $US100 million ($137 million) cheaper than previously thought, courtesy of a two-year delay in the development schedule.\nIn a badly needed example of new investment into Australia's struggling resources sector, MMG gave the green light on Wednesday for full development of its Dugald River zinc, lead and silver mine in north-western Queensland.\nThe project was expected to cost $US1.5 billion when originally touted during the second phase of the mining boom in 2012 and 2013, but deferral in 2013, the fading of the boom and a new, scaled-down mine plan has allowed the Hong Kong-listed miner to reduce the cost of the development.\nMMG spent $US650 million on building a decline at Dugald River before the deferral, and on Wednesday approved the spending of a further $US750 million over the next 30 months to complete the project, for a total cost of $US1.4 billion.\nAdvertisement MMG chief executive Andrew Michelmore, who is also the chairman of the Minerals Council of Australia, said the timing of the decision would allow the company to avoid paying boom-time wages and other costs.\n\"When we were first looking at Dugald River, the market was hot with iron ore projects, coal projects, gas projects. We were finding we were getting B-grade construction people,\" he said.\n\"We are [now] looking at getting the A-team and getting more efficiency out of those people.\"\nDugald River project is essentially a play on zinc, which despite a weak start to 2015, is expected to be one of the most prospective metals over the next few years when a shortage of supply is expected to emerge.\nDeutsche Bank predicts zinc prices to improve by 14 per cent over the next year, and 5 per cent in 2017.\nDespite that outlook, Mr Michelmore said the approval was a tough decision, and was helped significantly by the fact the project had a long mine life at 28 years.\nThe previous plan said 2 million tonnes of ore would be mined each year at Dugald River, but that will fall to 1.5 million tonnes a year under the new plan.\nProduction of zinc concentrate is expected to reach 160,000 tonnes a year, rather than the 220,000 tonnes flagged under the previous plan.\nAside from zinc, the mine will also produce significant amounts of lead and silver. With first production expected in the first half of 2018, Dugald River should be nicely timed to capitalise on the expected exhaustion and closure of several zinc mines around the world.\nMorgan Stanley estimated earlier this year that 1.2 million tonnes of annual mined zinc supply should disappear between now and 2017, and MMG's Century mine north of Mt Isa will be one of those, with plans for it to close later this year.\n\"Dugald River will come on line at around a time when significant global zinc supply will disappear through mine closures,\" Mr Michelmore said.\n\"We are positive about the long-term fundamentals for zinc.\"\nMMG still needs to obtain some approvals, including from the Environment Department and the Port of Townsville where the product will be exported, but construction is expected to begin in mid-2016.\nBusiness group Townsville Enterprise praised the decision at a time when most miners were avoiding capital spending.\n\"Investments of this magnitude are catalytic for the development of Northern Australia and critical to the growth and prosperity of the region,\" the group said.\n\"For this decision to be made at this point in the commodity cycle shows that investors have confidence in the future of the North Queensland region.\"\nDual listing MMG is the publicly traded arm of Chinese state-owned miner China Minmetals, and the company has many Australian assets after taking over all but one of OZ Minerals' assets in 2009.\nThe company's corporate headquarters are on Melbourne's Southbank and its shares are traded on the Hong Kong stock exchange.\nMr Michelmore has often been asked about the prospect of MMG setting up a dual listing on the Australian Stock Exchange, given its headquarters and several of its assets are here.\nWhen asked again on Wednesday, Mr Michelmore indicted MMG was likely to set up a second listing but not until after it has set up its flagship Las Bambas copper mine in Peru.\n\"We want to go to the market at some stage to issue more equity most likely to rebalance the balance sheet, where we do that and when has not been decided,\" he said.\n\"We want to go somewhere that has a long-term minerals industry basis, so there are three obvious ones [Australia, Toronto, London]. It is just a matter of which one you go to.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T01:00:58.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
