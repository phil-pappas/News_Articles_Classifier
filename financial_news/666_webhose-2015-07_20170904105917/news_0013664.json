The investment is part of GM's plan to invest 5 billion over several years to develop a global family of Chevrolet vehicles with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp (SAIC), the state-owned Chinese automaker that is GM's primary partner in China.\n\n\"GM cannot remain a global leader without making a serious investment towards expanding our presence in growth markets like India,\" GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said at a briefing in New Delhi. India's automobile market has been sluggish for the past few years, with annual sales of less than 3 million cars. But by 2020 analysts expect India to become the world's thirdlargest passenger vehicle market after China and the United States.\n\nGM will launch 10 new domestically manufactured vehicles in India over the next five years in a push to double its market share in the country by 2020, Stefan Jacoby, GM's chief of international operations, told a news conference. GM sold 56,700 vehicles in India in 2014 and had a market share of 1.8 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:24:30.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
