He sought to blame the West for the impasse.\n“Now, they have excessive demands,” he said of the major powers’ negotiating position.\nBritain’s Hammond said ministers would regroup on Saturday to see if they could overcome the remaining hurdles.\n“We are making progress, it’s painfully slow,” he told reporters before leaving Vienna.\nZarif has been holding intense meetings for two weeks with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to try to hammer out a deal limiting Iran’s nuclear programme in return for withdrawing economic sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy.\nAn agreement would be the biggest step towards rapprochement between Iran and the West since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\nBut the negotiations have become bogged down, with final deadlines extended three times in the past 10 days and diplomats speaking of a shouting match between Kerry and Zarif.\nThe White House sought to change the tone on Friday, saying the United States and its negotiating partners “have never been closer” to agreement with Iran.\nDEADLINE MISSED\nThe negotiators missed a Friday morning deadline set by the U.S. Congress for an expedited 30-day review of the deal. Any deal sent to Congress before Sept. 7 would now be subject to a 60 day review period, accounting for lawmakers’ summer recess.\nU.S. officials had previously expressed concern that the extended review would provide more time for any deal to unravel, but have played down that risk in the last few days as it became increasingly likely that the deadline would not be met.\nOn Thursday, Kerry suggested Washington’s patience was running out: “We can’t wait forever,” he told reporters. “If the tough decisions don’t get made, we are absolutely prepared to call an end to this.”\nAli Akbar Velayati, top adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called Kerry’s remarks “part of America’s psychological warfare against Iran”.\nA senior Iranian official speaking on condition of anonymity said the United States and the other powers were shifting their positions and backtracking on an April 2 interim agreement that was meant to lay the ground for a final deal.\n“Suddenly everyone has their own red lines. Britain has its red line, the U.S. has its red line, France, Germany,” the official said.\nBack in Iran, Friday provided a reminder of the depth of more than three decades of enmity between Iran and the West that a deal could help overcome.\nIranians rallied for the last Friday of the fasting month of Ramadan, observed in Iran as “Qods Day” or “Death to Israel day”, to show support for Palestinians, protest against Israel and chant slogans against the “Great Satan” United States.\nOPTIMISTS\nWestern countries suspect Iran of seeking the capability to make nuclear weapons. Iran says it has the right to peaceful nuclear technology.\nOver the past two years, the nuclear talks have brought about the first intensive direct diplomacy between the United States and Iran since Iranian revolutionaries stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held hostages for over a year.\nA successful outcome would be a triumph both for U.S. President Barack Obama and Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist elected in 2013 on a pledge to reduce Iran’s international isolation. Optimists say a deal could help reshape Middle East alliances at a time when Washington and Tehran face a common foe in the Sunni militant group Islamic State.\nBut both presidents face scepticism from powerful hardliners at home, making it difficult to bridge final differences.\n 11, 2015 8:45 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T10:10:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
