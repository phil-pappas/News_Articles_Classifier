James Davies How this will manifest will depend on the bank you're with. Sheyne Walsh, a mortgage lending specialist and principal of Kingsbridge Private, says: \"Each bank is doing its bit to discourage investment lending and to appease APRA [Australian Prudential Regulation Authority], but they're all coming at it in a different way ... it's a moving feast.\"\nCBA and Westpac, for example, have reduced the weight rental income has on its loan calculations by 40 per cent, Cole says, while ANZ no longer counts negative gearing towards lenders' ability to repay their loans. ANZ has already increased the rate on its investment property loan by 0.27 per cent to 5.65 per cent, effective on August 10, and other lenders are likely to follow.\nAdditional cash Dixon Advisory's modelling shows the amount of additional cash an investor could expect to be asked to hold to cover a $500,000 loan might be between $10,000 and $12,000. \"Holding\" is a euphemism for either keeping the money in a deposit account or using another property as security.\n Previously a borrower with a $500,000 loan and 20 per cent deposit would have reasonably been expected to prove cash flow of about $8600 a year before loan approval, after factors like rental income and negative gearing were accounted for. Dixon's modelling shows that sum jumps to almost $21,000.\nFor a $1 million loan, the expected additional cash flow could be as high as $22,000 under the new standards, a leap from $14,700 to $36,870.\nThe estimates carry a number of assumptions, such as a loan-to-value ratio (LVR) of 80 per cent (put in place recently by Westpac and BankWest), a principal and interest rate of 7 per cent and rental income of 4 per cent. The borrower is assumed to be on a marginal tax rate of 49 per cent.\nCole adds that some banks could ask lenders to put in a higher deposit if they don't meet the extra cash flow requirements and don't have adequate cash put aside.\nWhether the measures will actually stop investors with property portfolios from proceeding with their next buy is another question.\nLiam Shorte, a senior financial planner with Verante Financial Planning, says while it will make loans more difficult to get, there are ways around it.\n\"People who just do bricks and mortar may look for some way around it, [perhaps by] borrowing an bit extra against the [primary residence] house,\" he says.\nRead next: How to limit (and even eliminate) the tax on your super", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T13:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:11:58.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
