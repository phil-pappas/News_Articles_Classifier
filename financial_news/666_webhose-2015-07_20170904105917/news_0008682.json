Well-intentioned steps have been taken for a coalition but if we look realistically there are various difficulties,\" he told the pro-government Yeni Safak newspaper in an interview.\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan is seen as favouring early polls, an option that would give the AKP he founded a chance to win back a majority and revive his hopes of furnishing his post with the strong executive powers he seeks.\nKilicdaroglu, despite his scepticism regarding the formation of a coalition, still views this as the best option for political stability.\nHe said a coalition would be a \"very healthy\" way out of the current uncertainty given that an early election was unlikely to give the AKP a mandate strong enough to deal with the country's problems.\nVeteran CHP deputy and former party leader Deniz Baykal reportedly added to scepticism regarding a possible coalition on Thursday, saying the AKP did not want to form a coalition and that an early election was likely in November.\n\"The AK Party does not want to form a government,\" IHA news agency Quote: d him as telling reporters. \"The coalition talks are just theatre. There will be an election in November.\"\nA grand coalition between the centre-right, Islamist-rooted AKP and the centre-left, secular CHP would likely be fragile and factious. But it could help placate jittery foreign investors and revive attempts to settle a Kurdish rebellion in the southeast.
