By Kate Palmer | Telegraph – 17 minutes ago 29,400.00 +1,050.00 \nAsk an expert : Belongings in empty homes can prove hard to insure we explain how to cover contents before you move in \nHow do we buy short-term contents cover for an empty property? \nWe have a gap between purchasing our new flat and moving in. It will have new carpets and some kitchen appliances, so we want to protect these things before we move in. \nWe don't need buildings insurance because the flat is leasehold and buildings cover is provided by the landlord, but we don't know if the appliances are covered by this. \nHowever, we can't buy contents-only cover because we have been told by several insurers that they won't consider unoccupied properties. \nSurely this isn't an unknown problem for people who buy properties with some furnishings already installed? Emma, via email New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) -build properties are often kitted out with fittings such as carpets, white goods and lights but these extras aren't normally covered under a buildings insurance policy. \nBefore you buy, the items will be covered by the developer if you haven't yet exchanged contracts. But after exchange, the new owner must buy a contents policy if they want to insure these items. \n• 'I have £250,000 invested should I sell it all?' \nThree-quarters of householders choose to buy contents cover, according to the British Insurance Brokers' Association. \"But contents-only cover for unoccupied properties isn't as common,\" said Graeme Trudgill, a chartered insurer, of Biba. \"And usually, contents won't be covered by a cheap policy that isn't flexible.\" \n• How can we avoid £7,000 stamp duty when we sell shared ownership flat? \nInstead, it might be necessary to buy a specialist policy that covers contents for both the current home and the new property. \nThese policies might have special conditions, for example requiring you to check on the property once a week, and might not be easy to find via a comparison website. \n= Leasehold flats what's already covered? = \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) if your flat has buildings insurance already, which landlords typically cover, anything that isn't \"screwed down\" will essentially be seen as contents, which needs its own cover. \nAndrew Leakey, from Stephensons Solicitors, said: \"Insurers might define this differently but usually it's anything that isn't attached to the property so some items such as carpets, curtains, light fittings, cookers and so on are contents.\" \n• Can seller take the cooker, fridge and curtains after we've exchanged? \nPermanent fixtures and fittings items which would usually be covered under buildings insurance include a built-in hob and hood or anything permanently that forms a permanent part of the kitchen. Mr Leakey added: \"Buyers should also check their landlord's cover very carefully, as it of course depends on the terms of insurance whether they are covered at all.\" kate.palmer@telegraph.co.uk • Put a question on buying property or borrowing for a house move to our experts: moneyexpert@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T14:27:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
