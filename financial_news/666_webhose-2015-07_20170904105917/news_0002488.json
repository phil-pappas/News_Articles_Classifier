VINCENT KESSLER All the same, Greece appears to be heeding its creditors' demands, with Tsakalotos submitting a request to Brussels for a bailout that offered immediate action on taxes and pensions.\nThe Greek daily Kathimerini is reporting that the proposals put together by the Greek government – which will be voted on by Greek Parliament later today – contain around €12 billion (about $18 billion) worth of measures, which is more than the €8 billion included in the plan rejected by Greek voters in Sunday's referendum.\nThe country's creditors are pushing for more cuts because Greek government revenues are shrinking as the economy slumps deeper into recession.\nGreece is under pressure to demonstrate that it is prepared to adopt tough budgetary measures, not only to placate Germany, which is its largest creditor, but also to appease other eurozone countries – including Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the Baltic countries – which have all undergone radical austerity cures during the region's debt crisis.\n The Baltic countries were hard-hit by the crisis, with their GDP shrinking by 15 per cent in 2009. Before they entered the eurozone, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (in 2011, 2014 and 2015 respectively), introduced brutal spending cuts and cannot see why Greece should not do likewise.\nSimilarly, Ireland and Portugal (which both submitted to tough bailout programs supervised by the \"troika\") and Spain (which implemented stringent spending cutbacks) are not at all pleased by the idea that the radical leftist Greek government should receive special favours that they were denied.\nAfter all, these three countries suffered bruising recessions in 2009, with Ireland's economy shrinking by 6.4 per cent, the Spanish economy by 3.6 per cent and that of Portugal by 3 per cent. To improve their budgetary positions, all three adopted rigorous austerity measures, involving cutting salaries, slashing government spending and pushing up the official retirement age.\nIn addition, these countries all took the axe to their public sectors. In Latvia and Lithuania, the number of public servants fell by 20 per cent, and their salaries dropped by 25 per cent. Spanish public servants suffered a 5 per cent pay cut in 2010, followed by a salary freeze, while Portugal cut the bonus months' salary.\nBut, in Greece's defence, it can be argued that it has already undergone its fair share of austerity.\nWith the Greek economy shrinking by 8.9 per cent in 2010, Athens responded with the usual mix of spending cuts and tax hikes. This caused Greece's budget deficit to shrink from 15.2 per cent of GDP in 2009 to 2.7 per cent in 2014 – a reduction of 12.5 percentage points. This is bigger than that seen over the same period in Spain (which saw its budget deficit shrink by 5.1 percentage points of GDP), Lithuania (8.6 per cent), or Latvia (6.1 per cent).\nGreece can also hold its head up when it comes to efforts to boost competitiveness. Between 2009 and 2014, unit labour costs, adjusted for inflation, fell by around 9 per cent in Greece, slightly less than in Lithuania (where they dropped by around 10 per cent), but more than in Ireland and Portugal (both an 8 per cent fall) and Spain (a drop of 7 per cent).\nThe problem is that Greece has been trapped in a never-ending cycle of austerity and recession, which has caused its overall economy to shrink by around 25 per cent since 2009.\nIn contrast, other eurozone countries, particularly the Baltic states, recovered from their austerity cures and returned to growth. Estonia's economy grew by by 8.3 per cent in 2011 and Lithuania's by 6.1 per cent, Ireland notched up growth (4.8 per cent) in 2014, as did Spain (1.4 per cent) and Portugal (0.9 per cent).\nAlthough there were hopes in the middle of last year that the Greek economy might finally be quitting the sickbed, it has since relapsed into a deep recession. One of the major reasons that Greece has failed to recover is that its industrial base is dilapidated and badly in need of fresh investment. As a result, the country has not been able to take advantage of lower labour costs to boost offshore sales.\nThe risk is that, although the Greek economy is unlikely to benefit from yet another austerity cure, it could be thrown into even deeper disarray next week. Many Greek banks face bankruptcy as soon as Monday if the Tsipras government is unable to strike a deal with the country's creditors on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T06:05:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
