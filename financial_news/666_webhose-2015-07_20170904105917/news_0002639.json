Josh Robenstone Share on twitter by Jacob Greber The Abbott government plans to take a sweeping package of tax cuts to the next election, increasing pressure on this week's historic meetings with state and territory leaders to deliver a breakthrough on the goods and services tax .\nAfter effectively committing to delivering future income tax relief, Treasurer Joe Hockey also challenged state premiers to front up to the political challenge of reform, suggesting they have become complacent about taxpayers' funds flowing from Canberra.\n\"The Commonwealth raises most of the tax revenue, hands it to the states – the states will be more precious about the taxpayer money they receive if they go through the hard politics of having to raise the money in the first place,\" Mr Hockey said.\nSources told The Australian Financial Review the government was eager to put itself in a position to take tax cuts to the next election.\nThe push comes amid growing concern about bracket creep – or the process by which wage inflation pushes people into higher tax brackets . The average wage earner on about $77,000 will soon be paying the second-highest tax rate of 37¢ in the dollar, and Australia currently has a top marginal tax rate of 49 per cent – compared with 33 per cent in New Zealand.\nBudget experts including at Treasury have warned that relying on bracket creep – in its eighth straight year – was an unsustainable way of fixing the budget deficit because it created big disincentives to work.\nDisincentive Mr Hockey said on Sunday that the existing system had become a \"disincentive for people to earn more money\".\n \"That's unacceptable in a modern economy. Certainly we'll be taking a proposal to the Australian people.\"\nThe remarks indicate that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's preferred strategy would be to use next year's May budget as a pre-election launch-pad to outline tax cuts and shifts in about $80 billion of spending responsibilities from the Commonwealth to states and territories, as was foreshadowed in the 2014 budget.\nWhile the desire for tax cuts was growing in the government, the timing on when they would kick in was still to be decided, sources said.\nThe biggest challenge facing Mr Hockey is that the budget is still in too much strife to fund a generous package of tax cuts without either imposing significant spending cuts or allowing a blowout in the deficit, which is in its eighth straight year.\nThe intergenerational report by Treasury suggested in April that Canberra wouldn't have the money for income tax reform until 2021.\nA report by Deloitte Access Economics released on Monday will show this year's budget promise to restore the surplus by early next decade is already under considerable pressure – and that's well before any tax cuts are considered.\nNo wriggle room Falling commodity prices and a still-high Australian dollar, as well as soft wages growth, mean the government has almost no short-term wriggle room to fund new tax promises. Over the longer term, big spending commitments on defence, health and education, as well as any failure to boost productivity growth, will probably weigh on government finances in future.\nIn May, the budget outlined a path back to surplus by early next decade, but this relies on an unprecedented rebound in economic growth to an annual pace of 3.5 per cent between 2017-18 and 2021-22.\n\"To get the official figures a whole bunch of things have to go right,\" Deloitte budget expert Chris Richardson said. \"Some, or most of those things, are outside the control of the government. It needs China to go right and the Senate to go right.\"\nEven with a rebound in commodity prices – particularly for iron ore – and improvement in capital gains tax, there remained the $80 billion in disputed money between the states and Canberra, Mr Richardson said.\n\"State budgets don't reflect what the federal budget assumes about the level of money flowing to the states,\" he said.\nShadow Treasury spokesman Chris Bowen said Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey promised before the 2013 election that they would cut taxes.\n\"Their record, though, is one of increased taxes,\" he said. \"Under the Abbott government, tax/GDP rises each and every year and is higher in every year than in any year of the previous government.\"\nBipartisan backing On Sunday former Liberal treasurer Peter Costello chided Mr Hockey's claim last week that he would pursue GST reform only with the broad bipartisan backing of states.\nThe government will never win such support, Mr Costello, who introduced the GST in 2000, told Chanel Ten.\n\"If we waited for bipartisan support, we wouldn't have a GST today,\" he said.\n\"The opposition never supported that, nor did all of the states support it. It was done against their opposition.\"\nMr Costello questioned the lack of debate about Australia's 49 per cent top marginal tax rate.\n\"We have bracket creep now which has been going on for seven or eight years, uninterrupted, which is putting people into higher income tax brackets.\n\"That's the vice in the Australian taxation system. That's what's got to be dealt with.\"\nMany economists believe that reducing income taxes in exchange for a broader or higher GST is fairer than the current system, which is gradually placing a rising burden on middle and low-income earners.\nGST revenue has fallen At the same time the GST revenue has fallen as a proportion of the economy, as people spend relatively more of their incomes on education and health, both of which are not subject to the tax.\nAnother area the government is targeting is ensuring foreign companies selling services and goods in Australia pay the GST.\nMr Hockey said the government would have more to say about tax reform after Thursday's state, federal and territory leaders' retreat in Sydney.\n\"It is hugely important that we have a more efficient federation ... that we get more efficient taxes in place between the Commonwealth and the states.\" he said.\n\"[Reform] is absolutely essential. You've just got to look at what's happened in Greece to realise that you cannot stop undertaking reform.\n\"And reform of our tax system is one of the many areas that is essential.\"\nAsked on Channel Ten whether tax cuts would be promised at the next election, due within the next 14 months, Mr Hockey said: \"That's what we're aiming for.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-07-19T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T04:10:52.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
