That could be the fundamental reason why the Australian dollar followed those movements,\" he said. \nIt then recovered when the kiwi dollar bounced in response to comments from New Zealand prime minister John Key. \n\"He said the fall in the New Zealand dollar was a bit faster than he expected,\" Mr Tjahja said. \n\"That pushed the kiwi up, and pushed the Aussie with it. It's been quite a volatile day.\" \nAt 1700 AEST, the Australian dollar was at 91.73 Japanese yen, down from Friday's close of 91.88 yen, and at 68.17 euro cents, up from 68.05 euro cents. \nThe Australian bond market is mixed with Japanese markets closed for a national holiday. \nJP Morgan interest rate strategist Sally Auld said Monday had been a quiet day, with no major economic data or news to drive traders. \n\"There's been no data and no headlines,\" she said. \n\"But equities haven't traded with a particularly constructive tone, so maybe there's been a bit of risk aversion.\" \nInvestors will now focus on the Reserve Bank's monthly meeting minutes slated for release on Tuesday, and a speech by its Governor, Glenn Stevens on Wednesday. \nAt 1630 AEST on Monday, the September 2015 10-year bond futures contract was trading at 97.040 (implying a yield of 2.960 per cent), up from 97.005 (2.995 per cent) on Friday. \nThe September 2015 three-year bond futures contract was at 97.970 (2.030 per cent), unchanged. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Baird tries to break GST deadlock AAP \nMike Baird's bold intervention to overcome a political deadlock over the GST may not get past this week's leaders â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T10:36:47.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
