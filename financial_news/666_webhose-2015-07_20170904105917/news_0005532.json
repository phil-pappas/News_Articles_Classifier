The low state of media freedom in Serbia concerns a lot of people. There are many incidents where the public should have been aware of but was left in the dark because of government control. Independent media plays a big part in improving the standards of governance in any country. You can easily understand that only a very select few governments around the world likes an unrestrained media. Media freedom is essential for the growth of a country, reduction of poverty, and other issues that must be made public to protect the people. That is why Opozicionar was created. \nOpozicionar is made up of a group of volunteers who wish to help stop the degradation of media and freedom in Serbia. People have a thirst for real news. They want to know what is happening in the country that is why it is imperative that the media should take a bold step and make the right move. Media freedom and good governance are two very important factors that can help a country’s economic development, as well as the improvement of human lives. Opozicionar’s goal is to become an influential news portal that can make unbiased reports that are made available for anyone concerned. \nFor Opozicionar to realize its goals, they needed more associates and full-time journalists that can investigate important matters and produce quality news videos to be aired on Youtube. Since all the members of Opozicionar are volunteers, they lack enough funds to be able to hire these individuals. They have launched an IndieGoGo campaign to be able to raise enough funds to give these very meaningful endeavors a head start. Any amount will be greatly appreciated, and supporters will be rewarded with Opozicionar t-shirt and mugs as well as ad space on the website for anybody who has a business or two. There is much news that badly needed attention. What is needed are those with enough courage who are willing challenge it and Opozicionar have it! \nFor more information on the Opozicionar IndieGoGo campaign, please check this link: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-us-to-hire-a-journalist#/story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T04:58:47.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
