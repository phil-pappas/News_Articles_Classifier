Bank of America said it will implement any changes at the end of September.\nThe decision pits investors who want the measure to better reflect the corporate high-yield market against those seeking higher yields associated with extra political risk. A removal of emerging-market companies, which accounted for 18 percent of the index at the end of March, may trigger price swings if bondholders are forced to sell those securities and raise funding costs for excluded companies.\n“It may be detrimental if emerging-market companies were removed from the index because this could narrow the investor base,” said Ulrich Gerhard, a London-based fund manager at Insight Investment Management, which oversees about 397 billion pounds ($619 billion) of assets. “Once we see the outcome of the review we’ll decide whether we change the benchmark for the fund or if we need to change guidelines in terms of taking non-index positions.”\nPetrobras Downgrade The portion of emerging-market companies in Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Global High Yield Index has swelled since they were first included four years ago.\nPetroleo Brasileiro SA became the biggest index member after the Brazilian oil producer was cut to junk by Moody’s Investors Service in February, with $44 billion of debt, according to Bank of America. Russian companies represent the largest emerging-market nation at 4.4 percent, followed by Brazil at 3.8 percent. U.S. companies make up 52 percent.\nBank of America is considering removing emerging-market companies from sub-indexes such as the euro high-yield index, even if it keeps them in the global benchmark.\n“It can be tricky when you have an index that suddenly has a big weight from countries like Brazil and Russia,” said Roman Gaiser, who oversees 3.5 billion euros of assets as the Geneva-based head of high yield at Pictet Asset Management SA. “In those countries, the sovereign risk overwhelmingly dominates the corporate risk.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T16:17:43.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
