Confidence for the next five years is now its lowest since the weekly series began in October 2008. ANZ chief economist Warren Hogan said there had been a fast retreat in confidence over the past two weeks. \"The rapid turnaround in sentiment highlights the sensitivity of consumers towards both domestic and global conditions,\" Mr Hogan said. \"Chinese stock market volatility and current negotiations surrounding Greece have dominated the news flow over the past two weeks and spilled over into the local sharemarket.\" Overnight, eurozone leaders finally inked a fresh bailout deal to prevent debt-stricken Greece from crashing out of the euro.
