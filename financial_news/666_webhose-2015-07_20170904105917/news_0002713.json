Chicago, IL\nZiegler, a specialty investment bank, is pleased to announce the successful closing of the sale of the Brentwood Portfolio (the Portfolio) on behalf of SLCM, LLC. (SLCM). SLCM is a developer and provider of senior living services and quality senior care in Indiana and Michigan.\nThe Portfolio included six high-quality, senior living communities located in mid-sized markets throughout Northern Indiana and Southwestern Michigan, previously managed by Brookdale Senior Living. The Portfolio was purchased by Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III. “The value achieved is further evidence of the growing interest in senior housing beyond the country’s largest MSAs,” comments Bill Mulligan of Ziegler’s corporate finance team.\nZiegler served as the exclusive advisor to SLCM in the sale of the Portfolio. The Portfolio totaled 653 rental units, including over 464 licensed assisted living/memory care units, 159 independent living apartments and 30 villas. SLCM is a family-owned and controlled enterprise. The corporate finance team has executed multiple engagements with previous generations of the family; this engagement represents the third time SLCM has engaged Ziegler’s corporate finance team.\nZiegler worked closely with the Brentwood ownership and senior management team to determine probable value, market the business to logical and qualified investors and operators, coordinate management presentations and due diligence, provide transaction guidance and assist in definitive agreement negotiations to accomplish a successful closing. Ziegler was able to identify a number of companies interested in the Brentwood Portfolio, and secured multiple proposals to acquire the portfolio. Ultimately, SLCM chose Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III as their buyer. The transaction closed in three phases as Ziegler helped navigate disparate state licensure processes, operator transition, and a Fannie Mae loan assumption. Ziegler also introduced the buyer to Ridgeline Management Company, which will provide third-party management services. Ridgeline, based in West Linn, Oregon, manages 21 independent living, assisted living and memory care properties in nine states throughout the country.\nThe Portfolio was acquired under a RIDEA structure, which allows for Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III to participate in both the rental and operational cash flow of each facility while relying on Ridgeline Management Company as the third-party manager.\nZiegler’s Corporate Finance team is focused on delivering best-in-class advisory and financing solutions for companies and organizations across the healthcare industry.
