Females have turned extremely risk averse and are performing much older than they actually are,\" she says.\n\"As soon as the sharemarket looks more volatile, they just switch out.\"\nYoung men have resumed pre-GFC investment patterns and still have a strong appetite for equities, which is suitable for their age bracket, the research shows.\nMs Allen says if a woman is approaching retirement, it makes sense to have a low appetite for growth stocks, but not if she's in her 30s and 40s. If the behavioural biases aren't corrected, it could leave women with low retirement balances, she says.\nLess than men It's well noted that women retire on significantly less than men, with data from the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia showing the balances in women add up to just more than half that of men. Of course, it's not just investment philosophies to blame for the variance – broken super contributions from years out of the workforce, coupled with lower average incomes, play a huge role.\nA woman's personal circumstance plays a role too, Ms Herman says.\n\"From a financial planning perspective there are different styles if a woman has been widowed and divorced ... In those situations they had quite often been in a partnership where the men had done the investing, so they were much more keen on a large cash holding. They didn't want to risk their liquidity.\"\nSome say women could benefit from a more active approach to investing in their super, starting in their earlier years.\nSimon Russell, director of Behavioural Finance Australia, says young women who lack confidence when it comes to investment might end up in default options, which aren't ideal for those with long investment horizons.\n\"If you are a younger female, you should be fairly aggressive in your investment strategy,\" he says.\nMen, on the other hand, could learn from the more disciplined approach to investment that women have, particularly when it comes to confirming information, he says.\nSo how can women and men combine their best traits to become great investors?\nFinding the middle ground So if men, in general, aren't afraid of risk but can be too overconfident, and women, in general, approach the market in a measured but sometimes too cautious way, there must be a happy medium.\nWhat investors of both genders need to find, Ms Mackay says, is Goldilocks territory – a solution that's not too hot, not too cold, but just right.\n\"Overconfidence can be quite damaging, while a lack of confidence may mean you don't take sufficient risk to get you where you need to get to,\" she says.\nPerhaps it can be achieved if investors cherry pick the best elements from both of the sexes and leave less desirable qualities at the door.\nFor men, that means harnessing the confidence to move through booms and busts, but drowning out the noise and impulse to act on water cooler advice.\nIt's fine to watch the market, Ms Mackay says, but don't respond to every price change or you could end up eating up your returns on fees.\n\"It's one thing to be aware of what the market is doing. It's another thing investing based solely on what the market is doing and how the press is reporting about the market,\" she says.\nFor women, it's a matter of continuing to think carefully about investment choices but not being frightened out of participation.\n\"It's never too little and never too soon. Keep putting money into investments, whether it's managed funds or direct,\" Ms Herman says.\nAnd of course that's a lesson both genders can take on from the empirical research, she says.\n\"All of the analysis says it's about staying invested in the long term. Being invested and topping up the investments is the key.\"\nWHAT WOMEN CAN LEARN FROM MEN · Back yourself – If you've done your due diligence, it could be a lack of confidence that's holding you back.\n· Don't be put off by jargon – Women have a tendency to be put off by acronyms. Seek clarification if something doesn't make sense.\nWHAT MEN CAN LEARN FROM WOMEN · Trade less frequently – Turning over stocks can be very costly in the long haul. Ask yourself, \"Will this trade really help my long-term goals?\"\n· Check prices less often – If the aim is to build lasting wealth over a lifetime, checking your portfolio several times a day can be distracting.
