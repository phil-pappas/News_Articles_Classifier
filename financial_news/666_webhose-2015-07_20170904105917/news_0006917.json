Photo: Glenn Hunt\nRosemary Vilgan, the outgoing chief executive of QSuper, the third-largest superannuation fund in the country, has backed the Productivity Commission's call for a comprehensive review of retirement incomes policy and flagged her interest in contributing to it.\nQSuper said on Wednesday it is on the hunt for a new chief executive after Ms Vilgan announced her resignation effective from October 23, 2015. Ms Vilgan is highly respected, having guided a transformation of the $90 billion Queensland public sector fund during her 18 years in the top job.\n\"The decision to leave the group hasn't been easy, nor is it one that I have made lightly, but I believe now is the time to move on and allow a new CEO to take QSuper to the next stage. I'm very grateful to have been involved in such a fantastic organisation for over 27 years,\" Ms Vilgan said.\nChallenges for investment market Her departure comes as the outlook for investment markets becomes increasingly challenging .\n\"A global environment of low growth and low interest rates mean we are heading into a more challenging period for investment markets, but QSuper is already on track to respond to that, having warned members to expect lower returns and acted to diversify the fund away from equity market risk,\" she said.\nMs Vilgan told Fairfax Media she does not have a new job locked in, and plans to take a short break at the end of the year before returning to another role in the industry.\nEarlier this week the Productivity Commission called on the government to conduct a comprehensive review of retirement incomes policies , to consider holistically the impact of potential changes to superannuation, tax, age pension, aged care, housing and other welfare measures. The government has ruled out such a review .\n\"I do think there is a need for a comprehensive review of retirement incomes policies, and that is a discussion I would love to be involved in,\" Ms Vilgan said.\nQSuper is one of the few public sector funds that is not facing a massive board restructure over the next three years, pending legislation requiring all super funds boards be comprised of one-third independent directors and an independent chair.\n\"It will depend on exactly how the definition of 'independent' comes up in the final legislation, but I expect that QSuper will not need to make any board changes to comply as we already have more than one-third independent directors and an independent chair,\" she said.\nMs Vilgan was named Telstra Business Woman of the Year in 2013.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/personal-finance/superannuation-and-smsfs/no-evidence-baby-boomers-are-wasting-super-review-finds-20150707-gi62s5", "http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/warning-super-funds-likely-to-miss-longterm-return-targets-20150703-gi270a", "http://www.afr.com/personal-finance/superannuation-and-smsfs/bruce-billson-dismisses-super-review-urged-by-productivity-commission-20150707-gi6tw8"], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:09:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
