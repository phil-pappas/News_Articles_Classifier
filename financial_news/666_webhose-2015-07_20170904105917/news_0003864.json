Factory output also hit a five-month high.\n\"Potentially China is still a bigger risk over the coming period than Greece has been,\" said Ian Stannard, Head of European FX Strategy with Morgan Stanley in London.\n\"It does need to be watched but at the moment that 7 percent print is going to give the market some comfort. In the margins that has helped currencies like the Aussie today.\"\nChinese stock markets, a focus of concern over the past month, shrugged off the data to fall another 3 percent. The Aussie, often used as a liquid proxy for bets on China, was up 0.2 percent at $0.7464.\nThe dollar, which in March paused in its months-long march higher, could take fresh strength from a U.S. Congressional appearance by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen later in the session.\nYellen said on Friday she expected a rise in interest rates at some point this year, and investors will have a chance to hear her latest thinking at the semi-annual testimony.\nThe dollar was steady at 123.43 yen, hovering close to a two-week high of 123.74 scaled overnight but largely unmoved by the Bank of Japan's trimming of its growth forecast and comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda afterwards.\n\"A bland warning (from Yellen) that rates will have to go up eventually is probably neutral for FX markets,\" strategists from French bank Societe Generale said in a morning note.\n\"Anything more dovish than that and equities will be on a roll, the dollar softer in the process. Our economists look for a hawkish bias, which would be a surprise to the market after yesterday's data.\" (Editing by Hugh Lawson )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T11:22:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
