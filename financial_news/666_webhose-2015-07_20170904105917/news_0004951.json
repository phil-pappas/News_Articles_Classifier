These invoices are access points to cash. Either one invoice or multiple invoices for selected quality debtors are ‘sold’ to release funds and improve cash flow,” Naidoo said. \n“If used correctly, Selective Invoice Discounting can be a funding solution that will help to accelerate the cash flow to businesses which need extra working capital to enable growth or to be able to take advantage of a current market opportunity,” concluded Naidoo. \nThe facility can be used on multiple occasions to meet the business’ working capital needs. Once an invoice is settled, the client will have no further obligations to the bank, but the facility remains available for future use. This will be deployed on an invoice-by-invoice basis. Cash can be released within a maximum of 48 hours after completion of take-on process. \nNaidoo said there were alternative funding solutions such as overdrafts, loans or enterprise development funds and it’s up to the business owner to investigate all options thoroughly in order to make the right choice.  //cajnewsafrica.com/?p=6922   21 2015.
