Photo: Supplied\n Volkswagen surpassed Toyota Motor Corp to become the biggest car maker by deliveries in the first half, putting the company on track to capture the worldwide sales crown three years ahead of its target.\nToyota on Tuesday said it sold 5.02 million vehicles in the six months through June, trailing the 5.04 million that Volkswagen reported earlier this month.\nVolkswagen benefited as car demand in Europe accelerated at the fastest pace in 5&frac12; years, softening the blow from a slowdown in China, its biggest market. To achieve its goal set in 2007 to become the world's largest vehicle maker, Volkswagen will have to withstand the slump in demand brought about by China's volatile stock market and competition from cheap SUV models by Chinese brands.\nVolkswagen benefited as car demand in Europe accelerated at the fastest pace in 5Â½ years, softening the blow from a slowdown in China, its biggest market. Photo: Supplied\nA global auto industry that has expanded every year since 2009 faces a stalling market in China, collapsing demand in Russia and weakness in some South-East Asian and South American countries. In the US, industrywide deliveries increased just 4.4 per cent during the first half of the year, putting the market on track for its smallest annual gain since the recovery began.\n\"The extent of the recent softness exhibited by many markets was not anticipated at the beginning of the year by either the companies themselves or by the market,\" Clive Wiggins, a Tokyo-based analyst at BNP Paribas, wrote in a report on Monday. Japanese car makers may cut sales forecasts and need cost reductions and currency gains to avoid having to reduce their outlook for earnings, he said.\nChina slump China's passenger-vehicle sales fell for the first time in more than two years in June as economic growth slowed and a stock market rout dented consumer sentiment. Global vehicle makers will manufacture fewer vehicles in China this year than they are able to because of slowing demand, a reversal after years of rushing to build new factories, Sanford C. Bernstein analysts said in a report this month.\nToyota bucked the market trend with a 42 per cent gain during the month and boosted sales during the first half by 10 per cent to 512,800 vehicles. Volkswagen's deliveries during the first six months fell 3.9 per cent to 1.74 million.\nChristian Klingler, Volkswagen's sales chief, said earlier this month the company was \"not immune\" from market trends in China and that conditions in South America and Russia market in China is changing and that conditions in South America and Russia \"remain tense.\"\nIn Europe, the longest stretch of economic growth for the 19 countries using the euro has put auto sales on more solid footing in countries where Volkswagen dominates.\nEurope sales The German car maker boosted sales in its domestic market and in broader Western Europe by more than 6 per cent, helped by the VW Passat sedan and Porsche's Macan compact SUV. Toyota's registrations in Europe climbed 5.7 per cent during the period, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.\nIn the US, Toyota outpaced the broader market by posting a 5.6 per cent gain, driven by demand for its Lexus NX and Toyota RAV4 compact SUVs. By comparison, the VW, Audi and Porsche brands combined increased sales by 2.4 per cent.\nBoth companies struggled in Japan during the first half, where demand has been weak since last year's sales-tax increase. Deliveries slumped 8.2 per cent for the Toyota and Lexus brands and 13 per cent for Daihatsu.\nSales in Japan plunged 17 per cent for VW, putting the brand on track to fall behind Mercedes-Benz as the top-selling import for the first time in 16 years.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T06:50:30.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
