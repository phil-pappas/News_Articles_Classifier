This is possible because of the comparatively lower base,\" bank's president for corporate banking KVS Manian told PTI.\n\nThe demand will be split evenly between term loans of slightly longer duration as well as working capital loans, he said, adding the bank has a bias towards taking balance sheet-led term-loan exposures wherein it sees a company's balance sheet strength to service the debt.\n\nALSO READ:  Kotak Mahindra Bank lowers base rate to 9.75% \nIt can be noted that the slowdown in corporate demand in the last few years has led to a lot of banks focusing on retail segment.\n\nManian acknowledged that the demand is slower and attributed it to the sluggish economic growth due to which greenfield projects are not coming up and also disintermediation, wherein better-rated corporates are going to money market alternatives to raise money rather than from banks.\n\nThe bank has not revised its conservative approach when it comes to segments like infrastructure which have reported problems in the past, he said.\n\nWhen asked if the newly-started vertical focusing on large corporates will help drive loan growth, Manian said the corporate and investment banking vertical is not aimed at loan growth alone.\n\nThe vertical is for focusing on the needs of a large corporate across financial services and will also help the bank earn fee income through services like debt capital markets and investment banking, he said.\n\nOn his expectations of revival in large ticket loan demand, Manian said it will come in the final quarter and will be driven by an improvement in the sentiments.\n\n\"Optimistically, it can happen in the December quarter, but otherwise, I feel it will happen in the fourth quarter,\" he said.\n\nKotak Bank had recently cut its base rate by 0.10 per cent, taking its cumulative cuts to 0.25 per cent during the fiscal.\n\nWhen asked if he fears losing business to larger rivals like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and SBI who have lower base rates, Manian replied in the negative, saying Kotak Bank can compress its spreads over the base rate to book loans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T16:50:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
