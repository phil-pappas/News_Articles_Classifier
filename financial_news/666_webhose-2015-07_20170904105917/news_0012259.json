According to Quartz, Facebook and Twitter were blocked in 2009, and Google left in 2010 after a government hack. \nSo far, for survival — or at least stability — a new generation of foreign businesses including Evernote and LinkedIn has relied on a willingness to \" work with the Chinese government, even if that means censoring content or sharing access to your data,” said Ben Cavender, principal at the China Market Research Group, to Quartz. \nLinkedIn CEO Jeff Wiener told the Wall Street Journal he opposed censorship. But “[censorship] is going to be necessary for us to achieve the kind of scale that we’d like to be able to deliver to our membership,\" he said. \nThat said, censorship is one thing, sharing secrets is another.
