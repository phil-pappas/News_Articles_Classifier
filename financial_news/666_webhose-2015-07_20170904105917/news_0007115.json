Muscly pony cars like the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro and Dodge Challenger all get 30 miles per gallon on the highway out of their most fuel-efficient versions. Tesla considers its Model S a performance car and it doesn't use a drop of fuel to cover its 270-mile range. \nThe University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute found that cars and light trucks purchased in 2014 got an average of 25.4 miles to the gallon. That's still less than halfway to the EPA and Department of Transportation's goal that it set back in 2012, but it beats the roughly 19 miles per gallon that the Department of Transportation measured for the same pool of vehicles in 1995. It's also closing in on double the average mileage of the light-duty vehicles on U.S. roads in 1980.
