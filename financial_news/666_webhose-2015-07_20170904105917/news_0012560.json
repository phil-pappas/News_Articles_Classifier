East has already halted a share buyback to preserve dwindling cash reserves as he seeks to clean up operations.\n“We welcome any investor who recognizes the long-term value of our business,” Rolls-Royce said in a statement. “We have frequent communication with all of our shareholders and meet with major investors on a regular basis. We look forward to engaging with ValueAct, just as we do with all investors.”\nProfit Drop Shares of Rolls-Royce were trading 5.4 percent higher at 790 pence as of 4:19 p.m. in London. The stock has declined 8 percent this year after slumping 32 percent in 2014, valuing the U.K. company at 14.5 billion pounds ($22.5 billion).\nPretax profit before currency hedging and one-time items fell 32 percent to 439 million pounds in the first half, Rolls-Royce reported Thursday, prompting East to say the company shouldn’t spread itself too thin in developing new engines, while predicting it will have a 50 percent share in turbines that power wide-body jets in five years.\nActivist funds generally acquire equity stakes in public companies and seek to pressure management and directors for changes that boost shareholder returns. ValueAct has served on at least 38 public company boards and typically seeks influence behind the scenes, often with a directorship.\nThe concerns of other Rolls investors may have played a part in the exit of East’s predecessor John Rishton, with New York-based Sequoia Fund Inc. complaining in a letter that his management was “stubborn and entrenched.” Investec Ltd. said earlier that the manufacturer could raise 6 billion pounds by selling off its non-aerospace assets.\nstatistics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T22:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:53:21.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
