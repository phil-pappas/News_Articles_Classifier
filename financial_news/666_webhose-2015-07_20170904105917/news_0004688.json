PederOtto Dybvik JOHN CANDI\nManaging director\nEkornes, Australia & New Zealand\nHow did you start playing golf? My father introduced me to the game of golf during my early teens, supplementing the loan of his old Brosnan golf clubs with a guide to golf written by the great Jack Nicklaus. It wasn't too long after this when any spare time on the weekends would be spent with mates trying to pack 36 holes into a single day.\nGolf course membership? Bonnie Doon Golf Club, Sydney.\nHandicap? A heavily inconsistent 16.\nGolf rule most often broken? Counting my scorecard before the end of the round. It gets me every time.\nWhat clubs do you use? Very forgiving Titleist DCI 822OS irons, a love/hate relationship with a TaylorMade R11, a reliable Odyssey Black Series 9 putter and my saviour, an Adams IDEA ProA12 Hybrid.\nFavourite course and favourite hole? My favourite course would have to be my home club (Bonnie Doon Golf Club), especially since the redevelopment. However, my favourite hole would be hole 10 at Schloss Goldenberg in Zurich. It is a very short par four (227 metres), which has a green that is not visible from the tee box and cow bells to signal the presence of golfers at either end. The intrigue and anticipation of not knowing where your ball landed was always entertaining, especially for optimists like myself, who would look directly in the hole first if the ball was not immediately locatable on the green â€¦ definitely wishful thinking!\nMost inspiring golfer? He's not perfect, but as a golfer, at the top of his game, Tiger Woods was pretty close to it. I remember watching him play at Kingston Heath Golf Club at the Australian Masters in 2009, which he went on to win. My father and I were behind the first tee box for day 1 and I still, to this day, remember the sound of the ball coming off his driver. It is a sound that I have yet to hear again.\nIf you could play anywhere, where would it be? That's easy - Augusta National. I would just make sure that I had three dozen golf balls with me, as well as a golf ball retriever.\nMemorable moments or embarrassing outbursts? Nothing really springs to mind, still waiting for my first hole-in-one though.\nTips? With a handicap of 16, I don't believe I am qualified to hand out any tips. However, a tip that has served me well is do not expect to play like a professional, unless you are prepared to practise like one. It eases the disappointment of a mediocre round.\nMost like to have a round with? I remember a friend of mine was asked to play a round of golf with Clint Eastwood, which unfortunately didn't transpire. I have always been a fan of his (Clint that is) and would imagine that he would be both a great golfing companion and storyteller through 18 holes.\nWorst thing about golf? Waking up to tee off at 6:30am and by the ninth hole, sitting on four points, realising it is one of those days I should have stayed in bed.\nWhy golf? Golf is truly a global game. The sense of excitement and anticipation you feel before you are about to play a new course anywhere in the world is hard to describe. The tradition and etiquette that is generally embraced by most golfers also adds to its charm. Most importantly however, it is just a great opportunity to spend quality time and a good laugh with mates and colleagues.\nThoughts from the 19th hole?
