But its primary competitor, Target, has been carving out market share with catchy advertising campaigns and hip design partnerships. Beyond size and the occasional sold-out capsule collection, how do Wal-Mart and Target really stack up? \nThe Elephant in the Room \nWal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT ) is the world’s largest retail company with over 10,700 stores—4,500 of those in the United States. Its main rival, Target Corp ( TGT ) , operates approximately 1,795 stores in the United States. In 2013, Wal-Mart dominated with a retail market share of 11.4 percent compared to Target’s 2.4 percent. We can have a glance at its balance sheet and market cap to see how huge Wal-Mart is compared to Target. As of the financial year ending in January 31, 2015, Wal-Mart’s total assets were $203.7 billion, about five times larger than Target’s comparatively modest $41.4 billion. In terms of market capitalization , Wal-Mart's $240 billion is three times larger than Target’s $79 billion.

For one, size does not tell how efficiently a company operates. For that, investors should look towards the inventory turnover , asset turnover , and receivables turnover ratios. By comparing these numbers against competitors’ numbers as well as against the retail sector (Wal-Mart, Target, Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST ), and Dollar General Corporation ( DG ) are large players in the sector), we can figure out how efficient the business is.
