APRA also said it would soon respond to a recommendation by the review committee to set aside more capital for potential mortgage losses.\nIf mortgage risk weights were to rise, “it will have the effect of shifting these banks towards a stronger relative positioning against their global peers,” the regulator said.\nThe study is in response to the December recommendations by the government’s Financial Systems Inquiry, APRA said. It measured common equity Tier 1 ratios at the country’s major lenders -- Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Ltd. and Westpac Banking Corp. -- against global peers. Wells Fargo & Co., HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Royal Bank of Canada were among lenders included in the study.\n‘Less Material’ Any changes to minimum capital requirements were “likely to be less material” for smaller banks, APRA said.\nThe top quartile positioning will be “a useful sense check of the strength” of the Australian lenders, the regulator said. “APRA is committed to ensuring any strengthening of capital requirements is done in an orderly manner.”\nNational Australia, which said it was well positioned to meet any additional capital requirements, fell 0.6 percent at 10:30 a.m. in Sydney, compared with a 0.5 percent drop for the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index. Commonwealth Bank fell 0.7 percent, ANZ Bank declined 1.1 percent, while Westpac was down 0.5 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T08:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T03:58:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
