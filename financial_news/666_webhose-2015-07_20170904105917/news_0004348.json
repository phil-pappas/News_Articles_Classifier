However, there is far less clarity about where those assets are going since those currently holding them can't be bothered to update their estate planning documents or inform potential beneficiaries about their plans. \nLittle more than half (56%) of American parents have a will or living trust document, according to a Caring.com survey of adult children. Nearly one-third of parents (27%) do not have estate documents in place and 16% of adult children are unsure if their parents do.

Attorneys and financial advisors say that wills and trusts are legal minefields that can keep families in courtrooms and at each other's throats for years if they aren't administered properly. We spoke to a team of financial and legal experts about estate planning and discovered that the following five estate planning mistakes are among the most common.
