The film was produced by Happy Madison Productions and boasts a $110 million budget. Sony Pictures Entertainment is hoping the action/comedy/sci-fi flick will be a hit like Sandler’s “Billy Madison” and “Happy Gilmore,” rather than falling flat like many of the actor’s more recent films. \nIn “Pixels,” aliens pick up a video transmissions of classic arcade games and mistake them for a declaration of war, prompting them to launch an attack on Earth in the form of those video games. \nRelated: How Much is Stan Lee Worth as Marvel’s ‘Ant Man’ Movie Comes Out? Adam Sandler Net Worth, Movie Successes and Flops \nAdam Sandler’s net worth is estimated at $340 million. He is one of Hollywood’s biggest draws. The actor has commanded a $20 million payday for at least 15 of his more than 30 major studio releases since Saturday Night Live. \nSandler’s movies have grossed more than $2.5 billion, with 14 films grossing more than $100 million, including critical and commercial hits like “Big Daddy,”“The Waterboy” and “Anger Management.” \nSandler’s highs, however, are balanced by extraordinary lows. “Airheads” and “Mixed Nuts” pulled in less than $10 million each. “Men, Women and Children” earned just $2 million worldwide and “Blended” struggled to break even on its $40 million budget. Will “Pixels” Flop or Top the Adam Sandler Movies List? \nForbes predicts “Pixels” — a film based on the wildly popular 2010 short film by Patrick Jean — could be the surprise smash hit of the summer. The initial trailer got 30 million views in the first 24 hours, making it Sony’s most-viewed trailer ever. \nBoth Sandler and “Pixels” co-star Kevin James have built-in audiences that have brought the duo commercial success — even in movies that get horrible reviews, like “Grown Ups.” Sandler is coming off a string of critical disasters. Nine of the last 10 films he has been involved in have received less than 40 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, with two films scoring single digits and one scoring exactly zero positive reviews. Net Worths of Other “Pixels” Stars Kevin James, Peter Dinklage and More Kevin James Net Worth: $80 Million \nKevin James began amassing his $80 million net worth with his role as Doug Heffernan on the hit CBS sitcom “King of Queens.” He found big screen success with “Paul Blart: Mall Cop” and its sequel, as well as “I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry,” which featured Sandler as his co-star. In “Pixels,” James plays President Will Cooper, who enlists Sandler’s character, Sam Brenner — an arcade wiz and Cooper’s childhood best friend — to battle aliens. \nSean Bean Net Worth: $20 Million \nBritish actor Sean Bean has a $20 million net worth. His fortune can be traced back to his early success on British television. The actor most famously played Boromir in the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy. In “Pixels,” Bean plays Corporal Hill, an SAS officer. Josh Gad Net Worth: $2 Million \nJosh Gad began amassing his $2 million net worth in the early 2000s with an appearance on the hit TV show “E.R.” He also landed roles in “Woke Up Dead,”“Numb3rs” and “Back to You.” He has also done voice overs for numerous animated projects, most notably as Olaf in “Frozen.” In the “Pixels” movie, Gad plays Ludlow, who is part of a team of old-school gamers assembled by Sam Brenner to take on an alien menace. Peter Dinklage Net Worth: $10 Million \nPeter Dinklage’s net worth is $10 million. The actor had his breakout role in the 2003 film “The Station Agent.” His most significant work, however, has been his role as Tyrion Lannister on HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” In Pixels, Dinklage plays Eddie, who is another member of the arcade-obsessed team charged with saving the Earth. Ashley Benson Net Worth: $3 Million \nAshley Benson plays the role of Lady Lisa, Ludlow’s tough and highly-skilled childhood video game love fantasy brought to life. Benson’s $3 million net worth can be attributed to her more than 30 acting credits, which include “How I Met Your Mother,”“Family Guy,”“Days of Our Lives” and “The O.C.” \nShare This Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T18:07:01.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
