Eqeus financial planner Gareth Colgan. Source: istock\nThe biggest barrier to improving your financial outlook is an attitude of burying your head in the sand, the research shows, because most of your money is being sucked up by bills and other living costs.\nSimply starting a savings plan can help you remove any monetary stress says MoneySmart’s senior executive leader Miles Larbey.\n“Pay yourself first — get savings deducted from your pay/benefits automatically. Most people don’t miss what they don’t see,’’ he said.\n“Keep a separate savings account ... add in your windfalls, try to save any pay rises, bonuses or tax refunds.”\nHe also urges people to take charge of their regular costs including utility and phone bills by marking on the calendar when they are due.\nAdd up how much your big bills cost in total for the year and put aside an amount to cover these expenses when each pay cheque arrives, he adds.\nResults by comparison website Finder show one of the most common financial worries — mortgage stress — is prominent among those whose repayments exceed 30 per cent of their monthly earnings.\nPeople who buy property with a family member or friend are most likely to experience mortgage stress, with an average of 35 per cent of their income being used towards mortgage repayments.\n ", "external_links": ["http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/topic-stream/3872/evergreen#itm_t=story&itm_l=money-stress", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/home-loans#itm_t=story&itm_l=money-stress", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=The+financial+attitude+holding+you+back&c=ARE+money+problems+making+you+tense+and+miserable%3F+There%26%238217%3Bs+one+little+change+you+can+make+that+can+help+ease+your+stress.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-handle-your-financial-stresses/story-e6frfmcr-1227445548312?sv=6d60fdfd5c22bf30cef7ac7b0730abc8", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-handle-your-financial-stresses/story-e6frfmcr-1227445548312?sv=6d60fdfd5c22bf30cef7ac7b0730abc8", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-handle-your-financial-stresses/story-e6frfmcr-1227445548312?sv=6d60fdfd5c22bf30cef7ac7b0730abc8", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-handle-your-financial-stresses/story-e6frfmcr-1227445548312?sv=6d60fdfd5c22bf30cef7ac7b0730abc8&title=The+financial+attitude+holding+you+back", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-handle-your-financial-stresses/story-e6frfmcr-1227445548312?sv=6d60fdfd5c22bf30cef7ac7b0730abc8&h=The+financial+attitude+holding+you+back", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/guide/building-a-budget#itm_t=story&itm_l=money-stress", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-handle-your-financial-stresses/story-e6frfmcr-1227445548312?sv=6d60fdfd5c22bf30cef7ac7b0730abc8&title=The+financial+attitude+holding+you+back"], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T08:22:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
