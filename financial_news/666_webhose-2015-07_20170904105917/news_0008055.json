Photo: Jessica Hromas\nEver wondered if the person sitting beside you is hiding a dirty little debt secret? Or perhaps you're nervous you've succumbed dangerously to temptation yourself. Well, I can tell you.\nMoney’s Borrowing Power Calculator lets you work out what mortgage is right for you. Source: ABS\nThe typical Aussie now owes $357,500 on their mortgage, $3195 on their credit card and $18,000 on personal loans … a total of $378,695.\nAdvertisement And you're probably muttering \"Typical shmypical\" if you're reading in Sydney or Melbourne.\nThe home loan figure is the scary one, up nearly $100,000 – or 36 per cent – since the credit crack-up just seven years ago showed us the borrowing bogyman in a debt-threat lesson we were supposed \"never\" to forget.\nAs we've chased house prices upwards over that period, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show New South Wales loans have spiked $118,100, or 41 per cent, to $407,900 and Victorians now owe $110,000 more, or 44 per cent, at $359,700. No surprises these are the largest increases in the country.\nWe've heeded the warnings on credit cards; Reserve Bank stats show they're just 2 per cent higher since the GFC hit. However, that's the average of all credit cards, including those that are cleared each month. ASIC's moneysmart.gov.au estimates the balance of cards accruing interest is more like $4800.\nAnecdotally, though, we've become darn responsible with our personal loans: down 12 per cent based on the searches on comparison website mozo.com.au (only aggregate figures are officially collected).\nBut the big issue is how much our total debts cost us each month. My calculations show it's an eye-watering $2664. That's what the average Aussie needs to earn each month before they break even.\nThe average wage is now $76,768 so annual mortgage repayments of $26,184 ($2182 a month) mean 34 per cent is pre-committed to the home. That's into \"mortgage stress\" territory – 30 per cent and up – and means rates hikes, when eventually they come, will seriously squeeze some households.\nBut they'll poleaxe many in the southern states. Nearly 40 per cent of New South Welsh pay packets go straight to a lender; 36 per cent of Victorians' does. And remember, that's without repayments on credit cards or personal loans.\nAltogether, 42 per cent of Australians' salaries is swallowed by our mortgages, personal loans and credit card repayments (at just the minimum) – so past spending, curtailing our ability to afford the future.\nFlipping that, our debt addiction leaves just 58 per cent of our hard-earned left to live on, much like passing \"Go\" in Monopoly and collecting only $116 (and that's before the ATO takes its slice!).\nLoan and card repayments are 2.5 times more than our grocery bills: 17 per cent of household budgets, according to the ABS. Then there's transport at 16 per cent, utilities and bills at 8 per cent, health costs at 5 per cent, recreation at 13 per cent and … oh sorry, you're probably out of cash and reaching for the credit card.\nBut at record-low interest rates, there's an amazing opportunity to ditch debt forever:\nYou shouldn't be paying the average big bank headline mortgage rate of 5.44 per cent, but the best rate with an offset account: 4.06 per cent from loans.com.au (or at least the Big 4 discounted average of 4.68 per cent – ask for it tomorrow!). You shouldn't be paying the big bank credit card rate of 18.35 per cent, but the best rate: 7.99 per cent from Quay Credit Union's Visa Credit Card. You shouldn't be paying the big bank unsecured personal loan rate of 13.94 per cent, but the best rate of 7.99 per cent from Newcastle Permanent Building Society. That would save our average Aussie some $340 in repayments a month, which they could then use to discharge their debt in descending interest rate order, starting with the credit card (with the aid of a 0 per cent balance transfer like the St George/Bank of Melbourne Vertigo Platinum Visa with its 20-month deal).\nAnd what would that \"free\" $340 heaped onto the average mortgage do? Help bring the total interest saving to $140,000 plus repay your debt – and reclaim your pay packet – six years early.\nEducator and commentator Nicole Pedersen-McKinnon is founder of TheMoneyMentorWay.com and developer of The 12-Step Prosperity Plan.\n@NicolePedMcK", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@NicolePedMcK"], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T22:28:00.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
