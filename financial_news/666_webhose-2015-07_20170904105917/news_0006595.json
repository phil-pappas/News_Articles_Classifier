Now Ferrari intends \"to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange,\" FCA said in a statement. \nIts filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC (Shanghai: 603988.SS - news ) ) did not specify the share price range nor the number of shares to be offered, but FCA said it was \"not expected to exceed 10 percent of all ordinary shares.\" \nFiat Chrysler has said it sees the supercar unit valued at more than $11 billion and plans to complete the separation in early 2016, according to Bloomberg News. \nThe auto group had previously said that it wanted to list Ferrari both on the US stock market and an unspecified European market. \nSince the decision to spin off from FCA, Ferrari has been transformed into a new company, New Business Netherlands NV, which will ultimately be renamed as Ferrari NV, the group said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T15:37:59.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
