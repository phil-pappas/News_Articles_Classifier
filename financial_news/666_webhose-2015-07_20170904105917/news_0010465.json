Enzo Ferrari himself agreed to provide two of the 390-horsepower supercars, each with a 4.9 liter flat-12 engine, for use in \"Miami Vice,\" the stylish Reagan Era TV show. In August, the car — and its signature side strakes — will hit the auction block at Mecum’s Daytime Auction. The car wasn't driven much. It's been sitting in storage since the end of the series’ run in 1989. The odometer shows only 16,124 miles. The car is also white, which might not wash with Ferrari purists — they like their rides red — but it makes sense given the overall glossy, pastel aesthetic that made 'Vice' some visually compelling. William Stern, Courtesy of Mecum Auctions “The sun may have set on Crockett and Tubbs, but the 'Miami Vice' Testarossa remains an enduring icon,” the auction house said in a statement. “Authenticated by both Ferrari North America and Ferrari Classiche, with documented service records from Shelton Ferrari in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., this exotic recently received an engine-out service at a cost of $8,000.” William Stern, Courtesy of Mecum Auctions The Testarossa's sibling sold for $1.75 million in December, but the auction house hasn't yet set an estimate for this car. It arrived on the scene for the third season of \"Miami Vice,\" which went off the air in 1989. The interior is vintage '80s. Check out that phone! And it's been a while since Ferrari included a gated shifter in any of its new models. There are no Ray-Ban sunglasses nor Armani jackets, but if you listen closely, you might be able to hear a distant echo of Phil Collins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T00:13:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
