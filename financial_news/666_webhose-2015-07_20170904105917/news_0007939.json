U.S. companies are expected to post their worst sales decline in nearly six years in the second quarter, in part due to the strong dollar that reduces the value of U.S. companies' overseas income.\n\"The question now is if the markets are fully valued and can they move higher without earnings growth,\" said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer of First American Trust in Santa Ana, California, which oversees $1.1 billion.\nBraakman said today's moves could have been worse but positive results from big names such as Boeing and Coca Cola were helping offset some of the losses.\n\"Ultimately, it's earnings that drive the market not revenue and a lot of the growth in earnings is expected to come in the second half of the year.\"\nAdding to the day's weakness, commodities resumed their downward spiral with gold and oil prices under pressure.\nAt 12:47 p.m. ET (1647 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 85.82 points, or 0.48 percent, at 17,833.47, the S&P 500 was down 7.21 points, or 0.34 percent, at 2,112 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 45.10 points, or 0.87 percent, at 5,163.02.\nFive of the 10 major S&P 500 sectors were higher with the utilities index leading the advancers with a 0.8 percent rise. The technology index was the biggest laggard with a 1.71 percent fall, its biggest drop in a week.\nCoca Cola was down marginally at $40.91 while fellow Dow component Boeing was up 0.4 percent at $145.68 after the companies reported results above expectations.\nBaker Hughes fell 8.5 percent to $55.70 following a Bloomberg report that the company's deal with Halliburton was facing resistance from U.S. officials. Halliburton fell 2.7 percent to $40.72.\nThoratec jumped as much 10.3 percent to record high of $63.51 after St. Jude Medical agreed to buy the smaller rival for $3.4 billion. St. Jude was little changed at $76.77.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,767 to 1,216. On the Nasdaq, 1,428 issues fell and 1,246 advanced.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 29 new 52-week highs and 38 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 75 new highs and 117 new lows.
