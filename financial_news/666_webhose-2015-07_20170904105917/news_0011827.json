Louie Douvis Betting markets appear to have taken the same view. Chances of a rate this week cut climbed over the weekend, but remain low at 8 per cent.\nThe Reserve Bank's \"shadow board\" - a group of experts including former board members that is coordinated by the Australian National University - urged the central bank to stay steady, not least to read how both Greece and China's worsening stock market turmoil play out.\n\"While Australia's direct exposure to the Greek economy is minimal, a complete breakdown of negotiations between Greece and the European Union, followed by a Greek exit from the Euro, may have noticeable ramifications for global financial markets,\" said shadow board chairman Timo Henckel.\n\"Of greater concern is China, Australia's largest trading partner, which grew by only 7 per cent in the first quarter of this year, its weakest performance in six years,\" Dr Henckel said.\n The shadow board attaches 57 per cent probability that the official cash rate should stay at a record 2 per cent. There was only an 8 per cent probability of the need for another rate cut, up from 2 per cent in June, while the probability of an increase stood at 35 per cent.\nThe shadow board is unique in that it doesn't attempt to predict what the Reserve Bank will do. Rather, it indicates what the board should do.\nShadow member and University of Melbourne economist, Guay Lim, said it made sense for the cash rate to be left on hold for a while.\n\"This is especially important, considering the possibility of global \"uncertainty\" impacting negatively on the Australian economy. In the absence of action from the fiscal arm of policy, we may need the monetary arm to act quickly and decisively,\" he said.\nMr Stevens clearly foreshadowed his intention to wait for signs of a genuine fall-out on the economy before reacting to Greece.\n\"In terms of our exposures - Australia's exposures are minuscule directly,\" he said a week ago.\n\"So I would anticipate that there's unlikely to be material issues for us unless there was a major ruction in global markets, and in that world everybody's affected. I think we're in good shape\".\nLabour market softening Australia's economic data have been mixed over the past week, with Monday's ANZ Bank monthly job advertisements index rising 1.3 per cent last month.\nHowever, ANZ chief economist Warren Hogan warned that the strength seen in the figures so far this year may not last in the second half, given the economy is running below par.\n\"Significant job losses are still forthcoming as several large resource projects are completed,\" he said.\n\"We expect to see the first signs of softer labour market conditions in this week's official employment figures.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T13:03:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
