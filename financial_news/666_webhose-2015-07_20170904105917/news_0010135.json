A Fitch Ratings decision to pull back from downgrading Malaysia is giving the country space to reinforce its fiscal credentials, he said.\n“This would help us to further strengthen and continue our effort despite all these noises, which I consider temporary,” Mohd Irwan said at his finance ministry office in Putrajaya, the administrative capital outside Kuala Lumpur, referring to the Fitch decision. “We are very committed in our fiscal consolidation.”\nMalaysia has seen its efforts to improve the budget overshadowed by a debt pile-up at state investment firm 1Malaysia Development Bhd. and corruption allegations embroiling the prime minister. While Mohd Irwan reiterated the government’s assertion that 1MDB is sound and has enough assets to pay off its debt, scrutiny has increased over how much liability the government may have beyond its official borrowings.\nMalaysia is incurring additional contingent liabilities beyond explicit guarantees, Fitch said June 30, even as it maintained the country’s credit rating at the fourth-lowest investment grade of A- and upgraded the outlook to stable from negative.\nSustaining Surplus The Fitch decision came after the government outlined its plans for fiscal consolidation and sustaining the current-account surplus, assuring the company Malaysia will avoid a twin deficit situation, Mohd Irwan said.\nThe government is creating a statutory body to take over the housing loans it currently manages for civil servants, he said. That will move about 40 billion ringgit ($10.5 billion) into off-balance-sheet liabilities and reduce the government’s debt-to-gross domestic product ratio, he said.\nMalaysia scaled back subsidies for gasoline and diesel last year after falling oil prices provided Najib the opportunity to wean the country off a decades-old policy of cheap fuel. He has also removed subsidies on sugar.\n“We cannot afford to be in subsidy mode forever,” Mohd Irwan said. “We are at a point where there are too many subsidies and the government budgetary system can’t afford to carry such a burden.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T05:43:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
