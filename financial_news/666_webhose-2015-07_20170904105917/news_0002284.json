Peter Braig by Fleur Anderson The business group representing the 100 largest companies says it wants the same things as small business, which complain workplace and competition rules give an unfair advantage to large companies.\nBusiness is split over the Harper review's changes to competition laws to stop the misuse of market power. The Abbott government is expected to announce its decision on the changes as early as August.\nBusiness Council competition spokesman and Gilbert and Tobin managing partner Danny Gilbert said: \"There are some proposals which small businesses are hoping will improve competition arrangements for them but which might actually do the opposite.\"\nHe said the proposed changes to the misuse of market power laws could discourage ordinary competitive activities by businesses regardless of size.\nHe gave the example of a rural cheese shop which acquires exclusive supply rights with a dairy farm to supply enough dairy products to meet their customers' demand. But the deal has the effect of driving a local butter maker out of business because it is unable to buy enough milk for its products.\n\"We just won't know the extent to which certain activity would breach the proposed new laws until it is tested through the courts,\" Mr Gilbert said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:58:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
