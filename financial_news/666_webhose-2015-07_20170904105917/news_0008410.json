Low prices tempted some buyers back to the market on Wednesday, but gains remained muted.\nSpot gold was down 0.3 per cent at $US1,089.34 an ounce at 2:53 pm EDT (0453 Friday AEST), off a high of $US1,105.60. US gold futures for August delivery settled up 0.2 per cent at $US1,094.10. \"The markets are all focusing on a September rate hike, so assuming that is when it occurs, you have to think that gold is going to remain under downward pressure up until that point,\" Citi analyst David Wilson said. Gold has been undermined this year by expectations that the US Federal Reserve is on track to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, boosting the cost of holding non-yielding bullion and lifting the US dollar. \"If you're thinking about the Federal Reserve hiking rates in September maybe December, in real terms that could be a larger impact than you may have thought,\" said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy for TD Securities in Toronto, noting there is not enough inflation to attract buying of gold. Technical analysts, who study past price patterns to estimate the future direction of trading, say once its current bounce from Monday's slump is over, the next target for gold below its Wednesday low near $US1,087 an ounce is $US1,044, its 2010 low. \"The bounce in gold is nothing but a technical trade, as most major momentum indicators are showing that the recent selloff is overdone,\" AvaTrade's chief market analyst Naeem Aslam said. Investors continue to cut their exposure to gold. Holdings in the biggest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Shares, shrank for a fifth day on Wednesday to their lowest since 2008. Some demand emerged for physical metal, however. A retreat in the dollar, which fell 0.5 per cent against a currency basket, encouraged some buying in China overnight, dealers said, while weak gold prices spurred buying of bullion coins in the United States where Mint sales jumped to a 2013 high. Silver was down 1.00 per cent at $US14.63 an ounce. Spot platinum fell 0.8 per cent at $US971 an ounce, while spot palladium was down 1.6 per cent at $US613.75 an ounce.
