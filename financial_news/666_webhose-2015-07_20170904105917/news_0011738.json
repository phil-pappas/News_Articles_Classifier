Moller-Maersk, which controls 75 percent of the shares, and a group of individual investors which owns the rest. \nEsvagt has a fleet of 43 vessels and is a provider of offshore safety and support at sea primarily in and around the North Sea and the Barents Sea. \nIt made a record profit of 252 million crowns in 2014 on turnover of 943 million crowns. \nSince 2010, Esvagt has been servicing the Bligh Bank Offshore Wind Farm for Danish wind turbine maker Vestas . \nThis year, it has put two specially built service operation vessels for offshore wind turbine farms into operation for Siemens Wind Power. \nA.P. Moller-Maersk has offloaded a string of companies and stakes in subsidiaries in recent years to focus on container shipping, oil, port operations and drilling. It has booked more than $11 billion from divestments since 2009. \n($1 = 6.7689 Danish crowns) (Reporting by Ole Mikkelsen; Editing by Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T10:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T11:48:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
