Analysts are worried that the UK will react too slowly in raising rates which could lead to another crisis. \nAsia remains the home to the strongest emerging markets despite the slowdown in Chinese growth. The developed countries of the continent are going in separate directions. South Korea and Australia have weakening economies, while Japan and India are heading in the right direction. \nIn total, global GDP growth is expected to reach 3.1% in 2015, down from 3.3% in 2014. Global consumer inflation should also slide to 3.2% this year, from 3.6% in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T18:05:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
