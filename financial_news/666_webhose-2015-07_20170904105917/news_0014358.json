We are not expecting anything great to happen, it has not happened in the last quarter and I do not think it will happen this quarter,” she said.\nThe SBI chief said the bank’s target on the lending side is 14%. “Segmentwise, it would differ a little as we are more focused on retail and corporate segments than SME and mid-corporate. I would be happy if they (SME and mid corporate) clocked around 10-12%,” Bhattacharya said.\nShe said certain stalled projects are beginning to move. “A few of them which need equity are still stalled, but most others are beginning to move. We will see some amount of disbursements there, but still the overall demand push is slow,” Bhattacharya said.\nLoan growth in the first couple of months in FY16 has shrunk with very little demand for credit. Companies have preferred to access the CP market for their short-term needs and banks seem to have lent more via the CP route than through loans. Bhattacharya also said that, at present, talks of merging SBI subsidiaries are on the back burner.\nFirst Published on July 3, 2015 12:20 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T09:12:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
