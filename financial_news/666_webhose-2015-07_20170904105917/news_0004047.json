RBI expects inflation to rise to 6 per cent by January 2016.\nThe central bank is scheduled to announce third bi-monthly monetary policy on August 4.\nOn growth, Morgan Stanley said domestic demand would be the main driver of acceleration in growth, with support from external demand likely to pick up only gradually in the second half of this calender year.\nAccording to the firm, slowing rural real wage growth and tightening fiscal policy are likely to hold back rural consumption in the next 3-6 months, while urban consumption is expected to accelerate in a sustained manner with rising real incomes, a steady pickup in job growth and added support from further rate cuts.\n“We believe that in order to sustain growth at 7-8 per cent levels, in the medium term the government will need to focus on addressing issues related to land, labour tax, policy regime related to infrastructure and overall ease of doing business,” the report added.\n 23, 2015 3:38 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T14:26:12.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
