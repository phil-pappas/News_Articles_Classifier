Tamara Voninski by Ben Potter The US government is laying claim to taxes owed to Canberra by tech giants, Treasurer Joe Hockey said.\nMr Hockey told a lunchtime seminar in Melbourne the US is not only becoming more vigilant and aggressive about collecting taxes from its technology giants but also seeking to tax them on profits made in Australia and other countries.\nMr Hockey told the PwC tax reform seminar in Melbourne there had been a seachange in attitudes to multinational tax avoidance among some finance ministers in the Group of 20 top economies and one country in particular – understood to be the US – was now going after taxes owed to the Australian government.\nUS tech giants such as Google, Apple and Microsoft are under fire globally and in Australia for their aggressive tax minimisation structures, including the now infamous \"Double Irish Dutch\" sandwich which enables them to pay little or no taxes on large swathes of profits shifted from high-tax countries such as Australia.\nMr Hockey said that when he first raised the issue of multinational tax avoidance at a G20 finance minister's meeting, \"one or two\" of his colleagues had said \"leave it alone, they're our companies, leave it alone, they pay their fair share of tax\".\n\"I must say that view has changed in the last 12 months. And that country is not only trying to get them to pay the tax they're owed – they're trying to get the taxes they owe to us,\" he said.\n\"I make no apology for going after the approximately 30 multinationals which are engaging in the Double Irish Dutch sandwich – which I am sure nobody at PwC knows anything about, and which I think is appalling,\" Mr Hockey said.\nHe rejected calls to rein in generous superannuation tax concessions for higher earners, saying that with fixed income returns relied on by many retirees at extremely low rates historically, imposing new taxes on super could reduce the consumption and harm fragile economic growth.\n \"If you were to impose new taxes on super – as our opponents want to do – you are going to reduce the amount of money retirees have in their pockets,\" Mr Hockey said.\nChallenged by Melbourne University economics professor John Freebairn to mount a comprehensive \"big bang\" reform effort on retirement incomes and taxes to ensure their sustainability in the future, the Treasurer observed that a proposal to raise the retirement age to 70 by 2035 in last year's budget had been howled down by Labor.\nHe said the government had a lot of reform processes on foot and any reform of retirement incomes would need \"proper consideration\".\n\"Let's just do it incrementally and carefully and, importantly, reassure people.\"\nMr Hockey said the $35 billion of uncollected taxes identified by the Inspector-General of Taxation in part reflected \"legacy issues\" and a change of tactics on the part of the Australian Tax Office to a more co-operative approach to collecting unpaid taxes from reluctant taxpayers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:57:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
