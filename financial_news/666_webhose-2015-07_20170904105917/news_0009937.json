Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in the FTSE 100-listed group soared more than 12pc to 491p in the first few minutes of trading. \nRSA, which owns the More Than insurance brand, declined to comment on the possible bid. \n“Our view has been that despite the group’s recent woes, such as in Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) , there are some terrific assets in RSA that are attractive to corporate predators, such as in Canada and Scandinavia,” said Eamonn Flanagan, analyst at Shore Capital. “In addition, following the rights issue and disposals, the group is pretty well capitalised, in our view.” \nInsurers across Europe are preparing themselves for the Solvency II rules that come into force in January and require firms to hold certain levels of capital to protect themselves against market shocks. The changes have prompted a number of firms to consider M&A to improve their capital bases. \nZurich said in a recent investor day presentation that it expects to deploy $3bn in excess capital over the next 18 months, having positioned itself early for the European capital rule changes. The Swiss group also identified the chance to grow its UK life insurance business following the recent pension reforms. \nRSA, which operates as a general insurer, had already seen its shares rise by almost a tenth in the past month as traders bought into the prospect of a takeover bid emerging. \nStephen Hester joined RSA as chief executive last year \nRSA brought in Stephen Hester, the former head of Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) , as chief executive in February 2014. His predecessor Simon Lee left the firm after it issued three profit warnings within six weeks, worsened by a £200m accounting hole in the Irish business. \nMr Hester slashed RSA's dividend and raised £748m in a discounted rights issue last year to shore up the insurer's finances. The company is not thought to have spoken to Zurich executives about the possible bid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T11:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T11:49:48.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
