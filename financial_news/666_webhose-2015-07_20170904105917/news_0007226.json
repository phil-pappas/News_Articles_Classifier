Suncor Energy Inc rose 2 percent to C$35.05 and Encana Corp jumped 4.3 percent to C$12.74.\nU.S. crude prices gained 1.9 percent to $53.21 a barrel, while Brent crude added 1.4 percent to $58.63.\nThe index rose 66.18 points, or 0.46 percent, to 14,599.40, with nine of the ten main industry groups ending higher and financials barely lower.\nBut investors remained cautious on Canadian equities given expectations for lackluster earnings reports in the coming weeks.\n\"There's still a good deal of uncertainty out there,\" Petursson said. \"There's still some risk to be had in terms of economic growth.\"\nAmong the most influential decliners on the day were pipeline operator Enbridge Inc, which gave up 1 percent to C$58.20, and First Quantum Minerals, which shed 2.5 percent to C$16.02.\nToronto-Dominion Bank dipped 0.4 percent to C$52.16 and Bank of Nova Scotia edged 0.2 percent lower to C$63.79.\nThe overall financials sector, home to banks and insurers, retreated 0.1 percent.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners at a 2.3-to-1 ratio, with the index posting six new 52-week highs and seven new lows.\n($1=$1.27 Canadian) (Reporting by Solarina Ho ; editing by Peter Galloway, G Crosse)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T00:33:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
