Dhillon will now be filing an appeal against the order to the higher court of appeal.\nOfficials immediately took Dhillon into custody from the premises of Supreme Court of British Columbia in Vancouver where the sentencing was pronounced at 8.30 am local time.\nDhillon is now facing trial for punishment for contempt of court under a four century old Common Law in Canada. Mistry had appeared for Dhillon at the a court hearing on September 17, 2014 in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The offence was that he had allegedly written a blog in contravention of a 2009 court order that prohibited anyone from writing or pleading anything defamatory or disparaging about leading accountancy firm KPMG, the Trustee in a bankruptcy proceeding against another person of Indian origin, Erwin Braich. Dhillon said he was one of the creditors and is owed $3 million. Dhillon, whose parents had moved to Canada before his birth there, was even arrested for a day in 2010 for the offence.\nDhillon had said that truth and public interest was a defence but Crown counsel Jeremy Hermanson said that truth is not a defence in violating a court order. Counsel for KPMG Inc in court were A D Gay and J L Gartner.\n\"The contempt alleged against Dhillon is breaching a court order...and not contempt by scandalizing the court, a type of contempt that's rarely used post Charter,'' the Crown said adding, \"If he (Dhillon) felt the order was wrongly decided, his obligation was to appeal that order...he cannot attack the order now by saying there is some public interest in what he had to say (in the blog).\" Dhillon said what he allegedly blogged was in public interest, true and not defamatory and hence he committed no contempt.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias= Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-07-11T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T10:54:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
