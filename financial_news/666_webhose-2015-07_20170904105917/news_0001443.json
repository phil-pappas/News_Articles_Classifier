According to research firm SNL Kagan, the total amount of retransmission fees is now estimated to rise from $6.3 billion in 2015 to $10.3 billion in 2021. \nThe average station’s monthly retransmission fee will rise to $1.53 by 2018, an amount surpassed by only five pay-TV networks: Walt Disney Co.’s ( DIS ) ESPN sports network charges $8.80 a month and is the highest-cost station by a wide margin; TNT, owned by Time Warner Inc. ( TWX ), charges $2.16 a month; Fox News ($1.67 a month) and Fox Sports 1 ($1.57 a month) are owned by Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. ( FOXA ); and the Disney Channel ($1.56 a month). \nALSO READ: The Most Expensive Town in Each State \nnScreenMedia has analyzed what the changes mean for a subscriber to DirecTV ( DTV ).

All things equal, by 2021 DirecTV will be paying 57.2% of revenues for programming. Those costs will be passed through to subscribers, who will have to decide if it is worth the money.
