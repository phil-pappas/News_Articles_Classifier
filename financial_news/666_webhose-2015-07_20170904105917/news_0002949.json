REUTERS/Edgard Garrido MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican state oil company Pemex (PEMX.UL) reached a $295 million settlement with a group including German industrial conglomerate Siemens (SIEGn.DE) in a longstanding dispute over a refinery project, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday. \nThe deal was originally announced in March but did not give details of the final settlement. \nA Mexican official close to the negotiations said that Pemex had agreed to settle for $295 million. Earlier in the day, Pemex said in a statement that the deal struck definitively ends the 14-year-long dispute, but it did not give a sum. \nThe official said Siemens originally sued for $690 million. \nA Pemex spokesman declined to name the amount. \nA Siemens spokesman declined to confirm the value of the settlement, which he described as a private matter. \nThe dispute involved Conproca, a Mexican joint venture between Siemens and South Korea's SK Engineering & Construction Co Ltd, which was created to bid for the reconfiguration of its Cadereyta refinery in the northern state of Nuevo Leon. \nPemex was at loggerheads with Siemens and SK Engineering & Construction Co Ltd - a unit of SK Holdings Co - over allegations of graft and cost overruns relating to the Cadereyta project. \nThe settlement will fund anti-corruption, environmental and social development projects in Mexico, the companies said. \n(Reporting by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Alan Crosby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T01:53:23.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
