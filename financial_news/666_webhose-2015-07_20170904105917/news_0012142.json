An 8.6 percent depreciation in July, the most among 24 emerging-market peers after Colombia’s peso, prompted economists to wager that the Bank of Russia will lower benchmark borrowing costs by 50 basis points on Friday to 11 percent.\nWhile ruble weakness is beneficial for Russia by offsetting the effect of falling oil prices on the national budget, the downside is that it boosts the price of imported goods and risks driving inflation already 11 percentage points higher than the official target. The central bank, which cited concern over consumer prices at its last rate meeting in June, this week stopped daily purchases of foreign exchange to avoid exacerbating the currency’s slump.\n“The ruble’s medium-term prospects don’t look bright at all,” Dmitry Dorofeev, managing partner at multi-asset fund White Dragon in Moscow, which currently doesn’t invest in ruble-denominated assets, said in e-mailed comments. “The most the central bank can do is to slow the depreciation in order to maintain financial stability.”\nOf the 35 economists polled by Bloomberg on today’s rate decision, only five expect policy makers will keep borrowing costs on hold at 11.5 percent. The key rate has been reduced by 5.5 percentage points in 2015 to support banks and shore up an economy caught in its worst slowdown in six years.\nGovernment bonds, which have handed investors the biggest returns in emerging markets this year at 12 percent, fell for a second day on Friday. Yields on five-year notes rose four basis points to 10.95 percent, trimming this month’s decline to 23 basis points.\nCrude oil, which along with natural gas accounts for about 50 percent of Russia’s budget revenue, decreased 0.9 percent to $52.81 a barrel in London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T12:39:19.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
