Jamila Toderas Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan A former organiser for the construction union and a Labor Party branch president was arrested by police in Canberra after it was revealed by the trade union royal commission that he allegedly extorted more than $150,000 from a building company.\nHalafihi Kivalu, who was president of a Labor branch in the ACT until May 2015 , denied demanding $50,000 from a contractor, Elias Taleb. But on Thursday the royal commission played him a secretly recorded telephone conversation of the former Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union organiser seeking the money from Mr Taleb.\nACT Police said on Thursday that a 39-year-old Queanbeyan man had been arrested after the hearing.\nThe Australian Financial Review confirmed on Thursday that Mr Kivalu was president of the ALP's Dickson Morning sub-branch until May.\nZach Smith, the branch's current president, said Mr Kivalu had been president for 12 months. Mr Smith is also an organiser with the CFMEU.\nMr Kivalu admitted to the commission on Thursday that he took $60,000 from Mr Taleb. He said the cash was paid voluntarily and without the knowledge of the union.\nAsked by counsel assisting the commission Jeremy Stoljar whether he had demanded $50,000 from Mr Taleb for the \"Morris job\", Mr Kivalu said: \"I didn't demand any money from anyone.\"\nDemanded payment The commission then played a recording of a telephone conversation between Mr Kivalu and Mr Taleb on April 10, 2015, in which Mr Kivalu demanded payment of $85,000.\n\"Remember we agreed on fu--king 50 grand for the Morris job,\" Mr Kivalu is recorded as saying during an expletive-laden conversation with Mr Taleb.\nHe told Mr Taleb there was a $35,000 payment for a separate job at Yarralumla \"that you still haven't paid for\".\nIn his witness statement, Mr Kivalu also said: \"I deny that there was any discussion concerning money that Elias owed to me and I did not consider him to be in debt to me in any way.\"\nMr Kivalu was expelled this week by the CFMEU after Mr Taleb told the commission he paid more than $135,000 to Mr Kivalu to work in Canberra.\nThree other employers gave evidence that they made payments to Mr Kivalu.\nGiving evidence to the commission on Thursday, Mr Kivalu said Mr Taleb and he had been friends but he agreed that he kept the payments secret.\n'Money he offered' \"This was the amount of money that he offered me with a view to me assisting his business to get work,\" he said in his witness statement.\nMr Kivalu said he did not take any action to help Mr Taleb get business despite taking the money. The commission was played a recording of a telephone conversation between Mr Kivalu and his wife, about an alleged plan for Mr Taleb to build a shed on their family property.\n\"He's going to do our shed for us, you know,\" Mr Kivalu said. His wife replied: \"No, we don't want the shed. We just want the money.\"\nAfter it emerged on Thursday that Mr Kivalu had been an ALP branch president, Employment Minister Eric Abetz sought to link the controversy to Labor leader Bill Shorten.\n\"Revelations such as this are a test of leadership for Bill Shorten,\" he said. \"Will he take decisive action at the upcoming ALP conference to reform his party to prevent it being controlled by the worst elements of the union movement?\"\nA spokesman for Mr Shorten said on Thursday it was not appropriate to comment, given Mr Kivalu had been arrested.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-07-16T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:57:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
