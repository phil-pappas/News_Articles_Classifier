Although the app was only supposed to debut a few weeks later, an early version of Microsoft’s Cortana app for Android was leaked a couple of days back. The official app will only be released alongside or a few weeks after ‘Cortana for Windows 10′ is made available to the public. Sponsored Links \nThe leak seems to be an early unfinished version of Cortana for Android. But most of the features work as the Windows version. In fact, it is seen that the leaked app looks a lot like the miniature version of Cortana for Windows 10. Also, the app usually worked well without any crashes, despite being an unofficial version. \nAs for features, the Cortana for Android could carry out a lot of different functions for the user like finding information about weather, traffic, places to eat and set reminders too. Even location based reminders work well on the app. Cortana could also transcribe speech into emails and text messages. \nOne of the missing features on the Android version is the ‘Hey Cortana’ function. Windows users can just say Hey Cortana to start up the assistant app. On the other hand, this feature is missing at least in the early version for Android. Users who wish to use the app will have to click on the icon. However, once running, Cortana can answer questions asked both via text or voice. \nMicrosoft had released a preview version of the Cortana for Android in one of its beta programs a few days back. This build was only available to those who were a part of the Windows Insider program. So, one of those members could have been responsible for this early leak. \nThe company said the following in a blog post last week, \n“In the spirit of the Windows Insider Program, we are looking for a limited number of people to get their hands on an early version of the app. It’s important to keep in mind that is the first public release of the Cortana for Android beta. And that for now, Cortana for Android is only available in the U.S. and China. Over the coming months, we’ll continue to deliver frequent updates to the app to expand the features and functionality,” \nYou can download the leaked version from here .
