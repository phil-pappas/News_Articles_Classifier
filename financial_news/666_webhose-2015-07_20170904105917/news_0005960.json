Profit is expected to have fallen 2.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.\nThe dollar index was up marginally at $97.91. It had earlier hit a three-month high due to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike this year.\nS&P 500 e-minis were up 2.75 points, or 0.13 percent, with 56,774 contracts traded at 8:37 a.m. ET (1237 GMT).\nNasdaq 100 e-minis were up 13.25 points, or 0.28 percent, on volume of 11,928 contracts while Dow e-minis were up 37 points, or 0.21 percent, with 9,069 contracts changing hands.\nInvestor sentiment was also buoyed by positive signals from Greece. Greek banks reopened their branches across the country after a three-week shutdown.\nMorgan Stanley shares were up 1.5 percent to $40.80 in premarket trading after the U.S. bank's consolidates net revenue rose 13 percent.\nPayPal Holdings was up 3.8 percent to $39.85 on a \"when-issued\" basis premarket ahead of its trading debut after it split from e-commerce company eBay.\nVivint Solar soared 42.4 percent to $15.58 after solar company SunEdison said it would buy the company in a deal valued at about $2.2 billion, including debt. SunEdison was up 3.3 percent to $32.59.\nHorizon Pharma jumped 9.2 percent to $40.49 and was set to open at a record, after the Irish drugmaker raised its full-year sales forecast.
