However, operating expenses jumped to 1.01 billion dirhams, a rise of 17 percent over a year earlier. \nThe primary contributor to growth in expenses was NBAD's investment in hiring talent, expanding client service capabilities and enhancing IT infrastructure, the statement said. \n\"We delivered this growth despite economic and market headwinds, including lower oil prices, margin compression and lower non-customer income in our global markets business,\" Alex Thursby, group CEO, said in the statement. \nThe lender booked 166 million dirhams as impairments in the second quarter, down 22.6 percent from a year ago. \nLoans grew 20 percent on the year to 217.9 billion dirhams by the end of June, while deposits fell to 230.1 billion dirhams versus 237.4 billion dirhams a year earlier. \nIn June, the bank launched its inaugural $750 million Additional Tier 1 Perpetual Bond, strengthening its capital position. \nNBAD is expanding in Egypt to add export financing to its wholesale operations and introduce wealth management services for affluent Egyptians, its CEO told Reuters in March \nShares in NBAD closed 1.4 percent higher on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T23:48:43.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
