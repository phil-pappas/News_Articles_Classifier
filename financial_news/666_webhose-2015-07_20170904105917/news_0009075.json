You’re just one person.\nPlus, how do you really know that your charity of choice is reputable and impactful?\nUniversity of Oxford professor William MacAskill set out to answer these very questions by taking an honest, evidence-based look at how we approach charitable giving.\nThrough his research, MacAskill found it’s surprisingly easy for each of us to make a major impact if we avoid common assumptions about giving.\nIt also turns out that the best charities are hundreds of times more effective than the merely good ones. And, he argues, the way we tend to evaluate them is all wrong.\nHe even has a term for it, effective altruism, and a new book on the topic: “ Doing Good Better: How Effective Altruism Can Help You Make a Difference .”\nIntrigued, we caught up with the outspoken MacAskill to uncover what it takes to be an effective altruist—and why you may want to rethink that donation to disaster relief.\nRELATED: Charitable Giving: Not All Generations Are Equal\nPage 1 / 5 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1592409105", "http://www.learnvest.com/2015/07/doing-good-better-author-q-and-a/", "http://www.learnvest.com/2013/08/charitable-giving-not-all-generations-are-equal-123/"], "published": "2015-07-23T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T19:38:10.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
