There's a huge opportunity.\" \nEcho plans to relocate its headquarters to Brisbane to oversee the project, tipped to create about 3000 construction jobs and 8000 continuing jobs when it is built. \nHowever prominent anti-gambling campaigner Senator Nick Xenophon said the construction phase would provide a sugar hit for the economy, but the casino would leave a sour taste. \nQueensland's existing four casinos - in Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Townsville and Cairns - have failed to spur economic activity and instead encouraged gambling addiction, Senator Xenophon said. \n\"Having a state development model based on gambling is chasing fool's gold,\" he told AAP. \n\"There's no question that this project will lead to more aggressive marketing by other gambling venues trying to compete with it. \n\"This is a classic case of the public interest losing out to the corporate interest.\" \nThe Australian Family Association also questioned the need for the casino, even if it offered discounted dining. \n\"They will say it creates employment and it has cheap good food, but I see that as a lure for something that's socially negative,\" national spokeswoman Terri Kelleher told AAP. \nQueensland's government has clearly avoided using the c-word when referring to the precinct. \nThe word was used once in a 400-word news release announcing the project had been awarded on Tuesday. \nThe casino was not even mentioned in a list of key highlights of the proposal. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T10:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T10:59:59.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
