Afterward, setting up \"auto-pay\" will help you to avoid one of the most-common fees: a late charge, he added. Other frequent charges include annual fees, balance transfer fees, foreign transaction fees and cash advance fees. \nIn the Creditcards.com survey, 99% of the the cards charged late fees and 81% had returned payment fees, typically $35. \nStill, credit-card users are better off in many ways than a decade ago. With the implementation of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 , also called the CARD Act, late fees were capped at $27 for the first late payment and $38 thereafter. \n\"The CARD Act really just slashed a lot of the fees,\" said Linda Sherry, director of national priorities for Consumer-Action.org . \"They made it much more consumer friendly.\" \nTwenty-six percent of cards in the CreditCards.com survey had an annual fee ranging from $25 to $195, while nearly 80% charged balance transfer fees that were typically 3% of the transfer amount. Foreign transaction fees were found on 77% of the cards, usually charging 3% of each transaction in U.S. dollars, according to the survey. \nFinally, 98% of cards surveyed charged cash-advance fees, ranging from $10 to as much as 5% of the advance amount. \nOther less common fees, according to Creditcards.com : Account re-opening fees", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:24:55.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
