It is generally accepted that the big four banks can turn $1 of capital into $70 of home lending.\nThat enormous leverage is possible because of the risk weighting that is applied to mortgage assets.\nThe risk weighting of mortgages differs between the big four banks and the regional banks because of the different models for measuring and managing credit risk.\nThe big banks have benefited from a system called the internal ratings based (IRB) approach to calculating regulatory capital. This is commonly known as the advanced approach to risk weighting.\nLow default rates They invested millions of dollars in systems that analysed loan default histories. Australian mortgages have low default rates and that naturally led to lower risk weights.\nBut the BIS discovered several years ago that the global risk weighting system was flawed. They were aware of a problem but confirmed it existed when they asked different banks in different jurisdictions to provide the BIS with their assessment of risk weights for the same portfolio of assets.\nThe responses varied between banks which showed that the IRB approach or advanced accreditation was not delivering uniform outcomes.\nMost importantly, the BIS work found that the IRB systems did not cope well with the unforseen risks in an asset class with a long history of low defaults. The Basel Committee is now of the view that risk models built on low default histories do not provide sufficient protection for depositors against unexpected events.\nAPRA chairman Wayne Byres was heavily involved in the BIS work on risk weights when he was secretary general of the Basel Committee, which is the regulatory capital-setting arm of the BIS.\nSince taking over from John Laker as chairman of APRA, Byres has spent much of his time confronting the prudential challenges presented by a booming housing market.\nHe moved quickly to ensure the banks tightened their rules for investment loans. He will move soon to lift risk weightings on mortgages for the big four and that will probably add about 100 basis points to their overall capital.\nMany ways to raise capital The banks will have about a year to add this $12 billion in overall additional capital. There are many ways to raise that capital including dividend reinvestment plans, selling assets and full-blown capital raisings.\nThe big banks will have about 12 months to lift their capital following a change in risk weighting for mortgages from about, on average, 18 per cent to between 25 and 30 per cent. Regional banks, which have risk weighting for mortgages of about 36 per cent, will not be affected.\nBut their competitive position will be enhanced.\nIn some ways Byres had a baptism of fire because soon after taking over he was hit with recommendations for higher capital made by David Murray's financial system inquiry.\nMurray's finding that Australia's banks needed to be \"unquestionably strong\" and that they were not carrying enough capital relative to their global peers was a less-than-subtle criticism of APRA's performance.\nOf course, Murray's conclusions on capital were initially trashed by the banks through the Australian Banking Association.\nThe ABA turned to accounting firm PwC to reaffirm its view that the banks had more than enough capital.\nThey argued that APRA had imposed capital rules that were tougher than regulators in other jurisdictions.\n'At or above 75 percentile' The PwC conclusion that \"on average, the Australian banks are at or above the 75 percentile of bank capital relative to the most appropriate comparator banks\" was a strong riposte.\nHowever, it was out of step with the findings of the leading banking analyst and commentators such as the AFR's Christopher Joye.\nAPRA had a distinct advantage in preparing its international capital comparison because it obtained access to information from the BIS that was not publicly available to PwC.\nAPRA found that the its strong rules relative to capital measures in other countries meant the banks were entitled to add 300 basis points of capital to bring them into line with overseas peers.\nBut that still left them 70 basis points short of core equity capital to qualify for the top quartile ranking.\nThat core equity shortfall is about $8.4 billion, according to APRA.\nOne important aspect to keep in mind is that all the numbers on capital are relative to June 2014.\nBanks have increased their capital since then. Most notably, National Australia Bank has raised $5.5 billion.\nCustody beauty parade There is a juicy custody contract about to hit the market thanks to the NSW government's amalgamation of the bulk of assets managed by NSW TCorp, NSW State Super, and the Safety, Return to Work and Support Division, formerly known as WorkCover. The amalgamation of $65billion in assets under the TCorp banner has been a methodical process that started in late 2012.\nNow that all the relevant staff have shifted to the single funds management model within the offices of NSW TCorp in Governor Phillip Tower the government can start to harvest the efficiency benefits of amalgamation. The three existing custody providers, their clients and assets under management are as follows: JPMorgan (State Super) with $35 billion, BNP Paribas (TCorp) with $15 billion and State Street (Safety, Return to Work) with $15 billion. They will be nervous about the upcoming tender because the market is extremely competitive.\nAll three existing providers are in the top five as measured by total assets under custody for Australian investors, according to the Australian Custodial Services Association.\nThe other two in the top five are the leading player, NAB Asset Servicing, which has $692 billion in assets under custody and Citi, which is ranked fourth with $270 billion of assets under custody.\nBut over the past two years the biggest mover in the industry has been Northern Trust, which won some big tenders including the Future Fund.\nThe custody business is virtually a loss leader given that the margins earned are only 2 or 3 per cent of assets under management. Margins have been squeezed in recent years as the big global banks have used their scale to undercut competitors and use custody as a starting point for offering a range of other services including foreign exchange and equity clearing services.\nDetails of the tender for the TCorp business will be decided over the next six months. The process itself including the tough probity requirements for government contracts will probably take more than six months and involve detailed due diligence.\nOne advantage for the incumbents is that custody relationships are complex and therefore difficult to change. The assets under TCorp's management are one third cash and fixed interest, about half in local and international equities and the balance in alternatives, infrastructure and property.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-07-13T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:05:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
