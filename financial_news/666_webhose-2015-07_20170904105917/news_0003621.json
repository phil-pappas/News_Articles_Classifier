Enrolled House Bill 2960 creates a new Oregon Retirement Savings Board, which may implement a state-run Oregon Retirement Savings Plan that requires certain employers to automatically enroll employees in the plan. All employers subject to these new laws should review their policies to make certain they comply. \n\n\nOn June 25, 2015, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown signed into law Enrolled House Bill 3025. Subject to certain exceptions, the new law bans the practice by some employers of inquiring in an employment application whether the applicant has ever been convicted of a crime. Moreover, even if that question does not appear on an employment application, the new law bars an employer from requiring an applicant to disclose a criminal conviction prior to an initial interview. Finally, if no initial interview is conducted, the applicant cannot be required to disclose a criminal conviction prior to the time the employer makes a conditional offer of employment. \nThe new law takes effect on Jan. 1, 2016. \n” \nAccording to the National Employment Law Project, so-called Ban the Box” initiatives provide applicants a fair chance at getting a job by removing criminal conviction history from job applications and delaying the background check inquiry until later in the hiring process.1 When the new law takes effect, Oregon will join 17 other states with similar laws. \nIn a guidance issued in 2012, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission endorsed Ban the Box” initiatives by stating: Some states require employers to wait until late in the selection process to ask about convictions. The policy rationale is that an employer is more likely to objectively assess the relevance of an applicant''s qualifications and experience. As a best practice, and consistent with applicable laws, the Commission recommends that employers not ask about convictions on job applications and that, if and when they make such inquiries, the inquiries be limited to convictions for which exclusion would be job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.2 \nOregon \nHB 3025 makes it “”3 An employer excludes an applicant from an initial interview if the employer: requires an applicant to disclose on an employment application a criminal conviction \nExcept as prohibited above, Oregon’s conviction history when making a hiring decision.5 \nOregon Law Exclusions \n’“Ban the Box” law does not apply in the following circumstances: if federal, state or local law, including corresponding rules and regulations, requires the consideration of an applicant if an employer is a law enforcement agency m if an employer is seeking a nonemployee volunteer6 \n\n–’s Revised Statutes allow any person claiming to be aggrieved by an alleged unlawful practice to file with BOLI a verified written complaint against the person alleged to have committed the unlawful practice. Thereafter, BOLI may investigate the complaint. If the investigation discloses any substantial evidence supporting the allegations of the complaint, BOLI will issue a finding of substantial evidence. BOLI proceedings are often a precursor to future civil litigation. \nWhat This Means for the Oregon Business World \n“” an employer seeking information from an Oregon job applicant should not order a criminal background check on the applicant prior to conducting the initial job interview. After the initial job interview, the employer may order and review a criminal background check on the Oregon job applicant. \nUnless one of the exclusions apply, after Dec. 31, 2015, if an employer does not conduct interviews of job applicants, and if the employer seeks information from an Oregon job applicant, the employer may not require the applicant, prior to making a conditional offer of employment, to disclose a criminal conviction. If an employer does not conduct job interviews, and if the employer wants to make an offer to an Oregon job applicant, the offer should be conditioned on the Oregon applicant consenting to and passing a criminal background check. \n2015 Oregon Law Creates Retirement Savings Board \nThe Board May Implement a State-Run Oregon Retirement Savings Plan.
