It plunged 19 percent on June 29, the first day of an exchange closure in Greece that will last at least through Monday.\nShutting the Athens Stock Exchange added an element of pure speculation to the the Greek ETF, with investors using it as a vehicle to predict where the nation’s stocks will end up once they resume trading. Judging by the fund’s recovery, money managers are placing a lot of faith in the bailout . It rose 8.1 percent at 1:13 p.m. in New York.\n“Greece had the worst news you could possibly have over the last two weeks,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Milwaukee-based Robert W. Baird & Co., which oversees $110 billion. “Now we have good news coming around some sort of resolution, so it’s natural for the fund to recover in the vacuum of being oversold.”\nFading concern over a Greek equity selloff has also reduced demand for hedges. Short interest in the Global X ETF sits at 1.3 percent of shares outstanding, half of where it was when the stock market went dark.\nTracking U.S.\nSince the shutdown, the Greek ETF has mostly conformed to the direction of the market where it’s listed rather than track Europe’s reaction. It’s moved in tandem with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index every day except one since June 29 while going in the opposite direction as the Stoxx Europe 600 Index four times.\nLawmakers in Athens are preparing to debate whether to support Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s plan to access a bailout of at least 53.5 billion euros ($60 billion). France praised a Greek package of reforms on Friday, while other nations voiced skepticism.\nThe European Commission, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank are studying the packet of spending cuts, pension savings and tax increases that was submitted on Thursday.\nNot everyone is as optimistic as ETF traders about a clean solution to the Greek crisis. The ECB may not raise bailout funds for Greek banks, even if a deal between the country’s government and its creditors is reached this weekend, London-based JPMorgan Chase & Co. economist Greg Fuzesi wrote in a client note on Friday. That may mean more capital controls could become necessary, he said.\nBittles is wary about the future of Greece though he predicts the Global X ETF will see further strength before anything catastrophic happens.\n“Over the short-term, with all the pessimism and oversold conditions, that’s typically a combination for a rally,” Bittles said. “But it remains an unknown in the long term.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T21:12:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
