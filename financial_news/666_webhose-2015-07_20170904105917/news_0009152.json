It is a catalyst for the Egyptian people which will unleash a renewed sense of pride and a more prosperous future,\" said Admiral Mohab Mameesh, Chairman and Managing Director of the Suez Canal Authority. \nHe added: \"The project is more than 80% complete, and climbing as we speak, with more than 210 million tons of sand excavated, so our attention is now turning to the celebration of this achievement with the Egyptian people, as well as sharing news of Egypt's 'gift to the world' far and wide.\" \nThe communications campaign will consist of a comprehensive, integrated marketing campaign designed not only to embrace and involve the Egyptian people but also tell the story of the canal to a global audience. The campaign will highlight the determination of the Egyptian people in building the new, 72-kilometer canal in just 12 months as well as the impact the canal will have on the country, region and the world. \nThe campaign will culminate in a gala event on the banks of the New Suez Canal on 6th August. On this historic day, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi will be joined by world leaders to witness the first time traffic has flowed simultaneously north and south through the Red Sea - Mediterranean crossing. \n\"The New Suez Canal is a symbol of the new Egypt, representing the energy, resourcefulness and determination of the Egyptian people, and is one of the most significant projects to come out of Egypt in modern times. It will enrich our economy and society for decades to come,\" said Admiral Mameesh. \nThe huge engineering project began with a national subscription to raise the necessary funds. In just six days, the Egyptian people raised around US$8.5 billion and work began on 6thAugust 2014. Despite initial estimates indicating the project would take three years, the project is well on course to be completed in less than 12 months. \nThe New Suez Canal is at the heart of a vision to construct a fully developed industrial area along the canal known as the Suez Canal Zone. The zone will see the creation of a huge industrial area catering to a broad range of sectors including manufacturing, logistics, ship repair, and more. With the Suez Canal positioned as a vital component of world trade, the Suez Canal Zone will provide access to 1.6 billion customers worldwide. The project will provide Egypt with investment and employment opportunities for years to come.
