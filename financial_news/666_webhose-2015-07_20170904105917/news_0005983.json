Johannesburg is already urbanising at a rate of approximately 4 percent – with our population having grown from 3.7 million to 4.4 million in almost ten years.” \nTau pointed out that the African continent, having suffered from years of colonisation, has not seen relative peace and stability in some countries. \n“This has led to forced migration of people from rural to urban areas, and from unstable countries to those with relative stability,” he said. \n“In recent months, South Africa witnessed social unrest against migrants which unfortunately portrayed the country in a bad light. The South African government’s response has been to promote social cohesion through ongoing anti-xenophobia campaigns,” Tau added. \n //cajnewsafrica.com/?p=6940   22 2015.
