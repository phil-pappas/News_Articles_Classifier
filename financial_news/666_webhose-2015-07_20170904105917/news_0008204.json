The breach is a mostly a function of the market’s recent stasis: while the S&P 500 is exactly where it was four months ago, the average has climbed from about 2,000 to 2,055 over the period.\nAmerican equities have erased all their gains for 2015 in the most recent selloff, following a period in which shares were pinned in one of the tightest ranges in two decades. Unfolding turmoil in Greece and a plunging Chinese stock market have diverted U.S. traders’ attention from economic data and the Federal Reserve.\n“Breaking the 200-day moving average doesn’t mean the trend is over, but it gets a lot of chatter and does invite selling,” said Michael Antonelli, an institutional equity sales trader and managing director at Robert W. Baird & Co. in Milwaukee. “It’s something people watch for short-term momentum.”\nU.S. stocks pared the worst of today’s losses to sneak back above the 200-day average. The S&P 500 fell 0.5 percent to 2,057.89 at 12:35 p.m. in New York. The low was 2,044.02.\nThe last time the benchmark gauge fell below the 200-day moving average was in October, when U.S. stocks were in the midst of a 9.8 percent decline. That drop -- the closest to a 10 percent correction the U.S. market has seen in three years -- gave way to an 11 percent advance through the end of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T20:16:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
