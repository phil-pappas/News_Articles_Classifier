Next time an NFL team comes to your town or state with its palm extended, asking for a handout for stadium renovations or a new building, just remember that the league is spotting it $226 million a year for doing absolutely nothing.\nBefore we get into this, we’d like send some special thanks to the Green Bay Packers organization. Because the franchise still operates under a community-ownership model long since banned by the National Football League, since it makes it very difficult to move a team to Los Angeles, Toronto, London or any other location the league’s other owners deem viable that decade, the Packers have to release their financial documents to shareholders. Granted, those 361,000 shareholders’ certificates are largely ceremonial, don’t increase in value and can’t be resold, but it allows shareholders a peek into the NFL’s otherwise shadowy finances.\nThis year, the Packers revealed that its share of the television revenue evenly divided among the league’s 32 teams was $226.4 million. Multiplied by 32, that’s a whopping $7.2 billion from television alone . That’s up from $3 billion in 2010.\nNew television deals with 21st Century Fox Inc. FOXA, -1.37% CBS Corp. CBS, -0.70% and NBC (a unit of Comcast Corp. CMCSA, -3.15% ), kicked in last year and will pay the NFL and its teams $28 billion for NFL broadcast rights through 2022 that include playoff games and rotating Super Bowl-hosting duties. ESPN, meanwhile, pays $1.9 billion each year — or more than double what any network pays for a season of Major League Baseball — just to host “Monday Night Football” in that same span.\nLast year, the NFL also got DirecTV DTV, -0.69% to pay $1.5 billion a year over the next eight years for the rights to the NFL Sunday Ticket multi-channel out-of-town games package. Though DirecTV executives initially refused to go above the $1 billion they were paying annually in their previous deal, losing NFL Sunday Ticket would have scuttled AT&T Inc.’s T, -0.99% $48.5 billion takeover of the satellite-TV provider that included a no-penalty “out” clause if “Sunday Ticket” negotiations went south. Meanwhile, the league was also able to pry $275 million more out of CBS for partial rights to “Thursday Night Football” games in 2014. The NFL and CBS renewed the deal at a “ slightly higher ” rate for this season.\nAll of that money rolled in during a season in which the NFL retained its option to black out home-market broadcasts for games that didn’t sell out. The blackout rule, which dates back to an act of Congress in 1961 that created the league’s current antitrust agreement, means that home games couldn’t be shown on TV stations that broadcast within a 75-mile radius of the stadium if non-premium tickets weren’t completely sold out 72 hours before kickoff.\nThe Federal Communications Commission ruled last year that cable and satellite stations are within their rights to substitute an out-of-market feed for blacked-out home games, but teams didn’t black out any games last season and the NFL has suspended the rule for the 2015 season. Meanwhile, owners who insisted that blackouts preserved the majority of their revenue were pantsed by the Packers, who divulged that their $226.4 million in revenue from the league far eclipsed their $149.3 million in local revenue.\nNagging inconsistencies like that may have pushed NFL owners to give up the tax-exempt status under Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Service code heading into this season. That means no more peeks at Commissioner Roger Goodell’s $44 million salary , and no more prying eyes preventing owners from obscuring the sources and true amount of the league’s revenue.\nHowever, the Packers’ financial documents make it very clear that teams receive a $226 million annual paycheck, roughly equal to what Buffalo, N.Y., its surrounding county and New York state paid in tax dollars for renovations to Ralph Wilson Stadium (which is already being eyed for replacement ), simply for existing. Granted, teams like the Packers still have to pay expenses — $336 million in Green Bay’s case. However, the Packers note that most of those costs are tied to stadium renovation and land acquisition. Much of the team’s $29.2 million in profit is also being plowed right back into Lambeau Field, with $55 million being spent on renovating luxury suites alone.\nYour NFL team is not poor. It does not need your city’s help to build a stadium. Its owners just want taxpayer dollars to help preserve its profits and line their pockets. That’s their prerogative as business owners, but just realize that they’re receiving a fairly substantial subsidy from fans who watch their games on television. They don’t need another bailout from taxpayers who may never see a game in their lives.\nJason Notte is a freelance writer based in Portland, Ore.
