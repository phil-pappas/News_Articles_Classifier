But new hurdles were set up after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which prompted a tightening of security at international borders. \nThe train, whose southern terminus is Washington, D.C., also serves Connecticut, western Massachusetts, the Connecticut River valley of Vermont and New Hampshire. It's northbound route turns northwest across Vermont at White River Junction. \nSearles said states along the route subsidize the train, adding that it's hoped Massachusetts and Connecticut will increase their subsidies when the route is reopened to Montreal. \nHe said that adding a metropolis of 4 million people as the final destination should add value to the route. Searles said he could not provide an estimated date when service to Montreal might resume. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T17:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T18:11:22.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
