In the game, players build, explore and play in a virtual world that now includes Northern Ireland. \nThe Minecraft NI map, which is free to download for PC and Mac versions of the game, has been developed using Land & Property Service’s Ordnance Survey NI (OSNI) digital mapping data. \nSpeaking at the launch at the PlayBall summer scheme in Stormont, the Minister said: “The Minecraft game has been hugely successful across the world, not least with our young people in Northern Ireland. This exciting new development will allow people here to play the game across all of Northern Ireland, in places that are familiar to them. Gamers can have a go at building structures including the Giant’s Causeway, the Marble Arch caves, their school or even their own house! \n“It’s important to recognise that this is about more than just playing a game. Minecraft inspires a high level of engagement and creativity in young people and it is an excellent tool for teaching children about a wide range of topics including geography, science, technology, engineering and computer coding.” \nThe new Minecraft NI world contains more than five billion blocks, each representing 12.5 square metres and equates to an area of almost 14,000km2. Once players have downloaded the map into Minecraft, they will be able to freely explore, build and create across the whole of Northern Ireland in a map based on OSNI’s digital maps. \nThe Minister continued: “This new programme showcases a new and innovative way of using OSNI mapping data, which is among the most detailed and comprehensive in the world.” \nOrdnance Survey GB have already created a hugely popular Minecraft map of England, Scotland and Wales from OSGB and provided LPS with the software to assist with the Minecraft NI project. \nThe map will be of particular interest to Northern Ireland post-primary schools using an educational version of the game as part of a new project. CultureTECH the organisation behind the project, is already using the Minecraft NI map to develop new classroom activities. \nThe Minecraft NI map is available to download for PC and Mac versions of the game via nidirect Notes to editors: Land & Property Services (LPS) is responsible for mapping, land registration, valuation & rating in Northern Ireland. LPS have also linked the Minecraft NI map to their popular Spatial NI service to enable players to navigate to some familiar places. Players can use a co-ordinate generator within Spatial NI to search for real world location in Northern Ireland. The co-ordinate generator will then give the corresponding co-ordinates in the Minecraft map, allowing players to ‘teleport’ to any location in Northern Ireland and start building and creating their own features within the map. CultureTECH receives core funding from the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, through NI Screen, to support a range of activity, including staffing costs, marketing and festival overheads including venue hire and programme content. LPS have also created a story map on Spatial NI that shows how various well known local landscapes look in Minecraft.
