It required that the livelihood of farmers and fishermen must be improved. \nVice President Amissah-Arthur also gave the assurance that the government would continue to make investments that advanced the progress of the nation and enhanced the greater good of the people. \nHe cited for example that, the government has made significant investments in roads, healthcare, education, water and agriculture, adding that the Western Region in particular, had benefited from investments in oil and gas infrastructure. \nMr Paul Evans Aidoo, Western Regional Minister, stated that despite the region's wealth in terms of cocoa, timber, rubber, manganese, gold, bauxite and other natural resources, this did not reflect on the infrastructural development and the lives of the people in the region. \nHe said it was only recently that bold decisions had been taken to re-construct and rehabilitate some major roads in the region. \nHe expressed the hope that the programmes and activities to be implemented through the Foundation, would promote alternative livelihood to foster better business support services, and develop education and employment training programmes. \nHe urged the board and management of the Foundation to involve the people, chiefs as well as the Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies in the discharge of their duties, in order to meet the expectations, and allay the fears of the people in their relationship with the oil and gas industry. \nMr Jon Benjamin, British High Commissioner in Ghana, disclosed that the United Kingdom (UK) government through its Department for International Development had committed Â£9.5 million over a five-year period to support, towards the set up of the WRCF. \nHe said the unique initiative brought together key stakeholders for the effective use of corporate social responsibility funds for development, conflict resolution and inclusive growth in the Western Region. \nHe said the Foundation was expected to facilitate a structured dialogue mechanism, which would bring together civil society, industry and regional and local governments, to discuss and influence development priorities to contribute to stable and inclusive development for the six coastal districts. \nGNA Other Stories Follow Us IF YOU WANT TO HAVE WHAT NOBODY WILL HAVE TOMORROW, THEN DO WHAT NOBODY IS DOING TODAY By: ISAAC// ITALY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T19:05:42.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
