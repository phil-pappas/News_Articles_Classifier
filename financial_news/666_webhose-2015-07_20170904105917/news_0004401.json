The service quality audit was done by an agency through independent drive tests in the two cities in June and July. \nIn Mumbai, Idea has a call drop rate of 5.56%, Tata has 5.51%, Vodafone has 4.83%, Aircel has 3.19%, Reliance has 2.29%. Only Airtel meets the benchmark with a call drop rate of 0.97%. \nThe situation is not very different in Delhi with Reliance having a call drop rate of 17.29%, Airtel 8.04%, Aircel 5.18%, Vodafone 4.28% and Idea 2.84%. Tata meets the benchmark with call drop rate of 0.84%. \n“The drive test results revealed that most of operators are not meeting the benchmarks of network related parameters. They failed to achieve the benchmarks due to high block call rate, high drop call rate, low call setup success rate and poor Rx quality,” Trai said. \nHowever, Trai said this result reflects only the network conditions on the route followed by the test vehicles and as determined during the day and time of the drive test. \nDoing some tough-talks on call drops, telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had asked mobile operators to walk the extra mile to reinforce their systems as they have enough spectrum to provide services without interruption. \nThe government has also asked Trai to suggest a disincentive mechanism to tackle the problem. Trai said it is evaluating the need for a consultation paper on ‘Regulatory Framework on Call Drops’ based on available information and facts. \n“Given the adverse impact of call drops on the consumers, the telecom service providers (TSPs) were advised to take initiatives and improve their performance, including exploring suitable compensation for call drops,” Trai said. \nThe regulator said operators have claimed that main reasons for frequent call drops include limited spectrum, delay in allocation of spectrum and changeover of frequencies. The telcos also said sealing of towers also contribute to call drops. During the last six months, around 801 sites in Mumbai and 523 sites in Delhi have been shut-down.
