Kazakhstan and the Iraqi region of Kurdistan have yet to tap markets after completing investor meetings last month, while the number of issuers forced to postpone offerings will only grow, according to Sergey Dergachev at Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH in Frankfurt.\nDebt sales have dried up since Gabon’s $500 million offering a month ago as a rout in Chinese equities and the deadlock over a bailout for Greece takes the country to the brink of exiting the euro. The turmoil has also raised questions about the timing of the Federal Reserve’s first interest-rate increase since 2006, a move that further threatens demand for emerging-market assets.\n“There’s a confluence of risks worrying markets at the moment including the Greek impasse, the Fed and also worries about stock-market volatility in China,” Mark Baker, who helps oversee about $1.5 billion in emerging-market debt at Standard Life Investments Ltd. in London, said by e-mail on Wednesday.“Most issuers would like to wait for markets to stabilize, sentiment to improve and ultimately achieve better issue terms.”\nBrazil will probably push back any international offering to the end of the third quarter as the Greek crisis adds noise and instability to financial markets, said a government official familiar with the strategy, who asked not to be named because talks aren’t public.\n‘Higher Premium’ “Issuing now makes a higher premium necessary as risk aversion is higher,” Michael Ganske, the head of emerging markets at Rogge Global Partners in London, said by e-mail. “In the current environment, to have a higher cash holding in order to have ammunition to pick up paper after a correction makes sense.”\nBrazil’s $4.3 billion of January 2025 bond yield was at 4.67 percent on Wednesday, compared with 4.44 percent at the end of May. The rate on Kazakhstan’s $1.5 billion of October 2024 notes climbed to a three-month high of 4.77 percent yesterday.\nThe central Asian nation completed investor meetings in London on June 29. It planned to raise more than $2 billion, Interfax cited Economy Minister Erbolat Dosaev as saying June 24. Gaukhar Akbasova, a spokeswoman for the Finance Ministry in Astana, declined to comment.\nA delegation from the Kurdistan Regional Government, which oversees the semi-autonomous region of northern Iraq, met investors in London June 24-26. The KRG plans to issue bonds in the international markets under its own name, spokesman Safeen Dizayee said on the KRG website, without elaborating.\nMore Scrutiny The average yield on emerging-market dollar debt climbed 30 basis points in June and was at 5.79 percent on Tuesday, within eight basis points of this year’s peak reached last month, according JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes.\nIssuers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are under more scrutiny because of Greece, according to Dergachev, who helps oversee $13 billion of emerging-market debt as a senior money manager at Union Investment in Frankfurt.\nThe European Union set a Sunday deadline to reach a deal with Greece on a rescue in exchange for austerity measures and economic reforms.\n“Clearly the delay in issuance is related to uncertainty in Greece and with it associated rates volatility,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T05:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T01:08:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
