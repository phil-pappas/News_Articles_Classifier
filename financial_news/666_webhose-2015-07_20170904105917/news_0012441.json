They succeeded in preventing a renewal of the charter from moving through Congress before July 1 and are now fighting to kill off the agency for good.But their triumph could be short-lived, as both critics and supports of Ex-Im expect lawmakers to attach an amendment to a transportation funding bill next in the coming weeks to extend its charter.The business community has backed centrist Republicans and Democrats in advocating for Ex-Im's federally backed financing, arguing it helps sustain jobs for small businesses in the U.S.\nJordan said business backing for Ex-Im shows why it should be scrapped.\"The bank has long been emblematic of Washington working for special interests and not for everyday Americans,\" the Ohio Republican said. \"The end of the Ex-Im Bank illustrates that conservative ideas — opportunity for all and limited government — resonate with people around the country.\" Is there a booby trap in Roberts's...
