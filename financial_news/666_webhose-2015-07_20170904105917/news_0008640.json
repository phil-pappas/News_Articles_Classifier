The Department of Education (ED) gives out information gratis about the Free Application for Federal Student Aid--FAFSA-- at the website, FAFSA.gov. Filing a FAFSA is essential to accessing federal and state aid and aid from many private colleges. \nBut until this month, typing \"FAFSA\" into a search engine would likely send you to FAFSA.com, a vendor that requires you to cough up a credit or debit card number before it dispenses FAFSA advice. \nNow the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is in the process of shutting down Student Financial Aid Services, which owned FAFSA.com , through a proposed settlement resolving charges that the company engaged in unlawful sales and billing practices in connection with its fee-based student financial aid assistance offered through its websites and call centers. The CFPB says that over 100,000 customers were illegally charged.
