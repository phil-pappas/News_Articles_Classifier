(And if you haven't read it, here's the link; in PR, you learn to do your own research!) \nFor me, it’s a wonderful example of how the media landscape has changed. I started out in journalism in the mid-1980s, first, a cup of coffee with the Washington Times and then with a chain of suburban weeklies in Baltimore, so for me, the notion that this would even be considered a news story is laughable. It’s a diner in Maine. The owner yelled at a noisy kid. Yeah, better “stop the presses,” we need a new banner headline for this one…granted, I’m showing my age as I’m doubtful if the Millennials in my PR class would know what I’m talking about. Presses? Is he talking about dry cleaning? What’s a banner headline? But I digress… \nSo what is news, anyway? According to the online Collins English Dictionary (no affiliation to this Collins btw), News is “current events; important or interesting recent happenings information about such events, as in the mass media…interesting or important information not previously known or realized …a person, fashion, etc, widely reported in the mass media.” \nThis, of course, opens the proverbial can of worms. What’s a current event? Me, sitting at my computer right now, typing, that’s an event, something that is happening, and it’s right NOW, it’s current, so does that constitute a “current event”? How does one determine what is “important or interesting”? Important or interesting to whom? What constitutes the mass media? Back in the 80s, that was easy—TV, newspapers/magazines and radio. Today, you’ve got to include the internet, blogs, social media…and that’s still a question mark for some, since the Huffington Post is one thing, some online rants by a guy in basement with 7 followers, that’s another. And how “widely” is “widely reported”? City wide, state wide, nation wide, international, seen by 50 people, 5,000 people, 50,000 people, 5 million?? What's the minimum readership for a legitimate news source? \nIn a way, news is like that famed definition of obscenity as coined by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart in 1964: “I know it when I see it.” News is a 500 point drop on Wall Street. News is a terrorist attack on our soil. News is an appearance by the President. News is company laying off thousands of employees. News is the tsunami that hit Japan. News is the Orioles winning the World Series (a fan can dream). News is gripping, it’s powerful, it impacts large numbers of people, it has economic, political, social, moral, impact. \nSo, does a diner owner yelling at a crying kid fit that description? I’d say no. It’s not news. However, once again harkening back to my days in print, it could be the sort of thing I’d see discussed in the Opinion-Editorial section of a newspaper…where a columnist, talking about an incident in a diner for instance, uses this incident as a paradigm to make an important point, perhaps about changing social mores, about small business owners and the challenges they face, about parenting, about whatever. And therein lies the key matter. \nNews was once about FACTS, not about OPINION. I recall nearly 20 years ago, when I was wrapping up my stint as PIO for the City of Thornton, Colorado, attending a media relations panel which featured several local TV anchors, including an “elder statesman” of Denver news television—for we in Baltimore, Denver’s version of Jerry Turner—who noted that he was glad he was getting out of the business because too much emphasis was being placed on OPINION, and less about FACTS, less about REAL NEWS. He saw the writing on the wall two decades ago. Now we tune in and the event seems much less important than the commentary and analysis that follows it. \nI believe it is for this reason that we have become a society where people seem to have no problem telling friends—telling strangers on the street—what they think these friends, these strangers, ought to be doing. Judging them. I read an article online recently about a woman who was flabbergasted that a friend would lecture her about her decision not to breastfeed her child. She wasn’t so much shocked about the pro-breast-feeding spiel, but that someone would think they were entitled to tell her what to do. Similarly, I posted a FACEBOOK rant recently where I commented on this same issue, as a stranger on a street corner felt he was within his rights to tell me I was wrong to cross the street to pick up a newspaper. When TV, video, the internet, social media, etc., are filled with OPINION—was this diner own right to yell at the kid? What do YOU think? NBC ’s TODAY Show did some kind of impromptu online POLL to find out, even though the information they were acting on was only from the diner owner, and not the parents. The parents’ point of view, in other words, was not represented. So “shocking” that the poll indicated that “92 percent” were in favor of the diner owner. What??? This is news? Some took-10-minutes, “half-azz” poll based on half-azz information, asking people to JUDGE who was right, the owner or the parents? Does this contitute scientific, clinica data? It's just trumped up gossip. And THAT's news. \nThis, unfortunately, is also our current reality. This is life in these United States. Social media, the internet, are not going away, and they have and will continue to shape the media landscape, changing what is “news,” making it less about impact and more about opinion and personal point of view, making it about “content” that can be “shared,” that can “go viral.” \nIf you’re going to be in PR, you have to be aware of these things because your client’s success or failure may depend on how said client reacts in a diner in a small town trying to eat lunch. Particularly if somebody has a smartphone videotaping away (or whatever the word is, there’s no tape anymore, and there’s ANOTHER change).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T22:53:00.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
