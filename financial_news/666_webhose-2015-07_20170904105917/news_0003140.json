The feedback system questions passengers on six service parameters including the cleanliness of the station, platform, train, catering quality, air conditioning efficiency, food quality, punctuality of the train and the quality of bedrolls, the Indian Railways said in a statement. However, of the six services, feedback is being sought for only two services immediately, the statement said without specifying which two. The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) has been entrusted with the responsibility of obtaining the feedback through an interactive voice response (IVR) system. Passengers travelling in the trains will be randomly contacted on their mobile phones and asked to award a zero for bad or unsatisfactory service, one point for satisfactory service and two points for good service. On an average, 60 to 70 calls per day per train will be made and efforts were afoot to approximately make 100,000 calls per day to the passengers of mail and express trains, the statement said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T16:48:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
