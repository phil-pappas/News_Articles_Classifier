Photo: Bloomberg\nThe full impact of the oil price collapse on liquefied natural gas revenues is set to be exposed in quarterly reports starting this week, with Woodside Petroleum and Oil Search firmly in the firing line.\nThe three- to six-month delay before moves in oil prices feed through to LNG contract prices protected LNG revenue in the March quarter from the full effects of the late-2014 tumble in crude prices.\nBut the June quarter numbers about to be reported by energy companies will make the hit clear, with UBS forecasting June quarter LNG prices slumping as much as 35 per cent from the March quarter, despite a modest recovery in oil prices.\nUBS analyst Nik Burns said sales for the larger oil and gas companies would probably hit their lowest point in the June quarter, with LNG-focused Woodside probably suffering a 36 per cent slide in revenue from the March quarter, while Oil Search would have a 35 per cent decline.\nAdvertisement Santos, which has a smaller proportion of its production derived from LNG in advance of the start-up of its $US18.5 billion ($24.94 billion) GLNG venture in Queensland, should not be as severely affected, with UBS estimating its sales will actually climb by 3 per cent from the first quarter of the year.\nHowever, Woodside, operator of Australia's biggest LNG producer, the North West Shelf venture, and 90 per cent owner of the producing Pluto project, should also get some benefit from its acquisition of the Balnaves oil field off Western Australia from Apache.\nThe drop in revenue is expected to flow to Woodside's earnings despite costs being cut from the business, pointing to risks ahead for Woodside's dividend, seen by some analysts as a key reason that Woodside's share price has held up relatively well to the oil price weakness.\nFall in dividend yield expected Morgans analyst Adrian Prendergast estimates that the drops in oil and LNG prices in the first half will drive a sharp fall in Woodside's dividend yield, to 3.2 per cent from 7 per cent, given Woodside has said it would not draw down debt to support its dividend and would stick with its 80 per cent payout ratio.\nThe weak June quarter numbers look set to add to bearish sentiment around energy equities, after a fresh drop in global crude prices last week to lows not seen for three months. Brent crude closed on Friday at $US58.73 a barrel, down 2.6 per cent in a week.\nThe International Energy Agency warned on Friday that prices might not have bottomed yet and reportedly described the oil market as \"massively oversupplied\". It said the rate of stockpiling of crude oil quickened rapidly to an \"astonishing\" 3.3 million barrels a day in the June quarter.\nLNG prices in the key north Asian markets, which are linked directly to crude oil prices, have slid to $US8-$US9 per million British thermal units in the summer months, and are set to reach only $US10-$US11 in the winter, assuming crude oil at $US65 a barrel, specialist pricing service Platts said last week. Spot LNG prices in Asia traded as high as $US20 in early 2014.\nPlatts reported that the North West Shelf venture and the Pluto venture had both sold cargoes recently at prices of less than $US7.50 per MMBTU.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/asian-lng-sales-contracts-under-pressure-as-prices-diverge-20150625-ghwsrp"], "published": "2015-07-13T09:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:48:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
