( http://bit.ly/1LA0e9w ) \nThe company did not give a price for the existing shares, but bankers said they are expected to raise the total value of the deal to at least $400 million. \n\"IndiGo are continuing with their growth plans while others have been cutting their operations. They had to come to the market because they need money for their expansion,\" said Harsh Vardhan, Chairman of Delhi-based Starair Consulting. \nIndia's aviation market is growing rapidly, but most airlines have struggled to break-even due to high costs and stiff competition that has forced carriers to offer hefty discounts on fares. \nIndiGo, which operates a fleet of 96 planes, is India's biggest airline by market share and one of a few that have turned a profit for the last year at least, helped by cost cuts and aggressive pricing. \nThe airline specialises in placing large orders for jets and selling them on to lessors before renting them back to reduce capital costs, but it has denied that the sale-and-leaseback model is the main driver of its profits. \nBy comparison, its listed rival, low-cost carrier SpiceJet (SPJT.BO), has not reported an annual profit since 2011. Full-service carrier Jet Airways (JET.NS) has posted annual losses since 2008. \nParent InterGlobe said it would use the IPO proceeds to pay off the lease of existing aircraft, which would allow it to bring in more planes. It said it had a net debt of $388 million. \nCitigroup, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, UBS and Kotak Mahindra are managers for the InterGlobe share sale. \n($1 = 63.6150 rupees) \n(Additional reporting by Devidutta Tripathy and Abhishek Vishnoi in MUMBAI; Editing by Pravin Char and Miral Fahmy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T09:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T10:20:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
