Sanghee Liu That will be a drag on growth in Australia and across the rest of China's Asian supply chain. But it will be better than the alternative. China's old growth model has reached its use-by date.\nYet, for those Australian politicians who watch and fret at the falling terms of trade, none of that will change the production plans of Australia's major iron ore producers. They anticipated the decline in the terms of trade when they made their investments. Their production expansion now is designed to maximise the return on that investment, partly by crowding out higher-cost producers in Australia and overseas.\nWe should let them get on with it.\nIf we want something to worry about, it should be the political opposition to China's reformist President Xi Jinping.\n What's important for Australia now is what's good for China: a successful transition from the investment-for-growth's-sake model that has left its financial system on the edge of crisis.\nXi's rapidly expanding circle of critics will see the current sharemarket crisis as evidence of the danger of his determination to allow the market to play a \"decisive\" role in the economy.\nObviously there are dangers. A major slump by the Chinese sharemarket would send destructive shock waves through the balance sheets of households, corporations, banks and shadow banks.\nIt would be the kind of event that has pushed lesser emerging market economies into prolonged cycles of slow growth.\nThat prospect accelerated the decline in iron ore prices as markets priced in the risk of weaker demand in China and expanded supply in Australia.\nDecade of inaction Yet, for all of the undoubted risks of unleashing financial markets on a half-reformed transitional economy, it's not really fair to blame this crisis on reform.\nIt could be more correctly blamed on the decade of inaction under Xi's predecessor, Hu Jintao, and on Xi's less than honest attempt to make up the gap with minimum political pain.\nWhat China needs now is more, not less, reform.\nHu's failure to get on with structural reform meant China was heading towards a structural slowdown at the time of the global financial crisis.\nIn the wake of the global crisis China found itself relying heavily on the expansion of credit to keep growth up.\nLast year the International Monetary Fund warned the newly installed Xi administration its growth model was unsustainable and that the economy was beset with \"rising vulnerabilities\".\nIt urged the government to unwind the post-crisis accommodative policies and accelerate reform to \"unleash new, sustainable engines of growth\".\nXi agreed on the need for reform, but was reluctant to accept the price of slower growth.\nThe sharemarket crisis is the result of the government trying to minimise the cost of reform. Economists say the Chinese authorities encouraged the sharemarket boom so that state-owned enterprises could sell equity at inflated prices and pay down their debts.\nThe government's strategy was to palm the financial problems of the state-owned enterprises onto investors, including its own citizens, at inflated prices to minimise the cost to its budget.\nIt's an old trick. China has a history of using the financial system – in particular bank interest rates – to surreptitiously tax its citizens.\nDeposit rates need reform A reform China obviously needs now is the deregulation of bank deposit rates.\nIt is the capped deposit rates that have driven households to put their savings into shadow banks, real estate and equities.\nFully deregulating deposit rates would boost household incomes and reduce the pressure on ordinary Chinese to risk their savings by joining one charging financial herd after another.\nEven more importantly, it would force the banks to lend to the most productive enterprises, which would exclude a good many of the highly indebted state owned enterprises and help the growth of China's new, privately owned service industries.\nOne way or another, it would accelerate the rationalisation and reform of the state-owned sector, with unsustainable businesses closing or, more likely, continuing with government subsidies.\nInstead of being burdens on the banks, the state-owned enterprises would become burdens on the budget, which would concentrate the minds of Chinese politicians wonderfully.\nIt also would impose a new discipline on the Chinese exchange rate because the combination of higher deposit rates and an undervalued renminbi would attract speculative capital inflows.\nAlas, there's no escape from the financial markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:06:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
