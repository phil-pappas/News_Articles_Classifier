Peter Braig by Perry Williams Tess Ingram After months of bickering, Fortescue Metals Group chairman Andrew Forrest and Rio Tinto iron ore boss Andrew Harding have agreed on one thing: volatility in China's stockmarket is nothing to worry about.\nThe two Perth-based executives have been at loggerheads for several months after Mr Forrest campaigned feverishly for a parliamentary inquiry into Rio and BHP's iron ore strategies claiming the two mining majors have forced iron ore prices down by flooding the market with cheap supplies.\nRio and BHP stared down that challenge although Mr Forrest remains concerned there is insufficient transparency in Australia's iron ore market.\nBut on Tuesday, the two miners turned their minds to the wild gyrations in China stockmarkets. In Monday's sell-off the Shanghai Composite Index nosedived by 8.5 per cent in its biggest loss since 2007. It looked to be heading for a similarly gloomy day of trading on Tuesday, with losses of over 5 per cent at one stage before recovering ground in the afternoon.\nMr Forrest in Sydney shrugged off short-term volatility in Australia's biggest trading partner. And several hours later in Perth, Mr Harding did much the same.\n\"I've heard about it and no I'm not particularly concerned,\" said Mr Forrest. \"That is a very volatile market â€“ but its been volatile up and down.\"\nMr Harding said the short-term market fluctuations were of little concern to the iron ore business which focused on \"long term fundamentals\", such as population and personal wealth growth in China.\n\"There are a lot of people making commentary about how the market is moving, particularly the Shanghai market,\" Mr Harding said. \"People have talked about it being a bubble and it has retracted really quickly. The reality is for the iron ore business it is more a part of the physical economy and what we look at is the long-term drivers to performance.\"\n The price of iron ore was trading at $US52 a tonne on Tuesday, nearly half the price the steel-making material fetched just a year ago.\nHuge exposure Mr Harding acknowledged Chinese market volatility could have a fleeting impact on iron ore prices but \"it is really only short term\".\n\"If you look at the price today it is actually a little bit above the long run price so it is almost impossible to predict with any accuracy where the price is about to go,\" he said.\nMr Forrest, who controls a 33 per cent stake in Fortescue, has huge exposure to China's economy as Australia's third largest exporter of iron ore along with his growing beef and agricultural interests.\nHe said a series of meetings with senior China executives suggested economic growth could be stronger but remains at historically high levels.\n\"I've just had the opportunity to spend time with some very senior Chinese industrialists and they are telling me that the underlying economy could be stronger but it is strong. And that some sectors are as strong as they have ever been.\"\nMr Forrest spoke in Sydney as chair of the ASA100 group of companies which aims to foster agricultural and food safety partnerships between Australia and China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:06:27.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
