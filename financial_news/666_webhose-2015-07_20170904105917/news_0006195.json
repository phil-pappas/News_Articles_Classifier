The New Zealand dollar plunged to a six-year low after whole milk powder prices slumped at an auction. The Aussie remained lower with its Canadian peer after the Bank of Canada cut rates.\n“The Fed is still on the way to hiking this year,” said Tomohisa Fujiki, the head of interest-rate strategy for Japan at BNP Paribas SA in Tokyo. “The dollar should strengthen.”\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against 10 of its major peers, was at 1,202.17 as of 9:17 a.m. in Tokyo, after closing at 1,200.76 on Wednesday, the highest since April 13.

She said Fed officials expect growth to strengthen this year and the unemployment rate to decline gradually.\nGreek Bailout Greek lawmakers passed a bailout agreement that keeps the country in the euro in a midnight vote in Athens. The result puts the onus on the European Central Bank and other euro-region governments to put in place more emergency funds that will help Greek banks gradually re-open and repair the country’s battered coffers.\nYellen had said in June there could be spillover to the U.S. if there were no agreement between Greece and its creditors.\nFed funds futures show a 67 percent chance the central bank will increase its benchmark rate by year-end from virtually zero, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank last raised the rate in 2006.\nThe New Zealand dollar plunged after whole milk powder prices plunged 13.1 percent in the GlobalDairyTrade auction overnight, spurring speculation that the central bank has added reason to cut interest rates again.\nKiwi Slides Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler has said that weaker prospects for dairy prices will curb farm incomes and delay inflation returning to his 2 percent target.\nThe kiwi declined 0.5 percent 65.60 U.S. cents after falling as low as to 65.58, the weakest since July 2009.\nThe greenback surged to a six-year high against the Canadian dollar Wednesday after the Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate for a second time this year, and spurred speculation it could augur further stimulus in other commodity-producing nations.\nThe loonie traded at C$1.2920 per U.S. dollar after sliding 1.4 percent to C$1.2913 Wednesday.
