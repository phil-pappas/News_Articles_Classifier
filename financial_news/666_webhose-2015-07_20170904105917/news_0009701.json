While economists surveyed by Bloomberg see no chance that they’ll increase borrowing costs this week, they put the odds of a September move at about 50 percent.\nHigher borrowing costs curb the appeal of gold, which doesn’t pay interest or give returns like other assets including equities. Investors are holding the least bullion through exchange-traded products since 2009 and sold metal through the funds in the past eight days, the longest run since March.\n“Worries over China are one of the factors playing into the Fed’s decision making, and as such is important for gold,” Jonathan Butler, a precious-metals strategist at Mitsubishi Corp. in London, said by phone. “The market has priced in a rate rise in September, so anything that delays that could be supportive for gold.”\nGold for immediate delivery lost 0.2 percent to $1,092.17 an ounce by 11:39 a.m. in London, according to Bloomberg generic pricing. It reached as low as $1,077.40 on Friday. Futures for December delivery fell 0.5 percent to $1,091.60 on the Comex in New York, where volume was 53 percent above the 100-day average for the time of day.\nA gauge of Chinese stocks plunged the most in eight years on Monday and extended losses on Tuesday amid concern that government efforts to prop up shares are unsustainable.\nInvestors sold 10.2 metric tons from gold-backed funds as of Monday and the eight-day decline was the steepest in two years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They now hold 1,541.2 tons, down more than 40 percent from a peak in 2012.\nSilver for immediate delivery rose 0.4 percent to $14.6181 an ounce. Platinum lost 0.3 percent to $980 an ounce. Palladium gained 0.9 percent to $618.75 an ounce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T09:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T16:49:27.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
