None of the Hollywood huff and puff that goes on when Barnaby Joyce threatens to put down dogs or anything.\nChina's 15th-richest man (give or take a few sharemarket gyrations) has no problems with Australia's less-than-welcoming regulations.\nRemember Xu Jiayin? He's the billionaire best known in Australia for being forced to sell Point Piper's $39 million Villa Del Mare (the one recruitment queen Julia Ross owned before that) earlier this year after flouting FIRB government approvals. In China, he's known for controlling the Evergrande Real Estate Group, and his close links to just about anyone that counts. And apparently he throws sensational New Year's Eve parties, assuming he's got the harbour front mansion to host them in.\nAnyway, his private Airbus A319 (that will set you back at least $70 million, and that's before fit-out costs) touched down at Sydney Airport on Monday.\nWonder where he's staying? Or whether he plans to catch up with Joe Hockey? After all, it's thought the sale which was whizzed through in the required 90 days (just shows what those real estate agents can do when they set their minds to it) covered stamp duty and the purchase price. No harm done.\n​\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:12:06.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
