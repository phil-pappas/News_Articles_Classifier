If we want to take that risk away, then we have to have a different euro - a stronger euro,\" Padoan was quoted as saying. \nIn Berlin, a finance ministry spokeswoman said that the discussion on such subjects had \"just started\" and would continue over the \"long term\". \nShe said no concrete proposals were expected in the coming weeks. \nIn its latest edition the weekly Der Spiegel reported that plans were firming up in Berlin and Brussels to give the eurozone a finance minister and a proper budget of its own financed with a dedicated tax. \nFrench President Francois Hollande also recently called for the eurozone getting a budget of its own, with a small number of member states moving forward with greater integration. \nThe proposal did not elicit any response from Germany at the time, but Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has long been an advocate of deeper eurozone integration. \nBut German officials have also made known deeper integration will entail changing European treaties, a labourious process with no guarantee of success. \n\"At a certain point the discussion will lead to a result\", but it is impossible to speculate on that at the moment, a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T16:11:52.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
