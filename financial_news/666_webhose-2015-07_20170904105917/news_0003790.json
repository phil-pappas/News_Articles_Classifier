Indeed, email trails cited shows that the management-sponsored grouping only begun in the wake of union agitations. \n\"Management has therefore been using its administrative powers to push the agenda of the splinter grouping,\" said a source close to the unions. \nThe PMSU and the LU are however threatening a 'final showdown' with the management if their accounts are not credited with the right amounts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T02:59:31.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
