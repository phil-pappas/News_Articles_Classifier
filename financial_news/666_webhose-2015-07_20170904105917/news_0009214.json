It was backed by 251 out of 300 deputies. \nIt includes plans for a pensions overhaul, tax hikes and privatisations. \nThe terms are similar to those previously offered by creditors which had been angrily dismissed by Tsipras as humiliating for Greece and then rejected by voters in a snap referendum. \nThe package is coupled to a request for a three-year funding plan and a separate 35-billion-euro ($39.04-billion) investment package. \nThe leftist premier told parliament: \"We have a national duty to keep our people alive... we will succeed not only in staying in Europe but in living as equal peers with dignity and pride.\" \nHe admitted \"the loan deal ...entails many proposals that are far from our pledges,\" but said it was the best deal available. \nIt was \"marginally better\" than proposals put forward by the creditors last month which did not offer relief from Greece's 320-billion-euro mountain of debt, said Tsipras. \nThe Greek government hoped the vote would give it an emphatic mandate to continue the talks with the creditors. \nBut it also revealed the depth of opposition to fresh austerity. \nThree senior government figures were among 10 deputies who abstained or voted against and several others from the ruling Syriza party stayed away, prompting commentators to wager the result could force a government shake-up. \nAn EU source in Brussels said Athens' latest proposals were \"positive\" enough to form the basis of a new support package. \nBut Athens's biggest creditor, Berlin, which has opposed parallel appeals for debt relief, has remained tight-lipped. \nPresident Dalia Grybauskaite of Lithuania, which joined the euro only six months ago, on Friday put the chances of a deal by Sunday's summit at 50-50, saying Athens' proposals are based on \"outdated information\" and \"will have to be seriously corrected.\" \nEU sources who asked not to be named also put the probability at no more 50-50. \nDespite the odds, French President Francois Hollande called the Greek proposals \"serious and credible\" while cautioning that \"nothing is decided yet\". \nItalian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi declared himself \"more optimistic\" that a deal would be done. \nThe EU's bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, was ready to consider putting up 58 billion euros, plus 16 billion euros from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an EU source said. \n- 'Completely open' - \nBut Germany said the outcome of this weekend's crisis talks was \"completely open\". \nBerlin leads a bloc of hardline eurozone nations saying that, after two bailouts over the past five years totalling 240 billion euros, and 107 billion euros in debt forgiveness in 2012, Greece is looking like a bottomless money pit. \nAlthough Greek voters last Sunday roundly voted \"No\" to accepting tough austerity terms for a bailout that expired June 30, they are alarmed at capital controls that have closed banks and rationed cash at ATMs. \nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said the summit he will host in Brussels Sunday is a \"last chance\" for Greece and the EU to seal a deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T12:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T13:19:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
