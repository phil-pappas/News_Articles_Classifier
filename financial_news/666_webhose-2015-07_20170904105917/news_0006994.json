It is already BHF Kleinwort Benson’s largest shareholder. \nThe amount is a 9.5pc premium to the bank’s share price on Friday. \nMr Guo hopes the deal, which includes Kleinwort Benson Bank (UK) and Kleinwort Benson Investors (Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) ), will link rich Chinese with financial hubs in the West. \n“The number of wealthy individuals in China is constantly growing on the back of sustainable 6pc to 7pc GDP growth,” he said. \n“We believe London as a global financial centre and Frankfurt as financial centre for continental Europe and clearing centre for the Renminbi to be natural choices for Chinese people to invest in Europe.” \nFosun also plans to set up a China office for BHF Kleinwort Benson. \n“We are convinced that BHF Kleinwort Benson, with its current business portfolio and strong brand reputation, investment track record and client reach, can leverage this growth momentum to create a modern European based private banking group capable of connecting capital, investment and transaction flows between Europe and China,\" Mr Guo added. \n\"We are highly committed to invest in BHF Kleinwort Benson to enable the company to leverage this opportunity to build bridges between Europe and Asia.” \nFosun has been branching out into Europe in recent years. In June it announced a tie-up with UK travel company Thomas Cook (Xetra: A0MR3W - news ) to develop domestic and international tourism in China. \nIt has also bought a stake in Belgian financial services firm RHJ International, and tried to snap up German wealth manager BHF-Bank.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T22:00:17.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
