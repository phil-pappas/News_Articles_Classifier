Under the terms of the agreement, Abraaj sold its 13.6 percent stake. \nOld Mutual plc, an international investment, savings, insurance and banking group, has bought the stake in UAP, a pan-African insurance holding company with subsidiaries in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and South Sudan, as well as an insurance brokerage arm in the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nUAP has been operating in Sub-Saharan Africa since 1977 and its general insurance subsidiaries hold dominant market positions in its main markets. \nIn March 2012, Abraaj invested, through one of its Funds, in UAP alongside Africinvest and Swedfund, using a convertible debt instrument. Simultaneously with a limited public offer conducted in November 2012, Abraaj converted its instrument into equity shares in the company. \nAbraaj said it has worked closely with UAP's board and management team to expand the company's regional footprint. \nOver the course of Abraaj's investment, the company's gross written premium and book value increased at compound annual growth rates (CAGR) of 25.5 percent and 18.8 percent, respectively, Abraaj said. \nUAP also expanded organically into Rwanda and via an acquisition into Tanzania. \nDavinder Sikand, partner, The Abraaj Group, said: \"We invested in UAP based on the Company's strong brand and well established business lines. With a surge in demand driven by the rapid expansion of a young, urban middle class across Sub-Saharan Africa, UAP has developed in key African markets, and is well positioned to lead the insurance sector in the region.\" \nDr Joseph B Wanjui, chairman, UAP-Old Mutual Group, added: \"Abraaj played an important role in developing UAP's business, enhancing corporate governance and positioning the company for further growth. Our partnership created many opportunities for UAP and we take this opportunity to thank Abraaj for their support.\" \nAbraaj said it has helped pioneer the growth and development of the private equity industry in Africa with more than a decade of investing experience and deploying $3 billion across the continent. \nIn East Africa alone, Abraaj said it has over 19 investments, with an active portfolio in Kenya, including leading dairy company Brookside Dairy Limited and cement company Athi River Mining Limited.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T09:23:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
