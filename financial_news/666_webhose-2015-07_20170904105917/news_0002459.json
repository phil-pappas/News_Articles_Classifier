However, it warned that the response of businesses and the impact on the labour market was “subject to significant uncertainty”. \nA new national living wage for over-25s of £7.20 will be introduced from April 2016 and will rise to £9 by 2020. This compares to a minimum wage of £6.50 at present. A retailer employing 50,000 full-time staff at £7 per hour will have to pay an extra £21m a year to get to £7.20. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Britain’s leading retailers fell following the Budget. Marks & Spencer fell 2.5pc, Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos, lost 2pc, Morrisons fell 1.5pc, Sainsbury’s 1.1pc and Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) lost morning gains. These companies employ 725,000 people between them. \nThe British Retail Consortium said the Treasury was “playing pass the parcel around the economy with the financial burden of increasing people’s incomes”, while the CBI said it was a “bad idea” to bring politics into the Low Pay Commission, which sets the minimum wage. \nClive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, said: “For businesses, particularly large employers such as supermarkets and pub companies, the stepped upward adjustment to labour costs may be a major challenge. \n“The imponderable item is how much of the higher pay will be recycled back through the tills of the retailers and what all of this means for pricing strategies.” \nOn top of the national living wage, which is still below the £9.15 that the Living Wage Foundation recommends for London, the Budget documents reveal that business rates are expected to increase from £28bn in this financial year to £32.9bn in 2020/2021. This is due to annual inflation-linked increases and will follow a revaluation of Britain's property due to come in to effect in 2017. \nMr Osborne will unveil a review of rates by next year’s Budget, but he has warned this will be “fiscally neutral”, meaning the amount that businesses pay will not be altered. \nHelen Dickinson, director general of the BRC (Shanghai: 600466.SS - news ) , warned: “Without seeing any more firm proposals on business rates, little in the statement will ease retailers' concerns as they navigate the transformative structural change that is taking place within the industry.” \nLeading retailers gave the living wage proposals a lukewarm reception. \nBritain's supermarkets will have to pay the national living wage \nIn a statement, Asda said: “The Chancellor has announced a number of changes that will impact our industry. We’ll take time to digest these announcements once we’ve seen the detailed plans, keeping the best interests of our colleagues and customers front of mind.” \nSainsbury’s said: “Our basic rate of pay is currently £7.08, which is considerably above the minimum wage. We are currently exploring what our pay review will be for September but it has been in the region of 2pc to 3pc for the past three years. \n“In addition to a rate per hour, we also give colleagues a broad package of benefits which include a pension, life insurance, paid breaks, annual bonus and a discount card. \n“We believe in rewarding our colleagues fairly for the great customer service they provide in our stores and will of course comply with legislation to reach the new national living wage by 2020.” \nA Morrisons spokesman said: “We are looking at the implications of the national living wage, so can't comment any further at the moment.” \nMr Osborne insisted that the cost of higher wages will be offset by lower taxes. Corporation tax will be cut to 18pc by 2020, while the Chancellor announced a 50pc increase to the national insurance employment allowance from £2,000 to £3,000. \nHowever, companies only generating a marginal profit will receive a limited benefit from cuts to corporation tax, and could be forced to curb their hiring ambitions. \nAccording to accountancy firm BDO, the employment allowance will only allow employers who are currently paying minimum wage to offset the cost of the living wage for up to 2,000 hours. After that, the business will be a net loser unless it is profitable enough to benefit from the reduction in the rate of corporation tax. \nThe hospitality industry hit out at Mr Osborne. \nUfi Ibrahim, chief executive of The British Hospitality Association, said: \"We were very surprised the Chancellor made this announcement without consultation. Despite the Chancellor trying to alleviate the pain with adjustments to corporation tax and employment allowances, these changes do not go far enough to reduce the impact on SMEs and mitigate potential job losses across the industry. \n\"On top of all these new pressures, our industry is at a serious disadvantage with other European countries where tourism VAT is on average 10pc. We call upon the Government to lower VAT on accommodation and attractions to 5pc to increase our market’s competitiveness and reduce costs to working families. A cut to tourism VAT could supercharge the economy with over £20bn in foreign exchange earnings and domestic spending over the next 10 years. \n“While we are analysing the potential impact of the Chancellor’s announcement, constructive dialogue with HM Treasury is now imperative to identify measures to counterbalance the Government’s ambitious agenda with the realities of running a high service and very low margin business.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T00:16:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
