Yorgos Karahalis Share on twitter by Karen Maley Who will be forced to pick up the tab if Greece ultimately ends up defaulting on its debt and quitting the eurozone?\nThe question has been given extra urgency after Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis estimated the total cost of a failure to reach a deal with Athens to stop the country leaving the eurozone at €1 trillion ($1.47 trillion).\nIn an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Mundo published on Saturday , Varoufakis lashed out at Greece's creditors – the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union – accusing them of \"terrorism\".\nBut he argued that regardless of the outcome of Greece's referendum, Europe had too much at stake to allow Greece to fail.\n\"If Greece collapses, a thousand billion euros [the equivalent of Spain's GDP] will go up in smoke\", he said. \"That's too much money and I don't think Europe can allow it.\"\nBut while Varoufakis appears to be exaggerating the immediate losses that the country's creditors are likely to suffer if the country defaults on its €320 billion debt, losses could spiral if the Greek default causes a steep increase in borrowing costs for other debt-laden eurozone countries, such as Italy and Spain.\nIn any case, the increasingly fractious relationship with Athens makes it likely that European taxpayers should brace themselves to accept that not all of the €300 billion they've provided in loans and central bank funding to Greece is likely to be repaid.\nEurozone countries put in €52.9 billion towards Greece's first bailout in 2010 and a further €131 billion from the country's second bailout – through the European Financial Stability Facility – in 2012.\n Significant exposure The European Central Bank also has a significant exposure to the embattled country, which could result in hefty losses if the country defaults.\nThe ECB holds almost €20 billion in Greek government bonds, while central banks in other eurozone countries hold a further €7 billion in Greek government bonds that the ECB would probably be obliged to buy in the event of a default.\nIf Greece leaves the eurozone the ECB could also expect to suffer losses of almost €90 billion in emergency funding that it has provided to Greece's cash-strapped banks.\nBeyond the immediate risk of a debt default, European taxpayers could also find themselves forced to contribute to a bailout of Greece's embattled banks.\nThe banks, which have been closed for the past week, are estimated to have less than €1 billion in liquidity, which is not enough to meet depositors' demands for cash.\nUnless Athens is able to reach an agreement quickly over the terms of a new bailout package, the ECB is unlikely to agree to raise the ceiling on emergency funding it provides to the country's banks.\nThere's also a risk that even if Athens is able to reach an agreement with its creditors, nervous savers might continue to make heavy withdrawals from the Greek banks. The severe downturn in the Greek economy has left the banks faced with a sharp increase in problem loans, raising the risk that they may need to be recapitalised.\nShort of funds The Greek government is the most likely source of fresh capital, but Athens is also short of funds and would need to borrow more money, from other eurozone countries and from the IMF, to rescue its banks.\nThe other alternative is for Greek banks to reduce their liabilities by forcing bondholders – and even large depositors – to take a \"haircut\". This was the approach taken in Cyprus in 2013, with depositors losing more than 50 per cent of their deposits of more than €100,000.\nBut write-downs on Greek bank bonds would also cause pains for the global banking fraternity. After slashing their exposure to Greece several years ago, foreign banks have begun to show a more lenient attitude.\nFigures from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) show that German banks, whose exposure to Greece plunged to €3.9 billion at the end of 2012 from more than €30 billion just two years earlier, had total claims of €10.6 billion at the end of 2014.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-07-05T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:06:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
