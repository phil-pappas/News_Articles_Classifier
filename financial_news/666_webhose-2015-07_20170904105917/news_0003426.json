Well, on paper at least.\nHis name is Jeff Bezos, and he's the founder and CEO of Amazon, the e-commerce giant best known locally for selling books and electronics. In the US and elsewhere, its a full-fledged online retail giant that's expanded into everything from smartphones to streaming television, and wants to pioneer home delivery by drones. This morning the company posted a better-than-expected quarterly result, sending its shares up 17 per cent in after-hours trading.\nAt a market value of $US250 billion plus, Amazon is now worth more than storied retailer Wal-Mart - and Bezos owns about 18 per cent of it. Whether the latest gains hold up in regular trading tomorrow (US time) remains to be seen.\nNot a huge amount is known about Bezos, at least compared to other internet entrepreneurs like Elon Musk and the late Steve Jobs. He rarely gives interviews and wouldn't participate in a high profile biography (which his wife slammed as inaccurate ) released last year. We do know he is incredibly ambitious, and like Musk, he's interested in space . Two months ago, his venture launched a rocket in what was seen as another significant step in the burgeoning private-sector space race.\nThe astonishing thing about Amazon is that Bezos has never prioritised profit at the company. The company's surging sales grow at high double-digit rates (they hit $US23.2 billion last quarter) but its profits remain relatively meagre. Bezos prefers to invest in distribution infrastructure and in keeping prices low, with the aim of driving customer loyalty over time. And Wall Street is happy to back him.\nPerhaps the best sign that Bezos doesn't care about short-term profit?\nHe bought a newspaper company with his own money. In 2013 he outlayed $US250 million to acquire the highly influential US masthead, The Washington Post.", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/05/jeff-bezos-amazon-biography-criticism", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/katevinton/2015/07/23/jeff-bezos-just-gained-7-billion-in-an-hour-to-become-worlds-fifth-richest/", "http://www.wired.com/2015/04/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-just-launched-flagship-rocket/", "http://qz.com/462605/amazon-is-now-bigger-than-walmart/"], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:36:32.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
