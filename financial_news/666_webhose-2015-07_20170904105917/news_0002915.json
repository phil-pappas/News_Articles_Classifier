It did not disclose who the buyer was. \nRoman Filkyin, co-director with Prosperity Capital Management which has around $2.2 billion of assets under management, said it had bought the entire EBRD stake, which allowed Prosperity to gain around 10 percent in Enel Russia. \nFilkyin declined to disclose the price of the deal. Based on Enel Russia's market capitalisation the stake is worth around 1.6 billion roubles ($28 million), according to Reuters calculations. \n\"We see the company as undervalued. We are counting on dividends and an increase in value,\" he said. \nEBRD declined to comment.
