Photo: Rob Homer\nAGL Energy has ditched ambitions to be semi-self sufficient in gas production but will continue to pursue a controversial coal seam gas project in NSW after a review of its gas business that has triggered more than $600 million in write-downs.\nChief executive Andy Vesey told investors AGL would not commit significant capital to gas production amid uncertain long-term energy prices, and because it is confident that ample supplies would be available from producers on the east coast.\n\"We are just unwilling to tie up large amounts of capital for extended periods with relatively uncertain outcomes,\" Mr Vesey said.\n\"But we are planning to judiciously invest in a few projects that we can develop in a relatively short-time horizon with more certain returns.\"\nAdvertisement The only new gas venture will be the Gloucester project, which Mr Vesey declared of \"importance\" to AGL to help source competitive supplies for NSW. The producing Camden coal seam gas project south of Sydney will be retained, but several other gas ventures have been designated \"non-core\" or \"underperforming\" and will be sold.\nThe stalled expansion of Camden to the north has been cancelled and the licence will be handed back to the NSW government, as will licences covering the Hunter project, which has also been abandoned.\nThe hefty writedowns, amounting to $435 million after tax, are mainly for the Moranbah coal seam gas project in Queensland and to Gloucester. On JP Morgan's calculations, write-downs by AGL in upstream gas now total some $1.2 billion since 2013, representing $1.80 a share of lost value.\nChief financial officer Brett Redman said the $321 million pre-tax write-down at Moranbah was mostly due to lower-than-expected production, which was not covering the requirements of a sales contract.\nThe $275 million impairment of Gloucester was driven by a reassessment of gas volumes, the impact of development delays and expectations that prices for the gas, while higher than present levels, won't be as high as originally anticipated. Prices are now put at $7 to $10 a gigajoule, about $1 to $1.50 a gigajoule less than earlier assumptions, Mr Redman said.\nAfter the latest impairments, the Gloucester project is valued at just $131 million on AGL's books, while Moranbah has been slashed to $40 million.\nJPMorgan analyst Christopher Laybutt said he had been expecting some write-downs on gas but not so large, and said the Moranbah impairment was a surprise.\nAGL has had its stake in the Moranbah venture up for sale for 18 months but with no success, and Mr Redman signalled a deal might still be some way off. It has now also put on the block its stakes in the Spring Gully venture in Queensland and in the Cooper oil project, but will retain gas storage plants in Queensland and NSW and the Wallumbilla LPG plant, which are seen as strategically important.\nAGL, one of the country's two biggest energy retailers, had previously set a target of sourcing 50 per cent of the gas required by its customers out of its own production.\nBut Mr Vesey put the whole upstream gas business under review within a week of becoming CEO in February, and oversaw a deal to buy a chunk of gas from the Esso/BHP Gippsland venture.\nThat 50 per cent target has now been formally dropped, with Mr Redman saying AGL's own production would account for only 20 per cent of its needs assuming Gloucester proceeds, and flagging little interest in other new projects.\n\"At this point we are not planning to invest in a project beyond the ones that we've talked about today,\" he said.\nAGL said it had a \"strong\" gas supply position through a mix of purchase contracts and its Camden output, covering expected demand from household customers until 2027 and commercial contracts until 2021.\nWhile AGL shares slid 1.8 per cent to $15.54, the market was down more than 1 per cent, and analysts welcomed the new strategy.\n\"We favour this approach and believe AGL should continue to allocate capital in areas where it has the greatest competitive advantage â€“ namely across its utility businesses,\" Deutsche Bank's John Hirjee said.\nAGL's commitment to the Gloucester project, which it expects to sanction in 2016, triggered new calls by coal seam gas opponents for it to drop the venture altogether.\nThe impairments will bring total write-downs for AGL in 2014-15 to $808 million pre-tax, including others already advised.\nAGL still expects 2014-15 underlying profit in the top half of its $575 million-$635 million guidance, helped by the recent cold snap.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T01:06:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
