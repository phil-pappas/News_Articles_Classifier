In addition calm weather conditions during the past few days led to an oversupply of fish in the markets.\" \nHe said this decline may continue until the last days of Ramadan and then prices will begin to increase again. \nHussein Al-Sheikh another fish seller said: \"Fish prices are likely to be volatile in the coming days due to an oversupply of fish and the long period of display in the market after fishing but these prices will become stable and rise again during Eid due to high demand. Summer often witnesses an increase in the prices of some types of fish.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T06:08:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
