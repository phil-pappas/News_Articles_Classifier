IMF rules prohibit lending to a country unless public debt is considered to be on a sustainable path. Greece has missed a payment to the IMF, and would also have to clear those arrears. \nBut the IMF official said that if European countries provided debt relief, Greece could recover. \n\"We have made it clear ... we need a concrete and ambitious solution to the debt problem,\" the official said. \"I don't think this is a gimmick or kicking the can down the road ... If you were to give them 30 years grace you are allowing them in the meantime to bring down debt by ... getting some growth back.\" \n(Reporting by Howard Schneider)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T02:55:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
