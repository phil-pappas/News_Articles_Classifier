Wise Bread Picks 0% Balance Transfer Credit Cards \nIf you have a business, it’s worth considering a small business credit card. In some cases, the rewards and benefits mirror their consumer cards with little to no difference. In others though, the rewards offered by the small business card can be significant. And regardless of the rewards offered, small business cards can be used in other ways that will benefit you and your business. Here are five of the benefits that small business cards can offer over using a personal card. (See also: Best Small Business Credit Cards ) Enjoy Bonuses for Business Expenses \nJust like the market for personal cards, there's a highly competitive market for small business credit cards. And one of the ways that banks compete for their business is by offering the most aggressive rewards for spending. With business cards, the rewards are more likely to be focused on common business expenses. In contrast, similar personal credit cards are more likely to offer bonuses for groceries and entertainment charges. Furthermore, the rewards earned from employee spending as authorized cardholders is retained by the primary account holder, increasing the opportunity for business owners to earn valuable points, miles, and cash back. \nThe Chase Ink Cash® Business Card , named “Best for Rewards for Small Business” by MONEY Magazine, offers 5% cash back for purchases at office supply stores and telecommunication services such as mobile phone, Internet, and cable or satellite television (on the first $25,000 spent in combined purchases each year) and 2% cash back at gas stations and restaurants (also on the first $25,000 spent in combined purchases each year). Earn 1% cash back on all other purchases with no limits. New cardholders can earn $200 after spending $3,000 on purchases in the first 3 months. There is no annual fee. Click here to learn more and apply to the Ink Cash® Business Credit Card. \nThe Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN offers as much as 3x Membership Rewards points for purchases in one of 5 categories (airfare, advertising, gas, shipping, or computer expenses), according to the cardholder's choice, and 2x on the 4 remaining categories. Also get 1x on other purchases. New cardholders can get 25,000 points after spending $5,000 in purchases within the first 3 months. The annual fee is $0 for the first year, then $175 after. Terms and limitations apply. Click here to learn more and apply to the Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN. Separate Personal and Business Expenses \nThe primary benefit of a business credit card, and the reason they exist in the first place, is to separate personal and business expenses for the sake of record keeping and filing taxes. Can you use a personal credit card to do this? Yes, but the balance will appear on your personal credit report. In contrast, a business credit card's balance will not affect your credit score, unless you miss payments. As a primary account holder, you're still personally liable to pay back all charges on your business credit card. \nThe Chase Ink Plus® Business Credit Card offers 5x points per dollar spent at office supply stores and on cellular phone, landline, internet and cable TV services (on the first 50,000 spent in combined purchases each year), 2x points per dollar spent at gas stations and hotel accommodations when purchased directly with the hotel (also on the first $50,000 spent in combined purchases each year). Earn 1 point per dollar on all other purchases. What's extra great about this card, though, is it offers 1:1 points to miles transfer with Chase’s travel partners. Additionally, if you have a Chase Freedom card, you can transfer those points to this card to be used for travel redemption through Chase Ultimate Rewards at a 20% discount or to transfer to miles. There are no foreign transaction fees and the annual fee is $95, waived for the first year. Click here to learn more and apply for the Ink Plus® Business Credit Card. Use Expanded Reporting Tools \nBusiness users are likely to need additional information from their credit cards for accounting purposes, which is a feature provided by many small business credit cards. For example, the Spark line of business cards from Capital One features quarterly and year-end summaries that include custom, itemized reports of your spending. In addition, these cards offer downloadable purchase records compatible with common accounting tools such as Quicken, QuickBooks, and Excel. Furthermore, the Ink line of business cards from Chase offers the JOT mobile app that allows cardholders to save images of the receipts and tag them with customizable categories. \nThe Capital One® Spark® Miles Select Business Card earns 1.5 miles per dollar spent on every purchase. Miles don’t expire and there are no categories to limit rewards. Miles can easily be redeemed as statement credit for most travel purchases. New cardholders can receive a one-time bonus of 20,000 miles after spending $3,000 within the first 3 months. There are also no foreign transaction fees and no annual fee. Click here to learn more and apply for the Capital One® Spark® Miles Select for Business card. \nCapital One also offers the Spark® Cash for Business card which offers 2% cash back on every purchase. Considering there are no limits to the amount you can earn and no categories that limit your rewards, this is a very high cash back percentage. No other credit card offers 2% cash back, except for Citi’s Double Cash card , which you don’t get the second 1% until you’ve made a payment. Get a one-time $500 cash bonus after spending $4,500 within the first 3 months. There are no foreign transaction fees and the $59 annual fee is waived for the first year. Click here to learn more and apply for the Capital One® Spark® Cash for Business card. Have More Control Over Authorized Users \nIf you need to give employees a card to use, business credit cards can offer better management, reporting, and control over their spending abilities. You can set up alerts on purchases, adjust spending limits, and view usage among different employees. Some consumer cards offer additional cards for authorized users, but it has the same card number and does not distinguish purchases between cardholders. \nThe SimplyCash® Business Card from American Express offers 5% cash back at office supply stores and wireless telephone services, 3% cash back on a category of your choice from their list, and 1% cash back on other purchases. (The 5% and 3% apply to purchases up to $25,000 per year.) New cardholders can get $250 statement credit after spending $5,000 within the first 6 months. There is no annual fee. Terms and limitations apply. Click here to learn more and apply for the SimplyCash® Business Card from American Express. Earn Valuable Sign-Up Bonuses \nOne benefit that some credit card users find attractive is that they can earn increased rewards from sign the up bonuses offered by the business version of a card. When an exceptional offer comes around, it's often extended to both the business and personal versions of a credit card, allowing business owners multiple opportunities to earn this bonus. In fact, someone who owns multiple businesses may be able to apply for separate accounts for each one. \nThe Business Platinum Card® from American Express OPEN offers 40,000 points after spending $5,000 in purchases within the first 3 months. This premium card offers complimentary airport lounge access to over 700 airport lounges around the world. It also includes free internet access with Gogo inflight and Boingo hotspots. The annual fee of $450 seems high, but when you factor in the lounge access, $200 airline fee credit per year, $100 credit for Global Entry or $85 for TSA Precheck, and their exclusive Business Platinum Concierge ready to help you 24/7 with just about anything personal or professional, the value is more than enough to cover the fee.
