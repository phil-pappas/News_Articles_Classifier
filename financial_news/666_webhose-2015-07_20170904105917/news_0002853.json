It has authorized a buyback of some $8 billion. \nBut Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold said he believes that if the right acquisition comes along, United Tech could divert those funds from the buyback allocation. \n\"There's an asterisk on it,\" Arnold said. \nHayes, who became CEO in November, has consistently said he wants to make acquisitions to boost the conglomerate's prospects. Without Sikorsky, United Tech is squarely focused in two areas: jet engines and other commercial aerospace systems and components; and elevators, climate control units and security systems for commercial buildings. \nHayes has said he prefers large deals but that his ambitions have been undercut by high prices of potential targets. \nEven if United Tech uses the Sikorsky proceeds on buybacks, \"they still have balance sheet flexibility to pursue acquisitions,\" said Sterne Agee CRT analyst Peter Arment. \nPotential targets include electrical and lighting systems company Hubbell Inc (NYSE: HUB-A - news ) , Dublin-based security firm Allegion (Stuttgart: 60A.SG - news ) and British aircraft parts supplier Meggitt , Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS - news ) analysts said in a research note on Monday. \nSome analysts said United Tech was more likely to use its cash held overseas for a foreign takeover, leaving the the Sikorsky proceeds for buybacks. \nUnited Tech had $5.28 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet as of March 31, according to its most recent such disclosure. More than 97 percent of its cash was held by foreign subsidiaries as of that date, the filing said. \n\"If you think about markets starting to get better, Europe is one of those and that's where an awful lot of that cash is,\" said Scott Lawson, vice president of investment management firm Westwood Holdings Group.
