As a nation, we have failed to meet the Millennium Development Goal sanitation target and we require the collective effort of all coupled with behavioural change across the board to improve and change the status quo.' \nJustice Samuel Agyei, Deputy Brong-Ahafo Regional Minister, expressed appreciation to GGBL and the Diageo Foundation for supporting the Akomade community and entreated the community leadership to take ownership of the facility and support the project managers to ensure its long-term sustainability. \n'The provision of water is not enough to ensure we are a Cholera-free or Diarrhoea-free community. We need to do our part by keeping our township clean. Indiscriminate disposal of waste and other related behaviours must stop. We thank corporate bodies such as GGBL for contributing to the government's effort to make portable water accessible to all.' \nAkomade was selected because GGBL sources its raw materials from the area for the production its Ruut Extra Premium Beer through an indigenous firm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T14:15:38.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
