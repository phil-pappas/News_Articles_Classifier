Britain's heatwave: How hot can it get before your boss has to send you home? BRITAIN will sizzle in temperatures well into the mid-30s this week, but the heatwave is set to cause misery for workers due to the lack of hot weather rules. PUBLISHED: 00:11, Wed, Jul 1, 2015 | UPDATED: 09:45, Wed, Jul 1, 2015 PA Wire Temperatures in Britain will reach as high as 35C \nEmployees could be left sweating in baking offices because there is no limit to when it becomes too hot to work and your boss is required to send you home. Firms must act if workplace temperatures dip below 16C for office workers, but there is no equivalent maximum temperature and the rules on the issue are shockingly vague, according to critics. It means that British workers could be forced to graft in unbearable temperatures that could put their health at risk, said Peter Ames, head of operations at website Office Genie. He commented: \"We’re on the brink of a heatwave and the legal obligations for workplace temperatures are opaque. It makes very little sense to me.“This could well be putting the health of millions workers at risk. “Other factors also play their part; for example some workplaces do not allow employees to open windows, ironically often due to health and safety regulations - if there’s no air conditioning then you’re going to face a hugely uncomfortable working environment when the temperatures rise.\"The Trade Union Congress (TUC) has long been campaigning for a guideline maximum temperature to be put in place. It wants a change in safety regulations to introduce a new maximum temperature of 30C – or 27C for those doing strenuous work – with employers obliged to adopt cooling measures when the temperature hits 24C.
