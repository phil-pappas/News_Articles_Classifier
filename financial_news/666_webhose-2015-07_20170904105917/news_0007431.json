Photo: Peter Rae\nScandal-ridden financial services giant IOOF has closed its My Adviser and Plan B financial planning arms after \"moving on\" more than half of its advisers for claiming they were out of step with the company's culture.\nIOOF, which bought both businesses in September 2012 for $46.6 million, could now have to write off more than $20 million in goodwill.\nIOOF reports its financial results in August. In its latest annual report IOOF valued the goodwill tied to its 2012 acquisition of Plan B, which in turn owned My Adviser brand, at $22.5 million.\nIOOF is believed to have reported 13 adviser-related breaches to ASIC in the past two years. Photo: Jessica Shapiro\nThe confirmation of the dismantling of Plan B's brands and the departure of at least 33 planners comes only weeks after Fairfax Media revealed 57 clients of IOOF's brands – which include My Adviser, Plan B and several other entities including Consultum, Lonsdale and Bridges Financial – had been compensated $2.8 million for poor advice in the past two years alone.\nIOOF is also believed to have reported 13 adviser-related breaches to ASIC in the past two years, with the company contacting 89 customers of those advisers to see if they had any concerns about their advice.\n\"IOOF believes it has appropriately compensated all clients affected by compliance breaches,\" a spokesman for the company said.\n\"Of the 57 complaints which IOOF has previously discussed with Fairfax, eight relate to ex My Adviser advisers and $553,500 has been paid in compensation in relation to those advisers' complaints,\" the spokesman added.\nIOOF's problems in its financial planning arms follows explosive revelations of misconduct by senior IOOF staff , including allegations of insider trading, claims of front-running, misrepresentation of performance figures, faulty research reports and junior staff asked to cheat on training and compliance modules on behalf of their boss. IOOF's head of advice research, Peter Hilton, is at the centre of allegations that he asked junior staff to cheat on compliance and training modules on his behalf. Mr Hilton was also subject to an internal investigation into possible front running on behalf of a relative and plagiarising research reports.\nThe company would not confirm whether it had contacted clients of those My Adviser planners who have been \"moved on\" or whether a compensation scheme has been set up to remediate any clients who may be concerned over the quality of their financial advice.\nTwelve advisers operating under IOOF's Plan B brand have been transferred to the group's Shadforth licence. Both Plan B and Shadforth's target client base include high-net-worth self-funded retirees.\nFifteen financial planners working at My Adviser will move to IOOF's Consultum financial advice business. Consultum came into the sights of the corporate regulator ASIC in relation to deficient advice on complex structured investment products. One former My Adviser planner now working under the Consultum brand is subject to legal action by one of his clients.\nDespite the decision to close Plan B, a spokesman for IOOF said \"Plan B has been successful acquisition for IOOF, and appropriate due diligence was conducted\".\n\"At the time of the acquisition, Plan B had itself recently acquired My Adviser, an independent financial adviser network operating out of the east coast. The My Adviser business was not financially material to the Plan B acquisition.\"\nInternal documents seen by Fairfax Media show IOOF had been handling an average of six complaints a year from clients of My Adviser planners.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T00:20:31.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
