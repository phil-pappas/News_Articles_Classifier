Airbus has so far spent €20m (£14m) developing the E-Fan. Although it is just a demonstrator aircraft, it has completed more than 100 flights and hints at the direction in which aviation could be going. \n• Video - the E-Fan explained in 60 seconds \nRecreating French aviation pioneer Louis Bleriot’s first cross-channel flight in a machine that was heavier than air back in 1909 although being a European company, Airbus did Friday's crossing in the opposite direction makes a very public statement about what is possible in with new technology. \n“This is a starting point to show electric technology is going to become a reality in aeroplanes,” says Jean Botti, Airbus’s chief technology officer and the man behind the E-Fan. “This flight is a public symbol but we have to be honest, it is just the start of a very long curve.” \nBattery technology will have to advance to make the E-Fan practical for anything more than short flights \nIt is likely to be several decades before paying passengers are buckling up their seatbelts for a trip on such an “E-Airliner”. However, he hopes to start on a prototype in the next 10 years, though he expects a production version of the E-Fan will come to market around 2018 with a four-seater version a few years later. \n“We start with a small plane like the E-Fan, as we have to learn and build up the know-how from the first concept to full understanding of how to build, operate, industrialise and maintain such an aircraft,” says Botti. \nWhile it might be decades off, Airbus is investing large sums of money in the technology and is setting up a laboratory where engineers can learn how to integrate all the new systems that would be required. \nThere are several factors driving the costly development of new forms of propulsion for aircraft. “The oil is not going to last for ever,” says Botti. “It’s not an immediate problem but we need to start work on it now.” \nOther drivers include tough environmental controls. The EU’s Flightpath 2050 is targeting reductions of 75pc in CO2 and 90pc in nitrogen oxide pumped out by aircraft compared with levels seen in 2000. \nNew (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) controls on aviation means airliners will have to emit far pollution \nThe initiative also wants to deliver aircraft that are 65pc quieter. Near-silent aircraft are unlikely to face the kind of restrictions on night flights in place at many airports, meaning a better return on the cost of buying them, as aircraft that emit only a whisper will not be limited by noise restrictions. As the furious debate around the location of a new runway serving London shows, it’s in aircraft manufacturers’ interests to work out how to deal with these factors. \nThe importance of starting research now is compounded by the long development cycles and high costs in the aerospace industry as issues such as safety, regulation and sheer complexity mean advances do not come quickly. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) an upgrade to existing technology such as a jet engine can take a decade and cost billions. \nThese are all challenges to be overcome but hastening work is the always present challenge of economics. The low margins in the airline sector make it an industry highly driven to squeeze every last efficiency out of its aircraft. \nThe size of the airline business IATA predicts annual spending on air transport will be $823bn in 2015 means that while research may be expensive, scale means that small savings soon stack up, especially in aircraft that have service lives that can be as long as 30 years. \nBefore the E-Airliners Botti describes is a regular sight in the air there are other major hurdles to overcome including developing longer lasting, lighter batteries, superconductive materials for the motors and wires and less power hungry avionics. \nWhile the E-Fan looks and works basically the same as a conventional contemporary aircraft, with a fuselage, wings and engines in pods which are powered by an energy source, the E-Airliners that will develop from it could be radically different both in how they are powered and how they look. \n“Pure electric power is currently quite some way short of being practical for an airliner,” says Simon Weeks, chief technology officer at Britain’s Aerospace Technology Institute. “Battery technology needs to advance and a more probable approach is a hybrid power system, like a Toyota Prius.” \nFuture (LSE: FUTR.L - news ) aircraft could have a power system similar to the hybrid engine in Toyota's Prius \nThis would involve a primary power source probably a jet engine used to power fans like those on the E-Fan but whose thrust could be used to give an extra boost when the aircraft needs a lot of power, such as take-off and climbing. Once the aeroplane is cruising, the jet engine could be run at a lower, less fuel-thirsty rate to generate power for the fans. \n“Like a hybrid car getting energy from braking, these fans could also generate power as the aircraft descends with them windmilling and putting power into a battery,” says Weeks. “You would still need fuel, but less of it.” \nAirbus’s Botti says this is the sort of set-up he sees in his regional airliner, though the power to drive the fans would always be electric, with the gas turbine being used only to generate electrical energy, not direct thrust. \nDriving several fans from a single power source is known as “distributive power” and could pave the way for airliners that look completely different from the familiar Airbuses and Boeings. Rather than having a couple of large jet engines on the wings or fuselage, instead a larger number of fans could be spread around the aircraft’s body with the engine generating the power to drive them hidden deep in the fuselage. \nFreed from current design limits because of their engines, future airliners could look very different \nFreed from previous constrictions, designers are letting their imaginations run wild, sketching out aircraft where wings and fuselage have blended into a single aerodynamic body with rows of fans along the trailing edges, and shapes similar to the “flying wing” of the US airforce’s B-2 stealth bomber. \nHow the public will react to such a transformation is unknown, but Alan Newby, head of future programmes and technology at Rolls-Royce, believes it won’t be an issue. \n“Some people won’t care because you don’t see the aircraft,” he says, referring to the walk down a boarding gate at the airport that means many passengers don’t even see what sort of aircraft they are flying on. “They could also be encouraged by the environmental benefits new types of aircraft and power will bring.” \nBotti doesn’t believe the jumbo jets and A330s the public are used to will be disappearing too soon. \n“We’ll still see wide-bodied airliners carrying hundreds of passengers on long-haul routes,” he says. “The potential for electrical power is much greater in aircraft flying shorter routes longer flights will look for benefits in areas such as using biofuels.” \nThe interest in electric power doesn’t mean there aren’t more improvements to be made to the jet turbines of today’s aircraft. \n“We’ve not run out of ideas for gas turbines yet,” says Newby, who believes another 10pc of efficiency can be squeezed out of the jet engines hanging off current aircraft's wings. \nRolls is working on an “Advance” gas turbine which uses new materials such as ceramics so the engine can run hotter, where it is more efficient, and carbon titanium blades which are lighter, effectively meaning aircraft can carry more passengers, effectively “for free” because of the weight saving. \n“You get to a virtuous circle where the less an aircraft and its engines weigh, the less power is needed, so you need to carry less fuel, which means the weight goes down and so on,” says Newby. \nRolls-Royce's Advance and Ultrafan engine desings offer significant benefits over current models \nFurther down the line, likely in 2025, is the “Ultrafan”. This builds on the Advance but the blades of the fan at the front which provide most of the thrust in a modern gas turbine are larger and can be adjusted to run at the optimum angle and speed. \n“To get the best propulsive efficiency you want a large amount of air moving slowly,” says Newby. “That’s why fans are getting bigger and the slower the air moves the quieter it is.” \nThere’s a limit to how big fans could become with conventional aeroplane designs so Newby says he expects even closer co-operation in the future between aircraft and engine designers. \nHe also sees distributive power featuring in forthcoming aircraft, with lots of smaller fans moving lots of air slowly to deliver less noisy aeroplanes. \nFor future passenger aircraft, it would seem speed is something that’s been left in the past. The amount of fuel needed to push Concorde to through the sound barrier meant it was hard to make the jet’s economics work and the current generation of large airliners cruise at slower speeds than their predecessors, as the faster a jet goes disproportionately more fuel is burnt. \nBreaking the sound barrier looks set to be preserve of military, says the ATI’s Weeks at least for the time being and even then for only the very richest few. \n“We’re unlikely to see civil supersonic flight in the near term, it’s just too expensive to go that fast with the technology currently available,” he says. “The only possibility of it outside the military seems to be business jets.” \nAlthough many aerospace companies have concepts for airliners capable of breaking the sound barrier tucked away in the design offices, perhaps one of the most realistic prospects of supersonic flight is from Aerion. \nAerion's AS2 jet offers supersonic travel for civilians - but has a $120m price tag \nThe US-based company has been developing a jet capable of carrying nine passengers at up to 1.5 times the speed of sound more than 4,500 miles though not at that speed all the way. However, when the company opened up the order book for its AS2 jet in May it had a $120m list price, meaning those who feel the need for speed will have to have extremely deep pockets. \nIf aircraft engine manufacturers do have a revolutionary power system in development, then they are keeping very quiet about it. Warp drive remains the preserve of Star Trek and for the next few decades the type of technology being pioneered by E-Fan is about as radical as it gets. \nIt seems that those living near airports and under flightpaths will just have to get used to the rumble of jet engines - even if they are becoming quieter. \nAs Weeks puts it: “Unless there’s a huge breakthrough, jet engines are about the best we’ve got - but they remain a remarkable way of generating a huge amount of power from a small volume.” \nThey’d certainly seem remarkable to Louise Bleriot back in 1909.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T18:58:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
