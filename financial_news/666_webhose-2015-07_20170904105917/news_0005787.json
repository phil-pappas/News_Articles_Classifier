Retail sales show the total receipts at stores that sell merchandise and related services to final consumers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics composes the producer price index to measure the average change over time in the prices received by domestic producers of goods and services. The weekly report of new unemployment claims shows the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the first time.
