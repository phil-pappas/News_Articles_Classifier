Industrial Securities (Shanghai: 601377.SS - news ) plunged by its 10 percent daily limit to 10.38 yuan and Dongxing Securities (Shanghai: 601198.SS - news ) also slumped 10 percent to 21.92 yuan. \nToll road-related shares also fell. In Shanghai, Hubei Chutian Expressway dropped by its 10 percent daily limit to 6.26 yuan and Shandong Hi-speed lost 10 percent to 7.49 yuan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T21:43:11.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
