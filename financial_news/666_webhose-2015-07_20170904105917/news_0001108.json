It leaves the future of the eurozone in tatters only 15 years after its inception. \nIn a weekend billed as Europe’s last chance to save the monetary union, finance ministers will now reconvene on Saturday morning ahead of an EU leaders' summit later in the evening, to thrash out an agreement or decide to eject Greece from the eurozone. \nShould no deal be forthcoming, the German government has made preparations to negotiate a temporary five-year euro exit, providing Greece with humanitarian aid and assistance while it makes the transition. \nA plan drafted by Berlin's finance ministry, with the backing of Angela Merkel, laid out two stark options for Greece: either the government submits to drastic measures such as placing €50bn of its assets in a trust fund to pay off its debts, and have Brussels take over its public administration, or agree to a \"time-out\" solution where it would leave the eurozone. \n= 23.45 = \n= 23.20 = \n= 23.16 = \nFinance ministers are now leaving the Lex building in their droves. Most are not speaking to waiting reporters. \nMr Dijssebloem says talks are \"very difficult \" and will continue against tomorrow. \"Work is in progress\". \nMeanwhile, Germany's SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel has put out the following statement: \nThe SPD continues to pursue the goal of keeping Greece in the euro zone, if the necessary conditions can be created. That is also the objective of the federal government. And above is currently being discussed in Brussels. The SPD places special emphasis on a common and coordinated approach with France. The Federal Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble proposal's for a temporary withdrawal of Greece from the eurozone is naturally known by the SPD. In such a difficult situation, every possible proposal needs to be examined impartially. This proposal would, however, only be realized if the Greek government would however have no better alternative. \n= 23.01 = \n= Eurogroup is over without agreement = \nTo be continued tomorrow at 10am BSM we're hearing. No press conference and no statement tonight. \nMalta's PM sums it up \n= 23.01 = \nWell that was quick. Looks like we're nearly done \n= 22.58 = \n= Washington pressures Finns = \nLooks like the White House is being forced into another euro intervention. This time it's Helsinki who are getting it in the ear, and none other than a certain Olli Rehn (former EU economics tsar) whose being leaned on to get the Finns to say Yes to a new deal. \nMr Rehn is now in the Finnish government serving as business minister. He is also a member of the Finns Grand Committee that decides what negotiating mandate ahead of EU summits. \n= 22.52 = \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) might be a good time to go put the kettle on... \n= 22.42 = \n= What are we waiting for? = \nSo it looks like finance ministers are in the middle of drawing up a statement which would commit the Greeks to start legislating on their plans as early as Monday. That's one way to solve the credibility problem. \nBut whatever they agree, it will be the leaders who have the final say tomorrow night. \n= 22.34 = \nThe FT's Duncan Robinson tells us what we don't want to hear from Brussels \nIt gets worse... \n= 22.13 = \n= A new big fat Greek bail-out will cost €100bn = \nIt's rising by the minute. German tabloid Bild is reporting that a new rescue package for Greece would now reach €100bn. Earlier touted figures ranged from €50-€78bn. \n= 22.10 = \n= 22.00 = \nIf that German finance ministry paper is a bit tl;dr, here's a digest of what it proposes: \na) to keep Greece in the euro: \n- Place companies and other assets to be privatised into an independent trust committed to selling them and using the proceeds to pay off national debt \n- Reform the public administration under the supervision of the European Commission. \n- Legislate for automatic cuts in government spending if budget deficit targets are missed \nAnd b) if that doesn't work out, the paper recommends a five-year euro holiday for Greece, with debt restructuring and \"humanitarian and technical assistance\". \n= 21.52 = \n= Italians run out of patience = \nThe Finns have had enough with the Greeks, but the Italians have had enough with the Germans. \nErstwile Greek allies in Rome are ready to tell Berlin tomorrow that it's time to end Athens \"humiliation\" \n= 21.42 = \n= Greece needs €25bn bank recapitalisation = \nThe Greek banking system is on its knees. Reuters now reports - following an earlier story from the Wall Street Journal - that the banking system needs double the amount of funds that were first reserved for a full recapitalisation - €25bn. \nThis sum would also take the country's financing needs to over €89bn. \n= 21.36 = \n= German finance ministry paper leaked = \nYou can read it in full here \nMeanwhile it has since emerged that both Angela Merkel and her vice-chancellor support the proposals. \n= 21.23 = \n= Finland will not back a deal = \nIt looks like that the Finns will not vote in favour of a deal tonight. This complicates things in the Eurogroup. As it stands, the finance ministers need unanimity to agree a Greek package. That will not now happen, but they can still evoke an \"emergency\" clause which states a deal can be passed if 85pc of remaining members states agree. \nThe Finns only hold a 1.7pc voting share, so as long as there are no more dissenters, the eurogroup can still gives the thumbs up. \nShould there be a blocking minority of smaller states, it would require all of the following to say no. \n= 21.05 = \nRumours that a statement is forthcoming... \nMeanwhile, the True Finns, who are the second largest party in the coalition government and fierce eurosceptics, are threatening to bring down the government if they ratify a new ESM programme... They're a tricky bunch the Finns \nBack in 2011, they secured an agreement to get back collateral for Greece's last rescue programme, and late last year blocked a six-month extension of Greece's second bail-out. \n= 21.02 = \nMy two penneth on tonight's shenanigans \n= 20.27 = \n= The temporary Grexit bandwagon = \nSo, we're told finance ministers are not officially discussing the temporary euro hiatus plan for Greece. Still, seems to be putting ideas in people's heads... \n= 20.21 = \n= Credibility and implementation = \nThose are the two buzzwords of the night. Everything we've heard so far tonight suggests that creditors remain unconvinced that the current government, after last week's referendum, can be trusted to implement the raft of measures they have signed up to. \nSomewhat counter-intuitively, they're demanding the government show commitment by going even further than their proposals to win back trust of the partners. In particular, they want to see some legislation on reforms passed as early as the upcoming week. \n= 20.13 = \n= The Finns say No = \nLots of attention on Germany today, but the eurozone's other hardened creditors are not for turning it seems. The Finns will need some convincing if their parliament is set to ratify another rescue package. Yesterday, the country's foreign minister said his was opposed to another deal. \nToday, finance minister Alexander Stubb rushed into the eurogroup. He needs a mandate from his own parliament to begin talks about a new rescue. Right now, that mandate looks very shaky \n= 20.07 = \n= Eurogroup prepare more prior actions = \nContours of tonight's discussions are beginning to take shape. Creditors look set to formally propose further fiscal measures they require from the government if a deal is to be reached in just over 28 hours time \n= 19.57 = \nEuclid: \"can someone pass me the salt...\" \nCreditors: \" not unless you raise VAT on salt to 26pc\" \n= 19.48 = \nTonight sounds like a write-off.. \n= 19.43 = \n= \"Too little, too late\" = \nA eurozone official has told AP that creditors want \"more specific and binding commitments\" from Athens that it will carry out its promises to overhaul the economy. \nThe official said there's a general feeling in the room that the Greek proposals are \"too little, too late\" and as such, more proof of the government's commitment to follow through is required. \nThe source added the reforms do not \"necessarily have to be austerity measures.\" \n= 19.39 = \n= Deal hopes diminishing = \nThe Guardian's Europe editor Ian Traynor on today's impasse. He also reports that part of Germany's plans include \"external\" monitoring of the Greek government's reform measures. That's likely to go down like a lead-balloon in Athens. \n= 19.30 = \n= A Franco-German rupture = \nUh-oh. Tomorrow's EU leaders summit just got interesting... \nWorth noting that the French have been beavering away tirelessly over the last few weeks to get both sides closer together. Paris sent a delegation to Athens to make sure their submitted proposals were up to scratch. \nA chorus of senior French officials have also warned against letting Greece go. And in my own favourite tribute, French PM Manuel Valls has even started tweeting in Greek. Bravo! \n= 19.29 = \n= Back where we started = \nPaul Mason of Channel 4 doesn't think much has been achieved (so far) at today's eurogroup. He stresses the Greeks won't sign any deal that gives no promise of debt relief, while creditors are continuing to push for the government to go even further on austerity. \n= 19.20 = \nWhile we're waiting, some readers' thoughts: \nPaul Campion writes: Well is it ‘deal’ or ‘no deal’? Looks like we need to get Noel Edmunds over to Brussels to sort it out. \nAndy Brown chips in with some financial incentivising: Please can you suggest that the eurozone finance ministers and leaders be made to put €25,000 each of their own money into the bail-out fund should they choose to give a third bail-out to Greece, that should focus their minds.... If Greece isn't helped and supported to leave the euro now, with humanitarian aid and support for its poor citizens, then the whole eurozone will just tear itself apart even sooner. I grew up with the Cold War, the euro is much more scary... \n= 19.14 = \n= \"Doubts and fatigue\" setting in = \nWe're five hours into the eurogroup, and the whisperings from Brussels aren't overly positive French journalist Isabelle Ory tweets that the dividing lines remain among the 19 ministers. She adds that finance ministers have also spoke about the huge financial costs involved with a possible Greek exit. \nTranslation: After 5 hours #Eurogroup divided. Some countries support the Greece, including the French. Others expressed doubts and fatigue. \nThe BBC's Jenny HIll in Brussels reports that Germany is reportedly said to be \"putting up fierce resistance at the negotiating table\". \n= 18.57 = \n= Reshuffle 'makes sense\" = \nSyriza's economics minister George Stathakis has fuelled the fire on rumours that PM Tsipras is planning an overhaul of his cabinet. \nAccording to Reuters, the minister - who is seen as one of the more moderate voices in the government and thus in line for promotion - has said it \"makes sense\" for some ministers to be replaced. He said that anyone who doesn't agree with the government should \"resign their seat\". \nHe's added that capital controls are likely to be in place for some time. \n= 18.55 = \nAFP have managed to get hold of that German finance ministry report. \nHere's their write-up of what's in the Schaeuble plan: \nGermany has drawn up plans for a temporary five-year Greek exit from the euro if it fails to improve its bailout proposals, a European source told AFP Saturday as eurozone finance ministers met in Brussels. \n\"It's an internal paper, it was not distributed today (at the eurozone meeting). There were two options: an improvement of the proposals, or temporary 'Grexit',\" said the source, who had seen the paper. \nHardline Germany is leading a chorus of scepticism as eurozone finance ministers study leftist Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's new reform plan for a third rescue package worth more than €80bn ($89 billion). \nThe European source was commenting on a report in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper that said the plans appeared in a one-page German finance ministry \"position paper\" which was handed to other member states. \nThe new Greek proposals for a third bail-out \"lack areas of important reforms,\" which is why they cannot serve as the basis for a new three-year bailout programme, the ministry reportedly said. \nIt urged Greece to quickly improve its reform proposals and seek parliamentary support for a fund to sell €50bn in financial instruments to reduce the debt burden. \nIf not, the paper said, Greece should leave the 19-country eurozone for at least five years and restructure its debt while remaining a member of the 28-nation European Union and receiving humanitarian aid and other support. \n= 18.29 = \nYet more confirmation that euro holidays are not a *thing* \nBut, this is not stopping Yanis Varoufakis having a nice: \"I told you so moment\" on Twitter (Swiss: TWTR.SW - news ) \n= 18.06 = \n= Dinner time for the eurogroup = \nDoesn't look like they'll be discussing a temporary Grexit, despite Mr Schaeuble's best efforts \nAs they break off for some fuel, eurozone officials have told Reuters that Athens is being asked to go further in the way of cuts and structural reforms. That chimes with almost everything we've heard so far today. \nOne of the main reasons it that Greece's economy is deteriorating rapidly under the weight of capital controls - which are likely to stick around even if a deal is agreed. This places a further burden on the government to hit ambitious budget targets to keep qualifying for fresh rescue money. And to so, they'll have to embark on more radical belt-tightening. \nIreland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) 's Michael Noonan today summed up some of the fears that \"demand\" side reforms, such as increasing taxes when an economy is in recession, will only condemn Greece to further misery. Instead he called on an emphasis on structural \"supply side\" measures to help restore the economy back to growth. The only problem with these is that they take much longer bear dividend. \n= 18.00 = \n= Nobody likes the Schaeuble plan = \nWolfgang Schaeuble's plan for a \"conscious uncoupling\" of Greece and euro, to paraphrase Gwynth Paltrow, is causing a bit of a stink. \nA German social democract on Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) has already rejected the idea to throw Greece out for five years and provide them with humanitarian aid. \nIt's also important to note that Mr Schaeuble and his finance ministry don't usually sing from the same hymn sheet as Ms Merkel. \nThe Chancellor will be in Brussels tomorrow at the major meeting which is now set to decide Greece's fate. Somehow, I imagine she won't be taking that finance ministry Grexit plan with her... \nBack in Athens meanwhile... \n= 17.50 = \n= Schaeuble wants temporary five-year Grexit = \nGerman newspaper FAS is reporting the German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has rejected Greece's plans and wants them to temporarily leave the euro for five years and be given humanitarian aid to manage the process. \nThis isn't the first time we've heard of Mr Schaeuble's plans for a \"velvet divorce\" for Greece. Yanis Varoufakis wrote today that he is convinced \"that the German finance minister wants Greece to be pushed out of the single currency to put the fear of God into the French and have them accept his model of a disciplinarian eurozone.\" \nFAS reports: (rough translation) \nThe finance ministry has put forward a negative assessment to the other euro countries:\"These proposals are missing centrally important areas of reform to modernize the country and to advance on the long term economic growth and sustainable development,\" said the paper. \nThe Ministry suggested among other things that Greece shall transfer assets amounting to €50bn to a trust fund, which it sells and thus removes debt. Option (Brussels: OPTI.BR - news ) two is Athens negotiating a 'time out' from the euro. It leaves the monetary union for at least five years and restructures its debt. However, it remains an EU Member State and receives further \"growth-enhancing, humanitarian and technical assistance\". \nThe German finance ministry is refusing to comment, for now. \n*Update: The Greeks have also denied the Schaeuble master plan \n= 16.56 = \nWe're well underway, so here are some telling snaps from inside today's eurogroup \n= 16.37 = \n= Mid-afternoon round up = \nEurozone finance ministers have been holed up for nearly two hours now. As we await more murmurings from Brussels, here's a round up of what we've know so far: \nGreece's future in the eurozone is hanging on a knife edge, after Europe's creditors warned the country has destroyed the trust of its partners with just over 24 hours remaining to secure Athens euro fate. \nIn a weekend billed as Europe's \"last chance\" to save the single currency, finance ministers rounded on the Greek government for holding a referendum on the country's bail-out terms only a week ago. \n\"The trust has been destroyed in unbelievable ways\", said German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble ahead of a crunch meeting of the eurogroup yesterday. \n\"We certainly can't rely on promises\" he said. \nSlovakia's finance minister, who represents one of the harshest critics of European largess to Greece, accused Mr Tsipras of being guilty of \"time travel'. \nEurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem - who represents all 19 finance ministers - questioned whether Mr Tsipras could implement measures which he had attacked as \"blackmail\" and “humiliation” only seven days ago. \n\"There is a major issue of trust - can the Greek government be trusted to actually do what they are promising, to implement over the coming weeks, days and years?\" said Mr Dijsselbloem. \n\"Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) if it's all good on paper the question is whether it will get off the ground and will it happen\". \nSpain's finance minister Luis de Guindos said: \"Credibility is very low, so we will see. I hope Grexit will not take place\". \n= 15.48 = \nChance for you to have your say on how talks will conclude in our poll here \n= 15.30 = \n= Why are the Greeks signing up to harsher austerity? = \nExcellent question. Here's an explainer on that, and any other questions about what could happen today. \n= Why have the Greeks signed up to harsher austerity? = \nPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras is banking on securing an agreement with his creditors to keep the country in the euro. By agreeing to carry out many of the tough reforms and spending hikes he has so far resisted, he hopes to get a big concession on relieving part of the country's debt. \n= Is this worse than the deal voters rejected in the referendum? = \nYes and no. On the one hand the VAT hikes and pensions reforms are exactly what creditors have wanted over the last month. \nHowever, Greece's lenders seem to have finally come round to the idea of alleviating the country's debt burden, after severe pressure from Washington. This was something that was always promised to Greece when they signed a bail-out in 2012, but it was never put in formal writing. \nAthens is also asking for a much bigger rescue package than it was before. This is around €75bn over the next three years so deeper reform measures are the price they'll have to pay. \n= 15.04 = \nWell this is awkward...despite having kicked him out of the last major eurogroup, looks like finance ministers were still expecting Yanis to turn up today. \nThe seating arrangements have his name hastily scribbled off and replaced by new man Euclid Tsakalotos. Way to make a guy feel welcome, everyone... \n= 14.38 = \nBuckle up everyone, I suspect it's going to be a long and tortuous one tonight. \n= 14.22 = \n= Schaeuble: debt relief is illegal under treaties = \nThe man holding the purse strings has arrived. He sums up much of the scepticism around today's Eurogroup, saying talks will be \"extremely difficult\". Mr Schauble again dismisses the notion of a debt haircut saying it is not possible under the euro's treaties (hat-tip to Melanie Hall in Berlin for the translation). \nHe adds: \"We certainly can't rely on promises. In recent months, up until the last hours, the trust has been destroyed in unbelievable ways. \n\"I do not think we will easily reach a decision.\" \n= 14.17 = \nLuxembourg's Pierre Gramegna says it is \"unavoidable\" the Greeks have some help on debt relief. \"There is no use in postponing that discussion\" he says. \nHe also describes the Greek proposals as \"comprehensive\". \nSpain's Luis de Guindos adds: \"credibility is very low, so we will see. I hope Grexit will not take place\". \n= 14.07 = \n= \"Huge problem\" with debt sustainability = \nSlovakia's Peter Kazimir sums up the tensions between creditors. He says he has a \"huge problem\" with debt sustainability analysis as carried out by the IMF. \n\"Now we will see what the institutions will bring on the table and we have to assess it\", he says. \"The DSA is a huge problem.\" \nA reminder the IMF has called for nearly 17pc of GDP debt relief for Greece, an assessment which the Europeans tried to block and have openly disagreed with. \n= 14.00 = \n= Dijsselbloem: we need trust = \nThe Eurogroup president arrives and hits the nail on the head. \"There is a major issue of trust - can the Greek government be trusted to actually do what they are promising, to implement over the coming weeks, days and years?\" \n\"We are not there yet\" says Mr Dijsselbloem. Athens \"will have to show very very strong commitment to rebuld that trust.\" \n\"I think it's going to be a quite a difficult meeting.\" \n= 13.50 = \n= France: the Greeks have shown courage and determination = \nThe Greeks have no greater friend than Michel Sapin of France today. He usually stays quiet in these doorsteps, but here's some of his words today (he's got \"bad English\" so sticks to French\"). \n. \nHe also adds: \"We have the right to talk about debt\" - words to Greek ears. \n= \"It's not about striking a deal tonight\" = \nItaly's Pier Carlo Padoan is one of the few allies in the room for Greece today. He says \"the purpose of tonight is to kick off on the ESM...we are all here with open minds, to get the green light to start negotiations.\" \n\"It's not about striking a deal tonight.\" \n= 13.35 = \n= Malta: Euclid needs to square the circle = \nEdward Scicluna, finance minister of the eurozone's smallest country Malta, echoes the concern of his colleagues. He says it is up to Athens to \"solve the incongruence\" between a government that is now presenting proposals that go beyond those that were rejected in the referendum. \nMr Sciculana says there is \"healthy scepticism\" among creditors towards the government, but it is time for the Greeks to begin implementation using a \"carrot and stick\". \n= 13.28 = \n= All change in Athens? = \nThat comment from Mr Noonan about fears of a diminishing majority for Mr Tsipras reflect the revolt among his own ranks over this new three-year deal. \nWe've aleady heard suggestions of a major reshuffle coming up as soon as next week if a deal goes through. Opposition parties from Greece have also been in Brussels this week with talks with Jean-Claude Juncker. \n= 13.26 = \nFinland's Alexander Stubb, prolific Tweeter and always ready for a good soundbite, has come and gone without a word. Ominous. \n** Scratch that. An explanation for the radio silence (what is the Grand Committee??) \n= 13.11 = \n= Ireland: Tsipras's majority is diminishing fast = \nIreland's Michael Noonan strikes a more balanced tone on arriving but says Mr Tsipras should move quickly to pass legislation for reforms. \n\"We need a medium term sustainable programe,\" he says, which depends on \"whether it is sufficient to cause the economy to grow\" \nHe says government is likely to need to do \"extra measures\" but adds that trust is slowly being rebuilt. \nMr Noonan says the referendum has done significant damage to the banking system and economy. He notes Mr Tsipras's parliamentary majority is \"eroding\" fast and he needs to implement the agreed measures to get the country back on track. \n= 13.07 = \nWhat conditionality is attached to the funding, we don't yet know... \n= 13.03 = \n= EU Commissioner: still many concerns = \nValdis Dombrovskis, vice-president of the Commission arrives. \nHe says there is now \"wilingness on the Greek side to reach an agreement\" and is confident they have backing through their parliamentary majority. \nHowever he adds \"there are still many issues and concerns\" to be ironed out with Athens and makes his way into the Lex building. \n= 12.59 = \n= Greek plan still has holes = \nDutch deputy finance minister Eric Wiebes is up next. He says \"the Greeks have clearly made a step forward but at the moment the plans are \"missing specificity\" \"and the plan is weaker than it should be in certain areas.\" \nHe adds negotiations can only start \"when these conditions are filled in\". \n\"Many governments have serious questions about commitment and the power of implementation\" from the government after it rejected the same measures in last weekend's referendum, he notes. \nAustria's Jorg Schelling also adds concerns about implementation, saying creditors need to see some moves to carry out \"prior actions\" in the next 14 days. He adds that the financing programme amounts to €72bn. \n= 12.26 = \n= Moscovici: we have the basis for an agreement = \nCautious optimism seems to be the order of the day as our finance ministers arrive for today's meeting. \nSome more from Mr Moscovici who says: \"We have to have reforms which are put in place rapidly, that is the key to getting a (new) programme, to be able to tackle the debt.\" \nMeanwhile, Estonia's number two has also arrived. \nMeanwhile, the Eurogroup seem to have pencilled in a press conference for 10pm tonight. I fear Ian Traynor of The Guardian might be on to something... \n= 12.18 = \n= Lagarde: hoping for progress = \nIMF chief Christine Lagarde arrives. Only a few words to waiting reporters. She says: \"We're here today to make a lot of progress\". \n= 12.10 = \n= Finance ministers arrive = \nGreece's Euclid Tsakalotos is first in to the Lex building for today's eurogroup. He says nothing to waiting journalists. Mr Sapin of France follows him in with the same. \n= 12.00 = \nSome signs of life in Brussels. Euclid is in the building. \nPierre Moscovici also arrives. He says the \"very large parliamentary majority in favour of new Greek proposals gives them political strength\" and there is now a \"basis to open negotiations for a new programme\". \nSpain's Luis de Guindos arrives without speaking to journalists. \nThe arrivals should be coming thick and fast in around an hour or so. You can watch them live here. \n= 11.50 = \n= Reshuffle on the way = \nMr Tsipras failed to secure the 151 votes he needed to secure a majority backing from Syriza over his plans. 17 MPs either voted against or abstained from last night's verdict, but it sailed through with opposition support. \nGreek journalist Niki Kitsantonis now reports that the PM is set for a major reshuffle of his government next week. So far, only Mr Varoufakis has been replaced in the cabinet. Expect more high profile figures, namely energy minister and dissenter Lafazanis, to be on the way out after failing to put his name to the austerity package... \n= 11.24 = \n= Where can Greece find €80bn? = \nEurozone officials think Greece's financing needs are around €83bn over the next three years. Athens seems to hope it can secure that from the following sources: \n- €53.5bn from a new European Stability Mechanism loan (joint eurozone rescue fund) - €16bn still due from the IMF before its March 2016 programme ends - €8bn in other EU funding that it lost its claim to when it failed to complete an its second bail-out \n= 11.11 = \n= Deal hopes tempered = \nOn the back of that leaked assessment from the Troika, Reuters is now reporting two unamed eurozone officials who reflect the same concerns that the measures will not be enough to satisfy creditors. \n\"The high figures for financing needs over the next three years may be too high and too sudden \" said one official. \n= 11.01 = \n= Schaeuble open to \"some\" debt reprofiling = \nMore German reports, this time from Suddeutsche Zeitung who says the irascible Wolfgang Schaeuble may be coming round to the idea of a debt reprofiling for the Greeks. They report that Mr Schaeuble has \"now acknowledged for the first time that debt might be too high\". The admission came during a conference with his French counterpart at the Bundesbank on Thursday it seems. \nFrom SZ: \n\"German Finance Minister Schäuble admitted at the conference for the first time to try to negotiate with the government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on debt restructuring. The International Monetary Fund had pointed out recently that the debt burden of Athens was too high. \"And they're right, I'm afraid,\" Schaeuble said . \"Debt is not sustainable without making a haircut.\" \nMr Schaeuble seems open to a \"reprofiling\" of Greece's debt which would likely see maturities on repayments extended far into the century. Repayment already stretches out to 2057. \n= 10.53 = \n= Bild: Tsipras is laughing at us = \nThe German tabloid aren't happy at being \"tricked\" by the Greek PM.
