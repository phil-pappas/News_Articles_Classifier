The ARO Station, developed for the European market, is a customized solution that houses an ARO pump and piping in a durable housing in order to reduce leaks and fumes during chemical transfer from one container to another. Standing independently from a truck, the ARO Station helps operators comply with changing environmental regulations, while enhancing operator safety. \n“ARO understands the importance of transporting and securing hazardous material and minimizing its exposure. The risks with chemical handling are a daily reality and the ARO Station was designed to protect operators as well as the environment during the transfer of these materials,” said Fausto Lotti, EMEA marketing leader ofIngersoll Rand Fluid Management. \nThe ARO Station can accommodate two different size pumps – the 1 1/2 inch or two inch Expert Series Pumps (EXP) ARO diaphragm pump. With the capability to pump material from five to 30 cubic meters per hour, the ARO Station can be calibrated to pump the appropriate quantity for each application. Use of the ARO Station increases the safety of chemical installations during the unloading process by reducing risks of water hammer that occur during the pressurization of the tanks. \nMade of high-density polyethylene, the ARO Station is impervious to corrosion, and features a drip collection tray that can hold up to 200 liters of fluid. The ARO Station can be used as a free-standing pump solution or it can be equipped with wheels for mobility. Compact and ready for use, the ARO Station is a standardized skid size thus reducing integration costs. \nARO offers three add-ons to increase environmental and operator safety: A leak detector that communicates possible leakage, helping to minimize air pollution and risk from fumes A heater to prevent freezing in extreme situations An alarm that monitors the level of liquid in the tank and whether the system is running dry \nAbout Ingersoll Rand \nIngersoll Rand ( IR ) advances the quality of life by creating comfortable, sustainable and efficient environments.
