The tender offer is part of the Company's existing $50 million repurchase program that was previously approved by the Board of Directors in April 2015. \nBased on the preliminary information received from Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the depositary for the tender offer, a total of 3,535,613 shares of the Company's common shares were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or below the purchase price of $9.10 per share. In addition, the Company has been advised by the depositary that a total of 270,776 shares of the Company's common shares were tendered through notice of guaranteed delivery at or below the purchase price of $9.10. \nBecause the tender offer was oversubscribed, the number of shares that the Company will purchase from each tendering shareholder will be prorated to limit the Company's aggregate purchase to 3,282,796 shares after giving effect to \"odd lot\" tenders for which shares will be repurchased on a priority basis. Based on the preliminary information provided by the depositary, excluding all shares tendered by notice of guaranteed delivery, the Company estimates that the proration factor for the tender offer will be approximately 93.2%. \nThe number of shares expected to be purchased in the tender offer and the purchase price are preliminary and subject to change. The preliminary information contained in this press release is subject to confirmation by the depositary and is based on the assumption that all shares tendered through notice of guaranteed delivery will be delivered. The actual number and percentage of outstanding shares properly tendered, and not withdrawn, the final price per share for shares purchased in the tender offer and the number of shares of the Company's common shares that will be outstanding after payment for the tendered shares will be announced promptly following the completion of the confirmation process. Payment for the shares accepted for purchase will occur promptly thereafter. Payment for shares will be made in cash, without interest. \nB. Riley & Co., LLC is serving as the dealer manager, Georgeson Inc. is serving as the information agent for the tender offer, and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. is acting as the depositary for the tender offer.
