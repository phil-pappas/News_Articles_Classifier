Jose Bautista tacked on a couple of insurance runs with a two-run blast of his own in the eighth.\nIt was all the offence Estrada would need as the 31-year-old stymied Rays hitters all afternoon, alternating between his high-80s fastball and baffling, Bugs Bunny changeup.\nAided by catcher Dioner Navarro, who threw out a pair of baserunners, Estrada faced just one batter above the minimum in his eight innings, at one point retiring 15 Rays in a row.\nThe last time Estrada faced the Rays — June 24 in Tampa — he took a no-hitter into the eighth inning and threw 8 2/3 shutout innings. (Coincidentally, it was Colabello who hit the game-winning blast then as well.) In fact, in two starts and two relief appearances against the Rays this season, Estrada hasn’t allowed a single run over a combined 21 innings.\nTasked to cover just one inning, the Jays bullpen was able to hold the lead with rookie right-hander Roberto Osuna pitching a scoreless ninth in front of a near-sellout crowd announced at 41,683.\nThe Jays have Monday off before a six-game road trip to Oakland and Seattle.\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays blast off behind Hutchison after break: Griffin\nJohnson leads British Open, DeLaet on bubble when darkness falls: Feschuk", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T23:32:16.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
