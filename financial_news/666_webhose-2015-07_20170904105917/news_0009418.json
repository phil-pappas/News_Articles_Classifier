It will soon go to Gov. Andrew Cuomo's labor commissioner, who will have 45 days to act on the recommendation.\nCuomo supports the proposal.\nThe wage hike would apply to fast-food workers in restaurants with 30 or more locations. It would be phased in over three years in New York City and six years elsewhere.\nFranchise owners say the hike unfairly singles out their industry.\nThe increase won't apply to low-wage workers in other industries. The state's minimum wage is now $8.75 an hour and will increase to $9 at year's end.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
