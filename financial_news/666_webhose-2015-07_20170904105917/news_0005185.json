Within the index, 34 stocks gained, nine declined, and seven were unchanged. Turnover was $159 million. Steel & Tube rose 4.9 per cent to $2.77, paring the stock's 12 per cent decline since June 11, after the Petone-based company said it plans to buy fastener distributor Manufacturing Suppliers in a cash and scrip deal. \"Investors will like the fact they're diversifying a little bit more,\" said Grant Williamson, a director at Hamilton Hindin Greene. A six-year low in the New Zealand dollar helped companies which derive their earnings overseas by increasing the value of the exports. Chemicals maker Nuplex Industries, which has been expanding its footprint in Asia, gained 2.9 per cent to $4.31, accounting software developer Xero, whose biggest market is Australia, advanced 1.7 per cent to $17.50, and UK-based threadmaker Coats Group advanced 1.7 per cent to 60.5 cents. Breathing respirator manufacturer Fisher & Paykel Healthcare rose 0.4 per cent to $7.21. New Zealand equities are in for a significant reweighting, with exporters expected to raise their earnings guidance in next month's reporting season, says Harbour Asset Management managing director Andrew Bascand. \"The Kiwi dollar is 50 per cent lower than its average for this year-to-date,\" he said. Units in Fonterra Shareholders' Fund rose 0.4 per cent to $4.72. NZX Milk Futures pricing indicates whole milk powder prices are set to fall further after yesterday's sharp decline at auction. The units give investors exposure to Fonterra Co-operative Group's dividend stream, which benefits from cheaper milk input prices. Among the blue chip stocks, construction company Fletcher Building fell 0.1 per cent to $8.27, telecommunications retailer Spark New Zealand declined 0.7 per cent to $2.86, and Auckland International Airport rose 0.6 per cent to $5.205.
