But things are changing, and within this change one can’t ignore that India has the second largest working population in the world, largely made up of people employed in the informal sector. As a result, majority of the working population does not have any formal pension benefits in India. While various employee benefits are empirically driven by legacy or industry practice, retirement benefits through instruments such as provident fund and gratuity are largely driven by statute. Over the years, the popularity of retirement benefits such as superannuation and pension has seen a decrease. The purpose of retirement benefits is to increase the economic security of employees. Today, employers have to play a vital role in bringing in awareness among employees of the need for the post-retirement income. Employer-sponsored superannuation schemes are an arrangement to contribute to an income tax approved trust or fund for creation of a corpus to buy pensions on retirement for the benefit of employees. Such contributions are tax efficient and investments grow over the working life of employees to achieve a higher corpus on retirement. These plans are usually either defined-benefit or defined-contribution. The defined benefit pension is where the benefit is a function of the last drawn salary. Such pension benefits may be based on the employee’s final salary, dearness allowance, and extent of service with employer. A defined contribution scheme provides for a fixed component of contribution as a percentage of base salary. The contributions so accrued during the active work life along with the interest earned form the corpus to purchase an annuity from an annuity provider. A small number of employers in the private sector do provide supplementary pension benefits, mostly defined contribution superannuation schemes, but very few offer defined benefit pension. These are largely funded through products offered by life insurance companies. However, these are decreasing due to certain setbacks besides employees not seeing perceived benefits. The good news is that the New Pension System (NPS) is another tool available to fund for retirement benefits. The employer can now subscribe to the NPS corporate sector model for the benefit of its employees. This enables employees to make their cost-to-company (CTC) tax efficient. The corporate model of NPS, sponsored by Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), is gaining popularity among employers; particularly after the budget proposals, which have further aroused interest in this product. Employers may now think about providing an option to their employees to restructure salaries incorporating a component towards contribution to NPS. Superannuation schemes are largely driven by tax benefits. Unfortunately, some of the tax and regulatory changes in the recent past has had an impact with both employers and employees opting out of superannuation schemes. Firstly, the government introduced a perquisite tax for contributions made by the employer in excess of Rs. 1 lakh, as taxable in the hands of employee. Secondly, the regulator issued guidelines to insurance companies to file for a new product with the regulator with certain minimum guarantees and no negative return guarantees. This resulted in temporary non-availability of the product. Though this was in the interest of the policyholders, it had its share of the uncertainty caused among employers. They changed their policies with either a decision to discontinue contributions to the superannuation scheme or some of the employers offering an option to employees to withdraw accrued corpus and approached the income tax authorities seeking approval for such withdrawal after deducting applicable income tax. But both superannuation and NPS can co-exist, thanks to separate income tax provisions. Both types of accumulations are portable when an employee changes jobs. However, the difference lies in the ease of portability and effecting transfer of accumulations to one’s credit. NPS scores over superannuation in this criterion. Under the corporate model of NPS, the employer is provided with a corporate account number and the employee also gets an individual permanent retirement account number (PRAN). This enables portability across geographies, employment and employers, and can thus be operated from anywhere. Contributions are easy to manage across employers and also as an individual subscriber. Superannuation is portable from one income tax approved trust to another. This means that transfer of superannuation accumulations is possible only if the new employer maintains an income tax approved trust as maintained by the previous employer. If not then the employee will be left with no option but to leave the past accumulations in the previous employer’s trust and avail annuity at a later date or transfer the same as and when the current employer sets up an approved superannuation trust. An immediate annuity or withdrawal option will not be tax efficient. An employee can derive tax benefit out of restructuring her CTC incorporating both NPS and superannuation under both heads. This would not only help build a decent corpus, it would also help enhance pension payouts. Doing so would be of particular value when the regular stream of income stops on retirement. The tax treatment makes contributions to both NPS and superannuation efficient tax saving tools. The government should consider the long standing demand of providing EEE (exempt-exempt- exempt) status to NPS. Currently, the corpus allowed to withdraw at the age of superannuation is taxable and NPS continues to be EET (exempt-exempt-taxed). This would create a level playing field between NPS and other retirement benefits such as EPF or PPF. Your regular stream of salary income stops on retirement. But it should be noted that we live in an era of rising cost of medical expenses. As such employer-sponsored retirement benefits provide higher quantum corpus available for ensuring post-retirement avenues for much required income.
