The company paid nearly $19 billion in the settlement that was announced earlier this month .TheStreet Quant Ratings rates BP as a \"hold,\" with a \"C\" letter grade. With low oil prices, and BP's grim quarter, are there any stocks in the \"integrated oil and gas\" sub-industry worth buying? \nThere are, and here are the top four, according to TheStreet Ratings , TheStreet 's proprietary ratings tool. \nTheStreet Ratings projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and dividends. Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings.

It engages in the exploration, development, and production of crude oil, natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). \n\"We rate YACIMIENTOS PETE FISCALES SA (YPF) a BUY. This is driven by multiple strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, attractive valuation levels, good cash flow from operations, expanding profit margins and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had somewhat disappointing return on equity.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The revenue growth greatly exceeded the industry average of 38.8%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 1.9%. This growth in revenue does not appear to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, displayed by a decline in earnings per share. Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 60.02% to $1,353.93 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, YACIMIENTOS PETE FISCALES SA has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of -53.49%. 40.47% is the gross profit margin for YACIMIENTOS PETE FISCALES SA which we consider to be strong. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Regardless of the strong results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 6.12% trails the industry average. The debt-to-equity ratio is somewhat low, currently at 0.73, and is less than that of the industry average, implying that there has been a relatively successful effort in the management of debt levels. Even though the company has a strong debt-to-equity ratio, the quick ratio of 0.50 is very weak and demonstrates a lack of ability to pay short-term obligations.
