Peter Braig Share on twitter by Adele Ferguson A confidential poll of some of the country's biggest and most powerful fund managers rates the performance of the Woolworths board among the lowest of the ASX 100 companies.\nThe poll, conducted by a corporate governance group, canvassed fund managers on a range of areas, including the retailing giant's strategy, the board's understanding of the business and its oversight of management.\nThe explosive results come as The Australian Financial Review can reveal that while Woolworths has instructed a recruitment agency to find two new directors, many in the investment community expect those headhunters might also be helping the board choose a new chairman soon.\nThe Australian Financial Review wrote in June that Woolies was embarking on a global search for new directors , following the sudden departure of Ian Macfarlane from the board on March 31 with little explanation.\nHowever, there is also strong speculation among key fund managers that Woolworths chairman Ralph Waters will resign in 2015. Some believe it will be after the company releases its full-year earnings on August 28.\nThe pressure is mounting. Waters, who took a 32 per cent increase in director fees in 2014 to $700,000, was re-elected as chairman at 2014's annual meeting.\nIf Waters steps down, the big question is who will replace him? Will it be an internal candidate, such as Jillian Broadbent, Michael Ulmer, or David Mackay, or an external candidate?\nPopular internal choice The most popular internal choice for chairman among fund managers is non-executive director Christine Cross, who has a strong retail background. The stumbling block is she is based in Britain.\nThe spotlight was put squarely on the Woolworths board in April, when former Woolworths senior executive and supermarket boss Bill Wavish called for an overhaul of the board, which he said lacked hands-on retail experience .\nAs guest author for broker CLSA in a report titled \"Double loop dismissal\", Wavish said: \"Customers have moved, shareholders have bailed and the board and management are rightly in the firing line.\"\nHe went further: \"Who on the board takes responsibility for the decision to back Grant O'Brien over Greg Foran? I am reminded of the Abilene paradox, where a group of people collectively continues on a course of action that is counter to the preferences of the individuals, because no one puts their hand up.\"\nHis controversial comments prompted Woolworths to tell the Financial Review : \"Mr Wavish was last involved with Woolworths Ltd almost a decade ago. We are now a substantially larger and more complex business, operating in a more competitive and innovative retail market.\"\nAs Woolworths conducts a global search for a new chief executive , the debate is whether the successful candidate should have a groceries background. At an analyst briefing in June, Waters said the brief for the search hadn't been finalised but that it would be broad.\n\"The brief will be to find the best leader for Woolworths, whether that person is external or internal and irrespective of their backgrounds,\" he said. \"We're not going to constrain this to say it must be somebody who's got grocery experience or anything else.\"\nLike a lead balloon His comments went down like a lead balloon. One analyst asked Waters if he was prepared to step down. \"Clearly there is a lack of responsibility, autonomy and controls going on in this business. I was wondering if you're prepared to say, well, you're going to take responsibility for that and step down yourself and find perhaps a chairman that does have some industry experience within this sector?\"\nThat a top 10 company and its board can get itself into a situation where it is perceived so poorly by the investment community is breathtaking.\nWhat is even more stunning is that the board didn't have a succession plan in place and instead waited for the bleeding obvious to occur.\nThe watershed moment for this loss in confidence can be traced to February, when chief executive O'Brien slashed the retailer's full-year profit growth for 2015 from 4 to 7 per cent to as low as 1.8 per cent . The market was gobsmacked, given the chairman had told it weeks earlier that he stood by the group's original profit-growth target.\nBesides the company's credibility being smashed, investors finally realised that its ill-conceived, deeply flawed and costly hardware strategy was dragging down the entire empire.\nFast forward to today and the company has had a strategy day that failed to impress, a second profit guidance warning and a chief executive who has tendered his resignation but still turns up for work each day. The reason? The board agreed to retain him until July 2016 so that he can qualify for a generous defined benefits superannuation scheme. O'Brien told investors recently: \"I might be retiring as CEO but I'll be the CEO until such time as agreed with the board or there's a successor in place. When I get out of bed tomorrow I'll have the same focus I have today.\"\nThat might be so, but optics on this aren't good.\nPrivate equity giants circling Against this background, Woolworths' share price has dived 22 per cent in the past year â€“ underperforming the All Ordinaries Index by a whopping 24 per cent. It is one of the most shorted stocks by value in Asia, with more than 7.6 per cent of the stock shorted in the past week, and it is widely speculated that private equity giants are circling with a view to busting up the empire and running it more efficiently.\nThe overwhelmingly negative sentiment is no surprise, given the group's return on equity has gone backwards for the past eight years.\nIn a report written before the June profit growth downgrade, CLSA analyst David Quote: : \"Woolworths has taken a dramatic turn for the worse.\"\nHis comments relate to a survey CLSA conducted of 1400 Australians, called The Tribe Has Spoken 3. The survey was conducted before O'Brien announced his resignation and it makes the crushing conclusion that consumers are allocating fewer supermarket dollars towards the chain. \"In stark contrast to the success of Coles and Aldi, Woolworths has taken a dramatic turn for the worse. Not only has it lost ground on key measures of customer perceptions, the fall from grace has been broad-based, with the votes for its range, loyalty and fresh food retreating significantly.\"\nThe survey showed there was little recognition of the Masters brand. \"We expect life to remain difficult for Woolworths' key banners, which will add further pressure on management,\" the report says.\nThe biggest take out of the 2015 survey was that Coles gained an extra 241 votes relative to Woolworths' loss of 388 votes, which put Coles ahead of Woolworths for the first time. \"The scale of this switch in less than just two years is dramatic and speaks volumes for both the positive momentum across the Coles business and the fall from grace at Woolworths.\"\nThere is no doubt that Woolworths is on the precipice of change. When it releases its results in August they will be ugly and investors will be expecting this to be a line in the sand for bad news.\nA revamped board, a new chief executive and a smarter strategy will give Woolworths a fighting chance to stop the rot before it gets out of control.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@adele_ferguson"], "published": "2015-07-19T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T04:07:09.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
