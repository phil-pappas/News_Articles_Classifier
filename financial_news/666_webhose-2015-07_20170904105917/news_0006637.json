Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Education Minister Christopher Pyne has appointed Ian Watt, former secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, to review university research aimed at \"boosting commercial returns\".\nBut the review was received with frustration by opposition spokesman for education Kim Carr who said the government was long on reviews and short on action.\nMr Pyne said the review would make sure research provided \"maximum economic advantage and social benefits for the nation\".\n\"Australia undertakes a great deal of truly world-class research, but we lag behind comparable countries in how well we translate this into practical and commercial results,\" he said.\nThe minister said the review would look at maintaining university research quality, finding simpler and more transparent ways to allocate funding, and encouraging more collaboration between universities and industry.\nSenator Carr slammed the move. He said the review \"neglected to have a whole-of-government approach\" and initiating another probe into research was a \"very strange way to do business\".\n\"This now is the sixth review the government has launched into research policy. This is a government long on reviews and short on action,\" he said.\nSenator Carr also called the appointed working party an \"ad-hoc expert committee\" and questioned if they would represent \"the full ecosystem\" of research in Australia.\n Universities Australia head, Belinda Robinson, and Group of Eight chief executive, Vicki Thomson, both welcomed the review.\nMs Thomson said they were pleased block grant funding would be the focus of the review, and hoped it would look into covering the \"full cost\" of university research.\n\"I don't think you can underestimate the impact the discussion around the deregulation of university research fees has had on bringing to the fore the issue of research funding.\" She said the current funding approach was not sustainable.\nMs Robinson said the downturn in the resource industry and Australian traditional manufacturing, put new pressure on local research and innovation to help transform the economy.\n\"The timing is absolutely right for a review like this. It's an ambitious project, it's a big job to be done in a relatively tight time frame, but it's an excellent panel that's been appointed and I'm sure they can do the job,\" she said.\nA National Tertiary Education Union spokesman warned the review could devalue \"blue sky research\".\n\"It would be am mistake should the value of research be judged entirely on short-term financial returns\" the spokesman said.\nMs Thomson said the government had addressed that concern in the appointment of Professor Steven Schwartz, head of the Council for the Humanities, Arts and Social Science, to the working group.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-07-07T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T19:15:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
