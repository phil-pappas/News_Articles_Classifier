Jessica Hromas by Joyce Moullakis The paths of Chilean-based conglomerate Sigdo Koppers and local mining services group Bradken​ well and truly crossed four years ago. The latter was the underbidder on Belgium-based Magotteaux​, while Sigdo Koppers won the tussle to acquire the target.\nFast-forward to 2015, and following a tumultuous ride for Bradken, the embattled company and Sigdo Koppers are getting to know each other better, 17 days into a 60-day exclusivity period for merger negotiations. Management meetings for a potential marriage are in full swing in the United States.\nBut in some respects, the overarching pressures in the mining services sector and the staunch defence of multiple bids have also led Bradken back into the arms of its former private equity owner CHAMP, this time flanked by Sigdo Koppers.\nCHAMP floated the business in 2004, and often touted the turnaround of the company as a marquee transaction.\nIt was only 12 months ago, Pacific Equity Partners (PEP) and Bain Capital were stalking Bradken, and Kansas-based Koch Industries was also running the numbers. Bradken was in the cross-hairs.\nAfter making a preliminary offer in August, PEP and Bain then lobbed the $5.10-a-share non-binding and indicative proposal in December. Koch was secretly part of the second offer, but despite some engagement between the parties the financing wasn't secured and the transaction fell over early this year.\nBank of America-Merrill Lynch and Rothschild Australia were advising Bradken, alongside King & Wood Mallesons.\nIn January, CHAMP which had been assessing the situation for months, decided to act. Director Joel Thickins​ flew to Chile to meet representatives at Sigdo Koppers and some time later the parties jointly drafted in UBS, dubbing the transaction Project Tabasco. Given the public nature of any transaction CHAMP chief John Haddock was also on deck.\n The mining and resources industry was under immense strain, and the scope of the downturn was unknown. Bradken's February earnings results were marred by losses, a write down of assets and goodwill as well as restructuring costs.\nBradken's board, led by former NSW premier Nick Greiner, and its advisers also knew they had to act as balance sheet pressures increased.\nThere were a handful of options on the table including hybrid issuance or a heavily discounted non-renounceable rights issue – which was the least favoured option. The board was, however, cognisant of the disastrous Arrium capital raising just months earlier which was still raw with investors.\nThe clock was ticking for Bradken and the external situation was markedly worsening. There was no stronger evidence of that, and earnings headwinds confronting the company, than a revised tilt at Bradken by PEP and Koch in April at $2.50 a share. That offer was promptly batted away.\nBank of America Merrill Lynch, a long-term adviser of Bradken, had Gautam Chari and Grant Chamberlain on hand while Rothschild's point men were Gareth Cope and Chris Foreman.\nFurther complications For Greiner, who joined the Bradken board in 2004, complications were also again arising due to his many corporate roles. He sits on the Rothschild Australia Council of Advisors, and is deputy chairman of CHAMP, meaning potential conflicts of interests abounded. He extricated himself from negotiations when CHAMP revved up its intentions, but there was no doubt the multifaceted links created grey areas, added complexity and protocols. Independent director Peter Richards was tasked with leading any negotiations.\nThings stepped up a notch when Sigdo Koppers chief Juan Pablo Aboitiz​ flanked by his finance boss Gonzalo Cavada​ flew into Sydney the week commencing May 18.\nAs the negotiations were getting to the pointy end, key negotiating responsibility from the advisory perspective was handed to Rothschild. As Bradken's stock continued to be pummelled, the company felt it needed to act decisively before June 30.\nTensions were high and there were varied opinions on the potential outcomes. In early to mid June it appeared an transaction was getting close. Michael Barker and Jason Watts of Mallesons were given a term sheet and told to document the new proposal in the form of a $70 million redeemable convertible preference share (RPS) issue.\nAs the documents were being prepared, the market was hit with another piece of contentious Bradken information. After a report in Street Talk, Bradken strangely outlined its succession planning for the retirement of chief of 18 years Brian Hodges. He is staying on while a search is conducted, and no successor was announced. The Bradken camp went to great lengths to say the deal had no bearing on the timing.\nJune 25 arrived – as did the all familiar Bradken trading halt – on the back of Street Talk revealing details of a CHAMP and Sigdo Koppers investment.\nThe RPS, would occur at strike price of $2 a share, and convert to equity therefore cutting net debt to about $350 million. But instead of relief in the market, investors were in a tailspin that the deal was priced lower than the PEP-Koch offer and were concerned the transaction did not go far enough to fix the problem of the company's debt pile and balance sheet.\nThe stock slumped to six-year lows of $1.07.\nThen there was the issue of the blocking stake that would emerge under the proposal. Bradken was again being peppered with tough questions about its dealings. Two years ago, Greiner had some sheen restored to his battered reputation when the Federal Court set aside court orders against him for bid rigging and false and misleading conduct.\nOn Wednesday, Bradken was forced to reaffirm its earnings guidance, which saw the shares bounce. The stock finished the week at $1.35.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:05:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
