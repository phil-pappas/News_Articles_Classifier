That was lower than what most analysts had expected after the steady hiring gains of the past year. \n\"While the data were mixed in June, on balance, it disappointed market expectations due to ongoing softness in average hourly earnings growth,\" they said. \nMarkets interpreted the data as lessening the likelihood the Federal Reserve would begin hiking rates in September, ANZ economists said. \nAt 0830 AEST on Friday, the September 2015 10-year bond futures contract was trading at 96.880 (implying a yield of 3.120 per cent), up from 96.845 (3.155 per cent) on Thursday. \nThe September 2015 three-year bond futures contract was at 97.900 (2.100 per cent), up from 97.870 (2.130 per cent). \nKEY MOVEMENTS: \n* CGS 5.5pct Jan 2018, 2.054%, unchanged from Thursday \n* CGS 4.25pct April 2026, 3.189%, unchanged \nSydney Futures Exchange prices: \n* September 2015 bill futures, 97.890 unchanged \n* December 2015 bill futures, 97.900, from 97.910 \n(*Closes taken at 1630 AEST previous local session) \nSource: IRESS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T03:38:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
