There has been no stay. Why is the ban not being implemented,\" Justice Manmohan asked the counsel for ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd which operates app-based cab services under the name of Ola.\nOn January 1, Delhi government had banned the operation of app-based taxi services till they comply with the guidelines of Radio Taxi Scheme of 2006 which was recently amended.\nREAD ALSO: App-based cabs make a comeback\nThe court, however, said it will pass interim orders on Wednesday when it might also put in place a temporary mechanism for running of the company, while it continues to hear the matter.\nIt said the matter needs to be heard as \"it seems at first blush that the rules of the policy are not in tune with ground level reality\".\nThe court, during arguments, observed that it cannot remain a \"bystander\" while the company \"pollutes the city\" as its taxis operate on diesel which is not a clean fuel.\nREAD ALSO: App-based cab services running in Delhi despite ban\nJustice Manmohan also observed that the company was taking an \"extreme stand\" that it was \"not amenable to any condition\", instead of taking a balanced view and warned that he will shut them down if they take this \"strident position\" and do not follow the law.\n\"If you are going to take this strident position, not follow the law, I will completely shut you down. I will enforce the January 1 order,\" he said.\nThe judge also observed that the company was acting as if it was above the law and said if needed he will \"bring them down to Mother Earth\".\nREAD ALSO: Delhi govt bans Uber and all app-based cab services\nThe company earned the court's displeasure after it changed lawyers and had sought time for taking instructions after addressing extensive arguments, and sought more time on Tuesday.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Ola Cabs,Delhi High Court,Delhi Ban on App-Based Cabs,Ban on App-Based Cab Services,ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-07-29T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:58:28.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
