Photo: AP\nGoogle is already one of the largest companies in the world, and has just made one of the largest stock market moves ever.\nThe surge meant Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin added more than $US4 billion to their individual fortunes on Friday.\nThe internet giant reported strong second-quarter results on Thursday , sending its stock climbing. Google's market capitalisation, already around $US403 billion ($544 billion), rose some $US65 billion on Friday to finish at $US468.3 billion, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nGoogle also helped power the Nasdaq to a record high for the second straight session , jumping more than 0.9 per cent to 5,210.14 on Friday.\nThe fortunes of Page and Brin are up 24 per cent this year, an increase of about $US7 billion each, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Google chairman Eric Schmidt, who owns 1.3 per cent of the company, has increased his fortune 22 per cent this year, rising $US1.8 billion to $US10.1 billion.\n\"People should take away that Google is a stronger and healthier company than what the Street had previously understood,\" said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W Baird & Co. \"Both Google and Facebook are benefiting from these secular growth trends, which is really moving advertising dollars online from offline. There's still plenty of growth left for both companies.\"\nIt has been a good week for US tech stocks.\nFacebook share were up more than $US5 this week, jumping $US4.12 on Friday. The company's co-founder Mark Zuckerberg's shareholding is up 21 per cent this year to $US41.6 billion.\nThe rise for US technology stocks also lifted Amazon.com about 9 per cent this week, making founder Jeff Bezos the top-performing billionaire among the world's 400 richest people, according to the index.\nThe Seattle-based company reported day-over-day worldwide order growth of 266 percent on Wednesday as it celebrated its 20th anniversary with a one-day sales promotion it called Prime Day. More new members tried the Amazon Prime service on July 15 than on any single day in Amazon history, the company reported.\nBezos has added $US14.5 billion to his fortune in 2015, a rise of 51 per cent. The increase pushed the US dollar gain for the technology billionaire past Wang Jianlin, China's richest person. Wang's fortune has risen $US14.4 billion year-to-date, a 57 per cent increase.\nGoogle's Class A stock traded above $US700 for the first time on Friday since the company conducted a stock split last year. The combined gains include Google Inc.'s Class A and non-voting Class C shares.\nGoogle's results had fallen short of Wall Street estimates for six straight quarters, but the California-based company reported a bigger-than-expected profit on Thursday.\nInvestors were also pleased that the search engine giant seems serious about cutting down on expenses, particularly on costly \"moonshot\" projects.\nGoogle's Class A shares gained $US97.84, or 16.3 per cent, to close at $US699.62. Google's Class C shares rose 16.1 per cent to $US672.93.\nAP, Bloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:27:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
