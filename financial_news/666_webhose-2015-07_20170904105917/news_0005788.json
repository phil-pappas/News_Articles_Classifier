Meanwhile, guests from Utah, the state with the lowest average gift, gave just $57.\nThese state-by-state discrepancies may be due, in part, to different norms in different parts of the country, says Jeffrey Beil, the CEO of Tendr. In the Northeast, where in some cases cash gifts have been acceptable for longer, gifts are higher, while they tend to be lower in the more traditional Midwest. It could also have something to do with income levels in the states: Many of the states with the highest, and lowest, median incomes also gave the most, and least, amount of cash, respectively. And, of course, the data didn’t come from a randomly selected group of wedding guests across the nation — instead, they were a group of Tendr users -- so that could skew the results a bit.\nBrides and grooms hoping to maximize the amount of cash they get should consider the season: Wedding guests give significantly more cash to a bride and groom who get married in spring (particularly March) -- traditionally the start of wedding season -- than in any other season. Guests gave March couples 36% more cash ($194) than those who were married in September, the month with the lowest cash gifts. “It’s higher at the beginning of the season,” says Beil. “I think there might be some wedding fatigue.”\nThat shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who’s been a guest at a wedding in recent years, as simply attending these affairs is getting pricier. The average cost to attend a wedding as a guest has jumped from $539 in 2013 to $673 in 2015, according to the 2015 American Express Spending & Saving Tracker . When you’re spending money like that just on one wedding, and you have multiple weddings to attend, you no doubt feel a little less generous as time goes on.\n ", "external_links": ["http://about.americanexpress.com/news/sst/report/2015-04_Spend-and-Save-Tracker.pdf", "https://tendr.com/"], "published": "2015-07-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T03:30:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
