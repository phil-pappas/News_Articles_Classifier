Ryan Stuart Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Cranston Australia's property funds under management have reached the highest level since the financial crisis in 2009 with $285 billion but there is little need to be concerned with levels of leverage still well beneath the levels recorded last decade.\nThe Property Investment Research annual fund management survey reveals growth in like-for-like property funds reached 8 per cent over the year fuelled by cheap credit but also strong returns and an expansion of offerings across new areas such as healthcare, retirement and retail.\nPIR managing director Dinesh Pillutla said that consistently low levels of leverage also suggested balance sheet management remained conservative following the global financial crisis. Leverage now stands at 29 per cent down from 42 per cent in 2009.\n\"As the cost of debt has lowered there has also been more offshore investors wanting an increased piece of the real estate pie here in Australia,\" Mr Pillutla said.\n\"The low level of leverage may also reflect the increased participation of pension funds, whose managers prefer lower leverage.\"\nMr Pillutla said that one of the clearest indicators for such steady growth in funds management was also the attractive spread between property yields and bond yields. The survey notes that median capitalisation rates have also tightened 30 to 50 basis points this year indicating higher values for property.\nCharter Hall joint managing director David Harrison said he expected gearing levels to stay conservative as investment returns remained favourable.\n\"Yields have been so attractive people have not had to enhance them with leverage,\" Mr Harrison said.\n \"So my view is that you won't see any major change in gearing.\"\nCharter Hall, which has been a stand out in funds management growing its assets under management from $3.5 billion in 2010 to $13 billion currently, expects steady growth as a greater diversity of product comes to the market.\n\"The upward trajectory will continue through 2016 as new products are created across all sectors in property,\" Mr Harrison said.\n\"The growth so far has been relatively modest and we are a long way from the peak.\"\nThe PIR survey noted that while real estate investment trusts had traditionally dominated the survey, in recent years they have lost ground to the unlisted wholesale sector. Currently, A-REITs account for circa 47 per cent of assets under management versus 41 per cent for unlisted wholesale funds.\nThere has also been a major contraction in the number of funds to just over 350 now from 650 in 2009 when managers such as Centro, Becton, APGF still operated major numerous property funds.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/102874628957085545973", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/mcranston1"], "published": "2015-07-01T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T18:03:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
