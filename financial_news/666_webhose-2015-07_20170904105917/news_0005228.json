Granted, most of it is simple misunderstandings or misunderstood intentions that escalate into unnecessary situations. If drivers had a simple way to communicate intentions with something other than a turn signal and finger, I think there could be less road rage . \nSo, I often wonder what driving would be like if it had some of the same elements as flying. What if drivers could communicate via radio? I surmise that a good portion of road rage is instigated by a simple misunderstanding. Have you ever heard of sky rage? I haven't. \nHow do pilots operate so well together? Airports with air traffic control towers provide specific instructions for aircraft. They tell the aircraft how to enter the airspace, what runway to use, and provide takeoff and landing clearances. Pilots simply listen to the instructions, repeat them to the controller, and then comply. \nHowever, the general public probably doesn't realize that most airports in the United States do not have control towers. How do pilots know what to do? Simply stated, they utilize their training and use simple courtesy. \nPilots learn during training that there are preferred ways to enter and depart from an airport. Using the preferred techniques, combined with radio communications, allows for a generally seamless day of flying. Listening to an airport's radio frequency will reveal conversations similar to the following: \n\"Cessna seven-two x-ray is 5 miles east of the airport and will be entering the pattern for runway two.\" \n\"Piper two tango romeo is on the left downwind for runway two.\" \n\"Beechcraft one alpha foxtrot is on the crosswind for runway two and I have the piper in sight. I'll give way.\" \n\"Piper two tango romeo, I'm about to take off, can you extend your pattern?\" \n\"Sure, no problem, two tango romeo is extending the pattern for departing traffic.\" \nSimple, courteous, and no hurt feelings for being cut off. Are pilots as a rule friendlier? I can't confirm or deny that. Does effective communication alleviate conflict? More than likely. \nIf a person is trying to merge onto a highway and needs to get across several lanes in order to reach a turnoff, would a vocal query to another driver allow that person to merge? A car comes upon a slower moving car in the left lane. If the faster driver told the slower one that his wife is in labor, and he is in a hurry, would the slower one graciously move over? If specified radio frequencies were available at certain points along a highway, and cars were equipped with radios, would there be less problems? \nThink of the last time you saw an inoperative traffic light. A police officer was most likely directing traffic. Did you see any instances of discourtesy? Granted, the officer is a recognized authority with the added likelihood of a ticket or worse for non-compliance. However, that officer is trained to effectively communicate with a whistle and hand motions. Again, I use the concept of effective communication. \nI'm not advocating putting radios in cars, but again, I often wonder if common courtesy and effective communication would alleviate more driving issues. So, next time you see me merge in front of you with less than a two second distance, sorry for the lack of judgment. If I'm going too slow in the right lane when you're trying to get to the beach, I'm not out to personally slow you down. If you tailgate me so close that I can see the blemish that your makeup missed, I will understand that you are preoccupied. I am also preoccupied. I'm trying to get to work so I can enter the safety of flight. \nDrive safe!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T16:40:17.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
