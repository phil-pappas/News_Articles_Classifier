What we are saying is that the conditionality that has been presented by the Greeks are simply not enough at this stage.\"\n\"We need to have clear commitments, clear conditionality and clear proof that those conditions will be implemented at the end of the day. I am still hopeful but I think we are very far away from the type of conditionality we need.\"\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION VICE-PRESIDENT VALDIS DOMBROVSKIS\n\"Discussions were quite complicated so we hope for more progress today. I think it's utterly unlikely the European Commission will get a mandate to start formal negotiations as regards a third programme or ESM programme today. But I think the Eurogroup can prepare and provide input for discussions of the leaders later today.\"\nCYPRIOT FINANCE MINISTER HARRIS GEORGIADES\n\"Greece needs an ambitious reform plan and that is what we should mandate the institutions to negotiate today. (Asked if Grexit is out of the way) Definitely yes.\"\nAUSTRIAN FINANCE MINISTER HANS JOERG SCHELLING\n\"We didn't talk about Grexit. As I said yesterday, we have to made adjustments and guarantees for the implementation. With the adjustments we have made a step forward but not with the guarantees.\"\n\"There could be alternative proposals which we put forward to the heads of government. I am always optimistic but it is a very very difficult negotiations because there are many points we have not agreed in between the euro group and in between with Greece.\" (Reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek, Foo Yun Chee , Phil Blenkinsop)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T11:43:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
