Instead, they want parking on local streets be restricted to residents only. \nMayor Len Brown has hailed the SkyPath as a \"game-changer\" for Auckland. The council received more than 10,000 submissions on the resource consent, a New Zealand record, with more than 95 percent in favour. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T04:46:34.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
