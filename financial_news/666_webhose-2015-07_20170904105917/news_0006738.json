PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 01:01, Wed, Jul 22, 2015 GETTY More customers are leaving banks that they're not happy with \nAlmost 132,000 people left the troubled bank last year through the free to use Current Account Switch Service (CASS). Taking into account new openings, Barclays lost around 100,000 customers overall - the highest of any of the biggest banks. Earlier this year, the bank refreshed its current account offering in a bid to win customers back. But it has remained shrouded in a cloud of scandal after recently landing a huge £1.53billion fine over its involvement in the rigging of global currency markets. Barclays also admitted this year that it was putting aside another £150million for customer redress for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI).A spokesman for the bank said that the figures did not take account of openings outside of the service and that, in fact, it opens more accounts than it closes on a monthly basis. He said: \"Today’s figures illustrate how important it is to continue to evolve our products and services for our customers. \"We have recently launched Barclays Blue Rewards to give new customers a great reason to switch to us and existing customers a great reason to stay and we are delighted with the level of interest to date.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T08:33:30.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
