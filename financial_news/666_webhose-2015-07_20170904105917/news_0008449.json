Obama's plan to visit the country proves a manifestation of this fact. \"Obama's visit to Ethiopia would be a first high level visit since Richard Niksson's visit as a vice President in 1957,\" he noted. \nThe president's planed sojourn here is meaningful to Ethiopia. It is counted as a vote of confidence tantamount to extending hails for the fast economic growth Ethiopia is making in the past two decades. Presidents and leaders of various countries have visited Ethiopia hence Obama's planned visit will give an opportunity for the country to showcase its potentials. \nThe president's visit will help Ethiopia to leverage its socioeconomic potential to the international community. The visit sheds light on Ethiopia's success to remain peaceful and secured in the highly volatile eastern Africa region. \nPreviously, the bilateral ties of the two countries were confined to humanitarian aids, however with Ethiopia's path-breaking move of unleashing potential towards a remarkable growth, the ties have blossomed to economic and political ones. \nThe two countries' ties are glued in terms of economy, political relation, peace and security.

But the level of emphasis varies according to the countries' economic development. In fact, democracy is a matter of survival for Ethiopians and as such the incumbent has a firm stance on the matter. However democracy is not something that could take shape overnight. \nSome claims of human right violations at different levels could crop up. However, slowly but surely these problems would be addressed. Again, the differences is the level of emphasis the two countries accord to democracy, otherwise the two countries do not have a diametrically opposite difference, as Ethiopia attaches due attention to the pillars of democracy. \nAsked about the public's discomfort that the issue of homosexuality will be raised during the president's planned visit, the Director General responded that as the issue has never been a concern to our people it will not be tabled for discussion.
