Louise Kennerley Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro A new Australian venture capital fund has been created to capture the estimated $400 million of Chinese visa money that has been designated to back technology start-ups.\nThe fund, Sapien Ventures, founded by Victor Jiang, is seeking to raise $50 million from predominantly Chinese investors that must invest one-tenth of the $5 million required to obtain a significant investor visa to live in Australia.\nJiang, an established tech entrepreneur, plans to harness his network in Silicon Valley, and among Chinese investment fund channels, to steer this enormous pool of wealth into viable big bang ventures with ambitions to replicate the Silicon Valley ecosystem down under.\nThe rise of Silicon Valley's \"Aussie mafia\" – a small but powerful group of Antipodean ex-pats in the Bay area that has made hundreds of millions through start-ups and exits – shows Australia has the talent. But the fact that they needed to head to Silicon Valley to make it big is proof to Jiang that he needs to breed local entrepeneurs in the right environment to get the best result.\n\"In our little way we hope to bottle a little bit of that, take a capsule and bring it back to Australia, and catalyse the Australian ecosystem to be more like Silicon Valley,\" Jiang tells The Australian Financial Review.\nJiang says half of Sapien Ventures' investment advisory team will be based in Silicon Valley. It includes the start-up coach Founders Space in central San Francisco that sees more than 100 start-ups a month.\nIts Silicon Valley's meritocracy, that has made it the epicentre of innovation and one where Antipodean start-up all stars such as Victoria Ransom and Bardia Housman have succeeded.\n\"In Silicon Valley you will see a tech billionaire talking to a broke uni student, with deep engrossing conversations about changing the world, and that doesn't happen elsewhere,\" Jiang says.\n He says that the billions of dollars of wealth created in Silicon Valley over several decades finds it way back into venture capital where \"the generation after entrepreneurs become investors back into that ecosystem\".\nBut the recently announced changes to the significant investor visa program are being billed as an opportunity to kick-start Australia's innovation ecosystem by capturing some of the billions of foreign money clamouring to buy access to Australia.\nThe changes, which came into effect on July 1, are intended to get high net worth capital to some sectors of the economy in need, such as venture funding. It will require $500,000 per $5 million of investment to be allocated to finance start ups. Based on estimates from research firm Basis Point of 400 to 800 visas being granted per year, this will see $200 million to $400 million designated for investment in venture capital, exceeding the $266 million invested in the sector in 2014.\nFundraising opportunities Already, Brisbane-based fund manager Blue Sky is set up to capture some of the funding through its venture capital fund. Sapien's Jiang, too, believes the changes will ensure there will be an abundance of fundraising opportunities to counter the limited interest among local institutional investors to allocate to venture capital.\n\"You have umpteen SIV fund managers – from the large institutions to the boutiques – but chances are they are more focused on property, bonds, listed equities. Venture capital is a very niche area. \"\nWhile many SIV applicants do regard the $5 million investment as little more than a ticket price to enter Australia, Jiang says these investors are savvy \"in the art and science of business and generating returns or they wouldn't be in that position\".\n\"They're rapidly gaining on the knowledge through the myriad of family offices and private bankers that are pitching to them en masse. They have an army of private bankers pitching to them to instil that sophistication.\"\nAs to what he'll back, Jiang is literally banking on disruption in financial services, while his team's expertise in the power of marketplace models that have allowed eBay, Uber and Airbnb to thrive means they're favourably disposed to these ventures.\n\"Every industry in the world will be gobbled up by marketplaces. Every type of transaction will be brokered through a massive and efficient marketplaces – it's writing on the wall for us.\"\nJiang is a believer in the unofficial mantra of Silicon Valley: \"ubiquity first, profits later\".\n\"We are of the opinion that scalable businesses should not aim to make a profit in the first three to five years of operations. You should reinvest every dollar of profit and outside capital to invest in gaining market share, invest those dollars to get the biggest market share possible, to achieve critical mass and economies of scale.\n\"That's why venture capital plays such a critical role and has worked so well for Silicon Valley.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-07-15T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:03:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
