But Microsoft is counting on tens or even hundreds of millions of people to download its latest release for free in the coming months.\nThe launch will be accompanied by a global marketing campaign for an event the company hopes will be pivotal -- both for its own future and for a vast audience of computer users around the world.\nWindows 10 is coming to PCs and tablets first, but it's also designed to run phones, game consoles and even holographic headsets. It has new features, a streamlined web browser called Edge and a desktop version of Cortana, the online assistant that is Microsoft's answer to Google Now and Apple's Siri.\nStill, the company insists Windows 10 will seem familiar to users of Windows 7, the six-year-old operating system still running on most PCs. Microsoft and PC makers want to erase the memory of the last big update, 2012's Windows 8, which alienated many with its jarring, unwieldy design.\nMicrosoft skipped the name Windows 9, as if to distance itself further from the last release. While many analysts believe Windows 8 made sagging PC sales even worse, it's unclear if Windows 10 will spur the industry back to growth.\nMicrosoft plans promotional events in several cities tomorrow, tied to a global ad campaign and a series of charitable donations. About 5 million people who enrolled in an earlier test program will be able to download Windows 10 right away.\nThe company is also offering Windows 10 as a free download, any time over the next year, to anyone who has the Home or Pro versions of Windows 7 or 8 (but not the Enterprise versions used by big organizations).\nSome may not get it the first day; Microsoft says it will deliver downloads in waves, to ensure things go smoothly, but it hasn't said how long that will take.\nRetailers such as Best Buy, Staples and Wal-Mart will have some desktops and laptops with Windows 10 already installed. More models are coming.\nThe company wants to get the new software on as many devices as possible. Microsoft needs a large pool of users to convince independent programmers that it's worth their time to build useful or entertaining apps for Windows 10 devices.\nCEO Satya Nadella says he wants to have 1 billion devices running Windows 10 in three years. Microsoft estimates there are 1.5 billion people who currently use some kind of Windows. Rather than charging them to upgrade, as Microsoft used to do, it's embracing the free download model pioneered by Apple and Google.\nFollow TOI Tech on Twitter >>> @ toi_tech\nLike TOI Tech on Facebook >>> TOI_tech Windows 10: 6 things to know of 7 Microsoft has taken the wraps off the latest version of its operating system Windows 10.\nThe company showcased more Windows 10 features and shared information related to its pricing at a recently concluded event. The essence of Windows 10 is its Continuum feature, which promises users a unified experience across various devices say PCs, tablets and smartphones. While this device-agnostic approach is key to Windows 10, the update also adds several other features.\nHere are six important things you should know about Microsoft Windows 10... Microsoft announced that Windows 10 will be free for customers running Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows Phone 8.1 if they upgrade in the first year after launch.\nWhile this comes as good news for Windows loyalists, it also means that Microsoft will shift to a subscription-based model for its flagship operating system. Microsoft's personalized virtual assistant and Apple Siri rival Cortana, will now be available on personal computers via Windows 10. Cortana made its debut on Windows Phone-powered mobile devices.\nThe Cortana bar will be placed next to the Start menu and will answer voice and text questions, search across the web and desktop, and bring notifications. Microsoftâ€™s new web browser will also have Cortana built-in and ready to help when users who need assistance. Microsoft also unveiled a new web browser code-named Spartan. It will be the successor to Internet Explorer and feature a new web-rendering engine.\nThe browser will offer distraction-free browsing, built-in note taking, annotating and sharing, and reading list features in addition to built-in support for the Cortana virtual assistant. It will also offer synchronisation across Windows devices. Microsoft is also bringing some features of its Xbox gaming console to Windows. It will allow gamers to see their games collection and chat with other gamers making the experience more social and interactive.\nIt will also offer Game DVR through which gamers will be able to share, comment and view gameplay clips. Users will be able to record clips while playing PC games. Users will also be able to stream games from their Xbox One console to their Windows 10 PCs. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias= Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/TOItech", "https://twitter.com/toi_tech", "http://ad.doubleclick.net/N7176/adi/TOI/TOI_ENT_ROS_ATF_Artical_Photo_300;sz=300x250;ord=", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-07-29T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:56:37.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
