For a country graduating through the early stages of economic development, growth in the industrial sector is essential for sustained long-term growth and poverty reduction. The structural economic transformation that involves the reallocation of workers from the poorly productive agriculture to more productive economic activities in manufacturing is an important step towards the creation of better-paying jobs. \nIn its effort to accelerate manufacturing growth, Ethiopia is implementing an ambitious Industrial Park program. Using this approach, the strategy hinges on attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the export-led and labor-intensive manufacturing sector. The imperative is to build on the country's agricultural foundations by moving toward new tradable activities in manufacturing that absorb large numbers of young and semi-skilled workers. \nSeveral challenges need to be addressed in order for Ethiopia to accelerate its structural transformation and significantly expand light manufacturing, which is vital for sustaining economic growth and development. \"Ethiopia's skills gap and constraints related to access to land, infrastructure, trade logistics, and customs regulations in private investment have hindered the acceleration to structural transformation, unlike in East Asia, where foreign direct investment was able to capitalize on a large pool of trainable labor, enabling investors to improve productivity while benefitting from low production costs,\" said Michael Geiger, Senior Country Economist. \nThe report provides the following policy recommendations which could contribute to the development of the manufacturing in Ethiopia: \nIncrease productivity through skills development. \nImprove access to finance for firms especially for SMEs \nAddress binding constraints including access to land and electricity. \nImprove tax administration and simplify the tax system. \nImprove trade logistics, customs procedures and trade regulations, to promote export and FDI. \nSimplify business entry regulations and processes to promote a dynamic and thriving business sector. \nUse a strategic and phased approach to develop Industrial Parks based on best international practices.
