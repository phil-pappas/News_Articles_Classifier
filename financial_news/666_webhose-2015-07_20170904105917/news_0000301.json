A few days after these negotiations we've now been given a mandate to redouble our efforts to get a socially just and economically sustainable solution to the Greek problem, without repeating the mistakes of the past which condemn the Greek economy to a period of never-ending impasse of austerity which trapped our economy in a recessionary vicious circle.\nLet me assure the house that, quite apart from the crisis, we will continue with our reform undertaken. Let's forget that for the past five years the Greek people have made a tremendous effort for adjustment but this has exhausted the resilience and the patience of the Greek people.\nWe demand an agreement with our neighbours but one which gives us a sign that we are on a long-lasting basis exiting from the crisis, which will demonstrate that there's light at the end of the tunnel.\nThe proposals we have made to our partners are credible reforms with an acceptable degree of burden sharing without recessionary effects. We need to ensure the medium term funding of our country with a development and growth programme because otherwise we won't exit from this crisis. Our prime objective must be to combat unemployment and to encourage entrepreneurship.\nPRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK\nOur inability to find an agreement may lead to the bankruptcy of Greece and the insolvency of its banking system. And for sure it will be most painful for the Greek people. I have no doubt that this will affect Europe, also in the geopolitical sense, if someone has any illusion that it will not, they are naive.\nThe stark reality is that we have only four days left to find an ultimate agreement. Until now I've avoided talking about deadlines but I have to say it loud and clear that the final deadline ends this week. All of us are responsible for the crisis and all of us have the responsibility to resolve it. As Plutarch once said: To find fault is easy, to do better is difficult. I hope doing better is not as difficult as Plutarch once thought. Let us prove him wrong.
