However, while consumers used to rely on newspaper-printed vouchers, or postal promotional letters, there has been a surge in shoppers using their mobile phones to download vouchers or access them through apps and emails. \nEagle Eye’s software also enables retailers to register patterns of shopping behaviour and adapt promotions accordingly. It can be used to combat fraud, as grocers often complain that money-off vouchers are easily photocopied and can be used on different brands of products, much to the chagrin of suppliers. \n“For us this is a game-changing move as it signals that this model works,” said Phill Blundell, chief executive of Eagle Eye. \"We will be taking charge of a third of the entire UK grocery market.\" \nEagle Eye software will be added to Sainsbury's tills \nEagle Eye already has an agreement with rival supermarket Asda but is prevented, at the moment, from striking a deal with Tesco due to its exclusive use of loyalty scheme Dunnhunmby . \nHowever, that could soon change as Tesco is understood to have received bids from WPP (LSE: WPP.L - news ) and private equity firm Advent for the Dunnhumby business. \n• Comment: Tesco should go for a rights issue rather than selling off its best assets \n“Tesco’s use of Dunnhunmby has given it the information about shopping behaviours, but we believe that this information should be available across the industry,\" said Mr Blundell. \nThe deal with Sainsbury’s means that Eagle Eye will process 20 million coupons every month from Asda and Sainsbury’s. \nThe group has already passed the one million mark for diners using its software to redeem vouchers at restaurants such as Pizza Express and Prezzo. \nSince listing on AIM last year, Eagle Eye’s shares have risen 24pc, valuing the business at £44m. Sir Terry owns a 10pc stake in the business and is a non-executive director. He served as CEO of Tesco for 14 years until 2011.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T23:37:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
