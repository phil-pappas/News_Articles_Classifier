Oxford Economics thinks so.\n“There is a risk that Chinese short-term rates will approach the zero ‘lower bound’ by 2016,” said Adam Slater, an economist at Oxford, in a research note Tuesday.\nSlater believes growth in China is running at a pace closer to 4% to 5%, well below the official Beijing estimate of 7% growth.\nThe raft of monetary policy measures adopted by the country since late 2014 have had only a “moderate impact,” and monetary conditions are still tight in large part because of a strengthening currency, Slater said.\n“We estimate currency depreciation of 10-15% would be needed to return monetary conditions to those prevailing 6-12 months ago,” Slater wrote.\nBut this seems to be “off the agenda” due to “prestige consideration” as well as concerns about financial stability, he said.\nChina is pushing to have the yuan included in the International Monetary Fund’s basket of currencies. The move would be a symbol of China’s emergence as a global economic power, analysts said.\nEven zero rates may not be enough to spark the economy. Other policy options, including monetary-financed deficit spending, may be needed.\nReal short-term interest rates in China, as measured by the prime loan rate deflated by the CPI, have eased to around 3.7% from 4.5% late last year.\n.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T00:50:15.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
