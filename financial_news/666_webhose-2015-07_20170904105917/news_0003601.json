(File photo: Bill Klotz) Sustainable: Resiliency is next stage for building design By: Frank Jossi July 7, 2015 6:55 am 0 \nEditor’s note: The Sustainable feature runs the first Tuesday of each month. \nResiliency is fast becoming the buzzword in architecture and construction as the next evolution of sustainability. \nTrying to figure out just what it means, however, is a challenge. What does it mean that a building is resilient? What are the standards for resiliency? \nEnter Perkins + Will senior project architect Doug Pierce . During the last two-and-a-half years Pierce developed a set of resiliency standards as the chief investigator for the Washington, D.C.-based Capital Markets Partnership . \n“Resiliency is the next step in the entire green ecological design framework,” said Pierce, who is based in Minneapolis. “It’s important because over the past 30 years we have not acted with foresight relative to the science on climate change or the knowledge that oil and water are finite resources.” \nJust take a look at the news to see the impact of climate change, he said, from torrential flooding to drought, from wild fires to powerful tornados. The debate over climate change has largely ended, Pierce points out, as business and government having begun seriously planning for it. \nThe result of his work is “RELi,” a new ratings system in a pilot stage that incorporates other certification standards while adding in resiliency measures. Two of the certification programs are based in Washington, D.C. — the United States Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design and the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure’s Envision program. \nSome ideas were pulled from Minnesota’s own SB 2030 Energy Standard and the Living Green Challenge . The RELi “Resiliency Action” list Pierce created has more than 200 actions, many from LEED and Envision. About 60 actions focus on resiliency, in particular hazard preparedness and hazard mitigation. \nRELi’s guidelines are available at c3livingdesign.org, the C3 Living Design Project , which describes the program in great detail. Mike Italiano, CEO of Capital Markets and founder of the U.S. Green Building Council, said the impact of global warming is already being taken into account by the insurance industry and financial institutions. They want to support and invest in more sustainable communities that can withstand increasingly unpredictable and dangerous weather. \nThe idea behind RELi is to provide architects and builders with guidelines to follow that are not imposed by the government yet allow communities to better cope with potential disasters. “RELi is really focused on creating a set of building regulations that we’re hoping the design community and local governments start using,” Italiano said. “It’s going to be political, very political, but we think that people will see its value when they start using it.” \nPierce isn’t the only local advocate. The University of Minnesota’s Center for Sustainable Building Research recently submitted a grant proposal focused on resiliency to the school’s “Grand Challenge” program. \nRichard Graves, the center’s director, wrote in his proposal that Minnesota needs greater resiliency planning as global warming begins changing urban and rural communities. \nPierce has presented his concept for RELi several times, including at an American Institute of Architects-Minnesota luncheon in June. He’s well-known in the sustainability community, having served for years on the Green Building Council’s local board and the AIA-Minnesota’s Committee on the Environment, having taught college level courses and, as an architect, leading the design of more than 3 million square feet of LEED-certified buildings. \nItaliano said the architect was “invaluable” and was “key in developing RELi.” Pierce offered some insights recently about the program. \nQ: Why do we need a program like this now? \nA: We haven’t taken action on any of these issues and the future is now. It’s not just mitigating the damage caused by a weather event. It’s about adapting to climate change. Resiliency is more important than it ever was. It we don’t do something now it will be beyond our ability to adapt. \nQ: How would the certification work? \nA: RELi would be used by an accredited practitioner, such as an environmental professional, who certifies projects. It’s like LEED for Homes. \nQ: Many architects have complained about the costs of certification. \nA: The certification fees won’t be as challenging. We want to be as collaborative with other programs, like LEED, as much as we possibly can. We don’t want to compete with them. We want to add vitality to those programs. \nQ: The countries and states really getting hit by climate change are on the coasts. Do we really need to worry in Minnesota? \nA: Yes, on the top of the list is extreme rain. Extreme rain events have increased 37 percent since 1950 in Minnesota. Southeast Minnesota is the prime example — they have had three overlapping, 1,000-year rain events in eight years. Duluth had a 1,000-year rainfall in 2012. \nQ: Anything else? \nA: Wind and hail. The insurance industry is saying we’ll see wind speeds increasing to 20 miles an hour with more frequency. The number of tornados is down but what’s up is outbreaks — eight or 10 tornados together, or more. Rising temperatures and humidity may bring more tornados since they feed off that. \nQ: How do you deal with that in the architecture of a building? \nA: The first question in a building’s design is whether we are going to try to manage a 1,000-year rain event, as we do now for a 100-year event. The answer is no. We will accept some level of damage and use conventional strategies, such as ponding and infiltration. We might allow for some flooding, say, of a parking lot. \nIn a tornado area we might not have curtain walls. The strategy is about reducing clients’ risk for big insurance claims and trying to make sure they will have business continuity after a major weather event. \nQ: What’s an example of a resilient building? \nA: One of the best is Mercy Hospital in Joplin, Missouri. Several people were killed in the hospital during a tornado (in 2011). The building was destroyed. They used resiliency strategies in the new hospital in response to a tornado — some of the windows are hardened enough to take a projectile going 250 mph. They improved the durability of corridors so they could become a safe haven. \nQ: How much more did it cost than if it had been conventionally built? \nA: Three to 4 percent. But there’s some payback on lower insurance rates and the good public relations it generated. Mercy has also worried about getting its clientele back because of safety concerns. So having built a resilient hospital helped greatly with those issues.
