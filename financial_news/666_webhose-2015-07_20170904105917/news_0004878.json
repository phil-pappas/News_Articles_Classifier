It's all lessons. It's just some lessons are more expensive than others.\"\nWestpac head of digital business banking Kalpana Gee doesn't use the term \"failure\", because she knows how much it hampers new ideas.\n\"Fear of failure is almost like a mindset where you've made the stake so high you become paralysed with it. That stops innovation. You're too worried that what you're delivering is not going to work.\"\nFor many organisations, that fear is driven by the bottom line, where the concern about expensive mistakes can make the leadership reluctant to change. Ms Gee said the trick to convincing traditionalists is to capture their imagination.\nShe now prefers butcher's paper and sketches, rather than business plans to pitch new ideas.\n\"If you can get people to visualise it, all of a sudden they will believe what you believe, versus reading a business case; you're still just looking at the bottom line.\"\nMs Gee had the opportunity to test her methods for encouraging innovation, establishing an Innovation Challenge between Westpac and incubator BlueChilli, to find start-ups with fresh ways of servicing first the real estate sector, and for the most recent round, agribusiness.\nIt's looking for ideas that could completely change the way Australian farmers and producers live and work.\nWestpac also sent a team to work at BlueChilli for five weeks, tasked with finding disruptive opportunities in business banking.\n\"We acted in a venture capital role to test and push them â€¦ It's so different from the way a bank would usually do it. They did incredibly well. I don't think we would have thought about that idea had we not done this.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T14:08:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
