Negotiators from the creditors, known collectively as the troika, have not set foot in Athens for more than a year as hostility has grown between the two sides. \nGreece had said on Thursday that negotiators would fly in to Athens on Friday to begin the talks, but this swiftly became \"in the coming days\", according to a European Commission spokeswoman, with the location of the talks and offices for the creditors apparently among the sticking points. \n\"The mission is being prepared. We are still discussing a location as we have to find an accessible place to work, near the ministries,\" a source close to the negotiations said. \nThe two sides are under enormous pressure to hammer out the rescue deal before August 20, when Athens is scheduled to make a loan repayment of 3.2 billion euros to the ECB that it cannot currently afford. \n- 'A difficult path ahead' - \nThe IMF warned on Thursday that finalising the deal, which is conditioned on Greece implementing painful reforms, would not be easy. \nThe Fund took part in the two previous bailouts but has said it will only participate this time around if European creditors reduce Athens' debt burden to a level it considers \"sustainable\". \n\"Clearly it's a difficult path ahead, we're just at the beginning of the process,\" said IMF spokesman Gerry Rice. \nIn the early hours of Thursday, the Greek parliament passed further reforms demanded by creditors for the talks to begin, including changes to the justice system, a bank deposit protection scheme and measures to shore up the liquidity of Greece's banks. \nThe bill passed by a resounding 230 votes out of the 298 members of parliament present, after a five-hour debate that once again exposed deep divisions in the governing Syriza party over whether to accept more austerity. \nWhile the result is a victory for Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in that he managed to convince parliament to back him on the bailout, he did suffer a major rebellion from Syriza MPs for the second time in a week -- prompting analysts to predict he may be forced to call early elections. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook US stocks tumble as weak Chinese data rattles Wall Street AFP \nUS stocks sank deep in the red Friday as weak Chinese factory data and US home sales numbers outweighed Amazon's …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T02:02:34.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
