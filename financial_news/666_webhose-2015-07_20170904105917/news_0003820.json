Bluetongue isn't harmful for human consumption but can be deadly for animals. \nSeveral Chinese investors have been jostling for an advantage ahead of a likely deal. \nHailang Group earlier this year bought more than A$40 million of cattle stations in southern Queensland. Yiang Xiang Assets purchased a smaller property for around A$11.5 million. \nChongqing Agriculture Investment Group Co Ltd said earlier this year it was looking to buy up to A$100 million worth of cattle stations within the next year. \nThere's also interest more broadly across agriculture as China's rising middle class spurs demand for quality Australian produce. \nWarriner said the Wollogorang and Wentworth stations had development potential beyond cattle breeding. \n\"There is scope to expand the current operation, enabling increased pasture utilisation and therefore an increase in carrying capacity,\" Warriner said. \n($1 = 1.3574 Australian dollars) (Editing by Christopher Cushing)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T06:55:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
