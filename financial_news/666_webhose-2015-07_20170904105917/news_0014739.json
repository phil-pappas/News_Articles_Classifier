More Paid-for pensions service criticised \nThe measure follows a decision by the Greek government to impose capital controls which will see the country’s banks shut until at least July 6 and cash withdrawals limited to €60 a day. \nInternational payments into Greece are exempt from these restrictions, the Department for Work and Pensions said, adding that UK state pension and public service pension payments would continue to be made into Greek accounts “in the usual way”. \nHowever, the DWP added that the situation remained “fast moving and uncertain and the government recognises customers may be concerned. Public sector pension schemes, including those covering former NHS staff, teachers and police, would attempt to contact those who draw their payments from a Greek bank account, “to talk through the options”. \nThose wanting more information should contact the DWP call-centre on +44 191 218 7777 from Monday to Friday from 8am to 6pm BST or from Saturday 8am to 4pm BST.
