Airbus did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nStill, concerns about the closed Zodiac facility, one of more than 30 Zodiac has in the U.S., reveal how vulnerable the aircraft industry is to disruptions in the overall supply chain.\nBoeing and Airbus are churning out more than 100 jetliners a month, a record pace aimed at reducing an eight-year backlog of orders.\nTheir assembly plants rely on a steady, just-in-time flow of millions of parts shipped from thousands of suppliers around the globe. Some parts come from only one or two suppliers.\nZodiac's prepreg factory supplies at least five other Zodiac factory facilities in Washington state and California that make seat shells and cabin interiors.\nEarlier this year, Zodiac failed to deliver seats on time, causing late deliveries of Boeing and Airbus aircraft.\nThe costly error drew a public scolding from plane makers and forced Zodiac to warn in June that its profits would suffer.\nPlane makers Bombardier and Embraer were also affected by the earlier problems at Zodiac's cabin interiors business.\nOn Thursday, Bombardier said Zodiac supplies its Q400 turboprop and CRJ programs, and that it did not expect production would be affected by the plant shutdown. Embraer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
