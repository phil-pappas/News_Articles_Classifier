Australian shares (.AXJO) fell 0.9 percent and South Korea's Kospi (.KS11) shed 1 percent. \nInvestor sentiment was also cautious ahead of a two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting beginning later today where some investors believe the Fed's rate-setting Open Market Committee will make its case for hiking rates as early as September. \nOvernight, the Dow (.DJI) dropped 0.7 percent and Nasdaq (.IXIC) fell 1 percent while share indices in Frankfurt and Paris tumbled more than 2.5 percent. \nIn currencies, the dollar was on the back foot at 123.12 yen (JPY=) as safe-haven assets were boosted by market jitters, offsetting upbeat U.S. durable good orders data. \nThe euro was little changed at $1.1091 (EUR=) after surging to a two-week high of $1.1129 overnight thanks to a bullish Ifo survey of German business sentiment. \nBonds were the solitary bright spot in Asia with U.S. Treasuries and Japanese government debt standing tall in a sea of red across stock markets as investors dumped riskier bets. \nTen-year Japanese bond yields held firm at 0.40 percent, from 0.55 percent two weeks earlier, a large move for the markets while 10-year U.S. Treasuries held at 2.2 percent. \nOil struggled at four-month lows after the Chinese stock market crash fueled worries the world's biggest energy consumer may cut back and as more evidence emerged of a global crude supply glut. [O/R] \nU.S. crude (CLc1) was down nearly a percent at $46.98 a barrel, near $46.91, its lowest since late March. \nCopper (CMCU3), heavily influenced by demand from key consumer China, languished near a six-year low of $5,164 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange. \nThe broader Thomson Reuters CRB commodities index (.TRJCRB) also hit a six-year low. \n(Additional reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in TOKYO; Editing by Eric Meijer) Singapore International News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T08:01:15.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
