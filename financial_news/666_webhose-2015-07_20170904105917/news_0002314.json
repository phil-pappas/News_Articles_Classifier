Photo: Cole Bennetts\nTelstra's new CEO Andy Penn is making his first public appearance of significance today since taking the reins at the telecom giant in May.\nHe's delivering a speech in Sydney and although nothing major is expected, it's still Penn's first chance to step out of the shadow of his illustrious predecessor. David Thodey engineered a stunning turnaround at Telstra , extending its dominant position in the mobile sector, negotiating lucrative agreements with the government (twice) over the National Broadband Network, selling off non-core assets and cutting expenses. The share price nearly doubled on his watch.\nSo he'll be a hard act to follow. That said, Penn is about the best qualified person on the planet to continue Telstra's sharemarket run. Before taking the top, job he spent 3 1/2 years as the company's chief beancounter, and before that he was the CEO of Axa-Asia Pacific Holdings, which was sold to AMP in 2011 for $4 billion.", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/telstra_ceos_hype/index.html", "http://www.afr.com/leadership/management/decision-making/lessons-from-david-thodey-20150501-1mwzpx"], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T04:47:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
