Perhaps the introduction of West Blue Contract ,which had no track record, could be the transition government had put in place,” Ms Addo pointed out.\nMs Addo pointed out that the five DICs which shared between them some 500 permanent employees and thousands of casual workers were in a fix over what to do with these employees. \nHowever, officials of Customs were of the view that the DICs had over the periods of their operations had personnel of the Customs Division being seconded to help in their operations; hence the competence of Customs in the performance of these duties was not in doubt. \n“Personnel of DICs were largely drawn from Customs, hence the notion that the division lacked the needed capacity to perform was false,” the source indicated. \nAccording to a Daily Graphic source at the Customs, there could be a marginal increase revenue in the trade chain when the takeover was fully completed and the economy showed a further rebound by the first quarter of 2016. \nThe source added that whereas import tax revenue dropped from a whopping $2.8 billion in 2013 to $2.02 billion in 2014 due to the economic meltdown the country had suffered, the prospects for the future looked great. \nCo-ordinated serviceThe source stressed that the regulations of the WTO and the World Customs Organisation (WCO) frowned on the operations of DICs in the dispensation of Customs-led duties. \nThe source emphasised that the WCO’s survey on member countries worldwide revealed that there were gaps in Ghana’s compliance chain which were key requirement for membership. \n“To ensure compliance, Ghana’s Customs must take over these very core functions so the service could conduct intelligence-led classifications. This would enable Customs to provide a one-stop shop-led service for the trading community rather than having multiple actors in the value chain,” the source intimated. \nThe Daily Graphic also gathered that the DICs in the provision of classification advices to Customs issues disclaimers on their classification reports, since the advices were based on documentations provided by importers. \nThis the source was of the view that Customs could no longer use the disclaimers of the DICs, but rather have the benefit to view the goods themselves, hence disclaimers issued by the DICs would no longer be a viable preposition for Customs to hang on in their operations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T12:22:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
