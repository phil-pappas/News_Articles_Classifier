Because borrowers are allowed to end the lease with 30 days notice, the program seemingly targets drivers who may want to drive short-term for the company.\nThe flexibility in this lease also comes from the fact that unlike traditional leases, Uber’s lease welcomes “all credit levels.”\nUber previously had a leasing program, but relied on third-party automakers and banks for the leases. Last week, Uber told Reuters it had ended its partnership with Banco Santander.\nThe idea of flexibility is important for the on-demand company as it faces legal battles over whether its drivers are independent contractors or employees. Uber, which is reportedly seeking a valuation of $50 billion , is no stranger to legal issues as it has been battling with regulators across the global, including its recent battle with New York City .\nThe company has argued that its drivers need to and want to remain independent contractors in order to work part-time or the hours they desire.\n“There is a lot of variability in how drivers use Uber, from the reasons they drive to the amount of time they spend on the platform. But one thing is clear: the key to flexible earnings is flexible financing,” the Uber blog states .\nOf course, it’s also a move to attract more drivers, as the company battles with cab companies and competitors such as Lyft. In a separate announcement Thursday, Uber announced a partnership with Life Reimagined, an AARP subsidiary, to bring on retirees older than 40 as drivers.\nThe move further broadens the Uber platform, which has grown to include bike couriers , food delivery and a moving service.\nXchange Leasing is currently a pilot program and only operating in three California cities, as well as cities in Georgia and Maryland.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-plans-large-new-funding-round-1431137142", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/23/us-uber-santandercons-deal-over-idUSKCN0PX2CB20150723", "http://newsroom.uber.com/2015/07/a-flexible-vehicle-leasing-pilot-in-california-georgia-maryland/", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-50-billion-question-can-uber-deliver-1434422042", "http://newsroom.uber.com/2015/07/aarp-life-reimagined/"], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:46:34.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
