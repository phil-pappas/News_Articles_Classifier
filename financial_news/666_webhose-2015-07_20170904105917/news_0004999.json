The “2015 Trends in Hospitality Training & Development Study” results were unveiled this week in New Orleans at the 90th CHART Hospitality Training Conference.\n“With this research, we validate the notion that training is one of the most important roles within an organization. Especially as we face a tightening labor market and skyrocketing turnover levels” said Victor Fernandez, Executive Director of Insights and Knowledge for TDn2K.\nThe goal of this bi-annual survey, launched for the first time in 2014, is to track trends in hospitality training and give trainers actionable insights they can use to gain additional support within their organizations to develop their people. The knowledge provided by this study is intended to drive the training and development initiatives that will result in improved employee performance and ultimately translating into improved business results. Findings from this survey allow business leaders in the hospitality and restaurant industries to benchmark training and development practices against an unparalleled data set in the areas of learning investments, learning hours offered per employee type, delivery methods, instructional design, content areas, e-learning practices and internal versus external resources.\n“Through this survey we are able to identify key trends in training and development that are occurring within our industry. We believe that the data and key insights that TDn2K is able to extract from our survey are a strong tool for our members to use to keep both their departments, as well as organizations, at the forefront of the hospitality industry,” said Jason M. Lyon, President of CHART. “With this study we finally have hard data to back up why training is so important!” added John Isbell, Director of Learning and Development at Logan’s Roadhouse.\nAbout TDn2K\nTDn2K (Transforming Data into Knowledge) is the parent company of People Report, Black Box Intelligence and White Box Social Intelligence.
