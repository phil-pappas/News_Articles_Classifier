() ET SPECIAL: Love visual aspect of news? Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! MUMBAI: Finance and banking firms, big and small, are raising large sums of money from foreign investors jousting for a slice of action in the world's fastest-growing major economy. Indian financial services firms delivered the second-highest return on invested capital for private equity firms during 2009-13, a recent study by global consultancy firm McKinsey & Co showed. Investors looking for growth and returns in a sluggish economy are pouring money into small- and mediumsized finance firms whose nimble models are delivering financial inclusion and growth faster than that of the stateowned banks. In the first six months of 2015, private equity funds invested $1.46 billion in finance firms, compared with $1.29 billion in the same period of 2014 and $0.9 billion in Jan-June 2013, a Bain Consulting study showed. \"Financial services sector has been very warm over the last two years as it happens to be one sector where most of the large private equity funds have been very focused. While in banks shareholding of more than 5% is not allowed, so the focus has been on NBFCs in areas like vehicle finance, home finance and even microfinance ,\" said Sanjeev Krishan, leader (private equity and transaction services), PricewaterhouseCoopers India. A McKinsey study released earlier this year showed that returns on invested capital for private equity investments in financial services were 14%, second only to information technology's 39% in 2009-13. Some promoters who partnered PE funds say that this is a long-term play. \"When PE firms invested in our company we told them that growth will not come in a few months as we do not expect macro to change anytime soon,\" said Sanjay Chamria vice chairman Magma Fincorp , which raised Rs 500 crore in March 2015 from investors such as India Value Fund, Leapfrog and KKR. \"There is growing interest for new-age financial services companies.\" Recently, Apax Partners invested Rs 500 crore in the Murugappa Group-owned non-banking finance company Cholamandalam, following it up with a Rs 2,300-crore stake buy in Shriram City Union Finance (SCUF) — the retail lending arm of Shriram Group. The returns have also been lucrative and sometimes even quick. Wolfensohn Capital Partners, founded by former World Bank president, sold shares in housing finance firm Repco Home Finance making two times returns in less than a year when it exited Repco in April 2014. TPG Capital, which sold the 20% to Apax in Shriram City, made 4.5 times returns. \"With the gradual opening up of various parts of the financial services market and the introduction of new disruptive technologies, we are seeing greater interest in investing in this sector,\" Sri Rajan, Bain India MD and senior leader of Bain & Company's private equity consulting practice. Private equity investors pumped in a total of $9.5 billion in Indian companies in the first six months ending June this year. This is a turnaround from what was seen in the preceding years when global investors were recaliberating their India approach. Since last year, PE investors have stepped up their India investments after a seemingly pro-business government came to power at the centre. \"The financial services sector is always considered a leveraged bet on the economy. With everything Prime Minister Modi is doing, a great RBI governor in place, and even the finance ministry, our hope is that the economy will do well,\" said Harsha Raghavan, head of Fairfax's India unit Fairbridge Capital. His firm has recently made an open offer of $225 million to increase stake in brokerage IIFL — the debut deal from the $1 billion raised through Fairfax India Holdings to invest in the country earlier this year. It also owns majority stake in Thomas Cook India, and 26% stake in ICICI Lombard General Insurance . \"What affected people who invested earlier was that RBI changed norms around NBFCs, making investors wary of regulatory risks,\" said Munish Dayal Partner Baring India. \"Fintech is very interesting segment right now. There would be opportunity to invest in banks as they need capital to meet Basel III norms.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T02:40:48.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
