Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Jacob Greber It's probably a good thing Treasurer Joe Hockey is on holiday this week – the temptation to freak out might be too much.\nWhich may also be a good reason for Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens to take some time off as well – not that he's a freak-out kind of guy, but still.\nAlready speculation is starting to bubble up that the Reserve Bank will need to unleash another official interest rate cut in the next three months .\nThe list of reasons for why this would be justified continues to grow. At the top is the latest bad news from the iron ore market.\nWith China's sharemarket turmoil stoking fears Australia's biggest customer is entering a new and unpredictable phase , many anticipate the iron ore slide will continue.\nAs the best barometer of Australia's near-term well-being, iron ore has slumped below $US50 a tonne this week .\nThat's bad news for a Treasurer who needs the price to hold substantially above US$48 a tonne for the best part of this financial year.\nBaked into the budget The figure is the one he baked into the May budget and falling short would force him into fresh revenue write-downs late this year at a time when the government will be desperate to build momentum for the coming federal election.\nIf anything, the iron ore price looked lately to be giving the government a rare break, clearing $US65 a tonne just under a month ago.\nFor most of June it held above US$60 a tonne, until collapsing sharply to US$49.70 on Tuesday.\n\"The surprise was that iron ore had that period where it bounced and was stable,\" said Barclays Australia chief economist Kieran Davies.\n\"I would have thought the fundamentals would drive it lower. Steel production in China has fallen and with the supply that has come on-stream it's inevitable iron ore goes lower.\"\nNo breather for Asia HSBC's latest assessment of Asia isn't any more cheerful. \"Things aren't exactly going according to plan,\" said the bank's co-heads of Asian economic research Frederic Neumann and Qu Hongbin on Wednesday.\n\"The sharp drop in crude prices, policy easing, and stabilising demand in the G3 markets [US, Japan and EU] were supposed to give Asia a little breather over the last couple of quarters.\n\"Instead, local demand – whether construction in China, auto sales in Indonesia, or real estate transactions in Taiwan – continues to slow.\n\"What's more, exports aren't coming to the rescue. Asia's traditional growth engine has failed to fire up, dragged down by weak investment globally and faltering demand in emerging markets. A quick fix seems unlikely.\"\nAll of that before anyone even begins to think about whether Greece's crisis will have major ramifications beyond its borders.\nOne lever So where does that leave the Reserve Bank? Again contemplating the only lever it has.\nWhile critics of more rate cuts will point to the bubbling Sydney property market, there's a view within the bank that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has a grip on investor exuberance. Expect more signs in coming months, is the message.\nIn addition the Reserve Bank has repeatedly emphasised that property prices outside Sydney aren't doing so great. If anything, they may even be below par.\nWhether you believe that or not, the key point is that the door to more rate cuts remains open, should the Reserve Bank feel it has no alternative.\n\"If there's a risk for a cut, it'd be August or September,\" said Mr Davies, who isn't formally predicting another reduction. \"I can't see why they'd wait.\"\nPricing on interest rate futures markets – normally pretty good at distinguishing signals from the static noise emanating from the Reserve Bank – are pricing the chance of a cut next month at 32 per cent, rising to 88 per cent by December.\nRead next: Market slumps but no contagion from China", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-07-08T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T13:03:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
