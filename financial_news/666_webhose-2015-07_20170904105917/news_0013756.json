Fiona Morris by Paul Best If you want to know how the economy is faring, stick your head in a city restaurant at lunchtime and count the suits. That's the conventional wisdom, at least. Or perhaps look at corporate restaurant bookings.\nThe latest data from online restaurant reservations agency Dimmi shows a 44 per cent rise over the past 12 months in bookings by its top 10 corporate clients, led by ANZ, PwC, National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank and Ernst & Young.\n\"It's a good sign when the corporates are out wining and dining,\" Dimmi managing director Stevan Premutico says. \"The corporate sector is telling us they're bullish about the economy.\"\nIt's not the only good news for the industry shown up by the preliminary findings of the Dimmi Australian Dining Index 2015, to be released officially in the next fortnight. Spending at the premium end of the market – more than $85 a head – is up 17 per cent on the previous financial year. In the same period, the mid and low markets nudged up 5 per cent and 1 per cent respectively.\nOverall, we are spending marginally more on restaurant dining, with Australians, on average, paying $55 a head for meals, up just $1 on the previous 12 months. The ACT had the highest average spend, with $61, but slipped 2.3 per cent on the previous year, as did South Australia (down 5.7 per cent to $59) and Western Australia (down 4.7 per cent to $49).\nCustomer satisfaction, says Dimmi – which has seated more than 13 million diners in 2500 restaurants – is also picking up across the board. ACT customers are most satisfied nationally with service and value for money, while South Australia has the highest satisfaction with atmosphere, food and drink. Western Australian diners were least satisfied across all five categories.\nMelbourne's Smith & Daughters and Sydney's Sixpenny (pictured) received the highest restaurant customer satisfaction ratings with 8.9.\nAnd for the first time, mobile bookings have overtaken desktop computer reservations. \"It's a changing world … restaurants are living and dying by our mobile experiences,\" Premutico says.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:16:24.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
