Sanders handled the event badly , according to reports. It continues to keep him on the defensive.\nWhat the incident showed was an apparent split between concerns about economic and racial justice and fairness. But that’s actually just the tip of the iceberg. There are deep divisions within those who say they want various types of reform liberals because they divide complex problems into parts and insist on solving their pet segment. Unfortunately, that won’t ultimately work, no matter how passionate people may feel.\nRacial problems are getting worse. The run of outrageous killings and alleged suicides, the latter of which alone would be an indictment against the practice of law enforcement, only continues. To say things are getting worse is difficult because it’s not clear that it was ever any better in the recent past. Only the proliferation of smartphone videos have made it so obvious to a mass audience.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., joined by federal contract workers and Rep.

According to the latest Annie E. Casey Foundation’s Kids Count report , the improving economy is leaving the lowest-income families behind.\nJob growth has been disproportionately in low-wage employment. As of 2013 (latest available numbers), 31 percent of children were in families where neither parent had full-time, year-round employment. The latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that whites (Latinos not broken out separately) have a labor participation rate of 63.3 percent and an unemployment rate of 4.8 percent. For African Americans, while the participation rate is 62.3 percent, or virtually the same, the unemployment rate is 9.8 percent. About 20 percent of children live in poverty in the U.S., and that means, for a family of four, less than $24,250 annual income. The concentration of poverty among children who live in areas where the poverty rate is 30 percent or higher, rose from 9 percent in 2000 to 14 percent from 2009 to 2014. According to the Pew Research Center, a quarter of Native Americans and Alaska Natives live in poverty . The country is slowly creating a bifurcated set of living conditions: extremely poor sections and homes in the clouds for the wealthy, who are tempted by developers to own the sun and the moon in high towers that block the natural world from those of lesser means. Over time we create the reality of Fritz Lang’s Metropolis.\nConcentrate poverty and you reduce educational opportunities because there isn’t enough money invested to improve education, so the chance most people might have to break free is undermined. Much of that concentration happens among African-Americans and native peoples. The distillation of economic disadvantage and the hopelessness it too often brings undercuts chances of influence and power, which are the creation of economic strength and united action among a group. Whites aren’t murdered by a law enforcement system — whether at arrest, in a jail, or through capital punishment applied with extreme inequality — at anywhere near the same rate because the collection of groups labeled white, at least those with money, do have power.\nSimilarly, increase the education, earning power, and engagement of people of color, and you’re likely to find that they enter a self-reinforcing cycle that only grows their success and influence.\nThe split between economic and racial justice is a problem because, as Robert Reich recently wrote, the two may not be the same but they’re closely linked. Economic advancement for poor whites is another part of the puzzle, because when they start doing better along with others, they are less susceptible to being told that racial minorities or immigrants are the reason they suffer.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2015/07/how_bernie_sanders_and_martin_o_malley_botched_blacklivesmatter_at_netroots.html", "http://www.aecf.org/m/resourcedoc/aecf-2015kidscountdatabook-2015.pdf", "http://time.com/3963692/bernie-sanders-martin-omalley-black-lives-matter/", "http://robertreich.org/post/124756365725", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5a545d931e9444548d3e57dd75a2b203/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm", "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/13/1-in-4-native-americans-and-alaska-natives-are-living-in-poverty/"], "published": "2015-07-27T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T15:34:51.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
