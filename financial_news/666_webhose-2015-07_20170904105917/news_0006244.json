Roswell, Ga. (PRWEB) July 10, 2015\nSteven Walker had worked in sales and sales management for 25 years when the opportunity to become his own boss crossed his path.\n“A friend kept telling me about [the] Bahama Buck's [franchise]. I finally tried it, and I was sold,” he remembered. “The product and the atmosphere is awesome.”\nWalker immediately began taking the steps to secure his Bahama Buck’s franchise territory and soon after left his job, ready to make the leap into entrepreneurship. When it came time to think through franchise financing options, he learned about the possibility of leveraging his 401(k) funds from another franchisee who had done so. Walker researched the alternative funding option and called on Guidant Financial to walk him through the rollover as business start-up process, enabling him to use retirement assets to invest in his business without accruing any penalties.\n“Guidant makes a complicated process easy for you,” Walker explained. With their help, he was able to launch his business completely free of debt, increasing his business’s cash flow from the very beginning.\nBahama Buck’s Original Shaved Ice Company offers its customers a ‘taste of paradise’ in the form of 91 flavors of shaved ice, also known as ‘Sno.’ In addition to Sno flavors ranging from standard cherry to pickle juice to snickerdoodle, Bahama Buck’s also offers a line of Thin Ice™ Sno with zero sugar, zero calories and zero carbs, in addition to Island Smoothies, Frostalattés and more.\nFor Walker, the best part of owning a Bahama Buck’s franchise is “seeing the smiles on the faces of customers when they try our Sno for the first time.” When he’s not working, he can be found spending time with his family and playing water sports.\nBahama Buck’s of Roswell, located at 4905 Alabama Rd. NE, #370, celebrated its grand opening last month.
