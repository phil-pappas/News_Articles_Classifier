PUBLISHED: 17:02, Thu, Jul 30, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:09, Thu, Jul 30, 2015 GETTY Avoid common investment mistakes \nHowever, there are a number of common pitfallls that can trip up even an experienced investor, and avoiding these can help to limit potential losses. Here's what to watch out for. • Falling in love It's easily done, but its not a good idea to show any sentimental or emotional attachment to an investment. Essentially, follow your head and not your heart at all times. Rob Morgan, pensions and investments analyst at Charles Stanley Direct, said: \"Critically reassessing the investment regularly should help - be brutal if you have to.\" • Buying all at once Due to markets highs and lows it makes sense to drip feed into the market when constructing a portfolio, even if you have a lump sum of money. This means that you'll avoid putting cash in when the market is at a peak that's hard to recover. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Markets are by their nature unpredictable and if you try to time them you are just as likely to get things wrong as right.\" • Keeping all your eggs in one basket The key part to having a successful investment strategy is diversification and making a portfolio made of different types of investments known as asset classes. It means that it's not necessarily a disaster for you, if one area or company takes a hit. Yet many small investors still fail to spread their risk. Robin Stoakley, managing director, UK Intermediary at Schroders, said: \"Not all asset classes react to the same market conditions in the same way.\"Therefore by placing money in a number of different asset classes the good returns you receive from one investment in a certain time period can help offset the poor performance of another.\"A stocks and shares ISA allows you access to a spread of investments, including bonds, equities and funds and protects investments from tax. • Unwittingly doubling up on risk Don't be caught out when trying to diversify; sometimes investments that appear to be very different can actually have a lot in common. Mr Morgan from Charles Stanley Direct said: \"A common mistake is having too much of a portfolio facing in one direction. \"For instance, investing in mining funds and Chinese equities… Many companies in the mining sector are reliant on Chinese growth, so it may mean the two areas rise and fall virtually in tandem. \"Similarly, watch out for funds that overlap in terms of style or holdings, or which have big stakes in shares you already hold.\" Related articles A five-minute guide to often-overlooked capital gains tax \n• Ignoring charges Weigh up all the charges and fees of your investments as they will make a big difference to returns over the long term. Maike Currie, associate investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, said: \"Watch out for platforms that appear to be low cost, but pile on additional charges later down the line.\"You shouldn’t be afraid to dig into the detail of what platforms charge, it will make a marked difference to your portfolio returns over the long term.\"Look at annual and ongoing charges, as well as any exit fees charged by platforms. As well as additional charges that may be linked to a specific investment, such as management and annual charges. • Buying a large riser or faller Following the crowd and buying a stock that is rising without an idea of the overall value can be a recipe for disaster. At the same time, bargain hunting shares that have dropped heavily can seem like a good idea, but the stock could have further to fall and there's no guarantee that it will recover its lost value. • Selling an investment that has lost money It can be alarming when you are in effect losing money, but selling too early is a mistake that many investors make. It's a good idea to make an assessment of the acts before deciding whether to cut losses. Mr Khalaf said: \"Stocks often sell off and subsequently recover, and if you keep moving out after they have fallen you can gradually deplete your investment pot. \"Of course if the outlook has fundamentally changed and you don’t think the investment will do well, switch out. But if the reason you invested in the first place remains intact, stick with it.\" • Trying to get rich quick You should typically invest for a minimum of three to five years, which means that any market falls can be recovered over the long-term. It's especially important to bear this is mind when the market is falling and you can be tempted to act on emotion. Mr Khalaf said: \"The trick to investing in the stockmarket is to try to get rich slowly! \"If something sounds too good to be true, it normally is. Investments offering guaranteed high returns need to be treated with extreme caution.\" • Not taking a profit It's near impossible to time a perfect exit from an investment, but it's generally it's better to leave on a high - even if it's not the peak.Mr Morgan said: \"There is nothing wrong with banking gains, especially if an investment exceeds your expectations. \"Use profits to diversify your portfolio, or to rebalance to areas that appear to offer better value.\" • Not having enough time Make you can put aside enough time to adequately monitor performance. Individual shares take more time, whereas funds need less - adjust your portfolio accordingly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T09:17:43.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
