The British bank made a loss after tax on the sale of about 500 million pounds. \nThe Portuguese business is expected to be sold at less than the price Barclays holds its assets at, one of the sources said. \nPortugal's banking sector is in a state of flux as authorities try to sell Novo Banco, the third-largest bank in terms of assets, which was born out of last year's state rescue of Banco Espirito Santo. \nBankinter CEO Maria Dolores Dancausa said after results on Thursday the Spanish bank was \"more a buyer than a seller\" when asked if it was an acquisition target.
