Savers can say hello to better rates for the first time in seven years. Investors will wobble as bond funds dive. But it is estate agents who have most to fear.\nEven a small rise in base rate could send shockwaves through the property market, not because mortgages suddenly become unaffordable – they won’t – but because the current extraordinary level of house prices rely on one factor above all: confidence. If home buyers think rates are going to start marching up, confidence in the market may evaporate.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mark Carney has said he expected the bank rate to rise over the next three years from its current all-time low of 0.5%. Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA Mortgage providers won’t wait for the Bank of England to raise base rate early next year. They will start to re-price their mortgages almost immediately. Expect to see the best fixed-rate deals disappear from the shelves over the next few days, with their replacements looking pricier. Currently, the best two-year fixes are around 1.29%, with the best five-year deal pegged at an extraordinarily low 2.18%. These are rates that may never be seen again by today’s generation of house buyers.\nShould you hop over to these deals while they still last? Most recent home buyers won’t be able to, as the vast majority are locked into fixed rate deals and can only move when they reach maturity. But there are the millions of households who were the winners from the credit crunch, as the cost of their tracker loans fell in line with base rate falls, who must now be eyeing the market nervously.\nAt Nationwide alone there are 700,000 people on the society’s base rate-linked deal, who during the financial crisis enjoyed a collapse in their monthly payments to just 2.5%, where they have stayed for seven years. They face a tough choice; stay and hope the ‘new normal’ is a base rate topping out at 3% (which alone will take their monthly rate to 5%) or switch now?\nLikewise, the HSBC 0.99% ‘historic low’ mortgage deal, which garnered so many headlines when launched nine months ago, has a sting in the tail that Bank’s governor Mark Carney only has to raise base rate to 1% and borrowers could swiftly see their rate shoot to 4.5%.\nOne base rate rise of 0.5% will only have a marginal impact on household finances: someone with a £150,000 mortgage currently at 2.5% will see their repayments rise from £673 a month to £711.\nBut a third of mortgage borrowers will struggle to meet their repayments if interest rates rise higher, with those in the south-east most exposed to an increase in their monthly loan bills. If base rates rise to 3%, then that £150,000 mortgage will be costing £250 a month more. Consumer spending, always cited as the motor of economic recovery, will inevitably stall.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A third of mortgage borrowers will struggle to meet their repayments if interest rates rise much higher than 0.5% Photograph: Rui Vieira/PA Meanwhile, repossessions, the missing actor in the credit crunch drama, kept off stage by super-low mortgage rates and bank ‘forbearance’, must surely reappear.\nThose excluded from the housing market by silly prices may cheer if rate rises send the market back to earth. But since the banking crisis, the Financial Conduct Authority has imposed tough affordability requirements. Buyers super-stretched to buy a one-bed flat on four times income today will face an impossible task if rates climb higher.\nIt will be fascinating to see the response of Britain’s new army of two million-plus buy-to-let landlords. Last week, many were rocked by budget reforms that will slice the tax reliefs they enjoy. Will they take a rate rise as a signal to sell up, or try to raise the rent instead? This is new territory for Britain’s property market.\nSavers, who outnumber borrowers by seven to one, should be in line for relief at last. But the banks will do their best to delay rises in returns for savers. Meanwhile, older savers who have piled into bond funds as they pay a better ‘yield’ could see them decline in value.\nThere is one very sunny spot, though. The money markets love to park their zillions in currencies paying higher interest rates. On Wednesday, sterling hit a seven-year high of £1.43 against the euro – rather nicely timed just right for the summer holidays.", "external_links": ["http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Housing+market+could+face+collapse+if+base+rate+rise+hits+buyer+confidence&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmoney%2F2015%2Fjul%2F16%2Fbase-rate-rise-buyer-confidence-topple-housing-market&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F3c0c489a05520319dab0ad78515c8d6133eb0561%2F0_170_3500_2101%2F3500.jpg", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Housing+market+could+face+collapse+if+base+rate+rise+hits+buyer+confidence&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmoney%2F2015%2Fjul%2F16%2Fbase-rate-rise-buyer-confidence-topple-housing-market&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Fea060ddbd6413d2964e912ae6f1a921ed0c0a1e9%2F0_77_2750_1651%2F2750.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Housing+market+could+face+collapse+if+base+rate+rise+hits+buyer+confidence&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4amc2%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Housing+market+could+face+collapse+if+base+rate+rise+hits+buyer+confidence&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4amc2%2Fstw%23img-3", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4amc2%2Fsfb%23img-3&ref=responsive", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4amc2%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive"], "published": "2015-07-17T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T00:18:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
