Those who have bought ULIPs (unit-linked insurance plans), traditional (endowment, money-back, whole-life) or pension products, often, end up trying to figure out options to exit the policy. Hopefully, they will not make the same mistake again and follow Moneylife’s suggestion to buy term plans for insurance needs. Contrary to popular perception, pension products from life insurers are poor options for retirement savings. But what if people already have a policy with which they are unhappy. Unlike a usual recommendation given by experts to surrender such policy, Moneylife tells you to evaluate all your options—in many cases, there are three different choices. After all, policy surrender is not the best option, in most cases, especially for traditional products; hence, you should cautious if you are blindly surrendering your life insurance policy. Moneylife has done three Cover Stories on this subject in March 2012, March 2013 and October 2014. The interactive two-hour session looked at options for handling old ULIPs (pre-September 2010), new ULIPs (post-September 2010), old traditional plans (pre-January 2014), new traditional plans (post-January 2014), old ULPP (unit-linked pension plan) of pre-September 2010, new ULPP (post-September 2010), old pension (traditional) (pre-January 2014) and new pension (traditional) (post-January 2014). Real-life examples were discussed along with cases from the audience to ensure that solutions would help choose the best of the three undesirable options. Old ULIPs had a challenge of non-standard surrender charges which, in some cases, continue till the end of the policy term. The saving grace is ‘cover continuance’ feature which allows the insured to stop paying premium after three years and remain invested without surrender. New ULIPs have standard surrender charges; but the good feature of cover continuance was withdrawn which means that your policy will be deemed to be ‘auto-surrendered’ if you stop paying the premium. Traditional products offer pathetic guaranteed surrender value. ‘Paid-up’ is an option for traditional policies which have a surrender value. It is similar to cover continuance wherein you do not pay premium but do not surrender till the end of the policy term. Handling a pension policy is the most difficult due to tax implications for policy surrender. Avoid falling into the trap of fraudulent calls for selling policies as well as mis-selling of surrender. The pitch is to get you to buy a new policy to earn commission for the intermediaries. Buying an online term plan for your life insurance needs will ensure that you don’t have to worry about loss at policy surrender. Put the remaining funds for investments in mutual funds, tax-free bonds, PPF or bank fixed deposits (FDs).
