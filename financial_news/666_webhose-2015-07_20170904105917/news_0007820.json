The “fortune”, Wilkin clarifies, is not the stuff of fancy cars and a holiday home on the Amalfi Coast, but “yachts and personal helicopters, diamond-encrusted light fixtures, stately homes and private islands”. \nThe sort of fortune, in other words, only available to the world’s 1,826 billionaires and well out of the reach of the wildest imaginations of the rest of us. \nBut Wilkin says he can change all of that. He has spent years researching the machinations of the uber rich and claims to have homed in on their wealth secrets. Pay attention, for this could be your chance to follow in the immaculate Italian leather shod footsteps of the world’s one per cent. \nGet rich quick tomes are, of course, nothing new, and usually more common to a Waterstones’ bargain bucket than an oligarchic’s book shelf - if such a thing exists. However, what makes this book different is Sam Wilkin’s is an inside man. \nThe 41-year-old is a senior advisor for Oxford Economics (one of the world’s foremost global research consultancies) and Oxford Analytica which provides strategic advice to more than 50 governments across the globe. He works with some of the world’s largest companies and even the odd billionaire sadly, he won’t say which. Wilkin has previously written several economic theory books, but this one, published worldwide this month, is different. It zeros in on how the wealthy made it and attempts to answer the billion-dollar question: \"How can I get me some of that?\" \nWe meet for dinner at a harbourside restaurant in Amsterdam. Wilkin is Buckinghamshire-born but lives in New York and is travelling back via Holland after giving a lecture in China. From the book’s amoral money-grabbing tone, I am half-expecting a Wolf of Wall Street character to breeze in, perhaps arriving by launch from some distantly moored super yacht. Instead I am greeted by a bespectacled figure in a suit crumpled by his long-haul flight. He prefers one glass of beer to a bottle of vintage champagne. \nWarren Buffett, the world's third richest man \nSo the obvious question, and one I am grilling him on before he has even buttered his bread, is exactly how does somebody (take, just plucking an example out of the sky, a lowly-paid journalist) become a billionaire? The good news, first, is that it is getting easier. In Britain, alone, the number of billionaires has increased from 53 to 113 in the past five years. For 2015 there are 290 newcomers on the Forbes global rich list . \n“It’s easier than ever,” Wilkin says. “It’s the rise of the financial sector and the rise of fast growing emerging markets. These are what an economist would call institutional factors.” \nThe book narrows the so-called wealth secrets down to seven, but for Wilkin only two really matter: eradicate the competition and take risks with other people’s money. \nHe cites the example of Microsoft (NasdaqGS: MSFT - news ) founder and richest person on the planet Bill Gates as somebody who managed to seize control of an entire market. Same too, the lightning expansion of Google by Sergey Brin and Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook empire. \n•How the wealthy, and not so wealthy, are taxing themselves \n•Are these the top 35 business women in Britain today? \nWilkin compares this total control of markets by men who had barely finished their degrees to the robber barons of late 19th century and early 20th century America. While the likes of Rockefeller, John Pierepont Morgan and Andrew Carnegie managed to hoover up the vast profits of industrialisation, a century on a privileged few have similarly reaped the rewards of a new digital economy. He says the pharmacteutical and technology sectors are nowadays where the true money is to be made. This is what American investor Warren Buffet t, the third richest man in the world (net worth of 72.3 billion dollars), refers to as getting in the right boat. \nThe other obvious way to have no competitors is to pick a place where nobody else wants to do business. “The best place to do business is really the worst’ he says. ‘You want a place that is so hard to do business in that nobody else can get one started.” \nThe most famous example of this, he says, is the Wild East of post-Communist Russia during the Nineties where men like Roman Abramovich (last week spotted sailing his 557ft super yacht through the Scottish Western isles) made their wealth. \nBy 2004, Moscow was home to more billionaires than New York and Wilkin says more than ever this is the wealth secret that dominates the rich list. The emerging markets of China, India, Brazil and Mexico are now home to almost one in four of the world’s billionaires. \nRoman Abramovich \nClearly, knowing where and how to operate is not enough. Personality is also key and Wilkin says there are obvious traits that unite a lot of the people in the book, going as far back as Marcus Licinius Crassus, the Ancient Roman known as one of the richest men that has ever lived. The corporate matiness of modern billionaires, as personified by Richard Branson chillaxing on his private paradise island of Necker, masks a steely resolve. This, Wilkin says, is the main disclaimer for readers. “Knowing what you can do to be rich is not the same as being able to execute it.” \n“These people tend to be pretty merciless, really competitive,” he says. “You have to go in willing to fight tooth and nail to be that winner and be comfortable and untroubled by wiping everybody else out.” \nWilkin talks about the “hard-charged testosterone environment” of modern day financiers, a lot of it resting on ego and still very much a man’s world. \nAnother uniting personality trait he says he has noticed among billionaires is they tend to declare their financial objectives as young children. “Bill Gates did it to his high school friends. Andrew Carnegie, too. Having the objective just to have money is a major driver of people who become super rich.” \nMelinda and Bill Gates (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nHe himself comes from normal middle class stock - his English father is a retired professor, his American mother a former librarian and admits he is full of respect for the “amazing gumption” of your average billionaire. “It’s impossible not to admire these people,” Wilkin says. “They really are larger than life characters who have done amazing things.” \nAnd what about him, I wonder. If he does know their secrets why doesn’t Wilkin become a billionaire himself? He insists, in between sips of mint tea, that he has no desire for great wealth mapping how it is made is interesting enough. \nHe says the “moneyed herd” of super rich bankers and the like are a regular sight in Manhattan, but the endless desire to stay on top at all costs which unites so many billionaires, is not for him. Happiness, he says, should not depend on one’s bank balance. \nNone the less, when I ask what he would spend his fictional billions on, it is impossible to ignore the glint in the economist’s eye. “Nothing ostentatious, but I would like to have a nice place in a few countries. Maybe Oxford, maybe New York, maybe Japan…” \nAs he trails off, I wonder if perhaps the one per cent may soon have another member? \n• Wealth Secrets of the One Percent, by Sam Wilkin, is published by Little, Brown, priced £20.
