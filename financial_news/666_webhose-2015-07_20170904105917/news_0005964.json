Both brothers have new deals that run until the middle of 2019. The pair will report to the company's board of directors, but James will also report to Rupert. That is a curious structure, which suggests that while he has the CEO title, James will still be following his father's lead. \nBoth Murdoch children will receive $3 million in base salary and are eligible for a bonus that could range from $8 million to $16 million along with stock incentives which will come in at no less than $9 million. At minimum, the pair are guaranteed $20 million in compensation each year, and that is before you consider the car allowance, personal jet, and other perks lavished on the duo. \nCarey will not have exactly the same deal as the new CEO and executive co-chairman. Instead, beginning in July, he will receive $20 million in cash compensation, according to Deadline . He will be considered a full-time employee, and his services will not be exclusive to Fox. \nThat is a pretty lucrative part-time job, and it gets even better. The former COO, who will report to Rupert and the board, has the right to deliver four months notice as of July 1, 2016. At that point, he can serve out those final months but be paid for the full two years. So, for Carey, it is potentially $40 million for 16 months of part-time work. \nWhy is this happening? The elder Murdoch is not really going anywhere. He gave up the CEO title and some of the work involved, perhaps, but his sons still must answer to him. The lavish pay packages are essentially a reward for the two of them to agree to the structure, which mollifies shareholders who wanted a succession plan. \nCarey gets his payout for shutting up and stepping aside. He never had the right last name to ascend to the CEO chair, so he is getting a bundle of money in exchange for not raising a fuss. \nThis seems like an awfully high price for shareholders to pay for a new leadership team, but this is how Murdoch does business. Given the large stake his family controls in the company, there is little reason to have expected anything different. \n3 Companies Poised to Explode When Cable Dies Cable is dying.
