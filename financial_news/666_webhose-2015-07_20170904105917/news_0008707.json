The construction unit of Samsung Group said it has asked the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) to arbitrate a refinery improvement project in which the company was chosen as a preferred bidder in 2013 by Oman Refineries and Petroleum Industries Co (Orpic).\n\"We submitted the request for arbitration from the third party. We were chosen as a preferred bidder for the project but Orpic withdrew the project during the negotiations\" a Samsung Engineering spokesman was quoted by Korean media as saying.\nHe said that Orpic took out its deposit for the contract which was set aside as a form of callable bond. Samsung did not reveal the amount of the deposit.\nAccording to details on the ICSID website Samsung Engineering's arbitration complaint was registered on July 20. US law firm of Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton will represent Samsung in the international court based in Washington DC US.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T13:40:41.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
