A-1A, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Aug 28, 2014 Affirmed Aaa (sf) \nCl. A-3, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Aug 28, 2014 Affirmed Aaa (sf) \nCl. A-3B, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Aug 28, 2014 Affirmed Aaa (sf) \nCl. A-4, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Aug 28, 2014 Affirmed Aaa (sf) \nCl. A-4FL, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Aug 28, 2014 Affirmed Aaa (sf) \nCl. A-SB, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Aug 28, 2014 Affirmed Aaa (sf) \nCl. X, Downgraded to B1 (sf); previously on Aug 28, 2014 Affirmed Ba3 (sf) \nRATINGS RATIONALE \nThe ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable ranges. \nThe rating on the IO Class (ClassX) was downgraded primarily due to a decline in the credit performance (or the weighted average rating factor or WARF) of its reference classes. \nMoody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 17.6%. As a percentage of the original pooled balance, Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 15.6%. Moody's provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255 . \nFACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING: \nThe performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected. \nFactors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance. \nFactors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls. \nMETHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION \nThe principal methodology used in this rating was \"Approach to Rating US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS\" published in December 2014. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology. \nDESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED \nMoody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% or greater of the current pool balance. \nMoody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 42, compared to 47 at Moody's last review. \nDEAL PERFORMANCE \nAs of the July 10, 2015 distribution date, the transaction's aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 22% to $3.70 billion from $4.76 billion at securitization. The certificates are collateralized by 270 mortgage loans ranging in size from less than 1% to 12% of the pool, with the top ten loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 32% of the pool. The pool contains no loans with investment-grade structured credit assessments. Six loans, constituting 4% of the pool, have defeased and are secured by US government securities. \nFifty-three loans, constituting 21% of the pool, are on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that could affect performance. \nTwenty-eight loans have been liquidated from the pool, contributing to an aggregate realized loss of $89 million (for an average loss severity of 33%). Thirty-seven loans, constituting 16% of the pool, are currently in special servicing. The largest specially serviced loan is the Moreno Valley Mall Loan ($80 million -- 2% of the pool), which is secured by a portion of a larger 1.1 million square foot, enclosed regional mall in Moreno Valley, California. The mall's anchors include Macy's, JC Penney, Sears, and Harkins Theaters. The mall is REO and was acquired by the trust via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in February 2011 from GGP, the former sponsor. The servicer has since embarked on a stabilization program targeting leasing and deferred maintenance. Inline occupancy was 90% as of June 2015. Temporary tenants account for 21% of the inline occupancy. Total occupancy is up to 95% from 81% at year-end 2013. New leasing reported in 2014 includes a new Crunch Fitness. Comp inline sales were $354 as of December 2014. The servicer has recognized an appraisal reduction of $54.7 million, representing approximately 69% of the outstanding loan balance. A September 2014 appraisal valued the property at $50.6 million. \nThe remaining 35 specially serviced loans are secured by a mix of property types. Moody's estimates an aggregate $395 million loss for the specially serviced loans (65% expected loss on average). \nMoody's has assumed a high default probability for 36 poorly performing loans, constituting 17% of the pool, and has estimated an aggregate loss of $107 million (an 18% expected loss based on a 48% probability of default) from these troubled loans. \nMoody's received full year 2014 operating results for 94% of the pool, and full or partial year 2015 operating results for 26% of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 111%, compared to 110% at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut of 11.6% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 9.8%. \nMoody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.37X and 1.00X, respectively, compared to 1.36X and 1.00X at the last review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan balance. \nThe top three performing conduit loans represent 19% of the pool balance. The largest loan is the DDR Southeast Portfolio Loan ($441 million -- 12% of the pool), a 50% participation interest in a senior mortgage loan secured by a portfolio of 52 anchored retail properties located across ten U.S. states. Approximately three-quarters of the properties are grocery-anchored. Occupancy across the portfolio was 89% as of February 2014, compared to 87% at Moody's last review. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 122% and 0.76X, respectively, compared to 124% and 0.74X at prior review. \nThe second largest loan is the Greensboro Corporate Center Loan ($125 million -- 3% of the pool). The loan is secured by a 439,000 square foot, two-building office property in the Tysons Corner section of McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, DC. The loan is on the watchlist. The former largest tenant, which had occupied approximately 20% of the property's net rentable area (NRA) vacated at lease expiration in September 2014, bringing the property's occupancy down to 74%. The current largest tenant, Watt, Tieder, Fitzgerald, occupies 16% of the property's NRA under a lease set to expire in June 2016. The local office leasing market is soft, with CBRE reporting vacancy up 90 basis points year-to-date in 2015. A new station on the Washington Metro opened in July 2014 less than two blocks from the property. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 137% and 0.71X, respectively, compared to 136% and 0.72X at the last review. \nThe third largest loan is the Wachovia Capitol Center Loan ($120 million -- 3% of the pool). The loan is secured by a 560,000 square foot, Class A office property in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina. The property is currently known as Wells Fargo Capitol Center. Property occupancy was 84% as of March 2015, down from 94% at Moody's last review, following the departure of the former fourth-largest tenant at lease expiration in November 2014. The current third-largest tenant (12% of property NRA) has a lease expiring in December 2015. Moody's identifies this as a troubled loan and our analysis incorporates a small loss from this loan. \nREGULATORY DISCLOSURES \nFor further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form. \nThe analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument. \nMoody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis. \nFor ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's rating practices.
