Reuters Share on twitter by James Chessell German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has vowed not to leave Greeks \"in the lurch\" amid warnings a No vote at Sunday's critical referendum will leave the county with shortages of food, medicine and push Greece's economy to the brink of collapse.\nAs Greeks prepare for a referendum that could decided their country's membership of the common currency-eurozone as well as the fate of prime minister Alexis Tsipras, Mr Schaeuble appeared to adopt a somewhat concilitory tone by promsing to support the debt-laden country's people and suggesting any \"Grexit\" from Europe could be temporary.\n\"Greece is a part of the Eurozone. There's no doubt about that. Whether with the euro or temporarily without, this question can only be answered by the Greeks themselves,\" he Germany's Bild newspaper that\nMr Schäuble, who is one of the most influential and hawkish ministers of chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet, has been a been fierece critic of the negotiating tactics adopted by Mr Tsipras' leftwing Syriza government and previously insisted a No vote could force Greece out of the euro.\nWith pharmacists claiming the government had begun rationing the distribution of some medicine and capital controls on Greek banks likely to continue througout this week, Mr Schäuble was asked what would happen if Greece left the currency union it joined in 2001 and reverted to the drachma.\n\"We will not leave the people of Greece in the lurch,\" he replied.\nA series of opinon polls published this week have predicted a close result. However, the disruption caused by the capital controls - which involve the closure of most Greek banks and daily withdrawl limits of €60 from ATMs - is expected to strengthen the Yes vote.\nImposed days before Greece became the first developed nation to default on a payment to the International Monetary Fund last week, the capital controls have forced Greeks to queue at ATMs and are beginning to suffocate the economy.\n An estimated 50,000 tourists have cancelled their holdiays, according to the Greek Tourism Confederation, while there are reports food staples such as bread and sugar were running low in some shops as suppliers lose confidence they will be paid.\nMr Schäuble said the situation in Greece has deteriorated dramatically in the last few weeks.\nHowever, the 72-year-old stopped well short of offering any form of compromise to Athens, noting the risk of financail contaigon from a Greek banking collapse was \"relatively low\" and arguing one of the conclusions that could be drawn from the crisis was that \"a community can only function if the members abide by the rules\".\n'War footing' Greece's combative finance miniser Yanis Varoufakis on Saturday accused the eurozone powers led by Germany of attempting to bully Greek voters and said his country was on \"war footing.\n\"What they're doing with Greece has a name: terrorism,\" he told Spanish newspaper El Mundo. \"Why have they forced us to close the banks? To frighten people. It's about spreading terror.\"\nMr Schäuble has also become, quite literarily, the poster boy for unpopular economic reforms known as austerity measures that formed part of the Greece's bailout deals with eurzone creditors in 2010 and 2014. His face is featured in a prominent \"Oxi\" (No) campain poster plastered around Athens, which features the slogan: \"Five years he has drunk your blood. Now tell him No.\"\nWith the liquidity of Greek banks only assured until Monday, The European Central Bank will meet on Monday to decide whether to extend it emergency assistance scheme which has kept lenders afloat in recent weeks.\nThe absolute breakdown in trust betewen both sides underlines the signficance of Sunday's vote, which was called just over week ago by Mr Tsipras after negotiations with Greece's creditors broke down.\nThe complicated 72-word question only asks voters to accept the terms of now-expired bailout proposal from the creditors but has taken on a broader significance as an in-out poll on euro membership after five years of economic hardship and mass unemployment.\nSyriza has unscuessfully attempted to make the focus of the referendum on a series of tough economic reforms known austerity measures such as tax hikes and a tightening of Greece's generous pension system.\nHowever, it has become a defacto-vote on Mr Tsipras's handling of often fractious negotiations with the creditors after his party won power in January by promising to oppose further austerity measures.\nA Yes vote is expected to end Mr Tsipras' political career and kickstart fresh negotiations with the creditors without Syriza.\nWhile Mr Tsipras argues a No vote will strengthen his hand in further talks, many observers believe it will terminate Greece's membership of the euro and possibly the European Union altogether.\n\"I could not imagine the future of Greece outside the eurozone and especially with people like Tsipras governing the country,\" George Tzogopoulos, a fellow at the Hellenic Foundation for European & Foreign Policy, told The Australian Financial Review.\n\"Because being under the umbrella of the eurozone, stability is gauranteed even if we of course have important problems like unemployment and poverty.\"\nMartin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, warned that the power networks, public transport systems, and health services were all at risk in Greece \"without new money\".\nWith Greece's debt mountain at an unmanagable 180 per cent of GDP, further negotiations with the creditors are necessary regardless of the result. The IMF puts Greece's total funding requirements at €50 billion for the next three years.\nDivided nation An estimated 35,000 people gathered outside the parliament building on Friday for a \"No\" rally which featured a concert and a defiant speech by Mr Tsipras.\n\"This is not a protest. It is a celebration to overcome fear and blackmail,\" he said, before urging Greeks to \"decide to live in dignity in Europe\".\nHe claimed a \"Yes\" vote would not result in a Grexit, saying: \"We are not going to allow them to destroy Europe.\"\nBut a crowd of around 20,000 attending a nearby \"Yes\" rally in the capital were told a \"No\" vote would result in Greece being ejected from the eurozone.\nThe rallies highlighted the social and economic differences between the two sides .\nYes supporters are generally more affluent while the No Camp has a higher proportion of students and unemployed.\nAlmost 9.9 million Greeks have the right to vote in the referendum, which is expected to cost €25 million.\nPolling stations open at 7am local time and close at 7pm. The first results are expected around 9pm.", "external_links": ["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11718296/EU-warns-of-Armageddon-if-Greek-voters-reject-terms.html", "https://twitter.com/jameschessell"], "published": "2015-07-05T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T08:34:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
