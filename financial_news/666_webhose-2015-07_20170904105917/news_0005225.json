For site clearance, the proposal has been sent to the Ministry, he told reporters.\nWhen asked about the apparent contradiction in the written reply to the Rajya Sabha, Sharma suggested that the response was given much before a decision for second airport was taken during the meeting last month.\n“I had replied in a written answer and the (Parliament) question for written answer comes a month in advance…,” he said.\nReplying to a query about setting up an airport in Jewar (Uttar Pradesh), the Minister today said that due to various reasons the matter did not reach a logical conclusion earlier.\n“We are writing to Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi that based on land availability an airport could be set up. From wherever proposal comes, we will consider those actively,” Sharma said.\nOn June 26 too, Sharma had said the Ministry has cleared a proposal for a second airport in NCR to ease burden on the Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi.\nHowever, there have not been clarity about the matter especially after Raju had refused to confirm such a move.\nReminded about Sharma’s announcement that the proposal has been cleared by the Ministry and would soon be taken to the Cabinet, Raju had only said, “Please ask Mr Sharma… Anybody can give suggestion, anybody can write (to the Ministry)”.\n“I don’t even know whether it (proposal for a new airport) should go to the Cabinet,” Raju had said.\n 23, 2015 5:21 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T00:10:50.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
