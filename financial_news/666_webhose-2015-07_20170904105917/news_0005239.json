It provoked a furious response from JD Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin, who called the increase another “capricious” government initiative that would cause more pub closures. \nHowever, Mr Findlay said that while the scale of the hike was greater than expected, “much of that change we had already got in our forecasting and in our plans”. \nHe added: “We’re probably looking at a cost of something like £1m in 2016 and then a couple of million per year thereafter.” \nNumis analyst Douglas Jack praised Marston’s “sensible approach” to the living wage, and shares in the company, which operates 1,600 pubs and employs about 13,000 people, rose as much as 3.9pc amid investor relief. \nAn encouraging trading update also buoyed the stock, with Marston’s posting a 2pc increase in like-for-like sales at its destination and premium pubs in the 10 weeks to July 18 compared with last year, and a similar rise at its taverns business. \nGiven most of its pubs have outdoor spaces, the recent fine weather has helped trading, Mr Findlay said. Last year, the company was also hampered by the football World Cup, which “isn’t particularly good for food-led pub businesses”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T16:58:27.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
