But don't lose sight of your compliance requirements. Michel O'Sullivan by Sam Henderson It's hard to believe a new financial year is already upon us; what better time to reassess your self-managed superannuation fund's written investment strategy?\nYou do have a strategy, don't you? On a professional level, I see very few that are actually up to scratch in the eyes of the Australian Taxation Office. So let's assume there's room for improvement with yours.\nIn my view, too much trust is placed in accountants, many of whom only attend to an average of five or fewer SMSFs within their practice. They therefore are not specialists and can inadvertently create potential potholes in their client's record keeping. All too often they produce standardised and unspecific documents that have been in their practice for many years and wouldn't satisfy the needs of the ATO.\nThe ATO wants to see the following in your investment strategy:\nA written investment strategy – they don't specifically say written but I'd definitely recommend it. Regular reviews (at least annually) with the changes documented. The consideration of insurance for each of your fund's members, although purchasing insurance is not obligatory. Some consideration of diversification. Liquidity (access to cash) for pensions and other benefits or requirements. Consideration of ancillary needs, goals and objectives of the members of whom maybe at different life stages and circumstance. Moving on to how you actually invest the money, a quick glance at the ATO's asset allocation tables (head to ato.gov.au and enter the search term \"SMSF statistical reports\") will clearly illustrate that SMSFs typically invest in Australian shares and cash and have very little exposure to bonds, international shares and property, despite being blamed for the beginning of the property boom. This in itself presents both opportunities and risks.\nRead your trust deed and refer to your existing investment strategy if you have one. If your current asset allocation reads 0 to 100 per cent in cash, 0 to 100 per cent in Australian shares, 0 to 100 per cent in international shares and 0 to 100 per cent in fixed interest or property then I think you're in dire need of some assistance.\nBe more specific about your investments. The following example would be adequate: cash, 0 to 50 per cent; Australian shares, 20 to 40 per cent; international shares, 0 to 30 per cent; property, 0 to 20 per cent; and fixed interest, 0 to 25 per cent. These ranges provide plenty of room for movement and are far more specific and realistic. If you only want cash and term deposits then articulate why and how you will meet the objectives of the fund members.\n Risk part of the equation Global equity markets are complex and risk is a part of the equation. Nobody needs a reminder of how volatile shares can be; however, the Greek financial crisis has now put this at the forefront of everybody's minds. Consider how your portfolio might look after a technical correction. Are you comfortable with that?\nOwning only property in an SMSF can be fraught with danger also. I've seen clients, particularly small-business owners, that only have their business property or a commercial property inside their fund. While it may be a good investment for a time, you can't sell the bathroom to fund pensions and if you lose a tenant you lose your cash flow and thus your liquidity.\nProblems arise when liquidity doesn't exist within the fund to pay those pensions. If a pension can't be paid then a fund is deemed to be in accumulation phase and the fund will be forced to pay a higher rate of tax.\nIf you are borrowing to buy property inside your fund, you also need to consider liquidity and the chance of rising interest rates. Residential property can also provide poor cash flow owing to costs such as interest, strata fees, agents fees, land tax, maintenance or low tenancy levels. If you're investing in property, or thinking about it, make sure you leave plenty of liquid assets such as shares or cash to fund times of vacancy or lower cash flows.\nThe same can be said for shares with low dividends. While the capital upside might be attractive, consideration must be given to liquidity, not to mention volatility, so that the fund can stay operational to meet its obligations.\nManaging a super fund can be highly rewarding, allowing you to take control of your retirement savings and giving you the flexibility you need when managing your own money. But don't lose sight of your compliance requirements.\nThe ATO has been releasing some fantastic and very helpful videos on various SMSF topics, including investment strategies. Go to ato.gov.au and enter the search term \"SMSF investment strategy video\" to watch the videos to make sure you're keeping up with their requirements.\nIn fact, watch all their videos and download their free booklets while you're at it. You'll be surprised at what you can learn – and it's cheaper than going to the movies.", "external_links": ["https://www.ato.gov.au/"], "published": "2015-06-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T01:02:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
