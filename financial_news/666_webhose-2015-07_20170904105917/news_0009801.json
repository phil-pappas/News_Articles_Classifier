Advertising Print This Post (Photo: Bloomberg) Cypriot financial authorities are tightening their grip on the large part of the trading industry that has set up base on the island. According to several sources who talked with Finance Magnates, the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) is now demanding from all its licensed brokers (CIFs) a full list of all their call centers worldwide. Many international financial firms have operations that are located around the world to gain from all types of local advantages. A typical firm can have its headquarters in Cyprus, a Chinese call center in Shenzhen, a media department in Israel and conduct software development in Eastern Europe, or any other such combination. This would allow an hypothetical firm to enjoy access to different markets with the best manpower and tools available globally. However, in a regulator’s eye this international spread can be a cause for alarm, as it places different aspects of the business in different jurisdictions, leading some functions to exist outside its gaze. To date, CySEC has not specified why they require to know about all the call centers of locally licensed brokers. It can be logically assumed that, next they would want brokers to make call centers either a tied agency or a wholly owned subsidiary. This way the licensed firms will bear full responsibility for the actions of the sales teams around the world and can not use “regulatory arbitrage” to their advantage. Cyprus has long been considered an international forex and binary options hub, with one of its reasons behind it is having a supportive legal and regulatory environment. In more recent times however, CySEC has been trying to shed its image of an “easy” regulator with higher fines on violators of its license and cooperating with foreign regulators against brokers operating from Cyprus. Finance Magnates has contacted CySEC about the latest development, its meaning and asked about possible following steps. We will update our readers when the commission clarifies this issue.
