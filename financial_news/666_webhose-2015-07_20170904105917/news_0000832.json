TheStreet found what treasures hid in the Overstock warehouses outside of Salt Lake City and on its website in search of the craziest things the retailer has to offer. Overstock made headlines this past week about the company's expansion into China and for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission about possibly issuing a public crypto security that would allow people to trade Overstock shares using bitcoin. But with earnings for Overstock coming on July 23, we wanted to find the craziest items that were behind the company's sales numbers. \nGrey Shark Quilted Cotton Oven Mitt ($8.99) \nWe told an intern to try out these mitts and bake us something to go with our coffee. The muffin tops were great, but unfortunately, oven mitts are now circling our office with little sign of backing down. A number of our interns have lost one or more limbs, and one intern with a punctured lung is currently unconscious due to excessive bleeding. We've called the Coast Guard, but they keep telling us the sharks on Wall Street are out of their jurisdiction.
