Ruben, played by Patrick Brammall, is the kind of character you'd like to introduce to Mick in a dark alley.\nThe film begins with a wild party at Ruben's designer house on Sydney Harbour, in celebration of his latest international advertising award. He's completely blotto and out of control, which is the final straw for his Czech supermodel girlfriend, Zoya​ (Abbey Lee), who packs a suitcase and leaves.\nNatalie Wood in a costume designed by Australian \"Jack\" Orry-Kelly in Women He's Undressed, the documentary based on the Hollywood designer's life. Distraught, but still in a drunken fuzz, Ruben jumps off his roof, aiming – slightly inaccurately – for the swimming pool. This is the cue for the real story to begin: the tale of a loud-mouth jerk with a broken arm who decides to give up the booze for a year to win back the woman he loves.\nDuring that time Ruben will reluctantly embrace the Alcoholics Anonymous program. He will begin to question his decadent lifestyle, and recognise the degree to which his family and friends are immersed in a rampant drinking culture.\nThere have been some brilliant movies about alcoholics. Billy Wilder's The Lost Weekend (1945) is the classic, but one might also look to Ed Harris' Pollock (2000) and James Ponsoldt's underrated Smashed (2012). I can't see Ruben Guthrie joining the honour roll.\nRuben's turn to sobriety doesn't make him any more likeable. Egocentric and shallow, he has now become sanctimonious as well.\n At home he is torn in different directions by his predatory gay friend, Damian (Alex Dimitriades), who comes to stay, and by a new-age girlfriend, Virginia (Harriet Dyer), whom he meets at AA. Meanwhile, he has to deal with the marriage problems of his wealthy parents (Robyn Nevin and Jack Thompson), after his dad takes off with a Korean kitchen hand who works in his waterside restaurant.\nBrendan Cowell's debut as a feature director is based on a play he wrote for Belvoir St Theatre in 2008, and the film retains traces of its stage origins. Ruben's house is pretty much a set – with a glittering mountain of bottles to symbolise his alcoholism, and a wall-sized photo of his girlfriend to underline her centrality in his life.\nIn the more naturalistic setting of the cinema these devices feel overstated. Not many AA members keep a fully stocked bar at home. Few new girlfriends would move into a house in which an entire wall was devoted to an image of the previous incumbent.\nSydney as city of excess Ruben Guthrie has been greeted with considerable fanfare, screening on the opening night of this year's Sydney Film Festival. It's a movie that paints a lurid picture of Sydney as a city given over to hedonistic excess, where money is worshipped and splashed around.\nIn contrast, the Melbourne Film Festival will open on July 30 with Paul Cox's Force of Destiny , a maudlin, low-budget drama about a sculptor who finds love while he is dying of cancer.\nThis comparison says everything one needs to know about the difference between Sydney and Melbourne.\nBoth films are also broadly autobiographical. Brendan Cowell has fought his own battles with alcohol, while Paul Cox has survived cancer by virtue of a liver transplant. The telling difference is that Cox is almost pathologically introspective, while Cowell is all surface. When Ruben feels unhappy with himself he tends to smash something – a glass, a phone, a laptop. It's a clumsy way of signifying a crisis.\nEveryone in this film is a caricature, a one-dimensional version of the people you might meet at an ad agency or a society function. Cowell has described the movie as a comedy, but although the gags keep coming they inspire a grimace rather than a laugh. When Ruben turns up for his first AA meeting and asks if tracksuits are obligatory attire, are we expected to smile at his high-handed attitude? Smart-alec behaviour isn't funny.\nSome of the worst moments take place at Ruben's agency where he is hailed as a genius, yet the only commercial we see, for the Vivid festival, provides little evidence.\nHis hyped-up boss, Ray (Jeremy Sims), showers Ruben with flattery, then tries to get him back on the turps. He teases his star performer by introducing him to Chet (Brenton Thwaites), a young, street-wise hotshot, waiting to take over his mantle. Words cannot describe the gruesomeness of this character.\nWhile the story is never allowed to drag, the triteness of the writing becomes progressively more exasperating.\nUltimately it's difficult to say whether Cowell intended to create a gallery of completely repulsive types, or hoped we might feel compassion for them. If the latter, there may be some truth in the idea that sobriety puts a brake on creativity.\nAlthough this movie is critical of Australia's love affair with alcohol, it made me long for a stiff drink.\nBright lights call Orry-Kelly, the subject of Gillian Armstrong's documentary Women He's Undressed , is one of Australia's unsung culture heroes. From 1932 to 1963 he designed the costumes for hundreds of Hollywood films, winning three Academy Awards. His credits include classics such as 42nd Street (1933), Jezebel (1938), The Maltese Falcon (1941), Casablanca (1942), and Oklahoma! (1955).\nBorn Orry George Kelly in 1897 in Kiama, NSW, the unusual name came from an ancient king of the Isle of Man, his father's lost homeland. In his early years Orry was known more prosaically as \"Jack\".\nHaving been sent to Sydney at the age of 17 to learn banking, Orry soon became preoccupied with the stage. He worked as an actor and a painter, creating murals and set designs. He also fell in with the city's homosexual subculture and, eventually, the criminal underworld. In 1921 he felt sufficiently threatened to take the radical step of relocating to New York.\nThere he eked out a living as a tailor's assistant while treading the boards in minor roles on Broadway. He also formed a relationship with a handsome, penniless young Englishman named Archie Leach. For years it was Orry who brought in the meagre income upon which the duo subsisted, until Archie's acting career took off – albeit under the name Cary Grant.\nFalling into bad company again, Orry fled New York to avoid trouble with gangsters. In 1931 he moved to Hollywood, where Grant helped him secure employment designing costumes for the studios.\nIt was one of the last times he would be assisted by his old protege, who was being transformed into a Hollywood leading man. The irony was that Grant had formed a new relationship with cowboy action hero Randolph Scott, which prospered until the studios decided these masculine idols needed to be separated and married off.\nOrry wasted no time in making his mark, becoming chief costume designer at Warner Brothers in 1932, where he would stay until 1944 when he had one too many disputes with studio boss Jack Warner.\nFrom this point his career was a roller-coaster of crashes and comebacks. His problems were exacerbated by alcoholism and by the huge pressures of being responsible for thousands of outfits a year.\nArtificial air Orry-Kelly, as he called himself, is a fabulous subject for a documentary. Not only does his career unfold like a movie, it provides the perfect excuse to show numerous clips from Hollywood's golden age and interview the stars who knew him personally.\nThe subtext of the film is the way Hollywood at first seemed to tolerate homosexuals, then turned to various forms of petty persecution. Under the Hays Code, which was brought down in 1930 and lingered until the 1960s, a new puritanism was imposed on the studios.\nOrry-Kelly was one of the few gay men who never pretended to be anything else, although he was secretive about his private life. His early relationship with Cary Grant, who would be married five times, was a taboo subject. Although Orry-Kelly wrote his memoirs, it is believed that Grant helped ensure they were never published.\nWith such priceless material it is hard to understand why Armstrong and scriptwriter Katherine Thomson would want to tell Orry-Kelly's story with actors, pantomime sets and a terrible air of artificiality. As a figure whose entire life was spent creating illusions, it is the reality of Orry-Kelly's life that commands our attention.\nDarren Gilshenan is enlisted to play Orry-Kelly, talking conspiratorially to the camera as if he had come back from the grave to be our tour guide. It's a dumb idea that would ruin a lesser story. The intrusions are so irritating it seems unbelievable the filmmakers couldn't see what a burden they were inflicting on the audience.\nThe problem, one suspects, is the desire to be innovative and creative with the documentary format.\nBut the great contemporary documentarists such as Alex Gibney understand that one need not rule out conventional approaches, no matter how many times they've been used in the past.\nBeing innovative just to be different is a recipe for disaster. In any work of art, the material must exert a decisive influence over the final form, whether we are taking about a documentary or an abstract painting.\nWe can be thankful the subject of this film is strong enough to survive the director's determined efforts to spoil her own party.\nRuben Guthrie\nWritten and directed by Brendan Cowell\nStarring Patrick Brammall, Abbey Lee, Alex Dimitriades, Harriet Dyer, Robyn Nevin, Jack Thompson, Jeremy Sims, Brenton Thwaites\nAustralia, rated MA 15+, 93 mins\nWomen He's Undressed\nDirected by Gillian Armstrong\nWritten by Katherine Thomson\nStarring Darren Gilshenan, Deborah Kennedy, Louis Alexander, Nathaniel Middleton, Lara Cox\nAustralia, rated PG, 99 mins", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:07:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
