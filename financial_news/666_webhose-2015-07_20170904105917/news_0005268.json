Supplied. Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Foreign citizens accounted for 9.4 per cent of all purchases of established homes in the second quarter of 2015, nearly double the expected level, according to National Australia Bank figures that are bound to intensify the debate on home ownership.\n\"We used to say about 5 per cent,\"NAB group chief economist Alan Osler told The Australian Financial Review on Tuesday. \"This time it's jumped up to about 9 per cent.\"\nThe figures also show that in Victoria, the most popular state for foreign investment, the 16.1 per cent foreign share of established home acquisition was nearly as high as the 16.7 per cent figure for new home purchases.\nThe majority of foreign investment focuses on newly built homes, as there are limits on non-Australian citizens buying established housing in order to keep prices affordable for locals.\nPermanent residents can buy established houses. Temporary residents can also buy established houses, but need to sell when they depart the country.\nThe federal government announced a range of measures in February to crack down on suspected unlawful acquisition of established properties, but NAB's figures for the three months to June raise questions about whether the rules are working.\n\"You can't prove it, because they're buying and might be selling,\" Mr Osler said. \"This is just saying there's quite a significant and growing interest in Asia in Australian property.\"\nNon-citizen purchases still focus overwhelmingly on apartments rather than standalone houses. In the apartment capital, Victoria - where the focus is on central Melbourne - foreigners accounted for 28.3 per cent of all new apartment purchases and a lower 17.5 per cent of established apartments.\n In NSW, foreign purchasers made up 16.5 per cent of all new apartment sales and 12.6 per cent of established ones. Foreigners accounted for 14.6 per cent of all new houses and 10.2 per cent of established ones.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-07-21T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:04:02.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
