Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) research suggests the gap could be even wider. \nJobseekers without a degree could earn up to £12,000 a year less than their graduate peers entering the job market, a report says the equivalent of more than £500,000 over an average working life. \nJobs website Adzuna, which analysed 1,000,000 vacancies in June, said there is a widening pay gap between graduates and non-graduates, although overall the opportunities are becoming better for both. \nThere were 62,750 entry level jobs available to graduates last month across the UK, a 15.7pc increase on 2014. \nMore than 350,000 graduates leaving university this summer are expected to apply for these positions, and on average there are 3.98 applicants to every graduate position - a figure which rises to over 35 in the more competitive regions of London and the South East. \nGraduates looking for highest paying entry level roles should head to Cambridge, where advertised vacancies can result in average pay close to £40,000, Adzuna says. Graduates in Cardiff can expect to earn significantly less than the national average. \nTop five graduate degrees by pay: *Civil engineering - £44,851 *Engineering - £42,837 *Computer science - £41,950 *Mechanical engineering - £39,106 *Mathematics - £39,019 However, there are lucrative career choices for those without degrees. The research found a large range of jobs paying upwards of £35,000 a year, including equities trading roles and air traffic controller positions. An equities trader is looking at an average salary of £59,475. \nMeanwhile, an air traffic controller could earn £41,011 a year. The minimum requirement is five GCSEs, including English and maths, although candidates can expect thorough psychometric testing as part of the qualification process. \nAir traffic controllers train for about a year and are taught to cope with pressure (Photo: Reuters) \nAccording to government statistics, graduates and postgraduates continue to have higher employment rates and are more likely to work in high-skilled jobs than non-graduates. \nFull-time employed, working-age graduates will earn an average of £31,000 this year , the government says, compared to £22,100 for non-graduates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:18:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
