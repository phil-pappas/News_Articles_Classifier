Philip Gostelow by Julie-anne Sprague It was just after 6pm on a typically hot February evening in Perth when 16-year-old Olivia Mead fielded a call from one of the nation's wealthiest and most private men, Michael Wright.\nWright, who had inherited lucrative Pilbara mining royalties secured by his dad Peter alongside Lang Hancock in the 1960s, was insisting he needed to see his fourth child; a child few people in Perth knew he had.\nMead, with her mother Elizabeth and stepfather Michael (Mick) Kirkby headed to the Hollywood Private Hospital in Nedlands.\n\"I got there and he [Wright] started crying,\" Olivia, now 19, recalls. \"He said that day he got told he didn't have long to live. I didn't say anything. I just sat there and cried. It was the first time I had ever seen him show emotion. It was the first time I'd ever seen him cry,\" she says.\nAFR graphic \"He said that night, 'Sorry for being such a bad father.' And he actually said 'Thank you' to my stepdad for raising me.\"\nWright, who had been diagnosed with stomach cancer in late 2011, died aged 74 on April 26, 2012.\nAt the hospital, he told Olivia that she and her mother, whom he'd dated for a little over a year in between his third and fourth marriages in the 1990s, would be looked after. But he would also tell her something that left her wondering what on earth he possibly meant.\n\"He told me to be prepared to fight,\" Olivia says. \"Mum, Mick and I talked about it [afterwards]. Now I sort of know what it meant,\" she continues. \"At the time I wasn't thinking about fighting anyone given my dad didn't have long to live.\"\n Whether the court brawl that did eventuate was what Wright meant remains a mystery, but either way Olivia would end up fighting. And hard.\nWright, with an estimated $1.5 billion fortune , left Olivia a highly conditional $3 million trust that she could not access until she was 30. She would rail against it. So fierce was her determination, she would drag her notoriously private half-sisters, Alexandra Burt and Leonie Baldock, who inherited more than $400 million each, into the West Australian Supreme Court.\nOlivia felt it was desperately unfair for Wright to have left her a trust spiked with so many conditions that she was worried she would end up with nothing.\nWith her anonymity blown by the court proceedings, she would become the subject of intense ridicule as Perth's shocked chattering classes mocked the teenager's expressed desires for a $US1.2 million Kuhn-Bosendorfer piano, a $250,000 Ritter Royal Flora Aurum bass guitar (the world's most expensive), Jimmy Choo shoes, Tiffany sunglasses, a $100,000 wedding, a $2.5 million home, a rabbit, a ferret, a dog. An axolotl.\nOlivia collected emotional scars and lost any desires she once held to become a journalist. But she emerged the victor. In February, the court awarded the Notre Dame University student a staggering $25 million lump sum payment, more than twice the $12 million her own legal team had suggested was an appropriate.\n'I just saw it and cried' But the war is not won. Baldock and Burt's lawyers, Clifford Chance, have lodged an appeal on behalf of the executor of Wright's estate, David Lemon. It is unlikely an outcome will be determined this year. But the Wright family has granted their half-sister a concession. In May, Wright's estate paid Olivia $3 million . WA's Court of Appeal will determine whether a further $22 million must follow.\nIn an exclusive interview with AFR Weekend , Olivia opens up about growing up in Perth's working-class suburbs, her relationship with Wright and the fallout from the case that left a shy, gentle-natured teenager nursing accusations that she was little more than a money-hungry brat.\n\"I didn't really know it was going to be this bad,\" Olivia says, as we talk in the boardroom at law firm Eastwood Sweeney Law, which has become almost her second home over the past 2½ years. She sips her coffee bought at the nearby Dome coffee shop.\nThe passionate Fremantle Dockers supporter is wearing black jeans, a black-and-white striped T-shirt and a blue denim jacket. Her jean cuffs are turned up and you can just make out a tattoo of planet Earth just above her right ankle.\nOver the three hours we chat, it becomes clear that Olivia, who is softly spoken and a little bit goofy, is a pretty normal university student. She likes pulling funny faces and impersonating celebrities and politicians, such as former US president Bill Clinton. Her favourite band is Fleetwood Mac; she likes Canadian hardcore band Alexisonfire but she has also been to a One Direction concert. Yet very, very few in her cohort would have such an intriguing story to tell.\n\"I honestly thought no one would care, so the next day when my face was on the front page of the newspaper [ The West Australian ] I thought, 'What has just happened?' I just saw it and just cried,\" Olivia says of her reaction to the media coverage of February's court case. \"It was so bad. They [the media] even took pictures of my boyfriend and they started calling up his family. I just thought, why?\"\nHer 21-year-old boyfriend would not return to the courtroom. Nor would her stepfather, who found it difficult to watch Olivia being peppered with questions from the barrister for the Wright family, Jane Needham, SC, president of the NSW Bar Association.\nFive months later, people still snigger at Olivia. \"People have been really mean to me,\" she says. \"People I literally thought were my friends. On social media, I had people saying things like, 'I guess you never really know someone.' I had people calling me up and telling me what people were saying about me.\n\"I had people calling me up and abusing me. People who I thought were my friends in high school have pretty much been the worst. They have honestly been horrible.\"\nFor a couple of months, she pulled down her Facebook page.\nDifficult father figure Olivia Mead was born on September 3, 1995, in St John of God Murdoch Hospital, in Perth's southern suburbs. Her father wasn't present.\nWright, a notorious ladies' man who'd already churned through three marriages, had abruptly cut contact with Olivia's mother, Elizabeth, or Liz to her friends, several months before Olivia's birth. It would be nine months before Wright would see his daughter for the first time – some six months after the results of a DNA test proved him to be her father.\nThe billionaire was, by all accounts, a complex, contradictory man. Some believed him to be generous, but he could also be mean. He could be thoughtful, but he also had fixed views on how things should be done and how people should behave. He could certainly be difficult.\nThe eldest son of Peter Wright, Michael, and his reclusive sister Angela Bennett, had inherited a fortune estimated by BRW to be worth more than a combined $3 billion, largely from the iron ore-rich Pilbara dirt their father had pegged in the 1950s alongside his business partner and former schoolmate, Lang Hancock.\nOlivia's grandfather, Peter, who died a decade before her birth, was not flamboyant or outspoken like Hancock. Those that knew him say he was diplomatic and mild-mannered.\nThe Wrights have continued that reputation for being reserved: they're intensely private and media-shy. When Michael Wright and his sister successfully took on Hancock's daughter, Gina Rinehart, in 2007, to snatch a 25 per cent share in the Rhodes Ridge iron ore deposit, Bennett went to extraordinary lengths to protect her identity. She got access to a tenants' car park underneath the WA Supreme Court and hid from photographers under a towel. Two of her sons stopped journalists from entering the elevator with her.\nBennett and Wright, who had fallen out over the direction of the family company, would join forces for legal disputes against Rinehart, but these Wright family litigations are almost always focused on the business interests. Wright and Bennett would also settle with the son and daughter of their brother, Julian Wright, who had sold his one-third interest in the family company for just $6.8 million after Peter Wright's death. His kids, Natalie and Timothy, netted an extra estimated $50 million in a dispute that was settled out of court.\nMeanwhile, the Wrights have been spectators to the dramatic airing of the Hancock family's dirty linen as Gina Rinehart and two of her children fight incessantly over the family assets. They were able to avoid that kind of publicity. Until now.\nThe hardest time When Liz met Michael Wright in 1993 she didn't know he was wealthy.\nShe was working for liquor distributor Lionel Samson selling wines, including Wright's Voyager Estate label from a sprawling premium winery in Margaret River that featured several South African Cape Dutch style buildings and a stunning large walled \" werf \" garden, an Afrikaans word meaning yard.\nLiz was 30 and a single mother to two girls aged nine and 11. She remained a single mum for the first 13 years of Olivia's life, before entering a relationship with Mick Kirkby in 2008, a police officer (now retired). They married in 2013. Kirkby is a traffic warden with Main Roads, managing cargo being transported to the state's far north.\nWright could be charming. \"I quite liked him because he liked me,\" Liz says. \"We got on very well. He was quite charismatic.\"\nShe would strike up a conversation with Wright at the WA hospitality industry's 1993 Gold Plate Awards, held at the former Burswood Casino, now Crown. She made an impression; he invited her to lunch. The following year, on Christmas Eve, Liz found out she was pregnant.\n\"He was quite pleased in the beginning,\" says Liz, who was unsure if he would help raise their baby. \"Everything was fine until probably May or June 1995 and he stopped speaking to me,\" she recalls. \"I rang a few times and left messages. I knew I was going to have no job, no car.\"\nWhile upset, Liz wasn't surprised. Wright could be difficult, she says. When Olivia was born, Liz rang Wright's assistant, Melanie Williams, to let him know. He arranged for flowers to be sent to Liz's home but by the time she got home from the hospital they were dead.\n\"I went on Centrelink. That was the hardest time,\" Liz says. \"It was hard on the big girls. We'd gone from a reasonable life [where] I was on pretty good money as a [sales] rep and we had the company car.\"\nShe recalls ringing Wright not long after completing her daughter's DNA test when Olivia was about three months old. \"I did ring him to have a go at him,\" Liz says. \"The DNA test requires a lot of blood from a baby and I rang him to tell him what I thought of him for putting her through that.\"\nIt would be another six months before Wright would hold his daughter for the first time, at a meeting with Liz at Kings Park, Perth's sprawling bushy park, high on a hill that towers over the city. It is a major attraction and a gathering place for both tourists and residents.\n\"He was very taken with her,\" Liz says. Yet things would get more difficult. A month later, when Liz approached her employer about returning to work as a liquor salesperson, it was suggested by the distributor that it was better that she didn't \"because Michael was Michael\".\nLiz says, \"I didn't go back. I didn't really want to go back anyway because we were selling his wine.\"\nBut she would end up getting a job cleaning a Police and Community Youth Centre in Claremont, mopping floors and cleaning toilets. \"I had to take what I could get,\" she says.\nDespite his enormous wealth, Wright would pay just the bare minimum in child support, about $20,000 a year.\nHe bought Olivia a birthday present just five times – on her fourth, fifth, sixth, 12th and 13th birthdays – and he attended her sixth birthday party as well as going along to her 13th \"black and bling\" birthday celebration.\nPrivate but not secret The media painted Olivia as a \"secret love child\", but she contends she was never hidden. Both families were private but she was never a secret. She says, \"I think the people that were close to dad knew about me and the people that thought they were close to dad and didn't know about me obviously weren't as close to dad as they thought.\"\nBut it was hardly a cohesive family. Olivia would not meet her stepsisters Alexandra Burt and Leonie Baldock until the day of their father's funeral in 2012. She met her stepbrother Myles briefly while visiting her ill dad at his Mosman Park mansion, which overlooks the Indian Ocean. The three are the children from Michael's marriage with his second wife, Jennifer, who died last year.\nThe Mosman Park house is now owned by fourth wife Mary Ann, who also sued Burt and Baldock after disputing the property assets Wright left her. The matter was settled out of court last year.\nMyles, 36, has always been nice to her, Olivia says. But they've not struck up a friendship, despite both having a deep passion for music and crossing paths at her university, where Myles teaches music theatre classes.\n\"I have seen him a couple of times at Notre Dame,\" Olivia says. \"We just walk past each other and pretend like we don't know each other. It's just the way it is. I'm not too disappointed or anything. It's alright.\"\nHer older half-sisters are old enough to be her mother. The eldest, Leonie, 43, has taken carriage of the family's Wright Prospecting business. Married to financial planner Tim Baldock, the couple have two children, Max and Keeley, and live in a two-storey home in Attadale.\nThe suburb may not have the glitz and glam of Dalkeith, where Rinehart resides, or be as eye-catching as Cottesloe, home to Andrew Forrest, and the house may not be anywhere near as grand as the mansion Leonie's aunt Angela Bennett sold for $57.5 million in 2009 (which set a national property record that is still current today) but the Baldock home is close to the tip of Point Walter with views to the Swan River.\nLeonie's sister, Alexandra, 41, is married to Julian Burt, whose great-great-grandfather Septimus Burt paid for the construction of the Burt Memorial Hall at St George's Cathedral. Septimus was the son of Sir Archibald Burt, WA's first chief justice. Alexandra lives in a gated block of townhouses in Claremont, a wealthy suburb in Perth's leafy western suburbs.\nBut again, it's hardly an overt show of wealth. The Burts aren't cruising to Rottnest Island, the holiday island off Perth's coast, in a 35-metre super yacht like Tim Roberts, who also inherited about $400 million from a fortune amassed by his late construction magnate father, John Roberts.\nAside from his lavish winery, Michael Wright lived relatively modestly. He drove an old Volvo. One story has it that he drove it to its death, clocking up 600,000 kilometres before having to get another car.\nOlivia too is relatively modest. The 1994 Toyota Corolla she lovingly calls Stephen (after Stephen King) is on its last legs. Her stepdad, Mick, bought it for her for about $2500.\nFlush with cash, Olivia has splashed out and will soon own a Honda HR-V (she will call it Hadleigh). It retails for about $30,000 and is less than half the price of an Audi, the car that, along with a new Tarago - Michael Wright had bought Liz one as a family car when Olivia was two - Olivia had jotted down on the courtroom wish-list her lawyers had asked her to draft to establish her needs.\nIt's hardly a Ferrari, which Master Craig Sanderson noted in his judgment would probably have featured on a wish-list by a 19-year-old boy.\nNo time for leaners Myles declined a request for an interview, as did his sisters. Myles was not, in comparison with his sisters, bequeathed a massive fortune by his father. Instead, Michael Wright left his son the ability to collect $650,000 a year until the fifth year after his death, when he would receive a $15 million payment, taking his payout to as much as $18.2 million.\nThis is presumably because Myles opted not to be part of the family business.\nIn court, Alexandra Burt would reveal that her father was disappointed but \"not necessarily surprised\" by Myles not wanting to be part of the family business. His love was music; Myles is a composer.\nOlivia's silk, Lindsay Ellison, SC, asked Alexandra during the trial if Wright wanted people going to university to study \"something useful\" such as accounting, medicine or law. She replied, \"Yes.\"\n\"He wanted them to do proper degrees?\" Ellison continued.\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\"Presumably not to, perhaps, not to do arts or that sort of field orientated but traditional professional degrees. At that time he would have put arts in that non-traditional definition?\" Again, Alexandra replied, \"Yes.\"\nAlexandra has taken over Voyager Estate and is also the patron of the WA Ballet, an arts organisation supported by Wright, who would also donate funds to educational institutions including Christ Church Grammar and St Hilda's.\nShe would reveal in court that growing up in the Wright household was bizarrely business-like. There were family meetings that required minutes to be taken and reports to be prepared and delivered.\n\"Even something as non-business orientated or trivial or familial as talking about joining a tennis club ends up on a formal memorandum and you reply to it very formally yourself, correct?\" Ellison asked.\n\"On that occasion I did,\" she said.\nEllison went on: \"You concluded the letter by saying, 'I hope this satisfies your requirements for my physical wellbeing'.\" Alexandra replied: \"It was meant in jest.\"\nShe would reveal her father was better at relating to adults than children and could be tough to deal with. \"At times he could be distant?\" Ellison asked. \"Yes,\" came the reply.\n\"At times, and this is just his make-up, he could overlook what you might think and what others might think are basic fatherly or parental responsibilities and obligations?\"\n\"At times,\" she answered.\n\"He wanted people, in the language of certain people in today's society, to be lifters not leaners?\" he asked.\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\"He could be brutal in the way he conveyed his thoughts or his feelings to you?\"\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n'We did it really tough' A rare ABC radio interview conducted with Michael Wright in July 2011, less than a year before his death, contains some clues as to his make-up. He revealed that he wished he could have changed his parents. His father, he said, was \"very manipulative\" – not aggressive, but instead he used \"kindness, generosity and reassurance\". Wright, however, believed his father set the bar unreasonably high.\nHis mother, he said, was violent. They never got along.\nWright didn't think to read to his own children, because it was something he had never experienced. \"There are defects in the way I behave as a parent because I miss things, rather than because I was cruel,\" he told ABC 720.\nOlivia remembers Michael's contrariness and meanness. She didn't live with him but saw him every few months or so. He would take her to boat shows, the ballet (and go to Hungry Jack's afterwards) or she would visit his Mosman Park home.\n\"Sometimes it was OK but most of the time I would usually come home in tears,\" Olivia says. \"We would usually say before he came to pick me up, 'I hope he's in a good mood today.' He would either be nasty or matter-of-fact.\"\nAt times he was just plain mean. \"I remember when I was 10 he told me to lose weight,\" Olivia says. \"He patted me on the stomach and told me to lose the 'chub'. He couldn't talk to me like I was a child. He didn't know how to interact with children at all.\"\nOlivia is studying a bachelor of communications, majoring in film and screen production. She at one point studied commerce – no doubt her dad would have been proud. The problem was, as she freely admits, she's really not that good at mathematics.\nShe's enjoying her study and like so many university students is filled with dreams and ideal jobs. She wants to film music videos and film montages for a wedding blog like Hello May. Eventually she wants to become a director of photography.\nOlivia reveals she also wants to establish a charity to help single mothers. \"We did it really tough,\" she says, before confiding, \"There was one point [where] Mum and I were living out of our car.\"\nIn fact, says Liz, it was just one night they spent in the car (in the Tarago Michael had bought Liz). But Liz remembers another occasion when Michael was about to buy a house for them in suburban Bentley. But then, she says, the seller wanted another $5000. Michael pulled out.\nThe family now lives in a modest four-bedroom home in Cannington which Liz proudly reveals she and Mick own outright, quipping \"How many people in the western suburbs own their own home?\"\nBut it's probably not surprising that Olivia now says she wants to be able to help struggling single mums find jobs and provide care packages that include things such as nappies.\nOlivia's dad hadn't particularly liked school. In her earlier years, Olivia too found things difficult. She was teased during her time at a Catholic primary school in Perth's southern suburbs. She thinks it was because she was \"obsessed with music\".\n\"I was in the choir,\" Olivia says. \"I was in a band. I used to skip religion and maths to go do music lessons. I loved music. It was my life. It still is.\" In other words, she was a card-carrying member of the glee club.\nShe says she can't actually sing but she can play the bass guitar, which she's played for years, aided by a $400 Yamaha bass guitar Wright bought her when she was nine years old – one of the few gifts he would buy her.\nBut Olivia would never fight going to school, Liz says. She wasn't a sook. When it came to deciding on a high school, though, Liz was determined not to send her daughter where the girls from her primary school were bound.\nOlivia's half-sisters had gone to St Hilda's, one of Perth's most exclusive girls' schools. Wright offered to send Olivia to other private schools – Iona or Mercedes. But Liz, worried about Olivia's troubling time at primary school, was concerned she would not be able to provide her daughter with the things she might need to fit in, let alone fund any extracurricular activities her potential new friends may do. Instead, Olivia went to St Norbert Catholic College in Queens Park, about 10 kilometres south of Perth CBD.\nWorlds apart Most of the stories Olivia tells about her father highlight his odd nature, his difficulty relating to children and his failings as a dad. She couldn't count on him. But she's not bitter; she's warm in the way she discusses him. \"I loved him a lot,\" Olivia says. \"He was still my dad.\"\nHe didn't buy her mother lavish gifts but Liz remembers that he carried around a cigarette lighter even though he didn't smoke; it was so he could light her cigarettes.\nOlivia didn't know the extent of her father's fortune but says she always had a sense he was wealthy. His large house was the giveaway. But it was when she went to Voyager Estate for the first time, when she was a 12-year-old, that she got a sense of the scale of his wealth. \"I think I was like, 'Whoa!'\" she says.\nAt times she got mad and she felt left out: \"It made me quite angry because he was always going away and going to these places all the time,\" Olivia says. \"I thought, 'We are stuck here in this position barely being able to pay for our rent and our food and stuff and you're gallivanting around the world while we are like this.'\"\nShe remembers a card he sent her when she was about eight years old. It contained a photograph of Wright with Mary Ann taken while they were travelling in Europe. It looked as if they were in a first-class cabin on a train. At the time, the family home – then in Canning Vale – had been broken into.\n\"They are smiling, you can see the food on the table and I just remember looking at this photo and thinking, 'Why do I want to see this?'\" Olivia says. \"I thought, 'That's not cool.'\"\nLiz remembers that Michael bought Olivia a mascot when he went to the Sydney Olympics in 2000. Olivia was five. \"He went to the Olympics and brought back the mascot,\" she says. \"I thought, 'Well, you could have taken her.' But he got her a mascot [which she still has].\"\nFamily ties and a tie Wright was hardly father of the year to any of his kids. But he would show affection in his own way. During the Wright family's 2007 court dispute with Gina Rinehart, Wright behaved oddly, throwing his tie over his shoulder and taking photographs of the assembled media photographers with his own camera.\nLiz reveals he took issue with a journalist who had quipped that, for a man with so much money, he could afford a better tie. It turns out he was wearing a blue and yellow tie Olivia had bought him for about $40. \"He loved it and he wore it,\" Liz says.\nOlivia turned up to her court case wearing clothes borrowed from her sisters and her best friend. She appeared single-minded, walking past the throng of television cameras and news photographs with a stern, resolved face.\nHer stepdad Mick had told her to hold her nerve, look straight ahead and keep walking. Taking the Wrights to court was a bold move but one she felt she had to do. For a start, she had to make a claim within six months of probate.\nHer uncle, Liz's brother, was a close friend of Perth lawyer Cameron Sweeney and asked for advice. Sweeney was in business with Cameron Eastwood, an estate lawyer. The wheels were set in motion. \"To this day I think it was the right decision,\" Olivia says.\nYet to most, getting $3 million is akin to winning the lottery. \"It wasn't just $3 million in your pocket and that's it,\" Olivia replies firmly. \"People seem to think I just got $3 million and I was a millionaire straight away and life was great. People need to learn how to read properly.\"\nWright set up the trust for Olivia but attached a number of conditions to it; some of them, Master Craig Sanderson would write in his judgment, were just plain \"strange\".\nThe trust was to provide \"up to\" $3 million, wording that Olivia's team believed created a ceiling but no floor. The Wrights felt differently and believed that by the time Mead turned 30 there would be $3 million available to her.\nAt the time of the case, there was a $740,000 industrial property in O'Connor generating some rent, which was paid to Olivia. Sanderson said it was not clear what the phrase \"up to a maximum amount of $3 million\" actually meant.\nThere was also the ability for David Lemon to distribute all of the trust funds to a charity. Sanderson felt that would be unlikely but noted it was a possibility and \"another odd feature of the trust\". But the conditions would go much further: Sanderson called them oppressive.\nIf Olivia at any time was suspected (not proven) of having any involvement in illegal drugs, suffered a conviction relating to drugs, which would include drink driving, she would become an \"excluded person\" and lose the trust. Despite her father not liking religion, he included a clause that said she could not \"in any other way\" be involved with a religious body unless it was \"Roman Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian, Baptist, Uniting or other similar traditional faiths\".\nSanderson found this particular clause \"most egregious\", noting: \"Most Australians would regard freedom of religion as part of their birthright. The plaintiff in order to be sure the trust would vest in her when she turned 30 would have to give up that basic human right. That is an extraordinary proposition.\"\nThe clause left Olivia fuming. \"What he wanted was crazy,\" she says. \"Who can tell someone they can't talk to someone just because they are from a particular religion? I go to uni with people that are Muslim, Buddhist, everything. If I get partnered with them for an assignment does that mean I can't do an assignment with them? Just because I want some money?\n\"That is against a person's human right. It's trying to control me from the grave. No one can think that's fair.\"\nCourtroom shock Olivia and Liz are frustrated that people took a simplistic view of the case – that Olivia was unhappy with $3 million and wanted more. Liz says it was \"outrageous\" the way her daughter was portrayed because they believed it was likely Olivia would actually get nothing from his estate.\n\"There was no $3 million,\" Liz says, adding that the wish-list Olivia had to compile – and which attracted such mockery – was for an actuary and included a range of other standard living expenses.\nOne source suggested Olivia was chasing $200 million, a figure she rejects. \"No, we never really had a limit. It was just take it how it goes,\" she says.\nOlivia's case could have far-reaching consequences. There was a collective gasp in the courtroom when Sanderson awarded Olivia $25 million – the biggest court-ordered estate payout in Australian history. It blew open debates across dinner tables about whether it was fair for a court to overturn the wishes of the deceased.\nLawyers warn that Sanderson's finding could trigger appeals in other estate decisions and has forced many wealthy families to re-examine their affairs. This was because they believed Sanderson focused on the size of the estate, which he described as colossal, and on what was proper, or moral.\n\"There's always been black sheep and children [who] people may not want to provide for,\" McCullough Robertson wills and estates partner Scott Whitla told AFR Weekend .\nWhitla says provisions must still be made for those children and, until now, the advice has been to carve out an adequate provision rather than what may be proper.\n\"We would give clients advice that you have a duty to provide adequately. So maybe a roof over someone's head and a small income,\" Whitla says.\n\"What this [decision] does is it says in big estates it is more than that. It is about what is proper. It's making sure there's the roof over their head, providing a nest egg and maybe making sure they get to wear nice shoes,\" he says.\n\"That's the change in the mindset.\"\nIn most estate disputes, the size of the estate is not large enough to accommodate the needs of all the parties with a claim. This is why courts assess the \"need\" of claimants to determine how to carve up the estate pie. The trouble with this case was the pie was infinite; it was an all-you-can-eat smorgasbord.\nOlivia's legal team asked her to compile a list of things she might need and want over a lifetime. It included everything from curtains to stockings but it was the more extravagant items that made its way on to the list that were pounced on by the defendants' barrister, Jane Needham SC, during the trial.\nAs damaging as it was for Olivia, her legal team contend it was necessary. In his judgment, Sanderson wrote that the one factor that influenced him most in determining what to award Olivia was the size of the estate, which he put was worth more than $800 million.\n'It's all worth it' Olivia is hoping that after she's told her story, things can go back to normal. That perhaps the sniggering may stop. But she doesn't regret going in to battle. \"Yes, it's all worth it. Definitely.\"\nRecently, she got to go to the Pilbara for the first time, courtesy of Channel Seven's Sunday Night program, which has filmed a television interview that will air on Sunday.\n\"I thought it [the Pilbara] was beautiful,\" she says. \"It was emotional. If it wasn't for that place I wouldn't be in the position that I am today. But it's hard when you didn't know your grandfather.
