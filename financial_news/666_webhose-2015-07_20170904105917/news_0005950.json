If we take our money out of chests and from our homes - where they are not safe in any case - and we deposit them in the banks, we will strengthen the liquidity of the economy,\" she told Skai television on Sunday.\nSigmar Gabriel, economy minister of Germany, the biggest contributor to eurozone bailouts, said the deal could succeed where previous ones failed because the European Union now emphasises growth and investment rather than just austerity.\nIt would depend on reforms being enacted and \"convincing the population that this is a path that allows Greece to assert itself rather than becoming a permanent alms-receiver,\" he said in extracts from a television interview.\nFrench President Francois Hollande, who pushed hard for a deal, said the Greek crisis had weakened Europeans' faith in the European project and revived calls for the creation of a euro zone government.\n\"What threatens us is not an excess of Europe but its insufficiency,\" Hollande wrote in an op-ed in the Journal du Dimanche weekly newspaper.\nDEPOSIT BOXES\nThe deal struck at a euro zone summit last week allowed the European Central Bank to top up emergency credit lines which the Greek banking sector needs to survive.\n\"The banks are ready to open and we don't expect any major problems on Monday,\" an official at the Central Bank of Greece told Reuters.\nAs well as getting a weekly limit instead of a daily one, customers will also be able to access their safety deposit boxes and withdraw money without a credit card.\nDeposit boxes are not affected by the capital restrictions and clients can therefore take whatever they want from them, bank officials said. But restrictions on transfers abroad and other capital controls remain in place.\n\"The banks are ready and they will open all their branches on Monday,\" a senior official at Piraeus Bank, Greece's second-largest bank by assets, told Reuters.\n\"There might be queues because many people will want to withdraw money from their deposit boxes.\"\nOne official at EFG Eurobank, the country's third-largest bank by assets, said the bank was expecting long queues in the first two or three days.\n\"We might have some minor problems with bank cheques that have expired in the last two weeks, but this is something that the government should decide on,\" the official said.\nAcceptance of the bailout terms that allowed for the banks to reopen marked a turnaround for Tsipras after months of difficult talks and a referendum that rejected a less stringent deal proposed by the lenders. But opinion polls suggest the prime minister's popularity remains high.\nThe VAT increases that will come into force from Monday are among a series of reforms demanded by creditors, many of whom have expressed doubt the government would keep its promises.
