The aim is to make the world’s second-largest economy a more efficient one, where money gets to its most productive areas.\n“The size of the potential capital flows here may be very large,” Stevens said, adding that it’s very hard to predict how big they’ll be.\nDepth, Quality “But if such flows did happen, it’s going to be very important that the depth and the quality of financial markets in China and around the rest of Asia that might be receiving flows continues to develop,” he said. “That’s a big challenge but one worth meeting and one that would bring considerable benefits both for China, their savers, and also for investors around the region and around the world.”\nAustralia’s links with China have tightened as exports to what is now its largest trading partner almost quadrupled in five years. It exports 5.8 percent of its gross domestic product to China, more than the combined 4.7 percent France sends to Germany and Italy, data from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund compiled by Bloomberg show.\nThe RBA has one of three international offices in Beijing - - solely for economic analysis, rather than for trading, which is the main function of the New York and London locations. The RBA has a team of about 10 analysts to focus on China and India.", "external_links": ["http://english.boaoforum.org/\\"], "published": "2015-07-30T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T07:12:33.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
