It could be at any moment.\"\nThe central bank's next scheduled meeting is Sept. 21.\nMexico's peso extended gains slightly following Carstens comments.\nThe peso firmed more than 1 percent after authorities boosted daily dollar auctions on Thursday and the central bank had suggested it could move outside its regular calendar.
