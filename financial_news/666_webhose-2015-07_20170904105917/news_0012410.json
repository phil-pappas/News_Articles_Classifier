But with the price of oil and metals like gold and silver at their lowest levels in years, fewer clients are awarding contracts for engineering, management, and other services. Fluor now expects a profit of $4.05 to $4.35 per share in 2015. It had forecast a profit of $4.40 to $5 per share. \nThe company's second-quarter net income and revenue both fell short of Wall Street estimates. Fluor reported smaller profits for its industrial and infrastructure business, which serves industries including mining and transportation and manufacturing, and for its power business, which serves power companies. \nFluor shares lost $4.07, or 8 percent, to $46.83 in afternoon trading. The stock has fallen 36 percent over the past year. \nAnalysts remained optimistic about Fluor's prospects in spite of the results, however. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Tahira Afzal said she thinks oil and gas project activity could increase again because the costs of those projects are falling rapidly. She wrote that that change could result in large new projects for Fluor. Jefferies & Co. analyst Luke Folta said the company expects to book some major contracts later this year and in 2016. \nBoth analysts rate the shares at \"Buy\" or the equivalent. Afzal cut her price target to $68 from $74 and Folta lowered his to $67 from $75. \nAccording to FactSet, 15 analysts report \"Buy\" ratings on Fluor shares and seven have \"Hold\" ratings.
