God bless our people,\" he said. \nForeign ministers of Iran and the six powers, including ministers from Britain and the US, have started meeting in Vienna to ratify the deal which has taken months to finalise. \nThey are then expected to hold a press conference in the Austrian capital at which the details will be released. \nIran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif welcomed the deal, saying: \"I believe this is a historic moment. Today could have been the end of hope, but now we are starting a new chapter of hope.\" \nThe EU's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the deal provided an opportunity to open a new chapter in international relations. \nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a long-standing critic of the talks, described the deal as a bad mistake of historic proportions. \nHe said: \"Iran is going to receive a sure path to nuclear weapons. Many of the restrictions that were supposed to prevent it from getting there will be lifted. \n\"Iran will get a jackpot, a cash bonanza of hundreds of billions of dollars, which will enable it to continue to pursue its aggression and terror in the region and in the world,\" he added. \nUS President Barack Obama is expected to make a statement on Iran at noon UK time. \n:: Sources are saying that the deal includes a compromise between Washington and Tehran that will allow UN inspectors to request visits to Iranian military sites as part of their monitoring duties, but not have an automatic right to visit whenever they choose. \n:: In the event that Iran refuses a request to visit, an arbitration board composed of Iran and the six world powers will have to decide on whether a visit should go ahead. \n:: Analysts say that the lack of an automatic right to visit is likely to be seized upon by critics, as it could give Tehran time to cover up any non-compliance by the time a visit takes place. \n:: A concession by Iran is that missile sanctions will not be lifted for another eight years and a general weapons embargo will remain in place for another five years. \n:: But Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said that during the five years deliveries of arms to Iran would be possible if the UN Security Council approves the import. \n:: According to Russia, Iran has been allowed to continue nuclear enrichment and researching centrifuges in a manner that does not allow it to accumulate enriched uranium. \n:: Iran said it will slash by around two-thirds the number of centrifuges from around 19,000 to 6,104 and will stick at this number for 10 years. A total of 1,044 of the centrifuges will be used for other purposes than uranium enrichment. \n:: In the event that Iran breaches the agreement, a 'snapback' clause is in place that will allow sanctions to be reinstated within 65 days of Iranian non-compliance, Reuters reported. \n:: A roadmap has been drawn up to tackle remaining issues, which will be resolved by the end of 2015, including the issue of access to the Parchin military base, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. \nMany other countries welcomed the deal, hopeful that it could unlock trade after years of being unable to do business with Iran because of international sanctions. \nTehran and the six world powers have been holding marathon negotiations at the ministerial level for more than a fortnight to resolve a 12-year stand-off. \nThe six countries are Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States. \nThe West has long been concerned that Iran holds ambitions to build a nuclear bomb. Tehran says its nuclear programme is purely to generate energy for civilian purposes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:01:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
