Gross domestic product expanded 7.4 percent in 2014, the slowest pace since 1990, and weakened further in the first three months of this year. \nBut the International Monetary Fund said Thursday that there was no reason to lose faith in China's economy because of the bursting stock market bubble. \n-- Greek relief -- \nThe oil market was focused also on Greece amid hopes debt-strapped nation would reach a deal with its creditors after Athens laid out details Thursday of a new bailout plan to save it from financial collapse. \nThe package involves a pensions overhaul and tax hikes in return for debt relief and a rescue loan from the eurozone. \nTraders are also keeping an eye on negotiations in Vienna between western powers and Iran on a deal to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions and allow the lifting of punishing sanctions. \nGlobal powers leading the negotiations sought to ramp up the pressure for a deal, but Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hit back, saying Western countries among the so-called P5+1 group on the other side of the talks were backtracking on previous commitments. \nA lifting of sanctions will allow Iranian oil to flow back into the global market, adding to a supply glut and helping depress prices, according to analysts. \nMeanwhile US commercial crude stockpiles rose another 400,000 barrels to 465.8 million barrels in the week to July 3, even as refineries picked up activity. Gasoline inventories also jumped, with the summer holiday driving season in full swing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T21:14:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
