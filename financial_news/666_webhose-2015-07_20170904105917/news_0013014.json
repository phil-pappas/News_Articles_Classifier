While a solid scorer — he averaged 12.6 points per game in the regular season and more than 17 per game in the playoffs — the six-foot-eight forward’s reputation is as a defender.\nDoes he consider himself tough?\n“If you see me in a fight with a bear, you’d better help that bear,” he famously said last season.\nCarroll broke the news of his own signing on social media, putting a note on his Twitter account that included an Instagram photo of him and family members beaming next to Ujiri, Casey and Toronto executive vice-president Jeff Weltman.\nBecause the league forbids teams from officially making transactions until the 2016-17 salary cap is officially set July 9, no one connected with the Raptors can comment publicly on the deal.\nNor can they comment on the departure of beloved power forward Amir Johnson, who reportedly agreed to a two-year, $24 million deal in Boston that just hastened an inevitable departure from the Raptors.\nNow with Johnson’s salary fully off the books, Ujiri could have up to $10 million to spend and several ways to even add to that total.\nThe cap for the coming season has not yet been set and reports suggest it might rise from an expected $67 million to more than $69 million. Until that is known — and isn’t likely to be confirmed until July 9 — the Raptors did not have to renounce the rights to Johnson in order to fit Carroll into the scene and still have a decision to make on Lou Williams, as Ujiri does a remake on the fly to set up more balance between offence and defence.\nThe moving financial picture may allow Toronto to stay in the hunt for other free agents they covet.\nIt’s unlikely they would have the money or the overall situation to pry Portland power forward LaMarcus Aldridge away from the clutches of the San Antonio Spurs, who are now seen as favourites to obtain his services.\nBut there are other objects of their desire who remain on the radar.\nThey have interest in Wesley Matthews of the Trail Blazers, free agent David West remains a person of interest and local product Cory Joseph remains an intriguing possibility as a low-cost backup.\nThere is no question Carroll fills one of the gaping holes in Toronto’s roster and should be seen as a precursor to moves to shore up to other weaknesses: Starting power forward and backup point guard.\nCarroll will unquestionably supplant Terrence Ross as the team’s starting small forward and now with a glut there of Carroll, Ross and James Johnson, trades become a distinct possibility.\nTeam and league sources have said for days the Raptors would be open to trading to fill one of their holes and now with a surplus at one spot, it becomes a more likely scenario.\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays pound Bosox in Canada Day rout\nCareer highlights of new Pittsburgh Penguin Phil Kessel", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T00:23:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
