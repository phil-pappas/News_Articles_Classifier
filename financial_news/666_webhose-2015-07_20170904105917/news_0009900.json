Fear is the ascendant emotion at the moment,\" said Macquarie analyst Vivienne Lloyd. \"The weak (manufacturing survey) last week reinforced the unease.\" China's factory sector contracted by the most in 15 months in July as shrinking orders depressed output to its lowest since March 2014, a private survey showed, reinforcing views that the Chinese economy needs more stimulus. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange rose 2.2 per cent to close at $US5,300 a tonne from $US5,188 at the close on Monday, when the metal used in power and construction hit a six-year low at $US5,164. \"There's some profit-taking on short positions across the metals complex,\" a metals trader said. \"We need more momentum to shake out more of those shorts.\" Three-month aluminium gained 1.0 per cent to close at $US1,655, nickel gained 3.00 per cent to close at $US11,325 , lead rose 1.6 per cent to close at $US1,722.50 and zinc rose 2.4 per cent to close at $US1,980. Many are reviewing previous expectations of higher zinc prices over coming months due to tighter supplies. \"Continued sluggish growth in galvanized steel sheet production in China and subdued Chinese H1 construction do not support the consensual bullish demand thesis, despite clear signs of improvements in other keys market such as the United States,\" Citi said in a note. Tin rose 3.2 per cent to close at $US16,150, matching its May 7 high on expectations of falling shipments from top exporter Indonesia from August 1. Indonesia is tightening rules for tin exports, in a fresh bid to crack down on environmental degradation and smuggling, and to enforce payment of royalties and taxes on shipments. Some traders and analysts are sceptical about the government's ability to implement the new rules.
