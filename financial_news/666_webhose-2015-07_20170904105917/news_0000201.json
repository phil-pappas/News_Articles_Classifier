The rouble last touched 60 to the dollar on March 19. \nThe central bank began foreign currency purchases to replenish its reserves in May, and has acquired some $10bn since. \nTom Levinson, FX and rates chief strategist at Sberbank CIB, a state-owned investment bank, described winter’s crisis as a “perfect storm” of falling oil prices and intensification of the Ukraine war at a time when the central bank did not have enough tools to cope with it. \nWhile a repeat of that crisis seems unlikely, on-going difficulties appear to have left Russian policy makers struggling to balance simultaneous goals of boosting growth, suppressing inflation, replenishing foreign reserves and managing the exchange rate. \n“They started foreign currency purchases in May when the rouble dipped under 50, and they’ve stopped now when it hit 60. So although they say they’re allowing a free-floating ruble, it is difficult to get away from the thought that they have a band in mind,” said Mr Levinson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T19:25:38.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
