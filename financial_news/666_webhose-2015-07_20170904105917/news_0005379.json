The activist group tweeted late Tuesday: Wonder if tomorrow is going to be bad for Wall Street.... we can only hope. â€” Anonymous (@YourAnonNews) July 8, 2015 New York trading was suspended around 11:30 a.m. Wednesday due to a \"technical issue,\" the exchange said in a statement posted to Twitter. The Department of Homeland Security said there was no indication the NYSE had been hacked, according to Bloomberg and CNN . The exchange said the glitch could not be attribute to \"a cyber breach.\" \"The issue we are experiencing is an internal technical issue and is not the result of a cyber breach,\" it said in another statement . \"We chose to suspend trading on NYSE to avoid problems arising from our technical issue. NYSE-listed securities continue to trade unaffected on other market centers.\" The White House said President Obama had been briefed on the issue. Earlier in the day, United Airlines briefly grounded all of its flights due to a systemwide failure. Anonymous has previously targeted Wall Street and made headlines in 2011 when it threatened to \"destroy\" the New York Stock Exchange. The message could also be seen as an allusion to economic unrest in China and Greece, which has contributed to global market turmoil in recent days. U.S. stocks saw modest losses in the early hours of trading Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T00:59:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
