Could anyone ask for more? Share on twitter by John Davidson The TV that has arguably the best picture quality of all time has finally made it to Australia.\nLG's 4K Ultra HD OLED TV goes on sale this week, for $5999 for the 55-inch model and $9,999 for the 65-inch model.\nThat's less of a price premium than we were expecting, considering the TV is the only one on the market to have all three of the major new display technologies - Ultra High Definition, OLED and a curved screen - in the one panel.\nNot that the curve is that important. For a lot of people it's actually a negative, though at least with these new LG models there's less of a curve than there used to be. Early LG curved TVs were based around a 5 metre radius, but LG has realised that was just too curvy, and has gone for a gentler, 6.5-metre-radius curve. A 100 metre radius would be more to our tastes, but for some reason LG has decided not to release these TV with flat screens.\nYou can't have everything.\nBut you can have OLED and UHD in the same TV, which makes for an incredible picture with the right inputs.\nOLED, in case you haven't been shopping for a TV for a few years, is the modern equivalent of plasma: self-lit pixels that display the blackest of blacks (the pixels are turned off, and there is no backlighting to seep through, so they are the very definition of black) and the most vivid of colours.\nMeanwhile UHD (aka 4K) means the screen has four times the resolution of regular High Definition TV. For the numerically minded, that's a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels, instead of the 1920 x 1080 pixels for HD. For TVs bigger than, say, 55 or 60 inches, that extra resolution can make a huge difference. For TVs smaller than that, it makes a difference only if you're sitting close enough that you would have been able to see the pixels on an HD screen. Though, even if you couldn't see the pixels, there are other improvements in UHD, such as a wider colour gamut, that can make a difference provided your inputs take advantage of them.\n Combine those two technologies together, and the outcome is pretty stunning. Add in webOS 2.0, LG's brilliant smart TV operating system, and you've got yourself a fairly compelling offering.\nThe caveat is, you have to have the right inputs, which means Blu-ray disks or HD/4K from an internet service such as Netflix. Feed a regular, 576i Standard Definition free-to-air TV program into one of these, and your mileage will vary considerably.\nLG's upscaling, which converts the low-res image to the high res image required by UHD) started off pretty miserably, though it has been getting better lately. We'll be interested to see whether it's as good as Sony's 4K upscaling (which we think of as the gold standard) when we get to review one of these LG TVs (fingers crossed) in the next few weeks.\nStay tuned.\nFor the moment, the TVs are only available through Harvey Norman.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DLLabs"], "published": "2015-07-07T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T18:05:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
