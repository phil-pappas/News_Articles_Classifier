But sometimes a bank won’t agree to a refi and you owe more than the house is worth,” he said. “In that case, a short sale may be the best option for you.”\nHe gave three reasons why a short sale is better than a foreclosure.\n“First, a short sale takes a while. You can stay in your house and try to find a new place to live while the bank reviews the paperwork and looks at offers,” he said. In a foreclosure, you’re kicked out when the paperwork gets served.”\nA second reason is lenders will let a person who went through a short sale buy a house sooner than if they went through foreclosure. Some government programs allow a person to buy a home almost immediately after a short sale.\n“And thirdly, there’s the impact to your credit. You can sometimes negotiate what the bank reports to the credit agencies. A short sale is generally less damaging to your credit than a foreclosure and a lot less damaging than bankruptcy,” Mr. Thomas said.\nIn a short sale, the bank agrees to let the homeowner sell the house for less than what is owed. Mr. Thomas said a bank can be convinced to do this, but it may take some work.\nFor more information on short sales and how to navigate the process, visit www.TedThomas.com .\nABOUT TED THOMAS - One of the nation’s premier experts on distressed real estate, including short sales and no-money-down mortgages, Ted Thomas lives in Merritt Island, FL.
