The company however assured that there is no effect on the field's reservoir or resources. \nThe news led to a dip in shares price yesterday. New agency, Reuters, reported that shares in the Africa-focused energy group fell 2 percent after news that oil and gas exports from the field will be reduced for a further three weeks to fix a gas compression issue. \nA downward review of Tullow's 2015 oil production forecast, which comes on the heels of a sustained period of falling oil prices, is expected to lead to a significant shortfall in government revenue this year. \nFinance Minister Seth Terkper, in a mid-year budget review, acknowledged this and asked for a reduced cap on the Ghana Stabilisation Fund (GSF). \n\"With the downward revision of the expected oil revenue for 2015, resulting from the drastic decline in world oil prices, we propose to reduce the cap on the GSF to È»150million for the rest of 2015,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T11:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T10:50:49.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
