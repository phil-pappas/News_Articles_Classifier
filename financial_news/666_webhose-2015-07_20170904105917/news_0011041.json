Philip Gostelow by Tess Ingram and David Ramli In the end, it was an offer too good to refuse for iiNet founder Michael Malone. On Monday he joined the vast majority of other shareholders in backing the $1.56 billion takeover offer for the company from TPG Telecom despite having publicly slammed the bid in its early stages .\nAt a sparsely attended shareholder meeting in Perth on Monday morning, iiNet shareholders provided overwhelming support for the offer, with 95 per cent of votes lodged in favour.\nMr Malone, who founded the telco in his parent's Perth garage in 1993, had been a firm opponent to TPG's original $1.4 billion all-cash bid in March but said the iiNet board had drawn out a better offer after listening to shareholder concerns.\n\"I'm feeling sad but it is going out at a good price at, I think, the top of the market,\" Mr Malone told reporters after the meeting.\n\"It is going out at nearly $10 – that is pretty incredible for a company that was down at 20c. If I had been sitting on the board I would have taken the offer as well. It is at that level where you couldn't say no because you represent the shareholders.\"\nA number of major institutional shareholders, including BT Investment Management, also criticised the offer at various stages, but only Merlon Capital, which initiated a last-ditch effort to rally voters against the deal , and a small dissenting retail vote appeared to reject the final offer, with 100.6 million votes in favour and 5.2 million against.\nMr Malone said the iiNet board had done \"a much better job the second time\" but disagreed with chairman Michael Smith's claim in his opening address that it was \"inevitable\" iiNet would be a target of consolidation in the industry.\nMr Smith said it had \"been a ride\" and he was relieved the bid had received shareholder support.\n TPG's initial bid was put under pressure when M2 Group entered a share-based counter-bid to buy out iiNet worth $1.57 billion , which was supported by Mr Malone.\nBut TPG eventually submitted an updated offer worth $1.56 billion in cash with the option of some TPG shares, which greatly reduced the level of discontent amongst shareholders and was accepted as being superior by iiNet's board of directors.\nMr Smith said iiNet hadn't received any other approaches but acknowledged he was aware the \"obvious\" companies had \"put the ruler over the business\".\n\"They certainly haven't approached us and if they wanted to bid they could have but we have a sense at the moment we got the best price we could,\" Mr Smith said.\nTPG will now become a telecommunications powerhouse with 1.7 million broadband subscribers and the power to reshape the Australian internet market. This places it behind Telstra's 3 million accounts and ahead of Singtel-Optus' 1.03 million users, with M2 Group a distant fourth.\nThe deal hinges on approval from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission , which is due to give a verdict by August 20. But industry analysts and insiders widely expect the regulator to approve TPG's takeover.\nOnce approval is given both parties will then immediately call for a court hearing to ratify the merger and finalise the deal.\nMr Smith said there will be \"a slight level of anxiety\" until the ACCC determination but he expected the regulator's approval.\n\"I think the market is actually better structured with integrated strong competitors in it so this gives TPG a very broad strong retail front to match up against their significant investment in infrastructure,\" he said.\nTPG is offering cash, or a combination of cash and TPG shares, for each iiNet share.\nThe cash option delivers shareholder $8.80 in cash plus a special dividend of up to 75¢ for each iiNet share while the combined alternative offers 0.5533 new TPG shares, $3.77 in cash, and the 75¢ dividend.\nMr Smith said about only one third of shareholders voted for the scrip alternative but said \"there couldn't have been a greater push\" to better reflect shareholders' desires.\n\"Negotiations with Mr Teoh are robust and always very polite but I can confidently say in my own judgment after a number of discussions I have had with him personally is that we took him to the absolute edge in what we could get.\"\nMr ​Malone held only a small stake, about 2.5 per cent, and said he opted for the cash alternative, which would have netted him about $40 million.\nDeutsche Bank analyst Craig Wong Pan and Morgans analyst Nick Harris said the outcome was largely expected and ACCC approval is likely.\n\"I think people are a bit frustrated iiNet is being acquired,\" Mr Harris said. \"But if you do step back ... iiNet has acquired a number of providers for much lower prices than TPG is offering them ... which is paying a big multiple to get the business. So although it is frustrating it is being taken over, it is a good price they are paying.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/iinet-founder-michael-malone-slams-tpg-offer-calls-for-board-spill-20150323-1m5vzr.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/m2-group-lodges-16b-allshare-bid-for-iinet-20150427-1mtw3c.html"], "published": "2015-07-27T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:11:29.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
