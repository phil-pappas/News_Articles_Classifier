Karl Hilzinger by Michael Smith There is no magic formula for picking the next takeover target. One problem for investors is that if a company looks ripe for sale or there is even a hint that a predator is circling, then a takeover premium is already factored into the share price.\nTrading on speculation is a dangerous game. Rumours are sometimes right but often wrong and can be driven by a host of self-interested parties including hedge funds and investment bankers.\nBut if you get it right or, better still, pick a company where no one saw a takeover bid coming, then you can make up to 40 per cent or sometimes more on your original investment in a short period of time.\nToll Holdings is a classic example. Japan Post's $6.5 billion bid for the Melbourne-based logistics giant, previously viewed as predator rather than prey, caught the market off guard. Toll shareholders were rewarded with an extraordinary 49 per cent premium on the stock's last trading price before the deal was announced. Unusually for a takeover bid of that size, there were no leaks.\nDeals like that are rare, though, and investors should not hold their breath for too many more. However, investment bankers are not shy about talking up the prospects for more multibillion-dollar transactions from foreign predators or within industries ripe for consolidation.\nMany investors believe that unless you have inside knowledge, which is illegal, then buying a stock for the sole reason of betting on takeover activity is a bad idea. But there are several things to look out for if that's the aim of the game.\nCompanies with strategic shareholder stakes are prime examples, as recent bids for PanAust, GrainCorp and Nufarm demonstrate. Keep watch for a private equity firm or hedge fund building a stake, as well as potential strategic trade buyers.\nUnderperforming stocks, particularly those in an industry ripe for consolidation, are also worth keeping an eye on.\n Ripe for consolidation Credit Suisse has published a list of potential targets and a number of those have major shareholders who could potentially make a bid.\nOne of those companies is Adelaide Brighton, of which the Barro family owns a 32 per cent stake. While Credit Suisse says this puts it on the potential takeover list, it could also act as blocking stake and deter a third-party predator such as Boral.\nThe building materials sector is ripe for consolidation, however, and joint ventures between competitors are already commonplace.\nThe media sector is also facing a wave of consolidation if there are changes to cross-media ownership laws as expected.\nRupert Murdoch's News Corp acquired a 14.99 per cent stake in APN News & Media in March, prompting speculation it will make a play for the company's radio assets. But the News stake also gives it a blocking stake if another company tried to buy APN. The company's share register was opened up when long-time parent Independent News & Media, controlled by Irish billionaire Denis O'Brien, sold out.\nAPN and Adelaide Brighton were among a list of 16 companies highlighted by Credit Suisse analysts as potential targets. Others included Beach Energy, Caltex Australia, DUET Group, Graincorp, Metcash, Myer Holdings, OrotonGroup, Prime Media Group, SAI Global, Senex Energy, Southern Cross Media Group, STW Communications Group and Whitehaven Coal.\nCredit Suisse argues Australia is in its fourth merger and acquisition cycle in 20 years and history shows it could be only halfway through. Strong corporate balance sheets and the low cost of debt mean there is no reason why deals should not proceed.\n\"We think the ruler has been run over all of these potential ideas in the past, and as the environment for M&A continues to improve they should be more seriously considered in the future,\" Credit Suisse analyst Hasan Tevfik says.\nRelaxed about deals Other senior bankers say management and boards are more relaxed about doing deals than they were this time last year. Conservatism and a disciplined approach to deal making still dominates the boardroom.\nLow interest rates, strong balance sheets and the lack of organic growth opportunities due to the sluggish economy are expected to drive more deals this year.\nRoyal Dutch Shell's $US70 billion ($88.7 billion) bid for BG Group put the spotlight onto Australia's oil and gas sector, which has been shaken up by new entrants and pressured balance sheets.\nKerry Stokes' Seven Group Holdings has been buying shares in Beach Energy and Drillsearch Energy, prompting speculation that it wants a seat at the table in the Cooper Basin. Seven is one of the few local companies exposed to the resources sector that has money to spend.\nSouth African retailer Woolworths' acquisition of David Jones last year opened investors' eyes to the possibility of more details in retail, where valuations have slumped due to tough consumer markets and online competition.\nRetailer Solomon Lew has been talking down speculation he wants to buy Myer Holdings but the rumours will not go away.\n'Best time to capitalise' Fund manager Beulah Capital predicts Australia is heading for its busiest year for mergers and acquisitions in seven years. \"Now is the best time since the global financial crisis for investors to capitalise on corporate takeovers,\" says Beulah Capital managing director Christian Ryan, who oversees $400 million.\nThe Beulah Capital Takeover Target portfolio includes stocks that stand up on their own in terms of valuation but meet at least one of six criteria, which make it eligible for a potential bid.\nBeulah says it likes GrainCorp, which was almost acquired by Archer Daniels Midland until the Australian government knocked backed the deal in late 2013. Some believe that deal could be resurrected â€“ watch this space.\nBeulah also likes Nufarm and Mortgage Choice, which Commonwealth Bank of Australia owns a 16.65 per cent stake in after buying Count Financial in 2011.\nTreasury Wine Estates, Qube Holdings, DUET Group and Challenger have also long been touted as potential targets by other high-profile investors and strategists.\nThe trick, according to the experts, is to find a business which has strong fundamentals but is undervalued by the market. That way if a takeover does not happen there is still upside in the share price.\nCompanies operating in a duopoly or monopoly are also potential targets, although there can be competition issues if an existing player in the same market wants to make a bid.\nAn uptick in US interest rates and the potential for more market volatility is expected to bring about a more acquisitive nature in North American firms. Australian healthcare stocks could become potential targets for cashed-up biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.\nThe upside is there but investors would be wise to target companies with strong underlying fundamentals to ensure they are not out of pocket if suitors fail to emerge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T11:10:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
