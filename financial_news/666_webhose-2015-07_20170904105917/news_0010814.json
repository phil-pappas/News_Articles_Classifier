Quite often, it can be tough to pull the trigger, but every once in a while the technical setup might help us separate trap from opportunity. Other times, they can help us determine if the risk is longer than just the day or week in front of us. It feels like we are in that unknown area with cyber security stocks. \nThis group has been red-hot, and I had been using the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF ( HACK ) as a way to watch the group just beyond a few individual names. \nWhile I still really like this group for the long term, Monday and Tuesday set up as very important days. If there is only one thing to know about HACK, it's the 50-day simple moving average. The 50-day SMA has been a springboard since February. We've seen half a dozen tests, with a bounce each and every time. Not once have we seen consecutive closes below the 50-day SMA. \nMust Read: Stocks Are Likely Heading Into Correction Territory \nMy other view is on the 20-day SMA, which has also acted as support. Whenever we see the 20-day fail, the 50-day SMA or lower Bollinger Bands have been support. The quandary here is we are hugging the 50-day SMA coming into Monday, with the lower Bollinger Band only 1% below that. Basically, we have less than 2% to spare before we enter into territory not seen in 2015. I don't like that. There's no warmth and fuzziness there, where I think we're certain of happiness at lower levels. \nIf I had to target an entry on those failures, it would be around $29 per share. The challenge at $29 will be buying without any momentum. It will become a long-term fundamental buy at those levels if $29 comes upon us quickly. Now, this isn't a sector I want to short. In fact, it is one I want to own, but if holding long, understand a close under $30.65 could be challenging as we have resistance at $32 already, and the 50-day SMA at $31 will be added to that resistance. Keep an eye on Monday and Tuesday's closing prices if you have an interest in this space. \nIt is a recently issued ETF, so with only eight months of history, the weekly chart should be interpreted with that in mind. In other words, take conclusions with a grain of salt. The uptrend since February is clear. The eight-week simple moving average is a decent key to pinpoint, but the 50-day SMA has been much more accurate. Momentum, price and volume are all relatively bullish, but starting to fail. We have a weekly close under that eight-week SMA, the Force Index is very close to crossing into bearish territory and the relative strength index (RSI) is much over the midline. A lot can change here based on the action this week. Again, the $31.50, preferably $32 area, is a critical find for HACK, while anything under last week's low will cause some very big concerns. \nRemember, you don't have to buy the falling knife if the market corrects. Just be ready when a target hits your desired price and begins to firm up or outperform on a relative basis to the overall market. \nEditor's Note: This article was originally published at 7:17 a.m. EDT on Real Money on July 6.
