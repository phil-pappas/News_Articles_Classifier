Partridge will report to Greg D. Kosch, executive vice president and head of the Wholesale Bank.“Tom’s extensive background in commercial credit, as well as his experience in leadership roles in three different markets with Fifth Third, make him the perfect candidate to significantly accelerate the growth of our leasing business,” Kosch said.Prior to his role in Louisville leading the Kentucky affiliate, which holds $2.5 billion in assets, Partridge served as market president in Northeastern Ohio, based in Cleveland. He also had served as executive vice president and manager of Commercial Banking there. Before his move to Cleveland, he managed the Middle Market and Commercial Real Estate Group for Fifth Third Bank (Cincinnati). He received his bachelor’s degree from Xavier University and his master’s degree from Indiana University.“This is a business line that is a true passion for me,” Partridge said. “I’m excited to be able to focus 100 percent of my attention on commercial leasing, and I look forward to what my team will be able to deliver to clients who rely on us.”As part of this change, Michael Ash, currently market president in Lexington, was named president and CEO of Fifth Third Bank (Kentucky), replacing Partridge. Ash led the Commercial Banking division, covering both the Lexington and Louisville markets.“It’s been an honor and a privilege to serve the people and businesses of Kentucky,” Ash said. “This new role invites me to take an even greater role in the community, and that’s an opportunity I eagerly embrace.”Ash has 24 years of banking industry experience, more than 12 with Fifth Third. Prior to his move to Kentucky, he served for seven years as the business banking executive for Fifth Third in Central Indiana. Ash holds a bachelor’s degree from Indiana University and a master’s degree from Butler University.Assuming responsibility as senior commercial banker and city president in Lexington, replacing Ash, is Mark Boison, the commercial middle market team leader there. Boison joined Fifth Third in 2011. He has more than 35 years of banking experience, and prior to Fifth Third, was president of Forcht Bank and a regional manager at JPMorgan Chase. He holds a bachelor’s degree from Miami University and graduated from the Wharton School of Business Executive Leadership program.“All three of these appointments reflect the significant bench strength at Fifth Third,” said Greg D. Carmichael, president and chief operating officer of Fifth Third Bancorp. “Our talent development discipline gives us confidence to make management changes, both in our lines of business and within our marketplaces, that will produce successful business results.” Today's Other News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T00:14:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
