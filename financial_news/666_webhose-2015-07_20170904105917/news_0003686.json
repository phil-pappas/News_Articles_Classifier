Bush tweeted he liked \"digital disruption\", en route to Thumbtack, a platform connecting freelance contractors to consumers.\n\"These kinds of companies cause mental dissonance for people who think they can plan the future of the economy from Washington DC â€“ people like Hillary Clinton,\" Mr Bush said last week.\nRapid technology advancement, often enabled through iPhone apps, is breaking down traditional employer-employee relationships.\nAirbnb ... disrupts traditional businesses in the hospitality sector, but is good for consumers. Bloomberg Digital platforms are instantly linking customers with networks of independent contractors who conveniently provide services such as grocery shopping, cleaning, the delivery of flowers and massages. Many people have speculated that the workforce trend will expand into law, accounting and other professional jobs.\nThe transformation has been dubbed the \"sharing economy\", although leading angel investor Esther Dyson of EDventure Holdings said that was misleading.\n\"It's the independent contractor economy and real-time sharing of dynamic resources economy,\" she said.\n\"They're allocating resources efficiently, but it's creating political problems.\"\n Talk about disruption: Uber is working on the next level already - driver-less cars. Tough questions By cutting the traditional tie between a company and its employees, the \"Uberisation\" of the economy is raising tough questions for governments and regulators.\nWorkers gain flexibility to work their own hours and be their own boss, while most consumers love the convenience and value for money offered by the likes of Uber, which is now reportedly eyeing a valuation of $US50 billion ($68 billion).\nBut some sceptics, including trade unions, incumbent industries under threat like taxis and left-leaning politicians such as Mrs Clinton are warning of downsides.\nPeter Thiel, PayPal co-founder is worried by the evisceration of the workforce, suggests producers of popular consumer products should \"ask for forgiveness...don't ask for permission.\" Bloomberg \"This 'on demand' or so-called 'gig economy' is creating exciting opportunities and unleashing innovation, but it's also raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future,\" Mrs Clinton said in a major economic speech last week.\nUber drivers are not employees, meaning they miss out on benefits such as healthcare insurance, retirement contributions, holiday and sick leave and the security of a full-time job. They also have to pay their own costs such as fuel and insurance.\n\"Service providers can make themselves available at times of their choosing, but this flexibility comes at the cost of a regular salary, job security and benefits,\" said American Institute for Economic Research senior fellow Max Gulker.\nMetaphorically, Uber has become a punching bag in the United States, Europe and parts of Australia. Unions and incumbent businesses under siege from nimble start-ups hated the competition, and argue the emerging Ubers of the world need to be tightly regulated to protect consumers and prevent the exploitation of workers.\nDriverless car intrigue Adding to the intrigue, although Uber has almost 200,000 active drivers in the US, it is in the early stages of testing driverless cars.\nIn a blow to Silicon Valley, a California court last month declared that an Uber driver was an employee, ordering the ride-hailing app to repay Barbara Ann Berwick $US4152 in expenses.\nAdding to the crackdown, the US Labour Department this month issued guidelines when to classify workers as employees, who were entitled to fringe benefits, unlike independent contractors.\nJeremy Liew, an Australian expat and partner at US venture capitalist firm Lightspeed Venture Partners, said the gig economy was opening up new implications for society and investors.\n\"Historically, venture capital has had to think about technology risk, market risk and execution risk,\" Mr Liew said. \"Now this is introducing regulatory risk, so that's a new thing for us to think about.\"\nMr Liew, who has led investments in photo-sharing service Snapchat among dozens of others, said new technology caused unexpected social consequences, so there was a role for government to think about the greater public good.\nIn New York, Democratic mayor Bill de Blasio had proposed capping the number of Uber cars, arguing it would help quell congestion in Manhattan. Uber hit back aggressively, adding a mock \"de Blasio\" feature to its app, showing \"No cars available\".\n\"This is what Uber will look like in NYC if Mayor de Blasio's Uber cap bill passes,\" the feature said.\nThe editorial of the left-leaning New York Times said \"Limiting Uber won't end congestion\" and it was a \"bad idea\".\nRegulatory pressure Accommodation website Airbnb is also facing regulatory pressure, due to complaints from hotels and neighbours of people renting out their places over the web.\nSerial entrepreneur Peter Thiel, Paypal co-founder and the first outside investor in Facebook, suggested producers of popular consumer products should \"ask for forgiveness ... don't ask for permission.\"\n\"If you have a consumer technology product that is adopted very quickly, then it becomes very hard for regulators to push back against,\" he said at a conference last year.\nRepublican presidential candidate Rand Paul, a raging libertarian Senator who despises government meddling, seized on Mrs Clinton's speech to criticise her.\n\"Services like Uber, Airbnb, and Lyft stimulate our economy and work towards lower prices. How is this bad @HillaryClinton?\" Dr Paul tweeted.\nSilicon Valley is typically a stronghold for Democrats, whose generally liberal views on social issues such as rights, abortion and climate change sit more comfortably with progressive technologists.\nHowever, Mrs Clinton's remarks test this bond and created an opening for small-government Republicans such as Messrs Bush and Paul to court votes.\nContractors in the sharing economy appear to be taking notice at the political rancour. A part-time driver in Washington DC, Bernard, said he \"enjoys the freedom\" of driving for Uber.\n\"I have a baby and sometimes need to stay home with her while my wife is working, so it gives me that flexibility.\" But he said Mrs Clinton was right to \"make sure the drivers are well taken care of\".\n\"For us drivers, I hope some day they treat us as part of their company, but we can't raise issues because we don't have a union.\"\nThe foray into the digital disruption dispute by politicians such as Mrs Clinton and Mr Bush, two of the leading favourites to win the presidential election in November 2016, suggests the fight is far from over.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-07-19T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T04:03:40.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
