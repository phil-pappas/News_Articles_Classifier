PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS: Revenue for the quarter was INR 3407 million, an increase of about 15% over the same quarter last year. EBITDA for the quarter was INR 583 million, an increase of 21% over same quarter last year. Net Profit for the quarter was INR 85 million, a decrease of 25% over same quarter last year. CAPEX during the year was INR 82 million. Cash balance at the end of the quarter was INR 1342 million. Mr. Raju Vegesna, Chairman, said, “Our continued growth in the face of a difficult economic environment has firmly established us a steady player in the Indian ICT space. This year, we are pursuing incremental growth from the North American market to supplement our traditional Indian market focus. While we are still at the earliest stages of our entry into this market, we are gaining strong traction with the partner ecosystem and are already seeing a growing interest in the services we are offering in North America. Within India, we see a gradually improving market, with IT Services playing an important role in supporting the Prime Minister’s call for digital transformation of India. We are confident that we have an important role to play in enabling both the public and private sector, as our clients seek to leverage the benefits of digital transformation.” Mr. Kamal Nath, CEO, said, “Our focus on multi-year and multi-services projects with our customers has guided us to a continued growth path over the last multiple quarters including Q1 of FY 15-16. Enterprises are increasingly adopting 3 rd Platform as the chosen model for IT Infrastructure Services and that’s a positive sign for Sify. Our new contracts, particularly with the medium sized Enterprises reflect the trend. Such engagements have not only positioned us strongly as a New Age ICT Services partner for our clients, but will also play a significant role in utilization of multiple Infrastructure assets which we have on the ground.” Mr. M P Vijay Kumar, CFO, said, “Our strong top-line performance has continued into the first quarter of the new year, which has also translated well into equally strong EBITDA growth. However, our continuing investment in the core assets to support this level of growth has resulted in a modest drop in Net Profit. While continuing to support the investment required for sustainable growth, our primary financial focus is on optimal asset utilization and alternate means to lower operational costs. We see potential for increased asset utilization in both our Network and Data Center businesses, which have driven most of the capital investment over the past year. Cash balance at the end of the year was INR 1342 million.” Unaudited Consolidated income statement as per IFRS Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (732) Note: Year ended March 31, 2015 are audited numbers Business Highlights Revenue from the data business grew by over 23% over same quarter last year.
