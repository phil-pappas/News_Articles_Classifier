As well as attracting new investment, the scheme could reduce the price of consumer goods through lower transport costs and help develop more remote parts of the archipelago. \n\nWidodo, a former furniture exporter who knows well the problems of the country's ports, is taking a personal interest in the project but it faces formidable challenges. \n\nThere are growing doubts his administration, which has been criticised over its failure to kickstart major infrastructure projects, will be able to push through the plans due to a lack of organisation and a dysfunctional bureaucracy. \n\nOn a recent visit to Tanjung Priok port in Jakarta-which handles much of Indonesia's international trade-Widodo's frustration at slow progress was clear when he delivered an angry tirade over the failure to substantially cut the time it takes goods to move through the facility. \n\nThe target date to complete all the ports is 2019. But even if the target is met, which seems doubtful given many infrastructure projects in Indonesia suffer delays, experts say this alone will not solve the problem of red tape and graft that slows down processing of goods. \n\n\"Building hardware is a critical element in the wider scheme of things,\" said Jayendu Krishna, a Singapore-based analyst with industry consultancy firm Drewry Maritime Services. \n\n\"An equally important element for success will be tackling bureaucracy and corruption, otherwise it might turn out to be much ado about nothing.\" \n\nNevertheless, industry players sense renewed momentum under the new president. \n\n\"I am very optimistic, we've got very strong support from the top,\" Richard Lino, president director of state-owned port operator Pelindo II, which is developing the New Priok port, told AFP. \n\"There is no reason not to be successful.\" The Jakarta project is one of five planned deep-sea ports, which can receive large cargo ships and will be dotted across the archipelago from western Sumatra island to underdeveloped eastern Papua.\nTanjung Priok, currently Indonesia's biggest port, handles 6.5mn containers a year. \nTo its east, the first stage of New Priok is taking shape, with labourers working on a container terminal, a wide stretch of concrete jutting out into the sea. \nConstruction of the new port, which consists of two phases, began in 2013 but people involved in the project say it has sped up in recent months. \nTrial operations are due to begin on the first stage later this year but the entire project is not expected to be completed for some years. \nThe new port, which will share services with Tanjung Priok and whose first phase alone is expected to cost around 4.5bn, will have capacity to handle 12.5mn containers of international freight a year. \nWork has already started this year on ports in Kuala Tanjung on Sumatra and in Makassar on central Sulawesi island. \nDespite the optimism, Indonesia faces a long road to catch up with other Asian countries, such as more affluent Malaysia, which has more modern port facilities. \"We are still behind our neighbours, that is for sure,\" said Pelindo II's Lino. \"It is a very big challenge.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T23:59:48.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
