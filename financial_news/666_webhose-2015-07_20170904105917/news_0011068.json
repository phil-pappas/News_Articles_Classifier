The Bank had argued that the CFPB’s lack of accountability to any branch of government was unconstitutional, and it also questioned whether President Obama went outside of the law using a recess appointment to put Cordray in his job while Congress was operating under a pro forma session. \nThe court rejected arguments by the federal government that the bank was not impacted by the CFPB and could not bring a lawsuit, noting that State National Bank’s operations fell under CFPB oversight. \n\"There is no doubt that the bank is regulated by the Bureau,\" the Court ruled. \"The bank therefore has standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Bureau.\" \nEleven states, the 60 Plus Association and the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) joined the bank in its campaign. \n“Since Dodd-Frank’s enactment five years ago this month, the CFPB has inflicted damage on huge segments of our economy,” said Sam Kazman, CEI’s general counsel. “Its powers are so free-roaming that they are unprecedented in our history. The fact that our standing to challenge the CFPB has been upheld is great news for us, the plaintiffs, and even greater news for the American public.” \nThe CFPB made no public comment on the court ruling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T07:42:24.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
