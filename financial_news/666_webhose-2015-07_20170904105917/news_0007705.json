Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! MUMBAI: The Union finance ministry has written to the Maharashtra government, directing it to stop filing FIRs (first information report) against bank managers of nationalised banks who didn't sanction loans to farmers. The finance ministry's letter terms the state government's move as \"catastrophic\", and warned that it could have \"unintended consequences\". The letter, a copy of which is with ET, has been written by Hasmukh Adhia, Secretary in the Ministry of Finance, Department of Financial Services, on July 8 to Maharashtra chief secretary Swadheen Kshatriya. The letter was written after district magistrates of Akola, Bhandara, Yavatmal and Chandrapur served notices under Section 188 to branch managers of 10 nationalised banks and 14 cooperative banks for not clearing loans to farmers. Adhia told the chief secretary that \"while banks need to be sensitive and responsive to the needs of farmers, particularly in times of distress, the idea of using criminal act for such matters is catastrophic. It is certainly not going to achieve the purpose for which it is being used\", wrote Adhia. He warned that the state government's move could be counterproductive as employees of banks would not cooperate with the government which could have unintended consequences. Adhia has politely reminded the state government that since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the regulatory body for financial institutions and banks, the state should take up the matter with the central bank if it has an issue. Former Maharashtra finance minister Jayant Patil of the Nationalist Congress Party has criticized the state government, saying that the situation could have been avoided if the state had simply followed up its earlier assurance that it would reschedule loans given to farmers by banks. Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has asked collectors to file FIRs against bank managers after farmers began complaining that they were not getting bank loans in the state.
