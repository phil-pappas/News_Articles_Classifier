However, it stunned investors with a 19 cents per share profit, or $92m, in the three months ended June 30. Revenues soared 19.9pc to $23.19bn, beating expectations of $22.39bn. \nSales in the US, Amazon’s biggest market, rose 25.5pc compared with the same period last year, to $13.8bn on trong demand for electronics and general merchandise. \n“The teams at Amazon have been working hard for customers,” Mr Bezos said. \nThe diverse company, which has branched out into e-book readers and drone delivery, saw cloud-computing revenues soar 81.5pc to $1.82bn. Customers storing digital information online accounted for nearly 8pc of the quarter’s total revenues. \nAmazon Web Services provides cyber space for businesses to save data and run systems, eradicating the need to build data centres and servers costing hundreds of millions. Mr Bezos believes it could one day become the biggest part of the company \n“It looks like they beat across every major revenue line,” said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W Baird & Co. “That, along with the surprise profit beat, is the icing on the cake.” \nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos \nAmazon also said it expected net sales to grow between 13pc and 24pc, to a range of $23.3bn to $25.5 billion, in the third quarter. This is well above analysts’ estimates of $23.89bn. \nThe outlook was helped by the first Amazon Prime Day, on July 15. Customers ordered 398 items every second during the shopping event, helping Amazon sell a total of 34.4m products on the day. Prime Day was so successful, Amazon said it would “definitely” run another. \nThe retailing giant said its global shopping day was bigger than Black Friday - the post-Thanksgiving US extravaganza that has arrived in the UK in recent years. \nThe shares jumped 16.7pc to $562.9 in after-hours trading, giving the company a market cap of more than $261bn. Wal-Mart is valued at $233bn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T04:29:05.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
