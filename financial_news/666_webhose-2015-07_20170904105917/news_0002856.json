But inside Russia, it probably won’t change thing. In fact, it could give Putin a popularity surge.\nAccording to polls, Vladimir Putin enjoys 80 to 85 per cent popularity at home. This, to put it mildly, is absolute *borscht.\nSuch polls are widely discredited because Russia has no meaningful free press. And even if it did, would you feel comfortable telling a random phone pollster that you dislike a former phone-tapping KGB operative?\nBut despite the trumped-up numbers, many Russians happily tolerate Putin. They don’t particularly like him, and they certainly don’t trust him. Yet they’re somehow comforted by him, and here’s a personal anecdote which explains why.\nLast year, on a five week working trip to Russia, I toured Joseph Stalin’s summer house. Stalin, who was leader of the Soviet Union from the 1922 to 1953, killed tens of millions of his countrymen, both directly through execution, and indirectly through forced Siberian exile and starvation.\nMy tour guide, Katerina, was a polite, friendly young woman who lived in a village in the nearby hills. She had two children, a husband who was a plumber and a droopy-eared dog. She also had a crush on Joseph Stalin.\n“Stalin did more good than bad,” Katerina assured me, in a statement scarily reminiscent of the official Chinese line that Chairman Mao was “70 per cent correct”, despite the fact that Mao, too, caused millions of senseless deaths.\nHow could she say that? How could such a delightful, sensible young woman see the good side of a leader many regard as the face of pure evil?\nUnderstand that and you answer why Russia puts up with Putin — and the answer goes like this.\nThey might not trust him, but they put up with him. Source: AP\nRussia, despite its size (and often because of it), has often felt like an isolated, backward country to many of its inhabitants. Stalin modernised Russia; that much is indisputable. He propelled it into the industrial era, leaving its agrarian past behind.\nThe Soviet Union, with Russia at its centre, became a Superpower after Stalin. Russians themselves didn’t have much to eat or much to hope for. But despite being portrayed as part of an “Evil Empire”, Russians at least had a sense of importance in the world.\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s eroded all that. While the West welcomed Russia’s political and economic reforms and Russians celebrated their improved living standards, they lamented their shrinking world influence and the loss of former Soviet states.\nThen along in the late 1990s came Putin who understood all this only too well.\nIn 2008, the 62-year old waged war on neighbouring Georgia, in a manner which was seen as needlessly heavy-handed. Russia didn’t win Georgia back, but Putin won popularity points for his belligerence.\nPutin had a brief and hyper-expensive flirtation with western style public relations last year when he staged the Sochi Winter Olympics in his (and Joseph Stalin’s) favourite summer hangout. But that didn’t really change much.\nMonths later, it was back to more familiar business. Putin annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea with a referendum so bogus, he’d have been thrown out of spy school for even suggesting such a preposterously cheap trick.\nCrimea is a strategic naval stronghold for Russia, as well as a culturally significant area. The famous author and playwright Anton Chekhov spent much of his life there. Crimea is also heavily populated by those who consider themselves ethically Russian. For Putin, it was an easy grab.\nBut beyond a mere land grab, Putin’s belligerence in Ukraine was interpreted as a “screw you” to Ukraine, whose revolution last year made it clear that it sees its political and economic future tied to Europe, not Russia.\nEven the koalas don’t trust him. Source: Supplied\nIt was also just a good old-fashioned diversion from domestic problems. As Reuters put it earlier this year:\n“Putin needs the bombastic oratory of war. With economic disaster looming in Russia, because of the West’s sanctions and plunging oil prices, his thinking may be that a threat of war can help justify his autocratic regime.”\nDr Matthew Sussex, a Russian foreign policy expert who’s head of politics and international relations at the University of Tasmania, told this website something similar last year:\n“Putin’s macho posturing is strategic diplomacy, but the way in which it’s done is for domestic audiences. It creates an image of Putin as strongman, a person who won’t be pushed around. He’s the embodiment of the new assertive Russia.”\nWould the self-styled strongman Vladimir Putin fund rebels to cause whatever chaos they can in Ukraine — including shooting down Ukrainian planes? Most western experts say he’s more than capable.\nIf those rebels were later found to have mistakenly shot down a civilian jet with 298 innocent people — including 27 Australians — aboard, would Putin’s popularity suffer?\nAgain, probably not. Ordinary Russians wouldn’t like it one bit. They are good people. But they also like what they believe is best for Russia. Russian belligerence towards Ukraine fits into that category nicely.\n*For the record, borscht is a delicious beetroot-based soup regarded as Russia’s national dish, which many say was “stolen” from Ukraine. Oh, the irony.\nOriginally published as Why this won’t hurt Putin at all", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/19/1227448/077396-ab4aecc4-2c3b-11e5-aa8f-85f55b955825.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/rebel-video-of-mh17-site-is-expected-to-be-a-game-changer-in-bringing-those-responsible-to-justice/story-fnizu68q-1227445478456", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/19/1227448/077448-7e9cceea-2c3b-11e5-aa8f-85f55b955825.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/the-human-tragedy-of-mh17-could-boost-vladimir-putins-popularity-despite-damning-video-evidence/story-fn5tas5k-1227448079141"], "published": "2015-07-20T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T11:28:28.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
