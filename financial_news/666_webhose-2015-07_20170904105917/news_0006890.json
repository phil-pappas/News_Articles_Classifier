Ryan Stuart Let's not look no further than ASIC boss Greg Medcraft to describe the attitude of big banks and interest rate rigging investigation.\n\"Absolutely appalling\", \"obstructionist\" and \"defensive\".\nSince ANZ – fondly known by some as Sam \"Dasher\" Dastyari 's punching bag – suspended seven traders late last year, there's been little visible progress or indeed, action by the major banks. Despite the fact that ASIC probably has more resources on this issue than any other.\nBut last week – movement. Maybe.\nWord reached us that a former trader at National Australia Bank had been suspended. It's not clear whether the action is linked to the ASIC probe on interest rates.\nRear Window rang the individual understood to have been suspended, but hasn't heard back. Understandable in this sort of environment, where ASIC is sifting through everything from phone records to Bloomberg chat. By now , Cathy Armour probably knows more about these traders' lives than they do. And it's quite possible rate rigging is the least of their crimes.\nWe haven't fared any better than Medcraft, when it comes to NAB's response to our questions. Perhaps they don't want to be Dasher's punching bag mark two.\nThe bank – which was first contacted by this paper early last week – stuck to its line of \"NAB has not suspended a trader\". Well, yes. The individual in question hasn't held a trading role for a few years, though was right at the centre a few years back. So is it related to interest rates? That's one version of the chat in the market – which is very jumpy around this issue. Suspension of any staff member is a pretty big step.\n Word around the traps late on Tuesday, was this particular case relates to what is known as 'behavioural issues'. Which could involve a whole range of sins. We'd love to know more!\nNAB's Andrew Thorburn has talked up his zero tolerance on poor behaviour. Wonder what he thinks of this?\n.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T23:06:33.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
