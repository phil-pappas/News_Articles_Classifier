Licenses are mainly awarded through direct, negotiation without public tender processes, but even when licenses are awarded through competitive tendering processes, evaluation reports go unpublished,' he said. \nMr Bekoe noted that adequate transparency and accountability in the extractive sector is critical to ensure that natural resources are managed effectively to the benefit of citizens. \nExpatiating, Mr Bekoe said the current provision did not guarantee a complete publication of all forms of contracts and supplementary texts and could lead to multiple interpretations. \nHe said the draft bill did not include any provision on disclosure of who the ultimate and true owners of petroleum companies are, which he said promotes illegal actions such as tax evasion, cronyism, and nepotism. \n\"The complex ownership structures make it difficult to deter and prevent misconduct and crimes committed by extractive companies,\" affirming that CSOs would like to see that the bill include provisions for the mandatory disclosure of beneficial ownership of all licensees.' \nMr Bekoe said Ghana's Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) attempted beneficial ownership disclosure but could not gain adequate information on the true owners who exercise ultimate control of the companies that operate in Ghana. \nNRGI has been supporting the EITI multi-stakeholder group to improve on the search and disclosure of beneficial ownership information in its next EITI report, he added, saying if the recommendations are considered by parliament and passed into law, Ghana could become a model for other countries in the region to follow. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T00:09:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
