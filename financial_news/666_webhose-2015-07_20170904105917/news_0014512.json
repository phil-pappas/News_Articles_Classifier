I would now like to turn the conference over to Shawn Roberts, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Shawn Roberts (Senior Director - IR): Thank you. Welcome, everyone. On the call today, our Chairman and CEO, Troy Woods, will begin with his opening remarks. Our CFO, Paul Todd, will provide business highlights on our four segments and then review our consolidated financials. After that, we'll open the call up for Q&A. I'd like to remind everyone, those participating in the Q&A, that after you ask your second question, you will be placed back into the queue. It will be the same as we operated the call on last quarter. I'd like to now call your attention to the fact that we'll be making some forward-looking statements about the future operating results of TSYS. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause TSYS's actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are set forth in TSYS's reports filed with the SEC. I'd like to now introduce TSYS Chairman and CEO, Troy Woods. Troy Woods (Chairman, CEO): Thank you, Shawn. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Before we get started with our business review, I would like to take a few minutes and recognize Ken Tye, our Senior Executive Vice President and CIO, who will be retiring at the end of September after 44 years of service to TSYS. During Ken's tenure, he has been instrumental in leading and delivering almost all of the technological advancements that TSYS has made. He was responsible for leading the team that built TS2, considered the industry's most technologically advanced payment processing system in the market today, with more than 40% of the credit cards in the United States processed on the platform. Most recently, Ken has led the Surround Team to create a more open technology environment to power TSYS's next generation of digital innovation and consumer servicing. As I have said on several occasions, Ken possesses that rare and unique ability to leverage his technical acumen with sound business strategy. And we are indebted to Ken for his service and for the role he has played in positioning TSYS as one of the most respected FinTech companies in the payments industry. We wish Ken, Kay, and his family all the best in his retirement. Moving on to our second quarter business review, once again, TSYS exceeded expectations, delivering an exceptionally strong performance for the second quarter. From a macro perspective, the US economy experienced a nice, healthy bounce after a lackluster first quarter. The benefits from lower unemployment, wage increases, and lower gas prices fueled spending and an improved outlook. These positives suggest the US economy is returning to a slow and steady growth trajectory, and consumer fundamentals still appear favorable. The momentum seen in the United States economy is counterbalanced somewhat by the headwinds from abroad, with weakening currencies in many of the countries where we do business and the unpredictability and volatility of some markets. But all in, we see net tailwinds benefiting our customers. And as I've mentioned in the past, when TSYS's clients perform well, we perform well also. Our analysis indicates that our clients and their respective issuing businesses have grown faster than the industry average. This is directly correlated to the exceptionally strong growth in transactions, authorizations, volumes, and account on file growth that we produced for the second quarter. Let me mention a few high-level enterprise highlights worthy of calling out. Total revenues for the quarter were $692.7 million, an increase of 15.1%. Revenues before reimbursable items for the quarter were $622.1 million, an increase of 15.6%. Our consolidated organic revenue grew 13.7% year to date. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.58, an increase of 29%. 1 of 12", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T17:41:48.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
