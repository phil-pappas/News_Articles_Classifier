Scott Barbour by Ben Potter AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan conceded the sport's governing body is powerless to stop relentless booing of Sydney Swans star and Indigenous standard bearer Adam Goodes and challenged fans to \"lead us out of here\".\nMr McLachlan's challenge came as Crown Resorts chairman James Packer said the booing made him \"ashamed... as an Australian\" and called on all politicians to back a campaign to recognise Aborigines in the constitution.\nIn a setback for Australia's richest sport, the AFL faces criticism for not showing strong and decisive leadership in the simmering Goodes controversy.\nThe AFL has led the way in celebrating Aboriginal players and dealing with racist taunts since the 1990s, and is seeking $1.75 billion for a new five-year broadcast deal, a 40 per cent boost on the current contract.\nSydney Swans star Adam Goodes has taken a leave from the game. Wolter Peeters WLP Citing previous examples of exemplary crowd behaviour in honouring slain Adelaide Crows coach Phil Walsh last month and observing silence on Anzac Day, Mr McLachlan said he couldn't tell fans how to behave but had faith in them.\n\"I just have great confidence in their ability to work through this issue, have their views and then ultimately respect the wishes of the players, the clubs, the industry, that Adam be given an environment to come back and play.\"\nGoodes, a two time Premiership player and winner of the Brownlow Medal for the AFL's fairest and best player, has pulled out of this week's match against the Adelaide Crows in distress at the booing that's dogged him around the country.\n\"It is time to draw a line in the sand\", said Jeff Kennett, the chairman of depression charity beyondblue and former Victorian Premier and Hawthorn AFL club President. \"That he has withdrawn from this week's game is a transparent illustration of the stress and hurt he is feeling.\"\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

View full Quote: Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements The issue has divided the AFL community and the 35 year old may have played his last match. Clubs, captains and players have been solidly behind him, with National Rugby League stars and politicians. The Richmond and Western Bulldogs clubs said they would don Indigenous Round strip in support this weekend.\nBut some former stars – such as three time Brisbane Lions Premiership hero Jason Akermanis and former Test spin king Shane Warne – have criticised Goodes for thinking himself above criticism. Some blame Goodes for having a 13-year old female Collingwood fan evicted from a 2013 match for calling him an \"ape\" – but that was the work of over-zealous ground staff.\nMr Packer told reporters after the launch of Crown's Reconciliation Action Plan that all people deserve respect. \"He is a great Australian. He has been Australian of the Year. He is an amazing role model and to hear people booing him is something that I am ashamed of as an Australian\", Mr Packer told reporters after the event at Melbourne's Crown Casino.\nHe joined in a spontaneous \"three cheers\" for Mr Goodes led by Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, who launched the action plan, which aims to give indigenous employees leadership training to prepare for senior management.\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott said: \"I can understand why he's upset because no-one should be subject to taunts, they particularly shouldn't be subject to racial taunts.\"\nMr Packer said that while he was proud of what Crown had achieved in indigenous employment, \"our efforts are small in comparison to bigger changes that need to take place in Australia.\n\"Australia, as a country, must take the next step of recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait peoples within our constitution. All political parties, business leaders, community leaders, unions, and the broader Australian community must work together with Indigenous Australians to build a consensus on this meaningful reform.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T09:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T10:12:33.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
