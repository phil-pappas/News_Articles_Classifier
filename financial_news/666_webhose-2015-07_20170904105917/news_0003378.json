This works both at the individual stock level, as well as for the overall market. Returns of good stocks bought at reasonable valuation can also get affected if the overall market is frothy and is due for a correction. One of the reasons for the recent trouble in the Chinese stock market was that it went up sharply over the past one year and stocks became overvalued. There are various ways to measure if stocks or the overall market are under- or overvalued. One such measure is the price-to-earnings ratio. However, at the macro level, investors also look at the total market capitalization of all listed stocks in relation to the gross domestic product or the gross national product (GNP). This is also termed as the Buffett ratio or Buffett indictor. WHAT IS IT? Buffett ratio, named after one of the most successful investors of our time, Warren Buffett, is calculated by dividing the total market capitalization (TMC) by the GNP. “…it (TMC/GNP) is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment,” noted Warren Buffett in an essay published in Fortune magazine in 2001 (see: http://mintne.ws/1RnBk1H ). According to Buffett, markets are fairly valued if the TMC is 70-80% of the GNP. “…If the percentage relationship falls to the 70% or 80% area, buying stocks is likely to work very well for you. If the ratio approaches 200%—as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000—you are playing with fire,” he added in the above mentioned essay. Going by this indicator, stocks in the US would be overvalued at present. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, market capitalization of US companies is at about 120% of the GNP. (See: http://mintne.ws/1HRlZC0 .) Market value of stocks in China reached $10 trillion in June, but has now fallen about 30% from the top. The GDP of China was at $10.36 trillion in 2014, according to World Bank data. In India, the current market capitalization is about 80% of GDP and, according to this measure, is not overvalued. LIMITATIONS Buffett ratio gives a broad idea about valuations at the macro level. For example, if the market value is close to 200% of the GDP—as it was during the technology bubble in the US in 1999-2000—it’s definitely a sign of trouble. However, investors should not rely on only one measure in all conditions. In India, for instance, a lot of economic activity, which is recorded in the national output, is not part of the stock market. If large state-run organizations such as the Indian Railways and the India Post were listed on the stock exchange, the total market capitalization would have been significantly higher. But yes, at the broader level, the Buffett ratio is an indication of whether markets are in line with fundamentals or not.", "external_links": ["http://mintne.ws/1HRlZC0", "http://mintne.ws/1RnBk1H"], "published": "2015-07-17T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:36:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
