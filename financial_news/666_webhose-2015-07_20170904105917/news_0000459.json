Commentators are less concerned about a bubble in Melbourne's apartment market than they were six months ago. Penny Stephens Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Is Melbourne's apartment market a bubble waiting to burst? Figures showing that construction of apartments in Victoria took a great leap forward in the March quarter certainly encourage the idea.\nThe jump to 9009 commencements of apartments, townhouses and semi-detached dwellings – a 42 per cent increase on the December quarter – was the state's highest ever and was the main factor pushing the national total over the 200,000 figure for the first time.\nThe city is already heading for a glut of apartments, which researcher BIS Shrapnel says will number 15,000 by June next year.\nDip, not a tumble But is the state headed for a nasty fall? The pundits say no. Continued high immigration levels and low interest rates, along with a slowing in production will see prices dip, but not take a tumble.\n\"You're looking at a 12 per cent to 13 per cent fall in real terms over three years,\" says BIS Shrapnel associate director Kim Hawtrey. \"That's state-wide. Falls in inner Melbourne apartments will almost certainly be sharper than that. But it's a correction, not a calamity.\"\nThe rise and rise of the Victorian apartment market, focused on the CBD and adjacent areas of Southbank and Docklands, has reshaped the skyline of the country's second-largest city and sent politicians scrambling to claim credit.\nIn the 24 months to May, Victoria's 57,534 approvals of new apartments and other denser dwellings accounted for nearly a third of the national total of 187,115. May itself chalked up a new record for apartment approvals in the state. NSW, battling to overcome a decade of under-investment in housing, approved only slightly more, with 61,749.\n 'Head and shoulders' above other states \"In Victoria we are head and shoulders above the other states because our land is more affordable and we are giving the development industry certainty and transparency in our decision-making,\" Victorian planning minister Richard Wynne said on Wednesday.\nThere are already some signs of a downturn. In the March quarter, the proportion of Melbourne units selling for less than their purchase price stood at 10.4 per cent, higher than the capital city average of 8.1 per cent, CoreLogic RP Data says.\nFigures last month showing a surge in deaths and a slowdown in births and immigration has placed a cloud over official growth forecasts and suggests housing market forecasts may be too optimistic.\nBut in Melbourne, some former bears have changed their minds.\nDeveloper Lorenz Grollo, chief executive of Grollo Group, previously predicted that Melbourne's mushrooming apartment stock – supported by predominantly overseas investors – would take a tumble in value once their original owners sold and the stock came onto the secondary market that was limited to locals and permanent residents.\n\"I was of the view that the secondary market was going to (see prices fall) because there was going to be a glut,\" Grollo says.\nSix months ago Grollo, a former Property Council of Victoria president, changed his mind, however.\n\"I think they'll hold their current pricing,\" he says.\nDemand still strong There is certainly little to suggest demand for apartment living is easing. Melbourne's vacancy rate held at 2.3 per cent in June, having tightened from 2.7 per cent a year earlier, SQM Research figures on Tuesday showed.\nSQM figures show that the vacancy rate in the apartment-heavy 3008 Docklands postcode held at 4.5 per cent in June from May, and has been below the 6 per cent level for the past year, sitting comfortably below its recent 9 per cent-plus peak of January 2014. The 3006 Southbank postcode tells a similar story. The current 4.6 per cent vacancy rate is well down on the near-9 per cent of a year ago. In the CBD vacancies are rising, but are below their 6 per cent of a year ago.\n\"Underlying demand is absorbing that supply at a fairly fast rate, which is why vacancies have been falling,\" says SQM managing director Louis Christopher. \"We are now less concerned about an imminent oversupply and bust in Melbourne.\"\nOf course, that has its downsides. The failure of apartment prices to fall significantly is going to make it harder for locals to buy. In fact, citing benchmark costs for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom CBD or fringe apartment of $10,000 per square metre in Melbourne, $20,000 per sq m in Sydney and $30,000 per sq m in London, Grollo says in the longer run they will get pricier.\n\"Melbourne in a global context is still cheap,\" Grollo says. \"A lot of people still want to live here. That's going to have an impact on local Melburnians and local residents and investors, but we need to view Melbourne in the context of a global market.\"\nThe inflated apartment construction sector is likely to deflate gently, Hawtrey says.\nApartment commencements totalled 29,868 in the year to March. He says the June quarter will mark the peak, \"just shy\" of an annual figure of 30,000.\n\"We see it starting to plateau in the second half of 2015 and then it'll start to ease back in the first half of 2016, still at very healthy levels, still in the mid-to-high 20,000s,\" he says.\nIt will then taper back, falling below 20,000 by the end of 2017.\nBut the new global context shows that Melbourne has also changed permanently.\n\"Just before the GFC, Victoria was only building about 8000 to 9000 apartments a year,\" Hawtrey says. \"It's basically tripled since pre-GFC levels.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-07-15T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:08:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
