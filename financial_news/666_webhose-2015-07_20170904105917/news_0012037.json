He added that rates could rise in September.\nIn the U.S., job creation advanced while wages stagnated and the size of the labor force receded. The addition of 223,000 jobs in June followed a 254,000 increase in the prior month that was less than previously estimated, a Labor Department report showed Thursday. The jobless rate fell to a seven-year low of 5.3 percent as more people left the workforce.\nHold Cash Gross expressed concern earlier this week that a panic could test the market’s liquidity in an investment outlook posted on June 30, advising investors to hold cash in order to stem losses during a possible market decline.\n“Long used to the inevitability of capital gains, investors and markets have not been tested during a stretch of time when prices go down,” Gross wrote in the outlook. “It’s then that liquidity will be tested.”\nIn today’s interview, Gross said that he faulted both sides of the current Greek crisis, adding that he was against the fiscal austerity position of the Mediterranean island’s creditors because of the likelihood it would only increase unemployment.\n“I wouldn’t blame the Greeks if they jumped into the deep blue sea,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T17:48:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
