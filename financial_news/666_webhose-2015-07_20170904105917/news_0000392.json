The world's No. 1 household products maker said last year it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands. \nThe combined company is expected to have annual revenue of more than $10 billion - double Coty's turnover - and will be led by Coty CEO Bart Becht. \nCoty, which is trying to staunch a decline in sales, said it expects hair color products to account for 24 percent of total sales after the deal is completed. \nCoty said it expects to generate about $4.5 billion in annual sales from its fragrance business, making it the world's largest fragrance company by sales. \nIt also expects to become the third largest brand in the color and cosmetics sector, behind L'Oreal (OREP.PA) and Estee Lauder (EL.N). \nJAB Cosmetics B.V. owns 97 percent of Coty's Class B shares is in favor of the deal, Coty said. JAB is controlled by Germany's billionaire Reimann family. \nCoty said the deal valued the P&G Beauty Business at $12.5 billion at the time of the proposal. Based on Coty's current stock price, outstanding shares and equity grants, the value of the transaction is about $15 billion, P&G said. \nP&G estimated a one-time gain of $5 billion-$7 billion, depending on the final deal value at the time of closing. \nReuters first reported in June that Coty was on track to acquire P&G's brands in a $12 billion deal. \nGoldman Sachs advised P&G, while Morgan Stanley was the lead adviser for Coty. \n(Additional reporting by Ramkumar Iyer in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) Coty Inc", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T18:03:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
