Jonathan Ng by Alexandra Cain Paying off the mortgage is the main financial goal for many Australians. But for some, it can make better sense to open a self-managed super fund before fully paying down the home loan.\nSo in what circumstances would you consider starting an SMSF before paying off the mortgage?\nJustin McMillan, a financial planner with Smart Wealth, says he's often asked by those looking to set up an SMSF whether they should pay off their mortgage before they set up their fund.\n\"The key to building wealth is to invest in multiple asset classes using multiple strategies,\" he says. \"So there are no fundamental reasons to hold off setting up an SMSF with a view to contributing extra funds into superannuation until the mortgage is paid off. Actually as a general rule I encourage clients to simultaneously contribute more into super as well as make extra payments against their mortgage.\"\nBut with current low returns on defensive assets such as cash and bonds, and with equity markets volatile or flat, at the moment McMillan is generally in favour of clients paying more into their mortgage to make a significant dent into the principal.\nTim Mackay, principal of financial advice firm Quantum Financial, says the decision to have an SMSF should not be solely determined by whether your home mortgage is repaid or the size of the mortgage. Rather, the determinant should be how it fits within the individual's overall wealth accumulation plan.\n\"Clients who have SMSFs are generally self-funded retirees with a significant super balance. They can also be business owners who have their business premises owned via their SMSF, together with other super assets such as cash and shares,\" says Mackay.\nHe says the decision to open an SMSF should be based on whether the returns outweigh the costs, and as long as the members understand the obligations and responsibilities of running their own fund.\n But as a rule of thumb, Mackay says allocating any surplus cash to repaying the mortgage is generally more of a focus than opening a SMSF, as super contributions for salaried people are going to continue to increase regardless each year from employer contributions.\n\"Having said that, we try to get clients to develop a habit of making small personal super contributions to their super fund,\" says Mackay.\nBarbara Smith, director of financial planning firm Oasis Wealth, says there are many variables that prospective members should take into account when considering whether to start an SMSF before paying off the mortgage. These include the amount of super in other funds that can be rolled into an SMSF and the amount of compulsory employer contributions that each member will receive each financial year.\n\"There is no prescribed minimum amount required to start an SMSF,\" she says. \"Some say it should be at least $200,000; however, a lower initial amount is OK if regular future contributions are expected to be made.\"\nSmith says it can make sense to open an SMSF if there may be a saving on fees and charges. \"There can also be tax benefits if you can salary-sacrifice your pre-tax money over and above your employer's compulsory contributions or you can claim a personal tax deduction if you are self-employed.\"\nHowever, she says some of the benefits of paying off a home loan before starting an SMSF include reducing future interest on the loan paid from your after-tax money and reducing the number of years you will be paying your mortgage.\n\"A debt-free home provides security if you lose your job, your income falls or you have health problems which prevent you from working, \" says Smith.\n\"Once money is contributed into super it is preserved until the member reaches their preservation age. So if a member might need to access after-tax money that is currently outside super before they retire, then it's better to put it in their mortgage, particularly if there is the flexibility of a draw-down facility.\"\nAccording to Smith, it's also an idea to use ASIC's super-versus-mortgage calculator to help you decide if you are better off putting spare money into your super account or your mortgage.\nKane Munro, director of Accountancy Online, says if you're financially savvy and have a very large superannuation balance then you could consider an SMSF regardless of your mortgage. But you really need to be fully committed to setting up and running an SMSF.\n\"Before you make a decision, you should do your research on what's involved and ask yourself what the real benefit of an SMSF is. If there is any doubt, then a simple direct-investment option in an industry or retail fund could be a good way of getting some control of your superannuation investments without all the administration and cost involved in an SMSF,\" he says.\nAccording to Monroe, making your last mortgage repayment is one of the most liberating financial experiences. \"As your home is probably the biggest asset you'll ever own, it also makes sense that it should also be your biggest focus.\"\nIt's also worth noting that there is now much more choice available in most industry and retail super funds. Which means you can have the flexibility of direct investment in shares, exchange-traded funds and term deposits, without the headaches and time associated with running an SMSF.\nSays Monroe: \"This means you can still focus on getting your mortgage paid off while still making your super work for you.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:57:23.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
