A&P listed assets and liabilities each of more than $1 billion in its bankruptcy filing late Sunday. \nThe company said was in talks with Acme Markets Inc, owner of Safeway and Albertsons grocery stores, Shop & Shop Supermarket Co LLC and Key Food Stores Co-operative Inc to buy its assets. \nA&P has lined up buyers for 120 of its 296 stores with total expected proceeds of about $600 million, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. ( http://on.wsj.com/1IdpCQZ ) \nThe company, which also owns Best Cellars, Pathmark and Superfresh stores, has been unable to stand up to behemoths such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Costco Wholesale Corp who entice customers with big discounts. \nAt the same time, wealthier shoppers have been lured away by higher-end stores such as Whole Foods Market Inc. \nA&P has received debtor-in-possession financing of $100 million from Fortress Credit Corp, court documents show. \nThe Montvale, New Jersey-based company employs about 34,000, according to its website. \nA&P, which in its heyday in the early 20th century operated over 15,000 stores, first filed for bankruptcy protection in 2010, re-emerging two years later as a private company after obtaining financing from investors including Goldman Sachs and an affiliate of billionaire Ron Burkle. ( http://reut.rs/1CDqC0k ) \nThe company was founded as a mail order business in 1859 by tea and spice merchants George Huntington Hartford and George Gilman. In the same year, it opened its first store-warehouse operation in New York City, according to A&P's website. \nThe case is in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, Case No: 15-23007. \n(Reporting by Supriya Kurane and Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Anupama Dwivedi and Joyjeet Das) Professional Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T13:46:42.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
