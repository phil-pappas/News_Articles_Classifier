More StanChart joins pact to prevent deforestation \nHSBC announced plans to sell its lossmaking Turkish operations as part of a strategic overhaul revealed last month that also includes plans to sell its Brazilian business, cut 25,000 jobs and slash assets in its investment bank. \nMeanwhile, there is growing expectation that the Greek debt crisis will force National Bank of Greece to consider selling its controlling stake in Finansbank, one of the most successful foreign-owned banks in Turkey. \nNBG delayed plans to sell a minority stake in Finansbank earlier this year. But under a restructuring plan agreed with European regulators last year, it needs to sell at least 40 per cent of the Turkish lender to shore up its capital position. \nSeveral of the bidders for HSBC’s Turkish operation dropped out to focus on the potential sale of Finansbank, including Qatar National Bank and Bahrain’s Arab Bank Corporation, according to Reuters. \nMany of the foreign banks that have done acquisitions in Turkey have struggled to make a success of them, held back by fierce competition from larger rivals and government rules limiting interest rates on certain products. \nLast year, HSBC’s 300-branch retail operation in Turkey made a $155m loss, while its overall Turkish revenue was $791m on assets of about $15bn. \nING was prevented from doing acquisitions until it had sold more than 50 per cent of its insurance operations, which it had to sell under EU rules imposed after it was bailed out by the Dutch government during the financial crisis. \nThe acquisition ban was lifted in May after ING reduced its stake in NN Group, its European and Japanese insurance offshoot, to about 38 per cent. \nHSBC is expected to sell its Turkish operation for a discount to its $1.1bn book value, said people familiar with the situation. The deal would double the size of ING’s operations in the country. HSBC and ING declined to comment. \nEarlier this year, Citigroup sold its $1.2bn stake in Akbank , the fourth-largest listed bank in Turkey by assets, although the US bank said it remained committed to corporate and commercial lending in the country.
