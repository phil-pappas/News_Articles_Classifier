Glenn Hunt Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jeremy Chunn Flying, like rock’n’roll, is harder than it looks. You don’t just shove the throttle of a Boeing 777-300 forward to release its full 230,000 newtons of thrust and leave the rest to physics. It takes “soft hands” to get 351 tonnes of machinery and holidaymakers off the ground.\n“It’s the same with the guitar,” says Virgin pilot Paul Doherty. “If you’re trying to be too rough with the guitar you don’t get the outcome you need.”\nAnyone who appreciates the nuance and dexterity of Angus Young’s playing would probably agree, and the AC/DC guitarist is one of Doherty’s favourites. “He’s exceptional – the precision is just amazing.” But Doherty pins “Little Steven” Van Zandt, the E Street Band guitarist who went on to star in The Sopranos, as the guy who switched on the light for him.\nLike so many other guitarists, Doherty started out on piano, whipped into shape by a nun with a ruler. Boarding school was more about football, and university degrees in science and aviation were all vector fields and matrix operations. The music returned about six years ago “in a much bigger way”. He practices 30 minutes a night and never misses weekly lessons.\nBrisbane-based Doherty has six guitars, including a Fender Stratocaster strung light for lead work and a Telecaster at high tension for deep rumble. “It’s really nice for your AC/DC stuff – your heavier music.”\nFor his next purchase he’s thinking a Fender Jazzmaster, a Rickenbacker, or maybe a kit guitar, where he finds the parts and assembles them himself. He’s already trawled eBay for necks. Making a guitar is a rite of passage for some. Did he make models as a kid? “Yes.” Model airplanes? “Yep.” It’s the same thing.\nDoherty’s wife, a forensics police officer, has a say in his guitar spending (a Jazzmaster, for example, can cost up to $4500), and likes to listen to him practise. “She says that she looks forward to it each night, but I think that’s because I don’t sing.”\nZipping over oceans in the captain’s seat sounds romantic but there’s a lot of down time at destination, which Doherty uses to “detune after a long day”. He has an electric guitar specially for travelling – its neck is regular length, but the rest of the instrument is miniature. “The fun part is taking it through security,” he says. It turns out pilots have to queue like everyone else and are just as likely to be pulled aside at Customs, especially when carrying strange-shaped bags.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

For him the joy of playing comes not “from a precision point of view; it’s more about how you feel”.\n“I’m in the vintage class now,” he says. Does that mean 50 is old? “Well, you’re as old as you feel.” A quick smile, shoulders relax. “You see people who want to be younger and sometimes it’s a bit over the top.”\nWhat that says about Angus Young, age 60, is anyone’s guess.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/108916474116836487598", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JeremyChunn1"], "published": "2015-07-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T10:11:26.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
