The landmark tower, co-owned by St Martins Properties and the Grollo Group, was completed in 1986.\n\"This is our family heritage,\" Mr Grollo said. \"That's why it's taken so long. It's a delicate process.\"\nMr Grollo said the classic large stone foyers of major corporate towers – of the type his father Rino and uncle Bruno famously built – were now evolving into something else.\n\"They need to be activated. They become a second workspace and meeting room. Those things are important for creating a vertical village.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T18:34:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
