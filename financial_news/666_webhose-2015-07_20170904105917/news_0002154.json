Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Fleur Anderson So far, our political leaders arguing the case for important economic reform – from the GST to the introduction of an emissions trading scheme – have the same rate of success as eating jelly with a chopstick.\nFor about five minutes this week, Treasurer Joe Hockey pressed the states to consider increasing the GST after yet another speech about the need for a mature conversation about tax reform\nThe next day he declared it \"game over\", after being confronted by the formidable spectacle of Victorian Labor Premier Daniel Andrews (the youngish one with the glasses?, the rest of Australia asks) saying no to the idea in a radio interview.\nPhew. What a relief that whole issue has been resolved. Some people thought the GST reform debate might take months or even years to find consensus.\nBut it is going to make dinner conversation a bit awkward at the first federal, state and territory leaders' retreat in Sydney on Wednesday and Thursday, where the main topic of discussion will be, ahem, the future of the federation.\n\"We have a political culture that has the ambition of a gnat,\" Paul Keating told a business audience this week. It's hard to disagree, when every time a conversation gets to the difficult, pointy bit our political leaders throw in the towel and revert to the 2013 election playbook.\nTony Abbott returns to the theme of Labor's addiction to great big new taxes, and Bill Shorten reprises that old favourite that the Liberals are a bunch of out-of-touch silvertails.\nWorld has changed Problem is, with another federal election only months away, the world has changed since 2013. Take, for example, the see-sawing political fortunes over the environment this week.\nAbbott started the week under fire from environmental types for ordering the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, that government-owned organisation that refuses to die despite the fervent hopes of its political master, to stop putting funds into wind power.\nThe prohibition makes life tricky for the fund. Analysts say about a third of the renewable energy proposals it considers relate to wind power and excluding this sector would make its task of achieving a return of double the government bond rate all but impossible.\nEven the Liberal Party's staunchest friends are getting cranky about some of its other environmental decisions.\nSydney broadcaster Alan Jones, who hates wind farms and the carbon tax more than anyone, tore strips off Environment Minister Greg Hunt on Thursday about the $1 billion Shenhua Watermark coal mine near Gunnedah, NSW, and spent half an hour the previous day ranting about the Abbott government's decision to give preliminary approval to the project.\nThe Nationals deputy leader and Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce was so incensed that he risked his cabinet position by criticising the plan to have a massive open-cut mine on prime agricultural land as a \"world gone mad\".\n\"The government is in massive trouble here and the public have had a gutful,\" Jones railed on 2GB Radio on Thursday.\nLooking wrong-footed Could it be that the Coalition was looking wrong-footed on the issue of the environment even in the eyes of the ordinary non-cheesecloth-wearing population?\nSo the timing of a leak in News Limited newspapers about Labor's back-from-the-dead \"carbon tax\" was a gift from the gods for the Coalition.\nComing a week before Labor's national conference, the leak appeared designed – by government agents or within Labor itself, depending on who you ask – to inflict maximum damage on Shorten's leadership.\nAnd while Labor has made no secret it would take an emissions trading scheme to the next election, Shorten's response had every appearance of a politician's weasel words – as the government no doubt knew it would.\nThe suggestion a carbon tax would return under Labor was \"complete rubbish\", he said.\nRubbish, schrubbish. To the rest of us who don't follow obsessively climate politics between taking the kids to school and holding down a day job, the terms carbon tax, carbon price and emissions trading scheme are eye-glazing jargon.\nOvernight conversion But a bit like the almost overnight conversion by developed nations on the legalisation on gay marriage, so too the debate on climate change has transformed while politicians were occupied with other things.\nInstead of unpopular \"carbon taxes\" that in Australia claimed the scalps of two prime ministers, market forces, technology change and the application of old-fashioned \"clean air\" regulations like the US Clean Air Act of 1970 are gradually doing the job the 2009 Copenhagen climate conference failed to do.\nWhile Australia was getting bogged down in the details of an emissions trading scheme versus a carbon tax, the secretly negotiated agreement between the US and China to reduce their emissions over the next decade has made climate change fashionable again.\nAnd thanks to more fuel-efficient cars and the explosion in better batteries to store household solar power and the like, climate change might not be the dirty word it was during the 2013 election. The irony is many of these goods will be built by Chinese companies, to be exported to Australian consumers.\nThe challenge for Labor and Bill Shorten is to explain to voters – simply, convincingly, and persistently – why there should be a price on carbon and persuading them in only a matter of months that a Labor government will not mean an end of days.\nJohn Howard's persistence in selling a complex and tough new tax known as the GST helped him to scrap through to retain government at the 1998 election. A similar sales job from the disadvantage of opposition is tough ask of Shorten, still known by large slabs of the population as \"whatshisname\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/fleur_anderson"], "published": "2015-07-16T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:16:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
