It is very easy to apply and rubs on just like a wipe would. I just used it on my arms and legs at first to see how it would come out and I have to say I was very pleased with the results. It didn't turn me orange like some others I had used in the past and it also didn't make me so dark that it was completely unbelievable. I really like these. After that first application I actually went ahead and did the rest of my body and had alot of people ask me if I had been tanning. I will definitely continue to use these over summer because I will never have the time to go get a real tan and this is just as good. I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.\"\nAbout Thermalabs\nThermalabs was created with a vision to create a skin cancer free world.
