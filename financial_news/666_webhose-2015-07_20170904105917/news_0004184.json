The information released is only estimated because New Zealand still has no foreign buyers register. \nThe sales data covers 45 percent of all Auckland sales from February to April this year and shows that while Chinese make up nine percent of the Auckland population, 39.5 percent of the houses sold in Auckland were to people with Chinese surnames. \nThe Nation revealed that of suburbs with more than 100 house sales, the three most popular amongst those with Chinese surnames were Albany, Epsom and Milford. \nLabour Housing spokesperson Phil Twyford says it is comprehensive data from a major Auckland real estate firm. \n\"The records include 4000 thousand individual house record showing every house sold in the Auckland region over the three month period,\" says Mr Twyford. \n\"That is a remarkable discrepancy and in my view is simply not plausible to suggestâ€¦that ethnic Chinese people buying houses in Auckland are all Chinese New Zealanders. It points I think to only one possible conclusion, and that is that off-shore Chinese investors have a very significant presence in the Auckland real-estate market.\" \nACT Leader David Seymour acknowledges the records are plausible but he believes Labour is fronting with these statistics to gain votes \"that they can't find anywhere else\". \n\"They're not really interested in foreign ownership they're interested in targeting Chinese and that is racist,\" says Mr Seymour. \nWatch the video for the full interview with Phil Twyford. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T04:37:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
