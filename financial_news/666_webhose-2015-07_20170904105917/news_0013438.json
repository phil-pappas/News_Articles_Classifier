The last record-holder included 129 photos. \nThe house has its own tennis court (Blenheim Park Estates) \nThe house, Lofties, in Worksop, near Sheffield, is on the market at just under £3m and has plenty of rooms for the agents, Blenheim Park Estates, to show off. \nIncluded in the 142 image photo album are snaps of the five ensuite bedrooms, home cinema, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, sauna and gym. \nThe luxurious pad also comes with eight acres of grounds, including tennis courts, a secret garden and fire pit. \nIdeal for rainy days: the home cinema (Blenheim Park Estates) \nAlso in the vast back garden is a summerhouse, once used as a stables before being converted to a games room and annexe. \nThe master bedroom comes with an oak-panelled dressing room and ensuite with Nordic steam shower. \nRather than make the effort of going out, the new owners could stay in and have a drink at their very own bar. \nThe home has indoor and outdoor pools (Blenheim Park Estates) \nAline Newton, Sales Manager at Blenheim Park Estates said: “The property totally deserves as many photographs as you can produce. \n“It’s an absolutely stunning property. The standard of the interior is so high and it really does have to be viewed to be appreciated. \n\"It offers so much - five ensuite bedrooms, a fantastic state of the art kitchen.” \nThe owners evidently like to keep fit with their own gym in the house (Blenheim Park Estates) \nBut experts from Rightmove (LSE: RMV.L - news ) warned that including too many photos with a property listing can be self-defeating. \nHaving too few pictures puts people off, but so can having too many. \nMiles Shipside, commercial director at Rightmove said there were “some interesting dynamics at play”. \nThe house has sprawling grounds (Blenheim Park Estates) \n“Sometimes to impress potential sellers the agent will take a lot of photographs to say, ‘look how much time and effort I have spent marketing this property’,\" MrShipside said. \n“It can be a law of negative returns. People’s attention spans are relatively short if you give everything away about a property people might not go and see it. \n“You want people to be excited about what they see on the internet and then go and visit it.” \nRooms come with view of the expansive gardens (Blenheim Park Estates) \nRightmove chief executive Nick McKittrick said: “We have run seminars across the country for our agent customers where we get 100 or so of our customers together and we talk about internet marketing. \n“What we find is if you have around about nine or 10 images that seems to be the optimum.” \nThere is even a fire pit in the garden (Blenheim Park Estates)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T08:47:18.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
