The audience for soccer in the U.S. has more than doubled since the last Women's World Cup tournament, and the price tag for carrying soccer games across leagues and contests has similarly spiked. \n\"The English Premier League, which is on the market at the moment, is likely to at least double in value in any new deal,\" wrote Robin Jellis, editor of trade publication TV Sports Markets, in an email. \"And this is after the value of Premier League rights in the US increased by almost 300% in the previous rights auction, won by NBC.\" \nComcast's ( CMCSA - Get Report ) NBC/Universal is currently paying $250 million for the rights to broadcast the 2013 to 2015 season. That investment has already delivered a bigger average audience than the NHL. \nMust Read: Why Cash-Cow ESPN Is Becoming a Drag on Disney \nThe Women's World Cup final on Fox this Sunday had 22.86 million viewers at its peak, beating out this year's NBA Finals and Stanley Cup, and rivaling Game 7 of the 2014 World Series. \nThe Premier League is not the only soccer league able to command skyrocketing bids in the U.S., Jellis observed. \n\"Last May, Major League Soccer and U.S. Soccer secured massive increases of close to 400%, following only a small increase in the deal before that,\" said Jellis. \nAs each attempts to secure a spot as the No. 2 sports broadcaster behind Disney 's ( DIS - Get Report ) ESPN, NBC and Fox have recently vied for soccer broadcasting rights. \nTo sweeten its bid for the Premier League, NBC offered a streaming and bonus channel package called Premier League LiveExtra, released the NBC Sports MatchMaker app to help fans find bars near them showing EPL games, and hired on-site talent (including current U.S. national men's team keeper Tim Howard) to call the games. \nFox has locked up the rights to all FIFA World Cup play and qualifiers through the men's tournament in 2026. Fox also currently owns the rights to broadcast the Champions League through 2018 and the German Bundesliga for the next five years. Fox and ESPN share the rights to Major League Soccer in the U.S. \nAs ratings for the Women's World Cup final showed, soccer in the U.S. is no longer a niche sport. As its popularity continues to rise, so will the prices that soccer leagues will seek to charge Fox, ESPN and other eager networks to gather their games.
