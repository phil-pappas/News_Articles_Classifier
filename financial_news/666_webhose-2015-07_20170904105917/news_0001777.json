Glenn Hunt by Joanna Mather Investment in residential property through self-managed superannuation funds has risen 11 per cent in the past year and jumped by nearly 60 per cent since 2011.\nThe big increase in property investment by SMSFs is highlighted by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in its submission to a parliamentary inquiry on home ownership .\nSince the law changed in 2003 to allow SMSFs to borrow money, concern has grown about the influence of the cashed-up funds on the housing market.\n\"As at March 2015, the value of residential real property investments through SMSFs was $21.78 billion … up from $19.49 billion … in March 2014,\" the ASIC submission said.\nDespite the growth, residential property still makes up less than 4 per cent of total Australian and overseas assets held by SMSFs, of which there are more than 500,000.\nIn a submission to the same inquiry, the Reserve Bank of Australia observed that \"although the share of the housing stock owned by these funds is small, it has grown quickly\".\nBan recommended David Murray's financial system inquiry recommended a ban on SMSFs borrowing to buy assets such as property and shares.\n The RBA agreed. \"The bank has previously observed that leverage in superannuation funds may increase vulnerabilities in the financial system and therefore supports limiting the scope for leverage in these funds,\" the submission said.\nThe government has yet to provide a formal respond to the inquiry.\nThe RBA submission also highlighted a recent spike in the number of over-60s holding geared property.\nIn the early 2000s, that age group accounted for 12 per cent of geared properties in Australia.\nBut by 2011-12, over-60s accounted for a fifth of such properties.\n\"This shift in the distribution of investors towards older individuals reflects both the ageing of the population as well as an increase in the extent of investment property ownership within this age group,\" the RBA said.\nSubmission causes stir \"Individuals in this group also became more likely to have a mortgage against their property investment, with about half of these investors claiming interest deductions from their total incomes.\"\nThe RBA's submission caused a stir by suggesting the negative gearing regime should be revisited, despite the Abbott government's vehement objection to change in that regard.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey shrugged off the RBA's comments, insisting that middle-income earners are the major beneficiaries of the tax break.\n\"More policemen negatively gear than specialised tax accountants, management consultants or university lecturers,\" Mr Hockey told 2UE on Thursday.\n\"This is a way for people on medium incomes, or even lower incomes, to be able to get into the property market.\"\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority anticipates lending to property investors will plateau.\nGrowth plateaus \"After accelerating throughout 2014, the growth in investment lending appears to have begun to plateau in 2015,\" APRA's submission said.\nWith house prices soaring in Sydney and home ownership rates among younger Australians declining, Mr Hockey announced a parliamentary inquiry into home ownership in May.\nHe misstepped in June by advising people wanting to buy their first homes to \"get a good job\".\nMortgage Choice chief executive John Flavell said getting rid of negative gearing would make housing less affordable.\nThis was because there would be less investment in new housing stock and investors faced with a winding back of tax concessions would put rents up to cover their losses.\n\"I'm with the government in terms of ruling it out,\" he said. \"I'm looking at affordability of housing across the board, for renters as well as owner-occupiers.\"\nRead next: Shares outperform other assets for SMSF investors", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:07:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
