James Alcock Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle Bill Shorten has recorded his lowest approval rating as Opposition Leader – and the number of voters who believe he has the confidence of his party has slumped – but he still leads Prime Minister Tony Abbott as preferred prime minister, and Labor holds an election winning lead, in the latest Fairfax-Ipsos poll.\nAfter a fortnight of criticism of Labor tactics, and an admission that he lied in 2013 about a Rudd challenge to then prime minister Julia Gillard, Mr Shorten goes into his appearance before the royal commission into trade union corruption on Wednesday with a personal approval rating that has slumped six points to 35 per cent.\nHis disapproval rating has jumped eight points since June to 55 per cent, giving him a net approval of -20, down 14 points since June.\nHowever, despite the abysmal figures, Mr Shorten still has a slightly better net approval rating than the Prime Minister (-23). Mr Abbott's approval rating is also down, dropping four points since June to 36 per cent, while his disapproval at 59 per cent is up five points.\nMr Shorten is still preferred as prime minister by 43 per cent of voters (up one point since June); while 39 per cent prefer Mr Abbott (down two points since June).\nThe poll of 1402 respondents, conducted between July 2 and July 4, shows Labor retains an unchanged 53-47 per cent two-party preferred lead over the Coalition, reinforced by a 16 per cent primary vote for the Greens (up two points since June).\nThe two-party preferred vote calculation, which represents a 6.5 point swing against the Abbott government since the September 2013 federal election, is the same whether based on preferences at the last election or current stated preferences.\nLabor's primary vote has declined two points since June to 35 per cent, and is now just two points above the 33 per cent it recorded at the last election. The Coalition's primary vote is down one point to 39 per cent compared with 46 per cent at the 2013 poll.\n Labor holds a substantial lead among all groups of voters other than those aged 55 or over. It holds a big lead among female voters.\nOne of the biggest declines in voters' ratings of the Opposition Leader has been on the question of whether he has the confidence of his party.\nA massive 15 per cent slump since November in this measures of leadership attributes to 56 per cent follows the airing of the ABC's The Killing Season , in which voters were reminded of Mr Shorten's role in coups against both Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard and amid widespread criticism of his stance on issues such as pension reform.\nThe criticism of Mr Shorten helped fuel early election speculation in the final weeks of the winter sitting of Parliament, with questions being asked about whether the government would seek to exploit the Opposition Leader's woes.\nWhile the poor polling will inevitably result in leadership speculation, the issue is more complicated in the case of Mr Shorten because of rules set down by the Labor Caucus after Mr Rudd's return to the prime ministership which are supposed to protect the leader from leadership challenges between election campaigns.\nQuestions have emerged about how solid this arrangement is, however, in the light of the publication of Labor's draft platform and rules ahead of its national conference later this month.\nThe rules show that while there is a proposal to include rules for electing leaders in the party's formal documents, the rules governing a leader's removal are not being put forward.\nDespite the huge drop (56 per cent) in the number of voters believing Mr Shorten has the confidence of his party, he still has a slightly higher rating on this measure than Mr Abbott (51 per cent).\nHe is also regarded as more competent than Mr Abbott (52 per cent to 45 per cent) and trustworthy (39 per cent to 35 per cent).\nHowever, Mr Abbott is seen to have a clearer vision for Australia's future than Mr Shorten (49 per cent to 36 per cent) and a firmer grasp on economic policy (47 per cent to 43 per cent), and is seen as a stronger leader (42 per cent to 34 per cent).\nThe Prime Minister is seen as having a firmer grasp on foreign policy (42 per cent to 39 per cent) but almost twice as many voters believe Mr Shorten has a firmer grasp on social policy than Mr Abbott (59 per cent to 30 per cent).\nMr Abbott has a dominant lead on the question of 'which can leader makes things happen' (55 per cent to 35 per cent) but is seen to be much less open to ideas than Mr Shorten (34 to 68 per cent).\nOn negative attributes, the Opposition Leader is seen to be much more easily influenced by minority groups (46 to 28 per cent).", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/latingle", "http://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/ipsos_2015jul5_hype/index.html", "http://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "http://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/ipsosextra_2015jul5_hype/index.html", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559"], "published": "2015-07-05T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:08:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
