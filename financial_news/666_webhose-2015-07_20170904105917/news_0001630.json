But their mindset is changing. Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro Bank hybrids are never far from controversy. These complex securities that are part debt and part equity have been sold enthusiastically to retail investors at prices that larger professional investors have snubbed their noses at, often with good reason.\nYet in a world where the concept of \"too big to fail\" must be dispensed with, they're precisely the types of capital banks around the world are being forced to issue. It is these investors – not taxpayers – that governments would prefer are called upon in a crisis.\nBank hybrids are effectively bank \"catastrophe insurance\": the buyer accepts higher premiums than safer deposits or senior debt but the capital provided is called upon in the event of extreme losses.\nThe problem in Australia is that those providing this insurance have been retail investors: the bank's customers; depositors; shareholders; and taxpayers. It doesn't make for a robust financial system when some of those you're trying to protect become collateral damage.\nHybrids are controversial because they pit two regulators against each other. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's role is to protect depositors; therefore it wants hybrids to be easier for banks to write off and cover losses. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission wants to make sure these securities are bought by those who understand them and are aware of the risks.\nThat's a good reason why more should be done to encourage wholesale professional investors in Australia and offshore to provide more of this Tier I capital to the banks. An even better reason is that despite our hundreds of billions of self-managed super money looking for yield, there just isn't enough capacity in the retail market to meet the growing capital demands of the banks.\nWeak markets If that was in doubt, the persistent weakness in bank hybrid markets following last year's $3 billion Perls VII issue by Commonwealth Bank of Australia shows the market has limited capacity to meet the needs of the banks that are set to grow further.\n The banks may have felt that retail investors, often with limited pricing power, were a cheap and abundant source of capital. But their mindset is changing and they're openly seeking ways to raise more of this form of capital in the wholesale market.\nOne of the impediments faced by the banks is their biggest selling point in the retail market – the fact that distributions are franked. Because hybrid coupons are discretionary (so that they can be turned off in times of crisis) they must be franked, and since institutions either can't access franking credits or fund raters such as Morningstar don't factor them into their performance, they're reluctant investors.\nChanges to tax laws that allow the banks to issue Tier I capital with unfranked distributions would likely broaden the investor base to include yield-hungry funds around the world. The Australian Bankers' Association has raised the issue in its submission to the government's tax white paper, and systemically it has merit. If foreign investors and large institutions well equipped to deal with losses are underwriting the next banking crisis in place of individuals, APRA should take comfort.\nSo to should ASIC. With wholesale investors setting the cost of Tier I capital, there will be less anxiety that the man on the street is getting a raw deal.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-07-12T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T11:02:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
