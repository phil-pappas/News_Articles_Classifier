Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Labor will spend $450 million on humanitarian measures as part of a trade-off with the Left faction to allow a future Labor prime minister to turn back boats and spare Bill Shorten a potentially fatal defeat at the hands of his own party.\nThe money will be given to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to bolster its work in the region. In addition, a Labor government will double Australia's annual humanitarian intake to 27,000 refugees by 2025, which would have an additional budgetary impact.\nIt will abolish temporary protection visas, which the Abbott government restored with the help of Senate independents, speed up the processing of asylum seekers in offshore detention centres, and implement independent oversight of the facilities and child protection measures.\nIt will also reinstate references to the UN Refugees Convention in the Migration Act to reverse the Abbott government's \"retrograde efforts to undermine international law\" and take a leadership role within south- east Asia and the Pacific to build a regional humanitarian framework to improve the situation of asylum seekers.\nAustralia would also advocate for work rights for asylum seekers in countries where they are detained, similar to what would have been achieved under the proposed Malaysia Agreement in 2011\nThe package will be unveiled on Saturday morning before what is expected to be a fiery debate.\nOn Friday, as the issue dominated the first day of the ALP National Conference, shadow immigration minister Richard Marles warned Labor would be \"condemned to history\" should it ever allow the people-smuggling trade to continue.\nMr Marles said that Labor, if elected, would improve the facilities on Nauru and Manus Island but would never let the people there settle in Australia.\n \"I don't think those 2000 people can come here. There would be boats on the water the following day,\" he said.\nFactional bosses fighting to stop Mr Shorten being rolled over his proposal to adopt Coalition policy were cautiously optimistic but with neither faction having a majority among the 397 delegates, they were more reserved than usual when trying to forecast the outcome.\nThe Left, which is in principle opposed to what Mr Shorten wants to do, will not decide until Saturday morning which way to go. As of late Friday, its options ranged from not moving any motion to have the policy explicitly rule out turn-backs, allowing them with conditions, to ruling them out altogether.\nIn an otherwise well received opening speech to the conference, Mr Shorten was booed when he promised a safe and humane immigration policy.\nMr Shorten used the speech to unofficially kick-start his election pitch, offering a range of policy proposals and calling on the Labor faithful to use the examples of Queensland and Victoria as inspiration to get rid of a one-term government.\nHe received the loudest applause when he challenged Tony Abbott to another climate change election with Labor to take to the voters a renewable energy target of 50 per cent by 2030 and a small emissions trading scheme dealing in low-cost international permits. Despite the carbon tax helping kill the Gillard government, Mr Shorten was defiant.\n\"We will win this one,\" Mr Shorten said to a standing ovation.\n\"We will not be intimidated by ridiculous, ignorant, fearmongering scare campaigns that will come.\"\nMr Shorten called for 50 per cent of all Labor MPs to be women by 2025, set a timetable for Australia to become a republic by the same date, and promised to build, maintain and sustain the next fleet of submarines in Australia.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-24T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:09:20.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
