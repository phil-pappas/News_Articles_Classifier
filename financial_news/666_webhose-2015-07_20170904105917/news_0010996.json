However, it no longer has any nomad clients after the last one, Forum Energy (LSE: FEP.L - news ) , was taken private by Philex Petroleum. Forum's shares were cancelled from Aim on June 25. \nAnother client, NAHL Group (LSE: NAH.L - news ) , parted ways in May as Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) became its sole broker. \nThere are now 39 nomads registered with the London Stock Exchange Group, which runs Aim. Three of these advisers PwC, HSBC, Deloitte have no current nomad clients, while several large investment banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch have recently withdrawn their services from the junior stock market. \nMarcus Stuttard, the head of Aim, recently said the drop-off in advisers had cleared out “a long tail of inactive nomads”. \nAim is the listing venue for more than a thousand small-cap and fast-growing companies. The market has helped firms to raise £90bn since its inception 20 years ago, although it has faced criticism for price growth that has lagged behind other global markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T17:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T17:23:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
