Qualcomm has also been hit hard in China where it had to pay $975m to settle an anti-trust case after being accused of overcharging and exploiting its position in the wireless communications standards sector. This has forced the company to lower the revenue it can charge for patents in the region. \nQualcomm said that this situation being settled is one reason for pursuing new ideas for the future, as the company can now operate with a legal and financial clarity that was not available while the case was ongoing. \nNeil Mawston, at analyst firm Strategy Analytics, told V3 that Qualcomm had been caught in a \"perform storm\" of problems and is likely to face an uphill struggle for up to two years. \n\"First, Qualcomm was forced by the Chinese government to reduce the prices of its intellectual property for mobile phones. Second, Qualcomm had well-publicised performance issues with some of its mobile chipsets,\" he said. \n\"And third, MediaTek and Spreadtrum have significantly upped their game this year and are giving Qualcomm unexpected competition.\" Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T14:58:44.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
