We hope that this will not be the case with Montana.\" \nEarlier on Thursday, the board of the Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) issued a statement saying that Montana had been dismissed with immediate effect. \nHis removal came amid reports that Prasa had put billions into new diesel locomotives which allegedly did not conform to SA rail line standards. \nNumsa said it had had its own concerns about the locomotives. \nJim said that even with Montana gone, they hoped to still get answers about the deal. \n\"As Numsa, we are determined to get to the bottom of the Prasa board's decision to let Lucky Montana go,\" he said. \nMeanwhile, the Prasa board said that it resolved that Montana will not be required to work the remainder of his notice period, which commenced on June 1 until December 2015. \n\"Mr Montana's last day of employment with Prasa will accordingly be July 15 2015,\" Prasa said in a statement on Thursday. \nUntil the Prasa board finds a \"suitable replacement\", Prasa chief operations officer Nathi Khena would step into the role. \nKhena is also acting CEO of Autopax. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:08:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
