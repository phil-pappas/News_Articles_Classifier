NZAS requires more time to fully analyse its options before making a decision,\" he said in a statement. \n\"We think it is in all parties' interests to ensure that a decision is based on the most complete information.\" \nThe smelter contributes around $525 million to the Southland community and employs hundreds of people. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T00:44:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
