Bond was the chief executive of Asda, while Mountford set up Sainsbury’s clothing business Tu, before leaving for Matalan. \nAndy Bond is a keen cyclist \nHowever, two years ago, both retail executives found themselves considering their futures, and they decided to meet for coffee. \n“I had already set up the investment vehicle that owns the company,” Bond explains. \n“Adrian and I met out of mutual interest. We had bumped into each other and heard of each other when Adrian ran Tu clothing and I ran George [Asda’s clothing brand]. We were sort of arch-rivals. \n“We started talking, and unbelievably Adrian came to the table with exactly the same idea as I did. \n“That was a couple of years ago. Then we looked at different ways to get it off the ground. We looked at buying a business, which didn’t happen, so we decided to launch it from scratch instead.” \nTheir idea was to create a h igh-street discount clothing chain aimed at thirtysomething mothers with children . \nBond will not say what business they tried to buy, although he insists it was “definitely not” BHS. \n“What I don’t want to project is that this is plan B,” Bond adds. “There are at least as many reasons why this is a better idea than buying a chain you get to start from scratch, you don’t have to turn something around, you can build your own team, you can build your own culture, and you can decide exactly what the product offering is because you have got no pipeline of stock coming your way.” \nPep & Co sells women and children’s clothing, homewares and some everyday items such as nappies. Menswear is likely to follow in the future. About 95pc of products will cost £10 or less. \nThe first shop opened in Kettering in Northamptonshire last Wednesday, with the store hitting its opening day sales target within an hour-and-a- quarter. Later this month, Pep&Co will start opening 49 more stores. If all goes to plan, the fledging company will open 50 shops in 50 days. \nBond and Mountford are focusing on so-called “secondary locations”, which have been shunned by the leading retail brands in favour of Westfield (Other OTC: WEFIF - news ) shopping centres and major cities. As well as Kettering, Boston, Newport (NasdaqGS: NEWP - news ) and West Bromwich will have new stores. None of the first 50 shops is in London. \n“We are playing towards more convenient shopping high street or town centre locations,” Bond says outside the first shop on opening day. “People are shopping more in town and less out of town \n“This is the B&M of clothing, the Aldi of clothing. When you think about it, all of the headline names that people are talking about in discount retailing, none of them sell clothing, with the exception of Primark. \n“There has been this huge surge in discount retailing, but in many towns there is no discount clothing retailer. Primark are typically in much larger locations. I think this fills a gap.” \nThe strategy of opening 50 shops in 50 days will allow the company to build scale and buy clothing from suppliers at a competitive price. \nSuppliers are prepared to deal with Pep&Co because of the experience of its management team and because it is backed by Pepkor, the African clothing and homeware empire. \nPepkor was built by billionaire Christo Wiese, who sold the company last year to furniture group Steinhoff, leaving the tycoon with 20pc of the enlarged company. \nBond insists that Wiese has left the management team to run the new retailer. \n“I met Christo a long time ago when I was working for Asda,” Bond says. “Christo is involved, but very much as an arm’s-length investor.” \nThe former Asda chief insists that “absolutely nothing” will change for Pep&Co despite Wiese’s investment business Brait buying rival high-street chain New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) Look. \nAs for finance, Bond and the management team have stumped up a significant amount of the £20m required to get Pep&Co up and running. \n“That is between me and my bank manager, who happens to be my wife,” he says when asked precisely how much he has stumped up. “We have all put enough money in that we can’t afford to lose.” \nDoes the venture feel risky, then? \n“It feels less risky at 12.30 than it did at nine o’clock this morning,” he replies. “Of course, there is a degree of risk, but we researched this for a long time. Adrian and I have been working on this for nearly two years now, but we have mitigated that risk through great research, recruiting a team with a lot of experience and having a backer that takes a long-term rather than a short-term view. \n“Adrian, Cathy [Haydon, the trading director], and my experience has been almost exclusively in discount retailing. We understand this shopper inside out it’s not like we are three 30-year-olds. We have got 75 years’ experience. Not many start-ups get that level of management.” \nBond and Mountford plan to decide whether to expand the business further after a full season of clothing comes to an end in January. If they decide to press ahead with Pep&Co, it could grow to have 1,000 shops across the country. \nBond says: “If we are successful, of course we want to expand further. You do the desktop work and there are roughly 1,000 towns like this [Kettering]. So theoretically that is 1,000 stores. Whether we ever get there, who knows?” \nAlthough Bond is reluctant to admit it, Pep&Co’s range in Kettering feels like the clothing department of a supermarket such as Asda that has been moved to the high street. Given the success of George, Tu, and F&F at Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) , this could prove a winning formula. \n“The target customer is an Asda shopper, but it is a different location,” he explains. \n“I don’t think it is case of Pep&Co wins, Asda loses, or Pep&Co wins, Primark loses. We are just following the right trends. Convenience shopping, discount retailing and \nmass-market consumers.” \nNo matter how Pep&Co turns out, Bond says that it has been “unbelievable” for the management team to build their own business. \n“There are very few opportunities in life when you can say ‘that’s mine’. \n“But this is ours. It’s not Asda’s, it’s not some generic corporation’s. We have done this.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T02:42:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
