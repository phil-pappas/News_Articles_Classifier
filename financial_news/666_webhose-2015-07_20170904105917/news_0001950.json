Speculation that the development would be anchored by a Walmart have persisted since the February 2014 acquisition of the two dead shopping centers Central Square will replace because The Kroenke Group is owned by billionaire Stan Kroenke , the husband of Walmart heiress Ann Walton Kroenke and developer of several Walmart-anchored projects. RELATED: Metcalf developers get positive reviews, Walmart warning Lane4 President Owen Buckley, who has been the spokesman for the Central Square project, has consistently said that it is premature to identify any potential tenant. The recently filing of the preliminary development plan represents the start of the planning and zoning approval process for the project, which covers the 67 acres at the northeast and southwest corners of 95th Street and Metcalf Avenue. The acreage is currently occupied by the shuttered Metcalf South and 95 West shopping centers, which will be demolished with the exception of the stand-alone Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurants on the north, or 95 West, side of the redevelopment site. The preliminary plan and rezoning for the project are scheduled to be considered during the Aug. 10 Overland Park Planning Commission meeting. The developers' request for $80 million in incentives for the Central Square project also remains to be considered. RELATED: Overland Park Council creates incentives district for Central Square project The Central Square plan calls for a mix of about 500,000 square feet of restaurants, retail and entertainment space, plus about 50,000 square feet of \"creative\" office space and 450 luxury apartments. One of the larger buildings shown on the preliminary plan is labeled as a theater. It is located immediately west of the Olive Garden, across 95th Street from the 177,000-square-foot big-box. Buckley last year expressed hope that the owners of the Glenwood Arts Theatre would decide to relocate from Metcalf South to a newly constructed facility in the Central Square development. But officials with the theater's operating group, Fine Arts Theatre Group, said the rental rate they were quoted was too high. Therefore, after becoming one of the last Metcalf South tenants to close earlier this year, the theater operation was merged with Fine Arts' five-screen Leawood Theatre at 95th Street and Mission Road, which was rebranded as the Glenwood Arts. \nWant Kansas City Residential Real Estate news in your inbox?
