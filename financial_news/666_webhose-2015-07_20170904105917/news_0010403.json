The key strengths of the project include:  \n\n- A world-class multi-element resource base that remains open to expansion allowing for further development opportunities;\n- A simple process flow sheet that has been rigorously developed which concentrates the key value minerals into a low-mass high grade mineral concentrate for efficient refining;\n- Unlike many projects in the rare earth sector (developed or emerging) the mineral concentrate can be treated by a simple atmospheric acid leach circuit without complex and costly mineral cracking presenting significant cost benefits with reduced technical risk;\n- By-product credits reduce the costs of rare earth production significantly;\n- Incremental cost of recovering uranium is low at less than 5.80/lb U3O8;\n- Ability to land lanthanum and cerium products in Europe for - Long term price forecast for the critical mixed rare earth concentrate of 78.6/kg which provides a high margin to the net unit operating cost of US8.56/kg critical rare earth oxide (net of by-product credits).\n\nMaiden Ore Reserve Estimate \n\nFollowing the release of the Feasibility Study GMEL released a maiden Ore Reserve Estimate for the Kvanefjeld Project of 108Mt at 362ppm U3O8 2600ppm zinc and 14300ppm total rare earth oxides. \n\nThe Ore Reserves are situated in the upper part of the Kvanefjeld Deposit the largest of three defined mineral resources within the broader project area. \n\nAt the projected production rate of 3 million tonnes per annum the initial reserves are sufficient to sustain 37 years of operation inclusive of ramp-up. \n\nThe resource base of greater than 1 billion tonnes will allow for both capacity expansions and mine-life extensions.  \n\n\nRegulatory Matters \n\nA series of conventions that deal with safety and protection in relation to radioactive materials are now in public hearing in Greenland with the hearing period closing in early August. \n\nThe necessary conventions have been identified through work conducted by Greenland and Denmark on regulations pertaining to the mining and handling of radioactive materials. \n\nWhile Denmark is a signatory to all the conventions in the current public hearing Greenland’s status requires independent ratification following public hearing.  \n\nPilot Plant Operation – Concentrator Circuit\n\nDuring Q2 GGG conducted a successful pilot plant operation of the concentrator (beneficiation) circuit. \n\nThe pilot plant operation was conducted through the EURARE program at the laboratories of GTK Finland. \n\nFroth flotation was used to produce a 2 tonnes of mineral concentrate rich in rare earth elements and uranium and a zinc concentrate.  \n\nNotably the plant operated at feasibility design criteria following ramp-up.\n\nThe next test work stage will produce high-purity rare earth concentrates that will benefit the EURARE program by providing feed for the subsequent rare earth separation work.\n\nThis was the third pilot plant operation of the concentrator circuit with each run conducted at an increasing scale. \n\nThe beneficiation circuit has been rigorously developed over a number of years. \n\nExtensive test work confirms the ability to cost-effectively concentrate the main rare earth minerals into less than 10% of the original ore mass using a single low-risk method in froth flotation. \n\nThe second and third (most recent) pilot plants have incorporated Jameson Cell technology which has over 20 years of commercialisation with more than 300 installations and is well suited to the Kvanefjeld ore-type.\n\nAnalysis \n\nGreenland Minerals and Energy is finalising the key Environmental and Social Impact Assessment for its Kvanefjeld Project through 3Q 2015.\n \nOnce completed the company will proceed with securing the Mining Licence one of the major project milestones.\n\nIt has also identified some areas of the project that it is looking to optimise.\n\nThis includes some obvious cost savings that will improve the economic metrics of the project.\nGGG is well funded with 3.4 million in cash as at 30th June 2015.\n\n\nProactive Investors Australia is the market leader in producing news articles and research reports on ASX emerging companies with distribution in Australia UK North America and Hong Kong / China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T23:54:56.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
