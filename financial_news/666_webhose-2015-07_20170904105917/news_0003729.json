If you are paying high rates on the money you owe, act now to lock-in low repayments for the future. Credit card card debt can be shifted on to the Barclaycard Platinum card no interest will be charged on the balance for almost three years (32 months). The card comes with a fee of 3.5 per cent of the debt that you are moving, which is reduced to 1.59 per cent through a refund. Alternatively, personal loans can be secured at a rate of as little as 3.6 per cent with both M&S Money or Cahoot. Savings With an interest rate rise on the cards, it's best to avoid tying up money in long-term savings accounts where the rates could look very uncompetitive in a year or two.If money is locked away you could be hit with penalties if you want to take cash out.In the mean time, you can keep money in easy to access current accounts without forfeiting returns. If you have a savings pot of between £1,000- £5,000, the Club Lloyds current account pays a rate of four per cent on the balance.The account is fee-free if you pay in at least £1,500 a month. Or if you have a larger lump sum, consider the Santander 123 current account. It pays three per cent on balances over £3,000. The account has a fee of £2 a month but you can also earn cashback of up to three per cent on direct debits. Investments Rising interest rates could be synonymous with rising share prices, according to experts. Though investors have been urged to make sure that portfolios are well balanced ahead of time. Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, said: \"Interest rate hikes are usually seen as a negative for financial markets but this need not necessarily be the case. \"It all depends on the reason why rates are starting to rise. If it reflects a strengthening of the economy rather than fears about inflation, the first rate hike can be associated with rising share prices.“Rate hikes can be accompanied by a rotation from defensive sectors to those linked to economic growth – technology, industrials and consumer discretionary stocks. \"But investors still need to maintain a balanced portfolio because a slow, shallow trajectory for interest rate rises – which I expect - could mean high-quality, income-paying shares remain attractive for some time to come.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T00:31:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
