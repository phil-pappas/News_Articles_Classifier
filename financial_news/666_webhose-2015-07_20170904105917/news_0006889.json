Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Sue Mitchell Australian fashion designers are feeling the pinch after Myer cut 100 brands to make way for new labels as part of a plan to restore sales and earnings growth.\nMyer has notified about 100 men's, women's, children's, footwear and homewares brands they will no longer be listed in its 67 department stores and will kick off a \"spring clean\" sale on Wednesday – less than a week after closing its mid-year clearance.\nThe move would clear floor space for new brands such as Aje, Jack and Jones, Calvin Klein White Label, Daniel Avakian and Oscar de la Renta.\n​Myer's decision came just months after arch-rival David Jones deleted about 180 of its 2400 brands – 80 alone in womenswear – to clear floor space for mid-market brands such as Seed, FCUK, Marcs, Country Road and Trenery.\nMyer chief executive Richard Umbers, who took the helm from Bernie Brookes in March , was hoping the new brands would be as successful in luring shoppers and generating sales growth as they had been at David Jones.\nDavid Jones sales rose 6.4 per cent in the year ending June and more than 10 per cent in the June half – the strongest rate of growth since 2007 – while Myer's sales in the 10 months ending April had risen 1.7 per cent.\nBoth David Jones and Myer declined to identify the deleted brands, saying some had minimal presence in their stores.\nSome brand owners welcomed the moves, saying brand rationalisation at the big department stores had freed up floor space for their labels.\n Too many brands \"I think it's positive because one of my criticisms is they have way too many brands and don't have enough volume to do justice to some of the brands,\" one supplier said.\n\"The new management at Myer and David Jones are placing much more focus on returns and productivity per square metre than we've ever seen before, which is very positive,\" the supplier said.\nOther suppliers said Myer and David Jones were key distributors, especially for smaller brands without stand-alone stores, and they would struggle to find suitable alternative customers.\n\"It is going to make it difficult for some of the small players,\" one supplier said.\n​Mr Umbers was not expected to unveil his strategic blueprint until later this year, but several key elements of his turnaround plan, including digital hubs in stores, new brands and job cuts, had been announced in recent weeks.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/suemitchellafr", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/david-jones-sales-surge-64pc-under-new-owners-woolworths-holdings-20150715-gicz9i.html"], "published": "2015-07-28T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T23:07:41.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
