This will require more than just increasing irrigation capacity and other modest improvements. \nIt may well require considerable research and a great deal of heart-searching among all farmers over how to make agriculture more viable and a more stable contributor to national wealth. \nIf nothing else, it absorbs more manhours of work than any other sector in the economy and is critical in providing a livelihood for millions of Zimbabweans. \nIt is fairly obvious that the old ways are not going to work much longer and new ideas, new tecniques and novel thinking are required. \nIndustry is showing the way. It has now learned that the old ways cannot be restored. The increase in manufacturing output of 1,6 percent this year, faster than the 1,2 percent of last year, reflects what we have said before, that a growing number of industrialists have made the switch from protected monopolies producing overpriced second-rate goods to open markets where quality and price rule. \nNewcomers to industry are finding unexploited niches and are starting to fill these. Such testing times will ensure that as the eastern half of Africa moves towards free trade, our industrialists will be prepared to compete effectively. \nTourism growth, the fastest of all sectors, shows the advantages of creating a decent product and marketing it properly, and other sectors can learn from that. \nMining in Zimbabwe is still growing well, largely because the demand and prices of the minerals we export are less dependent on single markets than, say, base metals. Demand for gold, platinum and palladium grows roughly in line with global growth, not just growth in one country or one region. So prices are a lot less volatile than many other minerals. \nThe minister saw the negative inflation rate as a positive factor; as we have noted before Zimbabwe does not suffer deflation. Slowly falling prices amid growth suggests we are doing a lot of things better, and the growing spending power will boost demand, not cut demand. \nFinally, the minister's appeal for all to close ranks makes sense. Whatever our political persuasion surely more national wealth, more jobs and moving large numbers of Zimbabweans out of poverty are common goals. \nWe are obviously doing quite a lot that is right and debate should not dwell on trashing our progress, but instead be generating new ideas to speed up this growth and progress.
