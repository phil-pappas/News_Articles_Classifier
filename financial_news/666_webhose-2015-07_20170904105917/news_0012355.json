But economists will be looking to the RBA's quarterly monetary statement on Friday for any elaboration of concerns, floated by RBA governor Glenn Stevens last week, that the economy's longer run potential growth rate - the so called \"trend\" - may have slowed. \"If the economy's potential growth rate is lower than in the past, the RBA may be able to scale back its ambitions,\" HSBC's Paul Bloxham said. \"Rather than having to get growth back to three per cent or more to keep inflation running consistently within the target band, it may only now need to get growth up to 2.5 to 2.75 per cent.\" This would weaken the case for more interest rate cuts, Mr Bloxham said. One argument for more cuts is the sliding terms of trade - export prices relative to import prices. That slide was confirmed on Tuesday by data from the bureau of statistics which showed import prices rose a bit in the June quarter while export prices fell a lot. \"The golden age of commodity driven income growth is long gone!\" Commonwealth bank economist Gareth Aird said. The falling terms of trade meant growth in real gross domestic income will continue to undershoot real output growth. \"The continued fall in the terms of trade reflects a pronounced fall in the purchasing power of Australian households and businesses,\" Mr Aird said. ABS figures on Thursday showed a surprise dip in residential building approvals. St George Bank's Hans Kunnen titled his report on the data \"Ouch!\", but was more sanguine about the outlook. \"Despite the fall in June, approvals remain at historically high levels suggesting that the pipeline of construction work remains solid,\" he said. But there are signs of strength - too much in one case. On Friday, the RBA released its monthly estimates showing credit to housing investors growing faster than the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's 10 per cent `line in the sand'. That will prompt the regulator to consider its policy options to rein lending in, ANZ's Daniel Gradwell said David Cannington said. But the strength may not last. \"While today's data incorporates the tightening of investor lending criteria announced by lenders in May, it pre-dates the recent increases to investor lending rates, which are expected to dampen investor lending growth in the coming months,\" they said.
