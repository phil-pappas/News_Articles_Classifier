Ironically, the same forces that unleashed Chinese investors’ animal spirits have brought the bull to its knees.\nMounting concern that Chinese authorities could scale back efforts to support stock prices sunk the country’s main Shanghai Composite Index. SHCOMP, -1.68% and the smaller Shenzen Composite 399106, -2.24% and Shenzhen ChiNext 399006, -3.78% indices.\nBut that same government policy to boost stock prices succeeded beyond expectations and fueled a speculative boom. Daily trading turnover quadrupled. At one stage, mroe than 500,000 new trading accounts were being opened weekly. China’s stock market capitalization soared, overtaking Japan to become the second-largest stock market in the world.\nNow China’s bull is spent. No one factor is to blame for the sharp correction. The market simply ran out of momentum and investors lost confidence. The market had become increasingly driven by debt-fueled liquidity and manic speculation.\nValuations had become stretched, with the rise in share prices at odds with slowing economic growth and deterioration in corporate earnings. New initial public offerings were oversubscribed, in some case by 240 times the shares on offer. Purchasing new listings increasingly required investors to sell existing investments, creating selling pressure.\nWhat's behind China's market plunge? (4:16) China's stock market dropped sharply on Monday, setting off a case of global jitters. Moneybeat's Paul Vigna discusses the global implications.

At its peak, margin loans reached around $350 billion, around 12%-14% of the size of the stock market. In comparison, the level of margin loans in the U.S. is around 5%-6% and 1% in Japan. Falling prices triggered margin calls. There was forced liquidation of positions as investors needed to raise cash or could not meet demands for additional collateral.\nAs the market fell with increasing rapidity and price changes became disorderly, Chinese authorities responded with a mixture of communist propaganda and borrowed capitalist tricks.\nChinese media blamed short-sellers and market manipulators. Patriotic calls sought to discourage investors betting on price falls. Chinese police instigated ritual investigations into short-selling to scare even legitimate sellers out of positions.\nFollowing the emergency plunge-protection guidelines patented by the U.S. authorities, the Chinese central bank pumped money into the financial system. Interest rates were cut. The reserve ratio and loan to deposit limits were altered to allow banks to increase lending. Margin finance rules were relaxed allowing anything from real estate to antiques to be used as collateral for loans.\nGiven the limited effect of these measures, the government intervened more directly in the market. The government-controlled Securities Association of China arranged for the 21 big brokerage firms to establish a fund worth around $20 billion, to buy shares in large companies.\nIn addition, China’s securities regulator barred major shareholders (with stakes exceeding 5%), corporate executives, and directors from selling their shares for six months. State-owned enterprises and investment vehicles were instructed not to sell shares. There were suggestions that some SOEs would buy back their own shares to support prices. New listings were deferred. With currently planned share offerings topping $600 billion, the authorities sought to limit the claims on available investor funds.\nThe government encouraged companies to apply for trading halts. This resulted in suspension of trading in around 1,400 companies listed on Chinese exchanges, representing over $$2.5 trillion worth of shares or 40% of the stock market’s capitalization.\nYet China’s ability to intervene in the markets further has constraints. Expansion of credit runs the risk of adding to inflationary pressures and further complicates the task of dealing with a large pre-existing credit bubble. Intervention might push up the value of the yuan, making China’s embattled exporters even less competitive.\nStill, given the centralized political and economic command and control in China, it is unwise to assume that the authorities cannot prop up share markets. Large foreign exchange reserves ($4 trillion) and the ability to use state-controlled banks to expand their balance sheets provides the government with significant resources to purchase shares.\nIn this uncertain time, Chinese authorities are discovering an old capitalist truth — bubbles are hard to see, and even harder to catch.\nSatyajit Das is a former banker and the author of the forthcoming “A Banquet of Consequences’”(in Australia and Europe); “Age of Stagnation” (North America and Asia).
