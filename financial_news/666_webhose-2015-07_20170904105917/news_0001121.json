It had gained 502 points, or 6.29 per cent, in the same period.\nThe trading sentiment remained volatile as investors took a cautious line ahead of the quarterly numbers and the announcement of key macro data points like IIP. Conflicting reports over monsoon only muddied the waters.\nThough the markets recovered from the initial blow of Greece rejecting the bailout terms, the sharp sell-off in China pushed investors to the brink.\nHowever, what cushioned the fall was value buying in key frontline stocks supported by short-covering after things started looking up in China, and Greece inched closer to sealing a deal with its creditors.\nThough the selling was indiscriminate, BSE IT bore the brunt, falling 4.09 per cent, followed by metal, technology, auto, and oil & gas.\nHowever, capital goods and healthcare staged a smart recovery to end higher by 2.99 per cent and 2.34 per cent, respectively.\nBSE-small cap gained marginally while mid-cap closed virtually steady.\nThe quarterly earnings season kicked off with TCS reporting a lower-than expected 2.1 per cent growth in its net profit at Rs 5,684 crore.\nMeanwhile, FIIs turned net buyers after the recent selling spree and bought equities worth Rs 2,174.91 crore during the week, according to provisional data.\n 11, 2015 4:57 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T04:54:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
