Many have taken cheap funds - designed to help revive the euro zone economy - from the European Central Bank in the past year and are now trying to funnel those to borrowers. \nSabadell said it would still maintain its targets, including a 1 billion euro net profit in 2016 and return on equity (ROE) of 10 percent. \nROE, a measure of profitability, dipped to 5.5 percent in the second quarter, from 7 percent in the first, in part after Sabadell raised equity to finance the TSB deal. \n\"There are a number of things that might happen and put pressure on targets, but all things considered, we (...) are still confident can deliver this,\" Varela said. \n($1 = 0.6456 pounds) (Editing by Julien Toyer and Susan Thomas)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T13:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T13:45:43.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
