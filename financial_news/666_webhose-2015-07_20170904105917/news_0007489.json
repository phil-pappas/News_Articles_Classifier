Photo: Peter Braig\nAustralian shares have ended lower as miners and the big banks dragged the benchmark down, with the materials sector falling for a fourth session amid a continuing slide in commodity prices.\nThe benchmark S&P/ASX200 finished 0.4 per cent lower at 5590.3, while the broader All Ordinaries closed at 5581.3 points, down 0.4 per cent.\nThe biggest losses of the day were sustained by mining companies, after iron ore and oil both fell overnight, the latter nearing bear market territory after sliding close to 20 per cent since mid-June amid a global glut.\nThe two biggest losers on the local market were Liquefied Natural Gas which shed 6.9 per cent to $3.64, and beleaguered iron ore producer Fortescue Metals Group, which plunged 6 per cent to $1.64 after a lacklustre response to its quarterly production report.\n\"Fortescue have felt the full force of the bears by admitting that the current strip mining rates are unsustainable and these will likely rise,\" IG Markets Chris Weston said.\nMeanwhile, the biggest gains of the day were made by gold miners Evolution Mining, up 8 per cent to $1.08 and Northern Star Resources, up 4.3 per cent, as they recovered losses triggered by a plunge in the gold price earlier this week.\nRio Tinto finished the day down 1.9 per cent at $51.50 while BHP Billiton ended on $25.50 after losing 2.9 per cent.\nThe big four banks also fared poorly on Thursday, adding to pressure on the ASX. ANZ led the falls, shaving 4 points off the market, as it closed at $32.15, down by 1.2 per cent.\nThe Commonwealth Bank closed at $86.30, down by 0.38 per cent; the National Australia Bank down 0.2 per cent to $34.10 while Westpac Banking Group finished down 0.26 per cent at $34.26.\nThe weight of market adjustments among both the resources and financial sector will continue to be felt throughout earnings season.\nAn earnings season preview released by UBS on Thursday forecast a relatively flat profit period for ASX200 companies.\nThe investment bank's equity strategists predicted overall earnings will rise by just 0.8 per cent, but this increases to 9 per cent once the resources companies are excluded from the forecast. The total gains rise again to 13 per cent when the financial sector is also excluded.\n\"Profit season is not likely to be a catalyst in itself for either a market correction or market surge, notwithstanding the inevitable scope for stock specific volatility,\" equity strategist David Cassidy said.\nMr Cassidy said the key themes for reporting season would be reactions by the bank to increased regulation burdens, sluggish top-line growth when compared to ongoing cost cutting, tougher competitive conditions and profit tailwinds from the housing sector.\nUBS anticipates the market will reach 5800 points by the end of 2015 and climbing to 6000 by the end of this financial year. These estimates are slightly lower than investment banks such as Credit Suisse and AMP, which are both anticipating the stock market finishing this calendar year around 6000 points.\n\"My concern is valuations right now are still above average,\" Mr Cassidy said. \"To get to 6000 quickly you'd have to be bullish on earnings, and that's hard. Especially if you see further downside to our key commodities, and neither financials or commodities will get much tailwind from the dollar.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/earnings-season-has-6000-back-on-radar-for-asx-20150721-gigv4m.html"], "published": "2015-07-23T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T23:19:36.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
