Most of the passengers were Chinese.\n\"I have sent a team to verify the wreckage ... we hope that it can identify (the wreckage) as soon as possible,\" said Malaysia's Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai during a visit to the United Nations in New York.\nMH370 vanished from radar screens shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur. Investigators believe it was flown thousands of miles (kilometers) off course before crashing. Its disappearance has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation history.\nSearch efforts led by Australia have focused on a broad expanse of the southern Indian Ocean.\nNeither the French civil aviation authority DGAC nor the BEA, the agency responsible for investigating aviation accidents, were immediately available for comment.\nLiow was at the United Nations for a Security Council vote on a draft resolution that would have set up an international tribunal to prosecute those suspected of downing Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 last year in eastern Ukraine. Russia vetoed the proposal, saying it was premature.
