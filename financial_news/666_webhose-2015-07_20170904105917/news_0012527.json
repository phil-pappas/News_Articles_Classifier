ANZ Bank also cut its forecast today, joining Deutsche Bank AG in predicting a cash rate of 2.5 percent as lower farm incomes damp economic growth and inflation.\nWheeler lowered his benchmark rate to 3.25 percent June 11 and said one more reduction may be appropriate. The New Zealand dollar continued to slide Thursday as economists predicted deeper rate cuts in the wake of another decline in dairy prices at auction.\nLower dairy prices “are going to knock more off our terms of trade than the RBNZ was projecting,” said Cameron Bagrie, chief economist at ANZ Bank New Zealand in Wellington. “That’s a bigger economic hit and means there’s more work for monetary policy to do to stabilize the economy.”\nThe currency dropped to a five-year low and was trading at 67.13 U.S. cents at 12:10 p.m. in Wellington.\nWhole milk powder prices fell to a six-year low at auction overnight, prompting ASB and ANZ to cut their forecasts for Fonterra Cooperative Group’s milk payout to farmers in the 2015-16 season.\nBusiness confidence turned negative in June for the first time in more than four years, led by the agriculture industry, according to an ANZ survey.\nBusiness Confidence “The increasing recognition of challenges in the dairy sector is impacting confidence across the economy,” said Darren Gibbs, chief New Zealand economist at Deutsche Bank in Auckland. He sees rate cuts in July, September and October while ANZ predicts two more cuts this year and a third in March 2016.\nTraders are expecting 55 basis points of cuts over the next 12 months, according to a Credit Suisse gauge based on interest rate swaps.\nWheeler raised rates four times last year to head off inflation as the economy expanded at a rate of more than 3 percent. That boosted the kiwi dollar and damped import prices. Now he’s trying to resuscitate inflation from near zero to 2 percent, a target the bank has failed to achieve since 2011.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T04:05:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
