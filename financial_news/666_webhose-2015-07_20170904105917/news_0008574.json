Share on twitter by Trevor Hoey Interest in stocks leveraged to the Australian travel industry has accelerated in this year, substantially driven by the depreciation of the Australian dollar against other currencies.\nInbound international travel numbers have been strong. At Sydney Airport international passenger numbers were up 2.8 per cent in June compared with a 1.7 per cent increase in domestic numbers.\nSydney Airport CEO Kerrie Mather said the strong international result for the month was driven by higher average load factors as a consequence of both outbound and inbound travel. However, some of the particularly strong trends were increases of 18.6 per cent and 10 per cent in Chinese and US passenger numbers respectively.\nMather underlined increases to services that have recently started from China and Korea, where new airlines and greater frequency of flights will add about 300,000 seats annually.\nWhile this suggests the underlying industry environment for Australia's tourism operators is robust, there are a number of different stocks to target and some have more merit than others.\nAmalgamated Holdings benefits Some companies have been affected in recent months by unpredictable developments such as weather events. For example, the polar vortex which brought extremely cold temperatures to the eastern states in early July was welcomed by Amalgamated Holdings as it effectively kicked off the skiing season on time, with large dumps of snow at the group's Thredbo resorts.\nThe company also benefits from increased accommodation spending through its chain of Rydges hotels, which are in key tourist areas as well as business hubs along the east coast.\n While they are not as strongly represented elsewhere, they still have operations in every Australian state and territory, and a small presence in New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\nThere is substantial scope for Amalgamated to continue expanding its hotel portfolio, which includes the designer brand QT chain. In June the group acquired the 163-room Museum Art Hotel in Wellington in New Zealand for $NZ28.5 million ($25.7 million). This will be rebranded as a QT hotel.\nWhile revenues from the 2015 ski season won't affect the group's full-year result to be announced in August, investors will no doubt be factoring it into the forward earnings outlook.\nThis year's result will already benefit from a robust season in 2014, management noting at the half-year mark that the significant year-on-year profit uplift reflected the outstanding 2014 season in Thredbo, when skier numbers were up 15.1 per cent.\nLower expectations for SeaLink Travel On the score of weather conditions, though, other players in the sector were disadvantaged.\nSeaLink Travel Group operates cruises and ferry services along the east coast as well as Northern Territory and South Australia. Analysts at Bell Potter lowered their earnings expectations for fiscal 2015 in June, noting inclement and highly unusual weather events that affected NSW in April and led to closure of Sydney Harbour, as well as a higher than average number of rainy days in May, which could place pressure on earnings.\nThe broker also pointed to two lost business days for Kangaroo Island due to weather conditions. While these can't be factored into forward earnings forecasts on a regular basis, the fact that such events may occur in the future can't be dismissed.\nSetting those issues aside, the group has performed well since listing on the ASX in October 2013, taking advantage of access to capital to expand the business by adding to its fleet and other measures.\nBell Potter remains positive about SeaLink's investment merits, recently saying the company offers leverage to one of the dominant themes underpinning the travel and tourism sector â€“ growth in international visitors, particularly from Asia.\nThe broker has a buy recommendation on the group with a 12-month price target of $2.64.\nUpbeat on Mantra Mantra is another relative newcomer, having listed on the ASX just over 12 months ago. It has been a major Australian operator of hotels and resorts for many years, with key brands such as Peppers and BreakFree complementing the well-known Mantra brand.\nManagement is aware of the importance of the Asian market, having recently held an Asian roadshow. Mantra boasts some impressive numbers, attracting about two million guests per annum, making it the second largest accommodation operator in Australia.\nAcross the three brands the group has about 120 properties and more than 13,000 rooms. Bell Potter is upbeat about Mantra's prospects, rating it a buy with a 12-month price target of $4.00. Deutsche Bank also has a buy recommendation with a 12-month price target of $4.10.\nMantra remains a growth by acquisition story. Deutsche Bank recently said that positive industry feedback on the pipeline of opportunities and attractive acquisition multiples suggested upside to its near- to medium-term earnings forecasts.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/trevorhoey"], "published": "2015-07-28T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:50:56.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
