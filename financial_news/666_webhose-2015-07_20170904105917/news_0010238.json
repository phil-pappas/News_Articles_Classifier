Advertising Print This Post \nBitreserve has added seven more fiat currencies to its supported assets: the three commodity currencies: CAD, AUD and NZD, plus HKD, SGD, ILS and KES. \nBitreserve uses Bitcoin as a backbone for payments, pegging all deposits to fiat currencies or commodities to avoid its volatility. \nThe additions bring the total number of supported currencies to 16, which already include USD, EUR and GBP. Four precious metals are supported as well: gold, silver, platinum and palladium. \nAnthony Watson, who was recently appointed as Bitreserve’s President and then also as Chief Executive Officer , commented: \n“Money is global: every new currency we add brings us closer to Bitreserve’s vision to create an inclusive and fair way for people to use, hold, change and spend it. Each of these geographies represents a thriving digital ecosystem and we are thrilled to be able to offer each one a way to transact in their own currency for free on our cloud money platform and to start to leave behind the cumbersome and expensive legacy banking systems of old.” \nThe startup, founded by Halsey Minor, has raised nearly $10 million for its platform. It recently launched its API and developer community Bitreserve Connect, and reports recent surges in transaction volume. Got a news tip?
