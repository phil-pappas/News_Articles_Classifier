But strong private hiring figures on Wednesday left economists considering another bumper reading.\n\"You can see there is edginess in the market,\" said Kit Juckes, at Societe Generale in London.\n\"If you get something strong (in payrolls data) that really makes it look like the Fed are going to hike, with all the Greek uncertainty in the background too, you could really get some risk aversion breaking out.\"\nLess than 24 hours after he wrote a conciliatory letter to creditors asking for a new bailout that would accept many of their terms, Greece's prime minister Tsipras abruptly switched back into combative mode in a television address.\nGreece was being \"blackmailed\", he said, quashing talk that he might delay the vote, call it off or urge Greeks to vote \"Yes\".\nMarkets were relieved on Wednesday that the European Central Bank opted against cutting back the emergency funding that it is sanctioning for Greek banks and on Thursday it announced it had broadened the list of bonds eligible for its QE programme.\nSWEDEN SURPRISES, OIL STEADIES\nOutside the euro zone there was also central bank action.\nIn a surprise move, Sweden's Riksbank cut its main interest rate deeper into negative territory and upped the size of its bond buying programme. It was in response to low inflation but also a bid to prevent a jump in the crown as Greek nerves drive investors out the euro.\nThe crown weakened against the euro after the decision and traded at 9.34 compared to 9.26 just before the announcement. Meanwhile The euro was last at $1.1050 against the dollar, with the dollar also nudging back towards 124 yen .\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended little changed after more volatile regional trade. Tokyo's Nikkei climbed 1.1 percent thanks to a weaker yen, but it was the 4 percent slump in Chinese stocks that grabbed the attention.\n\"We are shaping up for a bumpy ride in the summer as the Greek crisis means a risk-on, risk-off approach is seen in the markets,\" said Tai Hui, chief markets strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. \"Investors are likely going to move towards a more conservative positioning in their portfolios.\"\nIn commodities, U.S. crude steadied somewhat after shedding 4 percent overnight on data showing stockpiles in the United States rose for the first time in more than two months.\nU.S. crude was little changed at $57.04 a barrel and Brent crude futures were trading at $62.33 per barrel but there was a lot of repositioning after recent ranges were broken.\n\"I think the drop in oil was somewhat underreported yesterday\" said Society Generale's Juckes. \"I don't think you can really be comfortable with any commodity currency at the moment.\" (Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Toby Chopra)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T12:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T12:06:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
