Peter Braig by Jacquie Hayes The Chinese aren't the only ones fuelling Australia's property boom, with expats forming a powerful new wave of buyers as they cash in on opportunistic foreign property gains and bring their money home. Local Australians are benefiting, too, as they seek to repatriate funds invested in distressed US property zones.\nA confluence of factors has these investors laughing all the way to the bank – they bought low, are selling high and are now reaping impressive foreign exchange gains in converting their currencies to weak Australian dollars.\nThe most successful of these, says senior alliance manager at OzForex Jonathan Sermon, bought US property in the wake of the global financial crisis – particularly in places like Atlanta, Florida and Las Vegas where foreclosures were common and house prices were at record lows.\n\"It started in 2007 and matured in 2010 and 2011 until we saw the Aussie start to decrease,\" Sermon says. Since then, buyers have enjoyed solid and rising rental income and strong capital growth. Figures from the US National Association of Realtors show the median house price grew 11.5 per cent in 2013 and 5.7 per cent in 2014.\nFrench agents say there's been a \"marked increase\" in inquiries about Paris property from US, UK and Australian clients. Those who picked up super-cheap property in the $US20,000-$US50,000 ($A27,000-$68,000) range are bringing back profits of around $A60,000 to $70,000 per property, Sermon says.\nFor those opting not to sell, rental income alone could still be netting $A5000 a month. And now, with the Australian dollar 30 per cent off its peak of mid-2011, healthy foreign exchange gains are rolling in too. \"They've pretty much had three bites of the cherry,\" Sermon says, \"and now we're seeing a lot of investors starting to sell up and bring the money back.\"\nThey're not alone. Cashed-up investors the world over are looking to take advantage of the currency differential to access our property market. Director of sales at Sotheby's International Realty Greg Herman says 65 per cent of his group's Melbourne sales are generally to foreigners, but inquiry and sales activity picked up in January. That's when the Australian dollar slid to 80¢ for the first time since July 2009.\n\"It's not just the expats, it's people from Europe and Asia and other places who have been keeping their money in US dollars,\" Herman says. Sermon says repatriated funds through his company are sometimes being used to pay down Australian mortgages or to top up superannuation. More of it is going into investment properties, some bought within super funds, such as off-the-plan apartments in areas like Newcastle or Brisbane where prices have lagged the big increases in other cities.\n Beware of the sharks But expat buyers hoping to invest in this way should beware of property spruikers promising more than they can deliver, says the director of acquisitions at Performance Property Advisory (PPA), David McMillan.\n\"The only real estate companies on the ground in the bulk of Aussie-expat hubs are project marketing companies selling over-priced, off-the-plan Australian property to overseas markets,\" McMillan says. \"Sadly the fallout from this type of investment – which generally involves apartments in high-rise towers – is that these properties have little to no growth potential over the medium term and can be difficult to rent out, given the current glut of apartments in cities like Melbourne and now, increasingly, Brisbane.\"\nWhile expat investment in property in Australia is still relatively low, McMillan anticipates it will grow considerably over the next few years as expats take advantage of the falling dollar. He's planning on running property investment seminars across Asia from September.\nA former Melbourne resident who now works in finance in the UK, Jacklyn Chu, says expats shouldn't let work postings dissuade them from their personal investment goals. \"Those who don't have time to do the ground work while balancing full-time work, travel and geographical separation should consider outsourcing the property search,\" Chu adds.\nShe engaged PPA last year to help her invest in Australian property because she felt it had potential for long-term capital growth given low interest rates, net population growth and an influx of overseas investors.The Brisbane apartment she bought, in inner suburban Clayfield, has good transport links to the city and airport and appeals to professionals and young families. Independent valuations of the property estimate it has already appreciated in value by 20 per cent.\nMcMillan says his company helps people like Chu by identifying and capitalising on inefficiencies in property markets .\"Our drawcard is we buy established property in markets that are showing value,\" he says. \"So if you have $600,000 to invest, we'll be telling you these are the suburbs you should be looking at and this is the sort of property you should buy. This brings down all the anxiety [for the investor] because they've got someone they can trust on the ground.\"\nOzForex's Sermon says with already low interest rates expected to fall further later this year, he expects more expats will take advantage of their improved buying power.\"If you're sending money home from the UK, [sending back] £50,000 mean you're £17,500 better off now than you were at this time last year,\" he says.\nBut Australia isn't the only destination for these opportunistically-gained funds. Property markets in some parts of Europe still haven't recovered since halving during the globlal financial crisis. They look attractive given the US dollar has strengthened from its low point against the Euro in 2014 by at least 23 per cent, a rate not seen since 2003.\nThe differential has helped drive a nine-fold increase in the number of US-based clients buying properties in France in 2014 from 2013, according to OzForex's US equivalent USForex. Tahminae Madani, from mortgage broker France Home Finance, says there's been a \"marked increase\" in inquiries about French mortgages and Paris property since January from US, UK and Australian clients.\nFor those who prefer to hold on to what they own in the US, the future continues to look bright. Further gains are expected through 2015, with the National Association of Realtors predicting the median US house prices will grow slightly faster than last year at 6 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T11:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:07:35.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
