Even after the bank’s macro group, which includes currencies and interest-rate sales and trading, generated a 10 percent increase in revenue in the second quarter, Chairman John McFarlane plans to focus on the less capital-intensive debt and equity capital markets businesses.\nJames White, a London-based spokesman for Barclays, declined to comment.\nMcCormick declined to comment. E-mails to Casey weren’t immediately returned. Casey had been with the bank for more than a decade, while McCormick joined from hedge fund Comac Capital in 2013.\nThe cuts are part of former chief executive officer Antony Jenkins’s plan to cut 7,000 employees in the investment bank by 2016, and the reductions are mostly taking place at the director and managing director level, the person said. Barclays’s investment bank employed 20,500 globally as of the end of 2014.\nNew Hires So far, the revamp of the investment bank has helped boost the shares. Barclays has risen 18 percent this year, making it the top-performing major U.K. bank stock. The lender reported a 8.8 percent increase in profit in the quarter this week, driven by its investment bank, where there was a 35 percent jump in earnings, and its credit card operations.\nWhile fixed income is being cut back, Barclays has bolstered its advisory and debt arm, making senior hires in areas where it anticipates a competitive advantage.\nThe bank added Barry Meyers from JPMorgan Chase & Co. as head of the U.K. equity capital markets team. He started this month as a director, a rank above his title at JPMorgan. Barclays also hired Philip Shelley in February from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was co-head of U.K. corporate broking.\nBarclays has added eight managing directors in the U.S. so far this year, with three of those in telecommunications, media and technology, including Peter Cohen, hired from Blackstone Group LP to run media banking.\nThe British lender also cut employees from its European asset-backed securities unit in London this week, according to three people familiar with the matter. Chris Carnell, head of European ABS sales, and Stuart Calnan, head of European ABS trading are no longer with the bank.\nJob Cuts Part of Major Reforms at Barclays \\r Read this next: \\r Barclays’s McFarlane Steps Up Pace of Revamp as Profit Rises \\r", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iPp_XVdlmUL4/v3/220x126.jpg\\"], "published": "2015-07-31T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T14:38:48.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
