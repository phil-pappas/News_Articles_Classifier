That figure was a reduction from the 7.5 percent goal set for 2014 -- when trade values expanded only 3.4 percent, the third consecutive year the target had been missed. \n\"Commodity prices fell significantly, dragging down growth in import value,\" Customs spokesman Huang Songping told reporters, adding that \"sluggish foreign demand\" was a \"major factor\" affecting trade growth. \n\"Export costs remained high, undermining export competitiveness,\" he said, adding that by June 30, the yuan had strengthened 0.2 percent against the dollar from the start of the year, 6.9 percent against the euro and 2.2 percent against the yen. \n\"The downward pressures on the domestic economy increased and the demand for imports was weak,\" he said. \nFor June, China's imports fell for the eighth consecutive month, Customs said, dropping 6.7 percent year-on-year to 890.67 billion yuan. \nBut exports increased 2.1 percent to 1.17 trillion yuan on-year -- snapping a run of three monthly declines in a row -- and the country's trade surplus leaped 45.0 percent to 284.2 billion yuan. \nChinese stock markets have been in turmoil in recent weeks, but the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was up 1.49 percent in late morning, maintaining a positive tone after the figures were released. \n- 'New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) normal' - \nThe latest report comes as Chinese authorities manage what they describe as a \"new normal\" economy in which they steer it away from a traditional model of high growth based on big investment projects and towards one where consumer demand takes prominence. \nChina's gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 7.4 percent in 2014, the lowest rate in nearly a quarter of a century, and signs of further weakness have mounted this year. \nGDP expanded 7.0 percent in the January-March period, the worst quarterly result in six years. \nChina announces second-quarter GDP figures on Wednesday and the median forecast in an AFP poll of 14 economists indicates GDP expanded 6.9 percent in April-June. \nFor all of 2015, the survey predicts growth at a median 7.0 percent, more optimistic than a forecast of 6.8 percent in a similar poll in April and in line with the government's official target of \"about 7.0 percent\". \nAuthorities have taken steps to boost slowing economic growth, cutting interest rates four times since November while also lowering the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve in a bid to boost lending. \nThey have also had to deal with weeks of volatility on stock exchanges, taking aggressive measures to stabilise the Shanghai index, which fell more than 30 percent in less than four weeks before reversing course in the past three trading days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T07:26:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
