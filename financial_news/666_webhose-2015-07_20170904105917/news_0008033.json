Both men and women work and cities and towns across the country look different. Some have evolved to match today's family (most likely dual income) needs, while others seem to be stuck in the past. \nWalletHub examined the 150 most populated cities in the U.S. for the best examples where today's essential family necessities can best be met. WalletHub took into account 30 key metrics such as: \"the relative cost of housing, the quality of local school and health care systems, and the opportunities for fun and recreation.\" More Headlines These are the Richest People in America's 10 Biggest Cities \nWhile choosing a city to put down roots live depends on work opportunity as well as personal preference, here are 10 places where families can thrive. \nWalletHub Sources: the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the National Center for Education Statistics, the Child Care Aware of America, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Council for Community and Economic Research, the Trust for Public Land, the Environmental Working Group, Sharecare, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Partnership for Women & Families, Tripadvisor, CoreLogic and WalletHub research. \n10.
