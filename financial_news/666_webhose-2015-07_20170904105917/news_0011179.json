All the sectoral indices led by FMCG, healthcare and oil and gas were in the positive terrain. \nOn similar lines, the 50-share Nifty moved up 24.45 points, or 0.28%, to 8,477.50. \nBrokers said continued buying by participants, backed up by a solid trend at other Asian markets on hopes of an agreement over Greece, and overnight gains in US markets on strong economic data lifted trading sentiment. \nBesides, revival of buying by foreign funds after remaining sellers for several sessions supported the upside, they said. \nIn other Asian markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.41% while Japan's Nikkei was trading 1.16% higher in early trade. \nThe US Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.79% higher in Wednesday's trade.
