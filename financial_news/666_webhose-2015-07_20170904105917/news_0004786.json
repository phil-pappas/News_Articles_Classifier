Insurance fraud adds £90 to every household bill, according to the figures from the Association of British Insurers and City of London Police, which runs a national fraud unit. After pouring an estimated £200m a year into fraud prevention and detection, insurers say they discovered 350 fraudulent claims for every day in 2014. This across insurance types, including car, motor and home. But the cost of bogus claims which go undiscovered could be far greater than the data suggests, industry insiders warn. \"Most insurers believe this is the tip of the iceberg,\" said Stephen Gaywood, a fraud specialist at the AA.\"Those attempting to defraud their insurers are increasingly likely to get away with it, but the industry's focus on fraud needs to be stepped up.\" Fraudulent claims uncovered in 2014: by insurance type Type Cost of fraudulent claims Car 835 Property 108 Personal liability 33 Travel 3 Pet 2 Other 44 The report comes after a surprise announcement in last week's Budget that will add £68 to every household insurance bill, according to estimates, when Insurance Premium Tax increases by 3.5pc. Costlier insurance premiums could push up bogus claims when the tax increase is implemented this Autumn. Mr Gaywood said: \"Increased premium prices means the industry's focus on fraud should be stepped up. Insurance fraud is not a victimless crime – insurance premiums go up as a result.\" Motor claims most likely to be fraudulent Car insurance attracted the most bogus claims, with 67,000 false claims discovered last year out of the 130,000 in total, worth £835m. Property insurance claims came second, with 24,500 dishonest claims worth £108m. Often policyholders might not realise they are committing fraud, for example by failing to provide the correct information when they sign up for car cover. It is insurance fraud to put someone as a \"named driver\" on a policy if they are actually the primary user of the car, for example, even when this saves money. This practice is known as \"fronting\" and may be used if a main driver is expensive to insure, such as young motorists. \"Whether they are making a dishonest claim or lying when applying for cover to get a cheaper premium, insurance cheats are more likely to get caught than ever before,\" said James Dalton of the ABI. \"They face long-lasting and serious consequences.\" Fake claim discovered – in a Facebook post Tip-offs from neighbours, in social media and video footage can also lead to the discovery of a fake claim. In one case uncovered by the City of London police last year, a man who claimed £20,000 for a stolen diamond engagement ring was found out when – a few weeks after the payout – he posted a picture of his fiancée wearing the ring on Facebook. In another case, a man staged a burglary at his home to try to get £30,000 from his home insurer. He reported to the police that laptops, computer games, jewellery and money had been stolen, claiming thieves had stolen his door keys from his gym bag. But it later emerged that photos of the \"stolen\" laptops were taken after the alleged theft took place. – kate.palmer@telegraph.co.uk – For money-saving tips each week, sign up to our newsletter Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T02:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T21:33:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
