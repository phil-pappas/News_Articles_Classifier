Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow QIC chief executive Damien Frawley said the global fund manager will not be forced into making dud investments by the Queensland Labor government and will only invest in assets which will deliver decent returns.\nA day after Treasurer Curtis Pitt revealed the Palaszczuk government was considering asking the state-owned QIC to invest its $30 billion superannuation fund in government-owned companies , Mr Frawley said the global fund, infrastructure and property management company would stick to commercial-based investments.\n\"They [the Queensland government] have a mandate with us. And if they want to change that mandate that is their right,\" he said in an interview.\n\"But, at the end of the day, any asset we invest in on behalf of a client – be it a government client or a non-government client – needs to make sense from an economic point of view. Clients aren't going to want us buying assets that don't make any sense.\"\nQIC manages the state government's $30 billion defined benefits scheme for 50,000 public servants. At the moment, about half of the fund is invested in real estate and infrastructure assets across the globe.\nThe Palaszscuk government said it was considering asking QIC to invest in other state-owned companies, such as the electricity companies Energex, Ergon Energy and Powerlink, to help pay for expensive infrastructure roll-outs.\nThese assets were to be sold as part of the former Newman government's $37 billion privatisation program, but that course was abandoned after Labor's surprise election victory in January.\nMr Frawley said the final say on the purchase of an asset would rest with QIC, not the state government. He said it would be unlikely the state government would override their investment decisions.\n \"That's never been tested. But ultimately it's got to stand the test. If it doesn't stack up, there is no way in the world we would want it in the portfolio,\" he said.\nMr Frawley said QIC was not against investing in energy assets, with the fund manager bidding for the electricity network assets in NSW where the Baird government is selling a 50 per cent stake.\nPauline Vamos, Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia chief executive, said there could be corporate governance problems involved in the state government directive.\n\"From a pure governance point of view and the point of view of a board member of a super fund, they must be judged on how well they meet their risk-and-return profile that has been set for them,\" Ms Vamos said.\n\"If they are then directed on where to put that investment then the measurement of that becomes redundant. Does this mean the transparency of the performance of what is ultimately public funds, is that being compromised in any way?\"\nOpposition treasury spokesman John-Paul Langbroek said it would be a dangerous precedent if the Palaszczuk government started making investment directives to QIC.\n\"The legislation is crystal clear: the government cannot direct either of those investment bodies to make any investment decisions, full stop. It's an important principle that must always be observed.\n\"Both the QIC and QSuper have highly regarded investment professionals who make these decisions. They will make those decisions without any input from government. Exactly how it should be.\"\nMr Frawley said he was also not fussed about the state government suspending contributions to the $30 billion defined benefits fund over the next five years to help pay down debt, saying it would keep them on their toes to keep delivering surpluses to meet future liabilities.\nMr Pitt said the state government had received actuarial advice saying there was a $10 billion surplus in the defined benefits scheme.\nHe said if all 50,000 public servants on the defined benefits scheme retired immediately, the government could meet the liabilities. The fund was closed to new entrants in 2009. The state's other 150,000 public servants are in an accumulation fund.\nQueensland is the only state or territory with fully funded superannuation liabilities. Treasury officials in the budget lock-up on Tuesday said there was a $50 billion shortfall in the Commonwealth's superannuation liabilities and $30 billion in NSW and Victoria.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-07-15T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T17:00:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
