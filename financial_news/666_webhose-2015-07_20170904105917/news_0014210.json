Carlson, who lives in Chicago’s western suburbs, wanted to attend the festival because her teenage children raved about it. But, she had some concerns: “I don’t like crowds, heat, using port-a-potties, getting soaked in the rain. Most of all, I don’t like seeing teens compromised by alcohol and drugs.”\nSo, Carlson joined a group of adults 45 and older attending Lollapalooza under the expert guidance of Val Haller, founder and CEO of the boutique music website Valslist.com , which specializes in introducing busy adults to new music.\nHaller is also in her 50s and understands why big festivals such as Lollapalooza, which tends to attract teens, can seem intimidating to an older crowd. “I hate crowds and oppressive heat, too, and I don’t want to be in a mosh pit,” she says, “but I love music.”\nShe started the group Lollapalooza trips last year in hopes of showing adults all the festival has to offer. Festivals are an amazing way to discover lots of new music in a series of small bites, “like a box of chocolates,” she says. Adults attend less for the scene and more to listen. Finding a new band they love makes them feel young again and the experience is an adventure they’ll talk about for years to come.\nLast year, Haller’s Lollapalooza group was captivated by the bands Trombone Shorty, Johnnyswim and Space Capone, which has a ’70s disco vibe. Overall, “the music was fresh, danceable and energetic,” says Carlson, who particularly loved listening to up-and-coming bands on the smaller stages.\nHere are the some top music festivals from around the country Haller recommends (either she’s visited, or it’s on her bucket list) and her expert tips for having a successful music festival experience:\nLollapalooza July 31-August 2\nChicago\nThis massive festival boasts more than 130 acts, in various genres. This year’s headliners are Metallica, Paul McCartney and Florence + the Machine. Haller loves it because there are so many bands to see, and it’s held in Grant Park, which offers cool breezes from Lake Michigan and great views of the Chicago skyline.\nOutside Lands Aug. 7-9\nSan Francisco\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://valslist.com/", "http://www.lollapalooza.com/"], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T15:39:48.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
