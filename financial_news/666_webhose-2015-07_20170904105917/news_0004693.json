Yet, only now is the cost to taxpayers becoming clear: at least $13.8 billion.\nThat’s how much more in interest the U.S. Treasury will pay over the life of bonds due in at least 10 years it sells in 2015. Barclays Plc figures investors are demanding an extra 0.15 percentage point in yield to compensate them for the risk they won’t be able to get out of their bonds easily after dealers were forced to cut back on making markets in response to new rules.\nWhile many say that’s a small price to pay to prevent another near-collapse of the banking system, the developments have created a market increasingly prone to sudden swings. The $12.7 trillion market for Treasuries, which is the benchmark for all others, has almost tripled in size since 2007 as the government borrowed to pay for a bailout of the banking system and pull the economy out of recession.\n“A less liquid, higher-volatility market is going to be a problem for the taxpayers because effectively they will pay a higher cost for Treasury financing,” Krishna Memani, the chief investment officer at OppenheimerFunds, which oversees $240 billion, said from New York. “Higher volatility makes for horrible markets for investors.”\nDealers Retrench Rising volatility, diminished liquidity and the prospect of higher interest rates are combining to make bonds more perilous at the same time that the market’s traditional gatekeepers -- the network of banks known as primary dealers -- retrench. Regulations such as Dodd-Frank in the U.S. and Basel III were put into place to keep financial firms from taking the types of risks that precipitated the 2008 crisis.\nFederal Reserve data show that the 22 primary dealers have reduced the amount of inventory they hold in Treasuries and other fixed-income securities to $200 billion, or half the amount in 2008, according to Jefferies LLC. The firms trade directly with the Fed and are obligated to bid at the Treasury’s auctions.\n“These liquidity issues aren’t going away, given that nothing on the regulation side can be rolled back and that the structure of the Treasury market has changed,” said Jay Barry, a U.S. fixed income strategist in New York at JPMorgan Chase & Co. The firm is a primary dealer.\nDiminished Stature The diminished stature of the dealers has also been evident at Treasury debt offerings. They’ve been awarded 35.4 percent of the $1.1 trillion of notes and bonds sold this year, and have won just 17.7 percent of what they bid for, both record lows, according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. Increasing allotments to mutual funds and other investor categories are taking their place.\nBarclays’s calculations measure the changes in Treasury prices and yields, adjusted for trading volumes. At the current pace, the U.S. in 2015 will sell $346 billion of 10-year notes and $191 billion of 30-year bonds. An extra 0.15 percentage point of interest during the life of that debt would equal $13.8 billion.\n“This is costing taxpayers a small amount but it’s an amount that is worth paying in order to get the financial stability that comes with it,” said Darrell Duffie, a finance professor at Stanford University in California.\nYields on 10-year Treasuries ended last week at 2.35 percent, down from more than 5 percent in 2007.\nVolatility Bouts As dealers cut back, electronic trading platforms are cropping up to take their place. That may ultimately help to boost liquidity. BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest money manager, said in a July 15 report that it has begun trading directly with interdealer brokers.\n“It’s no longer the case that the broker-dealers are the only liquidity sources,” said John Bellows, a money manager at Pasadena, California-based Western Asset Management Co., which oversees $454 billion of fixed-income assets.\nExcluding Treasuries held by the Fed and foreign central banks, only seven percent of the government’s tradable debt changes hands on average each day through the dealers, down from 22 percent in 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nThe issue of bond-market liquidity was laid bare on Oct. 15, when in a six-minute window that morning, banks essentially pulled out of the market, providing no, or very few, offers and widening their bid-ask spreads, the Fed, Treasury and other agencies said in a report last week. At the same time, high-frequency trading firms exacerbated the situation by often being on both sides of the same trade, according to the report.\nThe rapid buying and selling caused Treasury yields to plunge and then rise, covering a 37-basis-point range during a 12-minute period starting at 9:33 a.m. Intraday changes of greater magnitude have only happened on three occasions since 1998, and unlike October’s movement, were driven by significant policy announcements.\nWhile the government concluded that there was no single cause of the turbulence on Oct. 15, the report raised concerns that changes in market structure could lead to “rare but severe bouts of volatility.”\nThe changes are “lowering transaction costs on average but it’s also increasing the chances of large moves,” said Anshul Pradhan, a New York-based debt strategist at Barclays. “You’re getting both outcomes.”", "external_links": ["http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/Joint_Staff_Report_Treasury_10-15-2015.pdf\\"], "published": "2015-07-20T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T16:23:14.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
