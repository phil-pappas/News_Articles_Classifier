Analysts are tipping a jump in quarterly inflation. Photo: Andrey Rudakov\nA jump in petrol prices and the impact of a lower Australian dollar on the cost of imports will have driven a sharp spike in June-quarter headline inflation, according to analysts.\nThe second-quarter consumer price index, which the Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish on Wednesday, is tipped to come in at about 0.8 per cent, compared with just 0.2 per cent in the first quarter to end-March.\nThe quarterly reading will equate to an annual rate of 1.7 per cent, compared with 1.3 per cent at the end of March.\nPetrol prices have jumped 14 per cent since then, while the weaker Aussie will have pushed up the price of so-called tradeable goods, which are those that can be bought and sold across borders.\nAdvertisement \"Overall, food should be relatively steady, as suggested by the lacklustre performance of food retail sales in the second quarter,\" said JP Morgan chief economist for Australia Stephen Walters.\nThe investment bank also sees a 3 per cent increase in tobacco, while alcohol, clothing and footwear will have climbed by 1.5 per cent, he said.\nUtilities prices are expected to have remained steady, and rental growth has also remained sluggish, at 0.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter, Mr Walters says.\nThe latest Bloomberg survey of economists also puts the quarterly headline CPI at 0.8 per cent, which translates into annual growth of 1.7 per cent.\nForecasts for the trimmed mean CPI, which is the average price rise across a basket of goods and services after more extreme movements have been lopped off, comes in at 0.6 per cent for the quarter and 2.1 per cent year-on-year. This compares with 0.6 per cent and 2.3 per cent, respectively, at the end of March.\nCore inflation, which is the weighted median, is seen unchanged from last quarter at 0.6 per cent, and 2.3 per cent year-on-year, down from 2.4 per cent.\nBoth of these underlying measures leave the inflation rate within the Reserve Bank of Australia's target band of 2 per cent to 3 per cent, meaning it does not need to act on either inflationary or disinflationary pressures.\nHowever, Commonwealth Bank of Australia economist Michael Blythe says the low Australian dollar, which on Monday morning was fetching US73.68Â¢, may force the RBA to revise up its inflation forecast.\n\"Import prices 'on the docks' are rising as the Australian dollar falls,\" he wrote on Monday.\n\"But the flow-through to prices 'on the shelves' is uncertain,\" he said.\n\"Higher import prices are one source of upside risk.\"\nHe said weak growth in labour costs, a feature of the global economy since the ravages of the global financial crisis, were helping to keep the CPI down.\nIn Australia, this reflected historically high unemployment of 6 per cent and the gap between output capacity and demand for goods and services.\n\"We expect annual core inflation to stick in the lower half of the RBA's target band through [to] the end of 2016,\" wrote CBA's Michael Blythe.\nHowever, Westpac senior economist Justin Smirk says the spike in petrol prices, volatility in fresh food and upward pressure on \"non-tradeable\" items such as health and housing costs could push headline CPI growth to 1 per cent for the quarter.\n\"A robust second-quarter headline print is due to petrol and fresh fruit driving a bounce in tradeable prices,\" he said.\n\"This is supported by an ongoing steady gains in non-traded goods and services due to housing and health.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T12:22:59.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
