However, we expect Governor Raghuram Rajan to strike a dovish note to keep the door open for further rate cuts if inflation continues to be in control,” the report added.\n\nMeanwhile, DBS in a research note said that “apart from the firmer US dollar, signals from the US Federal Bank will also be important for the Reserve Bank of India’s rate trajectory. If the official commentary signals a start to the US rate hiking cycle later this year, it will affirm our expectations that the RBI will maintain a prolonged pause on the rates front.”\n\nAccording to official figures, retail inflation rose to an eight-month high of 5.4 per cent in June on costlier food items, fuel, housing, clothing and footwear even as prices of sugar and confectionery items eased during the month.\n\nRBI, which tracks retail inflation as a benchmark for its monetary policy, said earlier last month that price rise was still a worry for the central bank. RBI expects inflation to rise to 6 per cent by January 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T01:19:38.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
