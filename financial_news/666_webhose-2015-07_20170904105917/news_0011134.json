It had opened 6.55 percent higher. \nThe Shanghai market had plunged by almost 30 percent over the three weeks to Friday, prompting the government to intervene over the weekend. \nOn Sunday, the government said the central bank would provide liquidity through the state-backed China Securities Finance Co., which manages margin trading, to \"protect the stability of the securities market\", according to the stock market watchdog. \nSeparately, market watchdog the China Securities Regulatory Commission also said on Sunday there would be no initial public offerings (IPOs) \"in the near future\", according to a statement. State media said 28 companies whose flotations have already been approved would postpone them. \nOn Saturday, China's 21 largest brokerage firms announced they would invest at least 120 billion yuan ($19.3 billion) in so-called \"blue chip\" exchange traded funds (ETFs). \n\"The series of market-saving steps will be able to effectively reverse fragile market sentiment as it is a combination of measures led by the State Council,\" Zheshang Securities analyst Zhang Yanbing told AFP, referring to the country's cabinet. \n\"This type of state-led market-saving has never been seen before, even when the market crashed during the last financial crisis,\" he said, referring to the global economic meltdown of 2008.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T05:24:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
