It believes security situation has improved immensely in much of the region. The move is aimed at improving the socio-economic environment of the region by bringing about a sense of normality in the insurgency-ravaged states of the northeast, say sources.\nAddressing a conference of northeast chief ministers in Guwahati on Saturday, home minister Rajnath Singh said, \"In the wake of improvement in security scenario, there is a need to review deployment of security forces in the region. At present the deployment is more than it was when the insurgency was at its peak.\"\nSingh urged all chief ministers \"to conduct a realistic audit of deployment of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) in their states\" even as he assured them that forces would be provided when needed.\n\"Without compromising with security, we must plan to reduce deployment to make the environment easy and also to encourage positive thinking of outsiders about this region,\" Singh was Quote: d by agencies as having said.\nSingh, who was accompanied by his deputy Kiren Rijiju, was also Quote: d as saying that there had been substantial strengthening of state police forces in the past few years.\nThe statements assume significance in the backdrop of certain recent developments. After announcing imposition of Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) in 12 districts of Arunachal Pradesh bordering Assam and Nagaland, the government recently restricted it to certain police station areas following protests from the state.\nAlthough there is as yet no decision on whether AFSPA may be removed from certain regions of Manipur, Nagaland and Assam, government is willing to more objectively assess security situation and deploy forces proportionately. This, when the N-E region saw more deaths due to terror attacks in 2014 than even Naxal areas and Jammu and Kashmir.\nEven though government has only last month extended AFSPA in whole of Nagaland, this state too is likely to see reduction in central forces, said sources.\nA senior home ministry official said, \"At the moment the strength of central forces in the N-E region is so large that people visiting the place feel they are entering a war zone. Our attempt is to change that feeling both for outsiders and those living there.\"\nThe official said that during the peak of insurgency, deployment kept on increasing and even state forces grew in strength. However, when insurgency dropped, the presence of forces did not drop correspondingly. \"So we must take a look at where deployments are necessary. We want to reduce the visibility of the forces on the ground. This will have a big psychological impact. This is also aimed at aiding improvement of socio-economics of the region,\" the official said.\nHome minister is also learnt to have urged CMs to have more khaki-clad men from state forces on the ground. \"Men in camouflage create a scary environment,\" the official said.\nThe official said that the Arunachal rethink was a result of the view that where it is not necessary, AFSPA must not be extended.\nDuring the conference, Singh congratulated all chief ministers on their sustained efforts in improving the security scenario by focusing on development resulting in an \"all-time low\" level of insurgency in the region.\n\"Mizoram, Tripura, large parts of Assam and Meghalaya, and Arunachal Pradesh, except its three eastern districts, are almost free of insurgency. There is a strong popular desire for peace in Nagaland and Manipur too,\" he was Quote: d by agencies as saying.\nTalking about militancy, the home minister said several small residual insurgent groups were operating from their safe havens across the border and are engaged in kidnapping for ransom, which had almost doubled in Assam and Meghalaya.\nHe said in Garo Hill district of Meghalaya, some new splinter groups were kidnapping people for ransom or looting businessmen at gunpoint.\n\"I would like to make it absolutely clear that the central government would not talk to such criminal elements. Such criminal activities must be dealt with firmly... I would like to reiterate and emphasize that we have zero-tolerance policy on insurgency,\" Singh said.\nHe also said most of the youths in insurgent groups were misled and they had now realized their mistakes. \"They are welcome to the mainstream. However, those who have committed heinous crimes and acts of terror will have to face the law and meet the justice,\" Singh said.\nReferring to the ongoing peace talks with different groups, Singh said these were on the right track and the government hoped to bring them to their logical conclusions soon.\nIn 2014, due to various terror attacks while 193 people died in Kashmir and 372 in Naxal areas, 413 died in the northeast. Assam is the worst sufferer of human casualties in terror attacks among all Indian states. In 2014, Assam accounted for 168 deaths in 246 insurgency incidents. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Centre mulls cut in central forces in northeast,Rajnath Singh Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-07-12T12:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T10:55:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
