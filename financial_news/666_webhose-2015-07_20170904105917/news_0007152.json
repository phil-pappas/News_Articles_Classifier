Photo: Reuters\nJames Packer has plenty of rivals wherever he looks.\nIn his home town of Sydney there's Echo Entertainment, which Packer stripped of its monopoly licence with his proposal to create a new VIP high rollers casino at Sydney's Barangaroo.\nInternational competitors include the Hong-Kong based Galaxy Entertainment Group, headed by the powerful Liu family, Malaysia's Genting Group, controlled by billionaire KT Lim, and Vegas-based MGM Resorts International, founded by the late self-made billionaire Kirk Kerkorian.\nThe Wynn Macau casino. Photo: CARMO CORREIA\nBut it's the legendary 73-year-old legally blind US business magnate Steve Wynn who Packer would dearly love to emulate.\nWynn is widely considered the architect of modern Las Vegas after creating the Mirage and Bellagio casino resorts.\nThe late Kerry Packer gambled heavily at Wynn's casinos, and at one point was jetting into Vegas on his private DC8 three or four times a year for massive sprees.\nThe best known story concerned Kerry playing cards in the late 1990s at a table at Wynn's Bellagio, at the time the most expensive hotel in the world.\nA Texan businessman playing at an adjacent table wanted to join in, bragging he was worth $US100 million. Kerry called his bluff.\n\"If you really want to gamble, I'll flip you for it [the $100 million].\"\nWynn and Packer senior became friends, often playing golf together. That led to a business relationship with both Packer and Crown Casino founder Lloyd Williams, with Wynn helping advise on the early designs of Crown's Melbourne casino.\nJames also quickly became a fan, forming a business connection with Wynn after the US casino operator sold the original Macau concession to Packer's Melco Crown venture in 2006 for $900 million.\nPacker has spoken of his huge respect for the ageing Wynn, 30 years his senior.\n\"I think Steve Wynn is the greatest developer in the world,\" Packer said in an interview with The Australian Financial Review in 2012.\n\"He is probably a bit like my dad, Kerry. You learn a lot more from him and you feel a lot more pain from him than any other boss you've ever had.\"\nThe friendship has been reciprocal.\nPacker, along with trucking magnate Lindsay Fox and billionaire rag-trader Solomon Lew, attended Wynn's 2011 marriage to Andrea Hissom, a $US5 million ceremony held at the tycoon's Las Vegas resort.\nThe two are still thought to be on good terms, but increasingly Packer is becoming a rival for Wynn's share of the casino pie.\nThe two are direct competitors in Macau â€“ Packer via the Altira and City of Dreams casinos and Wynn via Wynn Macau.\nWith Melco Crown about to open a third casino in Macau and Packer planning to mount a successful return to Vegas, Wynn could yet be upstaged by Packer's global ambitions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:43:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
