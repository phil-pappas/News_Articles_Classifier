Well, it turned out, no, Congress had passed a crummy law that didn’t give people guidance in terms of what it was they were trying to do. They did it poorly and stupidly. The truth of the matter is that there was not some big conspiracy there. They were trying to sort out these conflicting demands. You don’t want all this money pouring through non-for- profits, but you also want to make sure everybody is being treated fairly.”\nReally, Mr. President? For effect, perhaps he should reprise his testy “not even a smidgen of corruption” remark to Fox News . The President keeps claiming there is no evidence the IRS was used for political targeting. You be the judge:\nU.S. President Barack Obama speaks with Jon Stewart, host of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, during a taping of the show in New York, July 21, 2015. The appearance marks Obama’s third time on the show as President, and seventh overall, with Stewart leaving the program on August 6.

In October 2010, IRS Exempt Organization chief Lois Lerner met with the DOJ about prosecuting conservative groups. By March 2012, amid reports of targeting, former IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman testifies there is “absolutely no targeting” by the IRS of conservative and/or Tea Party organizations. On November 9, 2012, Mr. Shulman stepped down , replaced by Steven Miller. On May 10, 2013, during a bar meeting, Ms. Lerner admits targeting, calling it “absolutely incorrect, insensitive, and inappropriate.” Four days later, on May 14, 2013, the Inspector General issued a report confirming targeting.

Ms. Lerner receives $42,000; former Commissioner Miller receives $100,000. On June 24, 2013, the IRS admitted that “inappropriate criteria” were used for tax-exempt status. Next day, Democrats claim progressives were targeted too. On September 24, 2013, Ms. Lerner’s retirement is announced, with full pension. On February 3, 2014, President Obama tells Fox there’s “ not a smidgen of corruption ” at the IRS. On March 11, 2014, the Committee on House Oversight and Reform issues a report on Lois Lerner. On April 7, 2014, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen confirms there are six investigations : four by Congressional committees, one by the DOJ, one by the TIGTA.
