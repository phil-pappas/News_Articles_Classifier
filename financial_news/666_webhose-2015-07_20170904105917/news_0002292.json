Arsineh Housplan Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Simon Evans A steady stream of wine buyers are shelling out more than $500 on bottles of Penfolds, Wolf Blass and Wynns wines so they can buy a steeply discounted large-scale wine fridge normally worth $3000, in early signs that an expanded high-risk promotion by Treasury Wine Estates chief executive Mike Clarke is paying off.\nCampbell Stott, general manager of Woolworths' Dan Murphys superstore chain, which has 196 outlets around Australia, said in the first two weeks of the Treasury Wines promotion his chain had been surprised at the number of shoppers choosing to trade up to a more expensive wine cabinet which holds 120 bottles and is worth $3099 when delivery costs are included.\nWine buyers who spend $500 or more on the three brands can buy the fridge, which is supplied by outside firm Vintec, for almost one-third of the normal price at $1199 each.\nâ€‹\"We've seen a big trade up into the more expensive fridge,\" Mr Stott says.\"We're pleased with how it's going.\"\nTreasury Wines spokesman says the wine cabinet promotion is part of the activities to drive its brands. But he thinks it will be hard to top last year's effort, when more than 12,000 small version Vintec fridges were sold as part of the promotion which was only confined to the Penfolds brand and where shoppers could only buy a smaller 30-bottle temperature controlled fridge for one-third of the usual price for the month of July 2014.\n\"It's a lot harder to keep that momentum up because it's the second time around. But there's a lot more appetite for the bigger fridge because the number of brands has been expanded,\" Mr Stott says.\nAggressive promotion Mr Clarke, who began as Treasury Wines chief executive in March, 2014, has expanded the aggressive promotion this year to include Wynns Coonawarra Estate and Wolf Blass grey label ranges along with the high-end Penfolds brands and is offering two types of wine fridges depending on whether customers in liquor stores spend $180 to qualify for the smaller fridge or more than $500 for the big version which holds 120 bottles.\n He has also extended the time frame over which it will run to three months this year up until September 1, instead of just the month of July which it ran for in 2014.\nAnthony D'Anna, owner of Boccaccio Cellars in Melbourne's leafy suburb of Balwyn said there had been strong take-up. \"It's going really well,\" he says. \"It's probably split evenly between those going for the more expensive one to the smaller one. Even the average Joe coming in off the street is interested in the small one.\"\nMr D'Anna says customers are buying more of the Treasury brands than they normally would, but over the longer-term some of the oomph may dissipate: \"Longer term, you wonder how sustainable it is.\" But it had generated similarly high levels of activity thus far in 2015.\nA Treasury Wines spokesman said on Thursday the company was \"very happy\" with the sales momentum of its top 15 brands globally, and the wine cabinet promotion was part of the activities to drive those brands.\nThe brisk activity at liquor stores comes as the broader Australian wine industry experienced its first rise in the value of wine exports for eight years, with a 5 per cent rise to $1.89 billion for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015 according to new figures released on Thursday.\nWine Australia chief executive officer Andreas Clark said on Thursday it was the first increase in value over a financial year since 2006-07 and was mainly driven by increases in the value of exports to Asia. The average value of wine exports to Asia for 2014-15 was $18.49 per litre, compared with $11.54 per litre to North America.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/103351169357344338991", "https://twitter.com/SimonMEvans"], "published": "2015-07-16T11:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:05:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
