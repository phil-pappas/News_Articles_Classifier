The ADB revised down China's growth forecast to 7.0 percent in 2015 from 7.2 percent estimate in March, and to 6.8 percent from 7.0 percent for 2016. Consumption growth in China remains robust but investment growth has continued to decelerate, the Manila-based lender pointed out. \"The financial sector is also expected to contribute less to growth after the recent stock market correction, although the drop in stock prices is unlikely to have much impact on consumption,\" it said. The bank maintained 7.8 percent growth outlook for India in fiscal 2015 and 8.2 percent in fiscal 2016 on the back of a healthy monsoon and new investments.\n\nThe ADB revised down the projection for inflation this year to 2.4 percent \nfrom 2.6 percent earlier amid ongoing softness in fuel prices and subdued food costs are containing inflationary pressures. Inflation is seen at 3.0 percent in 2016, unchanged from the previous forecast.\n\nThe ADB is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific. Established in 1966, it has now owned by 67 members, mostly from the region, as well as the US, the UK and Germany. Last year, its financial assistance totaled USD 22.9 billion, including co-financing of USD 9.2 billion.
