Mr Tsipras? Syriza government may see significant rebellion and approval of the deal in the Greek parliament will probably only be possible with the help of opposition parties -- and even then, it is not completely certain it will pass.\" \nTsipras needs to secure backing for the deal from the Greek people, parliament and Syriza, which shot to power in January on the back of promises to end five years of bitter austerity under two previous bailouts. \nIn the agreement struck Monday with the eurozone to prevent Greece crashing out of the euro, Athens must pass sweeping changes to labour laws, pensions, VAT and taxes by Wednesday. \n?Equity markets largely in the red... coming down off yesterday's heady reaction to news of a Greek deal, as Alexis Tsipras returns to a revolution within his Syriza party,\" said Augustin Eden, research analyst at trading firm Accendo Markets. \nHe added that \"fears of a Grexit\" are \"back on the minds of investors\". \nIn foreign exchange deals, the European single currency firmed to $1.1026 from $1.1004 late in New York on Monday. \nThe euro had jumped to a July peak at $1.1216 on Monday shortly after the deal was announced, but then slid as traders then realised a Greek deal bolstered chances that the US Federal Reserve will hike interest rates soon. \n- German investor sentiment sinks - \nThe German stock market meanwhile took another knock from weak data. \nInvestor sentiment in Germany fell in July to its lowest level in eight months, but the outlook for Europe's biggest economy remains positive, a survey found. \nThe investor confidence index calculated by the ZEW economic institute slipped by just 1.8 points to 29.7 points in July, its lowest level since November 2014, ZEW said in a statement. \nAnalysts had however been expecting a slightly steeper decline this month to 29.0 points. \n\"Neither the difficulties in dealing with the Greek sovereign debt crisis nor the turmoil on Chinese financial markets seem to impress the financial market experts strongly,\" said ZEW president Clemens Fuest. \n\"Despite the slight decline of the indicator, the overall economic outlook for Germany remains positive,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T15:37:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
