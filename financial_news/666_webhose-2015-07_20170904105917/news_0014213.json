The actor and newly minted race car driver has a very personal connection to the plight — he lost his mother to ovarian cancer in 2014. Fifth Third Bank will donate $150 to SU2C and $150 to new customers when they open an Essential Checking account and meet certain conditions. \nAccording to SU2C, a charitable initiative of the Entertainment Industry Foundation that raises money to fast-track the rate of groundbreaking cancer research, a total of 15 million new cases of cancer have been diagnosed since 1990. And, 1,500 people die from the disease each day. Patrick Dempsey and Fifth Third Bank Team Up to Support Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C) \n“With cancer impacting so many, we asked ourselves, ‘Could a bank help in the fight against this disease?’” said Maria Veltre, senior vice president and chief marketing officer for Fifth Third Bank, in a press release . “That was more than two years ago, and we’ve proven since that we can make a difference with the help of our customers, employees and members of our communities, and now leveraging the power of celebrity with Patrick Dempsey. With this campaign we want to highlight all the ways that we help fight every day.” \nDempsey will serve as the spokesman for the campaign and is featured in a Fifth Third Bank public service announcement detailing the ways people can fight back against cancer. Over the past two years, the bank has joined in multiple marketing campaigns that have amassed $4.2 million in SU2C donations. \nFifth Third Bank first partnered with SU2C in 2013 with the launch of the bank’s Fifth Third SU2C debit and credit cards. These cards allowed bank customers to raise money to support the cause by making qualifying purchases. The bank is also the only card issuer that provides SU2C payment cards. \n“Through this campaign, Fifth Third has made an everyday necessity a more meaningful experience for their customer by supporting Stand Up To Cancer’s innovative cancer research,” said Rusty Robertson, co-founder of SU2C, in the release. \nRead: What Are the Best Checking Account Features?
