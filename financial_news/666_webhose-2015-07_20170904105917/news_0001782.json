Photo: Louie Douvis\nClass Super, a popular online software platform used by accountants to administer self-managed superannuation funds that is backed by Countplus founder and philanthropist Barry Lambert, has named former Stockland boss Matthew Quinn and former Microsoft executive Kathryn Foster directors as it prepares for a $100 million-plus sharemarket listing before the end of 2015.\n\"The business has been profitable since 2013 and achieving strong growth, the time is now right to float. We will have our first board meeting with the new directors on Monday and begin the intensive process of planning for an initial public offer before the end of this year,\" Mr Lambert said.\n\"With the number of SMSF funds growing at around 7 per cent per annum and more of the market adopting cloud technology there is plenty of growth potential left in the business.\nBarry Lambert, Countplus \"We also expect to announce the appointment of another director with an outstanding history in the financial services sector in the next week or so. These high-calibre appointments, with sound commercial and corporate expertise, will be invaluable as we prepare the company for listing.\"\nMr Quinn was managing director of the almost $1 billion listed property group Stockland for 12 years, overseeing a period of growth in which the developer became an ASX top 50 company. He is also a non-executive director of CSR Limited and UrbanGrowth NSW and is chairman of Carbonxt Group Limited and mPort Pty Ltd.\nAdvertisement Ms Foster spent much of a 20-year executive career in the United States and Asia as a Microsoft executive working on developing internet-based businesses for the multinational.\nClass Super was the first cloud-based SMSF administration software to market in 2009. Roughly 83,000, or 16 per cent, of the 520,000 SMSFs in Australia use the product. Of the SMSFs that are administered using a cloud based solution Class Super has more than 50 per cent market share.\n\"With the number of SMSF funds growing at around 7 per cent per annum and more of the market adopting cloud technology there is plenty of growth potential left in the business,\" Mr Lambert said.\nMr Lambert also chairs Countplus, a $127 million ASX-listed network of accountants and financial planners, which is the largest shareholder in Class Super. Countplus is an offshoot of Count Financial, the business Mr Lambert founded in 1980 and sold to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for $373 million in 2011.\nCountplus paid $2.15 million for a 10 per cent stake in Class Super in July 2013 in a deal that valued the IT company at $60 million.\nMr Lambert said he expects the company to list with a valuation of more than $100 million as 50 founding shareholders sell down between 20 per cent to 25 per cent alongside a small capital raising.\nClass Super chief executive Kevin Bungard has also been elevated to the board as an executive director. Other existing Class Super directors are its largest shareholder Rod Kibble and former CEO and early shareholder Raj Ray.\nMr Lambert is ranked Australia's156th richest person on the 2015 BRW Rich List, with an estimated wealth of $372 million. Last month he and his wife Joy made the largest ever research donation to the University of Sydney, giving $33.7 million to establish the Lambert Initiative to fund medical research into developing pharmaceuticals from cannabis extracts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T17:34:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
