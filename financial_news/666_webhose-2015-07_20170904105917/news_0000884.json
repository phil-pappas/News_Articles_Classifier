In the country most skin bleaching products have been banned by the Tanzania Food and Drug Authority (TFDA). \nThe Tanzania Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, 2003 prohibits the manufacture, sell, supply or distribution of cosmetics that contain prohibited ingredients which may harm or cause injury to users under normal circumstances. These products include a variety of pills, soaps and creams. \nTFDA spokesperson, Ms Gaudencia Simwanza, told the 'Sunday News' that they have been running outreach programmes on the effects of skin lightening products. \"We have a special programme in which we have reached various primary and secondary schools in the country,\" she said. \nMs Simwanza said that TFDA has also been educating people especially in highly populated areas like Manzese, a place where many people from different walks of life conduct their activities, adding they also conducted various seminars and workshops in Morogoro and Dar es Salaam to mention a few. \nSpeaking about homemade skin lightening products, she said it was still a challenge as it's never easy to know which house is involved in that business, thus much efforts have been put on providing education to the public. \nOne of the sellers of homemade lightening product who preferred anonymity, said that the business was booming for people who are selling homemade skin lightening products. \n\"We sell these products in different parts of the country and the price ranges from 45,000/- to 65,000/- depending on the desired level of light skin by a customer,\" she revealed. \nShe further said that content of homemade cream include a mixture of various products including imported soaps and cream, though she refused to reveal the exact products name. According to Dr Suka, skin bleaching comes with hazardous health consequences. \nThe dangers linked with the use of toxic compounds for skin bleaching include blood cancers such as leukaemia and cancers of the liver and kidneys as well as severe skin conditions. \nDr Suka warned that sustained use of bleaching agents could cause even cancer, hardcore bleachers use illegal ointments containing toxins like mercury, a metal that blocks production of melanin, which gives the skin its colour, but can also be toxic. \n\"Systemically it causes things like kidney failure because of the mercury in some of the products and it also causes eczema, skin pigmentation among a host of other infections,\" he told the 'Sunday News'. \nMr Benny Mkalimoto, a Dar es Salaam resident, said that many men are attracted to light skinned ladies, thus making them to opt to bleach their skin believing they will be more attractive. \nMr Frank Mushi, an advocate said that to him ladies who use skin lighting products are not attractive at all, noting that ladies should learn that not all men have interest in light skinned women and that they should accept who they are. \nA physician at Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS), Dr Isaac Maro, said that melanocytes are the cells responsible for making melanin, a pigment that gives skin and hair colour, adding the more melanin the melanocytes produce, the darker the skin and the lesser melanin the brighter the skin colour. \n\"Absence or lessened melanin puts people using lightening creams at risk of skin cancer because melanin acts as a natural sun block that protects the skin from the ultra violet rays of the sun and provides a sun protection factor,\" he elaborated. \nHe further said that accepting who you are was crucial as the effects of using skin lightening products were great than remaining with your normal skin.
