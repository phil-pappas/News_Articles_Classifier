The new site launched in Brussels in April. \n- Mere minnows - \nSpringer has also blazed a trail in the media publishing industry in Germany, which has evolved more slowly than in the United States or Britain. \nIt introduced a scaled payment model for the online edition of Bild in 2013, offering free teasers while putting premium content behind paywalls. \nRecognising the decline of print, Springer has unloaded dozens of magazines and regional newspapers while snapping up websites around Europe, particularly those specialising in classified ads such as online job board StepStone. \nHowever, those outfits were mere minnows, while attempts to net big fish, such as Britain's Daily Telegraph a decade ago, came up short. \nIts bid to buy German commercial television group ProSiebenSAT1 in 2006 also failed when the deal was blocked by competition authorities. \nSeven years later, Springer bought German rolling news channel N24, its first television acquisition. \nGroup sales surged eight percent last year to just over three billion euros ($3.3 billion), with its digital sector accounting for more than half of the group's revenues. \nAnalysts for Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) said in a prescient research note last month that the company's growth in digital subscribers, coupled with expansion in the US and British markets, could \"mark the starting point of the next step in the transformation of Axel Springer\". \n\"We note however that it may not be easy to find the right targets at a reasonable valuation -- especially in the Anglo-Saxon world,\" they wrote. \nThe company is due to announce its quarterly results on August 4, when Doepfner is expected to reveal at least hints of where he sees the road ahead leading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T16:34:26.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
