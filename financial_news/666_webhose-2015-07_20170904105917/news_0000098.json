Michelle Smith Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Cranston Play down the casino.\nThat was the one simple objective given to the architects for Destination Brisbane Consortium 's winning $2 billion bid.\nCottee Parker Architects' Rob Cottee and Naveen Dath, alongside global urban planner Jerde's chief executive Phil Kim, had to strike the right balance between toning down a normally glitzy casino design and igniting what has been an abandoned stretch of Brisbane riverfront.\n\"If you take Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, there is a similar sort of concept going on, and that is to downplay the entry to the casino and up-play the entry to the resort,\" Mr Cottee said. \"That's what government wanted here. That's what they were pushing for and we understood what they were trying to achieve.\"\nAn artist's impression of Echo Entertainment's proposal for Queen's Wharf casino. On Monday the Destination Brisbane Consortium, comprising Echo Entertainment, Chow Tai Fook, and the Far East Consortium, won the right to develop 7.8 hectares of public realm into 2000 apartments, 1100 hotel rooms and more than 20,000 square metres of retail space . It beat James Packer's Crown Resorts .\nIt was not the first time Far East and Cottee Parker have won a government tender process for a high-profile central business district redevelopment project. In March 2014 they won the right to develop the first commercial stage of the Elizabeth Quay project in Perth.\nBut the Queen's Wharf precinct, with its lucrative casino licence, has attracted a considerably larger public profile and controversy, especially because the public's land was being handed to a casino operator.\nAll publicly accessible \"The idea here is that we can allow the general public to use most of the facilities of this integrated resort without ever going to the casino,\" Mr Cottee said. \"We have the sky deck, we have riverview plaza, we have the bridge and they are all publicly accessible.\"\n\"The casino is a small part of the facilities, which are the real drivers of bringing people to the site.\"\nMr Kim said the detail of what was offered within the public realm was crucial to winning the bid.\n\"With the way the integrated resort reaches out and connects to the city there really is much more of a porous kind of solution than a traditional casino,\" he said.\n\"It is really an inversion of the traditional gaming idea, which is that you used to go through gaming to get to everything else but now the gaming is being wrapped by all these other things.\"\nThe use of subtropical elements such as outdoor terraces and elevated views of the river have also been encouraged to try to reflect the climate, as well as provide a \"wrapping\" for the casino.\n\"​We have taken the quintessential verandah element that is intrinsic to the traditional Queenslander and we have transformed that into a spectacular sky deck,\" Mr Dath said. \"Much like a verandah, it offers people an indoor and outdoor space that they can use to enjoy the unique climate of Queensland and its views.\"\nBuilding design critical The design of the buildings were critical for \"projecting\" a Brisbane feel on to the global stage, he said.\n\"The building facades incorporate a lot of subtropical features, such as green walls, shading elements, balconies, overhangs and projections, all of which are distinctively Brisbane.\n\"You don't see that in a building somewhere else in the world. If you look at a building in Melbourne, it is all just sheer glass, clean and smooth. But here the buildings are highly textured, which reflects what Brisbane is all about and what the subtropical response has to be in such a climate.\"\nJerde also studied the city's changing demographics and used that to influence the type of retail offerings within the wrapping of the casino. Craft breweries and local restaurants will abound – more than 50 of them – and some will inhabit the heritage listed buildings in the precinct.\nThere are also expectations that Brisbane will have significantly stronger tourism connections and higher demands for higher-quality hotels and tourism product and that also means better shopping.\nEcho is also likely to bring hotel operator Ritz Carlton and a large department store such as Galeries Lafayette or Saks Fifth Avenue into the heritage buildings that house the existing casino.\n\"Shopping is an integral part of a tourist destination,\" Mr Dath said. \"Most visitors, when they do go out they enjoy being in a shopping precinct. What is being offered will complement what already exists.\"\nWith all the distractions of the public realm – its architecture, its shopping, hotels and subtropical environment – Cottee Parker and, ironically, the Destination Brisbane Consortium are all hoping the word casino will be an afterthought.\nRead next: Hard work begins for Echo after beating Crown in Brisbane", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/102874628957085545973", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/mcranston1", "http://www.cotteeparker.com.au/", "http://www.jerde.com/"], "published": "2015-07-21T10:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:11:06.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
