As if on cue, the key indexes, already down in morning trade, fell more than 4 percent in the afternoon.\nThe CSI300 index eventually ended down 3.5 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 3 percent.\n\"Investors liquidated their positions as the GDP data failed to impress,\" said Steven Leung, a director at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong.\nIt has been a difficult year for the world's second-largest economy, with slowing growth in trade, investment and domestic demand compounded by a cooling property sector, deflationary pressure, then the equity market panic from mid-June.\nBeijing will need to keep providing liquidity to the stock exchanges and cut the cost of corporate financing, which remains far higher than returns on investment for many companies.\nEconomists have also called for more direct fiscal stimulus to help support heavily indebted local governments.\nWednesday's data showed fiscal expenditure rose 13.9 percent on an annual basis in June, a sharp rise from May's 2.6 percent but well below April's 33.2 percent spike.\nFAITH IN THE FIGURES\nSome analysts, who on average had tipped GDP to rise 6.9 percent, question the accuracy of official data, implying the numbers are more about reassuring investors than true reflections of performance.\nFor example, June power output only increased 0.5 percent year-on-year, though factory output climbed 6.8 percent.\nThe statistics bureau rejected suggestions that figures were being inflated.\nIt is not only the government reporting a warmer second quarter; the recent independent China Beige Book survey also reported signs of a broad-based recovery for the period, which it said was largely driven by growth in the interior provinces.\n\"While actual growth is almost certainly a percentage point or two slower than the official figures show, there are good reasons to think that the latest figures are mirroring a genuine stabilisation,\" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard, economist at Capital Economics in Singapore.\n\"There is growing evidence of an improvement in the wider economy.\"\nThe statistics bureau described the nascent recovery as \"hard won\" and noted it was driven primarily by an increase in domestic consumption, which produced 60 percent of China's economic growth in the first half, compared with 35.7 percent for capital formation and 4.3 percent from net exports.\nConsumption contributed 51.2 percent to GDP growth in 2014, so the rise will be welcomed by a government that is trying to reduce its dependence on exports in favour of domestic demand.\nCREDIT QUESTIONS\nThe statistics bureau warned that recovery required more support to consolidate.\n\"We must also take note that domestic and the external economic environment remains complex, and the global economic recovery is tortuous and slow,\" it said.\nEven so, bureau spokesman Sheng Laiyun predicted further improvements in the second half as previous policy measures, including several interest rate cuts, take effect.\nAndrew Colquhoun of Fitch Ratings also expects an improvement in the rest of the year.\n\"The resilience of retail sales in June is a further encouraging sign that downside risk, while not negligible, is receding, despite recent equity-market volatility.\"\nData on Tuesday showed bank lending increased sharply in June, thanks to central bank support.\nHowever, economists worry that many companies and individuals borrowed heavily to buy stocks in the first half, so the sharp stock market decline could inhibit banks' ability to lend.\nBefore the market plunged, key indexes had risen nearly 60 percent in the first half, which some economists estimate added more than a percentage point to total GDP growth in that period, mostly by boosting activity in the financial services sector.\nIf that boost peters out now the market appears to have run out of steam, it could drag on third-quarter figures.\nThe government has forecast economic growth of around 7 percent for 2015, which would be the weakest rate in 25 years.\n(Additional reporting by Lu Jianxin, Koh Gui Qing, Winni Zhou and the Shanghai Newsroom; Writing by Pete Sweeney and Will Waterman; Editing by Alex Richardson )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T11:22:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
