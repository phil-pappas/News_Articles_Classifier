The dollar weakened for the first time in three days against the euro after jobs gains were close to forecast and the prior-month increase was revised down.\n“This data doesn’t indicate the market is just going to pile into the dollar,” Lennon Sweeting, a Toronto-based dealer at the broker and payment provider USForex Inc., said by phone. “Based on the numbers we’ve seen today, it just leads to more consolidation at current levels.”\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against 10 of its major peers, declined 0.2 percent to 1,187.25 as of 9:14 a.m. in New York. It rose as much as 0.2 percent earlier Thursday.\nMarket Moves The U.S. currency weakened 0.3 percent to $1.1088 per euro and dropped 0.1 percent to 123.05 yen.\nThe shared currency strengthened as Greece prepared for Sunday’s referendum on its creditors’ demands. Yanis Varoufakis said Greece won’t “extend and pretend” that it can pay its debts, vowing to quit as finance minister if voters don’t support him in the referendum.\n“The euro’s taking a bounce, which makes sense because it means that the Fed may be on hold,” Douglas Borthwick, head of foreign exchange at New York brokerage Chapdelaine & Co., said by phone. “If you’re going to sell the dollar, sell it against the yen because the yen will also be a beneficiary should something bad happen in Europe.”\nThe increase in June payrolls followed smaller gains in the prior two months and wages were little changed as U.S. job market reflected a more moderate pace of economic growth.\nThe addition of 223,000 jobs followed a 254,000 increase in the prior month that was less than previously estimated, a Labor Department report showed. The jobless rate fell to a seven-year low of 5.3 percent as more people left the labor force.\nWage Growth Average hourly earnings at private employers held at $24.95. They increased just 2 percent during the 12 months ended in June, following a 2.3 percent gain the prior month.\nFed funds futures show there’s a 27 percent chance the central bank will increase its benchmark rate from near zero in September, down from 35 percent on Wednesday, and a 68 percent chance by December, down from 72 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe central bank has kept its benchmark, the target for overnight loans between banks, in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008 to support the economy. It last raised the rate in 2006.\nWhile the economy has picked up after a first-quarter slump, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last month she still wants to see more “decisive” evidence of a lasting turnaround in growth before raising rates.\nThe dollar has gained 5.7 percent this year among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro is down 4 percent, while the yen is up 2.5 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T17:06:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
