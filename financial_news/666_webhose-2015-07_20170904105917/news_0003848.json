Gardening writer Robin Lane Fox is not amused. Getty Images by Robin Lane Fox\nI hereby found a Society for the Protection of André Le Nôtre.\nIt has been an awful year for the greatest of landscape designers. He has just been slandered in film. An item crucial to one of his masterpieces is at risk of disfigurement by a car park. Another has been inaccurately restored in \"honour\" of the tricentenary of his death. And his most famous vista is being wrecked by misplaced contemporary art.\nLe Nôtre's great gardens include many V-words, words such as Versailles or Vaux le Vicomte. Not until this northern summer's cultural patronage have they been disfigured by another, an intruder which politely, for reasons explained below, I will abbreviate as VQ.\n'Descension', an artwork by Anish Kapoor, on show in Versailles. First, the ordeal by film. In English cinemas it was entitled A Little Chaos , but in French, tellingly, Les Jardins du Roi .\nMaybe you would smile if you too were represented at the age of 40 when you were actually over 65 and then shown as seducing Kate Winslet at the height of her acting powers.\nYou would, however, sue if you were at the summit of your talent, recently returned from Italy, about to design two brilliant royal bosquets at Versailles but were presented to millions of filmgoers as if you needed the inspiration of a pushy young lady designer whose only achievement, a little back garden, intrigued you by resembling a yard in Los Angeles 300 years after your death.\nPatricia Dechin is the celebrated expert on Le Nôtre's life. She confirms to me that female gardeners did indeed have important official roles in parts of Versailles's garden, but Le Nôtre would never have delegated to them the right to design for the king.\n 'C-Curve' by Anish Kapoor, is displayed at the Royal Tennis Court. Writer Robin Lane Fox is appalled by the placement. Thierry Chesnot \"A missed opportunity,\" she magnanimously concludes, while observing that bits of the film were shot at Blenheim Park in Oxfordshire but not in its formal parterre garden. \" Dommage ,\" she remarks, as the parterre at Blenheim was modelled on designs at Versailles.\nShooting red wax At Sceaux, near Paris, the \"anniversary restoration\" of a Le Nôtre design in 2013 has been much publicised, but it is based on its architect's reworking of an 18th-century melange and is not the master's design at all.\nAt Chantilly, the commune has just floated a plan of consummate philistinism, a parking lot in the remains of Le Nôtre's original reservoir, an integral part of the original water systems that enabled his beautiful landscape. Above all, consider, but this year, avoid, Versailles.\nIn early June, Anish Kapoor posed in front of his artwork at the opening of the exhibition of his works in Versailles. Thierry Chesnot I fear art works by Sir Anish Kapoor will be in situ here until November. On the way up to the chateau, the former Tennis Court, the Jeu de Paume, is one of the holy spaces in all political experience. There, on June 20, 1789, more than 600 French deputies of the Third Estate swore their oath that as a new National Assembly they would continue to reassemble \"until the constitution of the Kingdom is established\".\nLike Magna Carta, this oath was a check on royal power. Like that charter, its fame increased far beyond the participants' aims. Push open the Tennis Court door in homage this year, however, and you will find a sort of gun which Kapoor has himself called \"phallic\". It is shooting red wax across the floor to symbolise human blood and entrails.\nIt is as if an unmade bed by Tracey Emin had been installed in this anniversary year at Runnymede with an angled phallus pointing in the presumed direction of Magna Carta's mediating Archbishop, the thoughtful Stephen Langton, and ejaculating shaving foam every 20 minutes to symbolise pressure from each of the obstreperous barons.\nThe Tennis Court is not the garden. However, on the garden's main terrace, blocking the view of the greatest royal facade in the world, Kapoor has installed C-Curve , a semicircular strip of shining mirror, one side of which makes spectators look as if they are upside down, the other as if they are taller.\nVersailles as it was designed by Andre Le Nôtre when Louis XIV, the Sun King, moved the French court there from Paris in the late 17th century – sans Anish Kapoor. Paul Rovere In my youth, we paid 6d to look into \"fat\" and \"thin\" mirrors, never on the terrace of Windsor Castle but at the merry old English circus. Seen from the garden, Kapoor's gleaming C-Curve looks as if the British Government Communications Headquarters has installed a dish to monitor rumours that the king's former mistress, Madame de Pompadour, has been Tweeting an Ottoman Turk.\nJolted by ugliness On Versailles' main axial view, Kapoor is concerned not to detract but to jolt us by ugliness and incongruity so that we think and see differently.\nUntil November 1, his now-infamous installation Dirty Corner will be ruining the line and perspective of this sublime landscape. In an interview, Kapoor is reported as referring to this artwork as \"vagina of the Queen\", or \"VQ\".\nPerhaps queens' V-words were differently shaped before the shock of 1792, but this monstrous metal trumpet is backed by a rusty-coloured drainpipe and flanked by huge heaps of earth and rocks and red plastic blocks to signify yet more entrails. Its fluted entry-point looks like the gramophone-trumpet by which that white dog used to sit in the adverts for HMV.\nI doubt if un fox-terrier blanc ever sat by the French queen's V with an ear cocked, even on a chilly night beneath the blankets while the king was busied elsewhere in Versailles.\nI do not accept Kapoor's argument that Le Nôtre's master design was itself intrusive on the landscape and so he, Kapoor, is forcing us to recognise Le Nôtre's art by being monumentally intrusive into Le Nôtre's own creation.\nUnlike Le Nôtre, Kapoor is working within a master design, flanked by classicising white statues of Artemis and the personified figure of Revelry. That design was brilliantly conceived as a unity by Le Nôtre. \"VQ\" is an execrable intruder, not a forcible wake-up call.\nTwo days after my visit vandals threw paint all over the trumpet. I swear, with a Tennis-Court oath, that I did not do it. Vandalism is not the right response to the rape of a defenceless genius.\nBeyond Kapoor's dirty tunnel stretches Le Nôtre's superb pond with a fountain of Apollo in his chariot. In the distance shines his formal sheet of water, but as never before this holy place is thunderously noisy.\nThe rumpus is all Kapoor's, with his Descension , an insolently placed pool of water, swirled around by power as if it is gurgling down a bath plug. The worst of the noise comes from the nearby generator that has to power it.\nJoin my new society and you can ballot for the chance after November 1 to feed bits of the queen's V down the bath plug and block it into silence. Meanwhile, give Versailles a miss until 2016.\n© The Financial Times Limited 2015", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqnT7Qkz8fo"], "published": "2015-07-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:07:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
