Generally, the commitment is there and things are on track,' said one source who declined to be identified. \nImproved control over spending, mainly through government reforms put into effect before the programme began, contributed significantly to the current progress, according to one source. \nRising global oil prices may have also eased pressure on government finances, said another source. \nExports of cocoa, gold and oil helped Ghana's economy grow strongly for years. \nBut growth has slowed since 2014, as commodity prices fell and the country's debt-to-GDP ratio rose close to 70 percent. \nTwo international economists said they expected Ghana to pass early reviews of the programme. \nThey are more concerned about budget projections for the election year of 2016, given how the deficit ballooned in the 2012 election year. \nGhana's currency, the cedi, has fallen 22 percent since January. \nIt steadied at 4.3600 to the dollar at 1130 GMT on Monday after touching a record low of 4.4100 last week. \nDeputy Finance Minister Cassiel Ato Forson told Reuters on Monday the government was committed to sustaining the reforms and hopeful the Fund will disburse the August tranche of money. \n- Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T07:36:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
