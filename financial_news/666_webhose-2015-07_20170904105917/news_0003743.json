Criminal scammers are targeting some of the most vulnerable people in society - ripping them off in many cases for thousands of pounds. \n\"We are going to continue in our fight to protect consumers and we urge you to help us by reporting suspected cases of postal fraud to the Royal Mail (LSE: RMG.L - news ) .\" \nA joint initiative - aimed at identifying bogus material - has resulted in 2,000 postal staff being trained to date while scam victims, including a woman from Wales who lost her life savings, have also been helped via partner agencies to spot fake marketing. \nLouise Baxter, who leads the NTSST, added: \"We really need the public to help us with this – by being vigilant about mass marketing scams themselves but also looking out for relatives or neighbours, particularly those who are elderly or vulnerable. \n\"We often find victims who have lost hundreds of thousands over several years; the impact on individuals and consumers is devastating.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T12:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T13:12:07.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
