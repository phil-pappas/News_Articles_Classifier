This comes as a relief to several Indian entities that had a high FII holding. As per earlier definitions by Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) in their rules in February 2015, foreign equity investment cap of 49% is applicable to all Indian insurance companies. Also, it would not allow the aggregate holdings by way of total foreign investment in their equity shares by Foreign Investors, including portfolio investors, to exceed forty-nine% of their paid-up equity capital and also shall ensure that ownership and control shall remain at all times in the hands of resident Indian entities. Last week, FIPB cleared Kotak Mahindra Bank's proposal to raise foreign investment limit in the lender to 55%. After deferring a decision on the proposal in the past, the FIPB, headed by Finance Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi, cleared the application after the Department of Financial Services gave its opinion on the matter, sources said. Kotak Bank had approached FIPB after the Reserve Bank of India barred overseas investments in it as foreign shareholding hit the permissible threshold following the merger with ING Vysya Bank. Investments from foreign institutional investors (FIIs), foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and foreign banks had reached 48.55% in the merged entity. With this clarification that has come now, the confusion over FII holding in insurance promoters acting as a deterrent for foreign promoters to raise their stake to 49%. Indian promoter is required to have atleast 51% stake in the insurance venture. Now, as per the new definition, this can also include FII stake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T18:59:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
