Kathmandu by Carrie LaFrenz Briscoe Group managing director and major shareholder, Rod Duke, is prepared to slash his stake in the Kiwi retailer by one third as part of a $324 million takeover of ailing outdoor clothing and adventure wear retailer Kathmandu.\nBriscoe revealed on Wednesday it has offered five Briscoe shares for nine Kathmandu shares, plus a cash of $NZ0.20 per share in a part cash-script deal. Based on a one month volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of $NZ2.88 on June 29, 2015, the day before the deal was made public, this equates to an offer price of $NZ1.80 per Kathmandu share and represents a 34 per cent premium.\nThe offer is based on a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 15.5 times full year 2015 earnings, Briscoe said.\nKathmandu shareholders have indicated they would be reluctant to swap shares in the well-known global brand for shares in a small, illiquid New Zealand retailer 80 per cent owned by Mr Duke. Under the deal, the issue of 89.7 million Briscoe shares and payment of $NZ32.3 million in cash would reduce Mr Duke's stake in the combined group to 55.1 per cent.\nSome Kathmandu shareholders also believe the offer is aimed primarily at securing a backdoor listing and wider shareholder base for Briscoe.\nMr Duke, one of New Zealand's richest men, confirmed if the acquisition is completed Briscoe intends to apply for a listing on the ASX .\nHe said the offer is an opportunity for Kathmandu shareholders to receive a premium for their shares and to share in the benefits arising from being a shareholder in a larger and more diversified retail group.\n\"We see this as a great opportunity for both companies and their respective shareholders,\" he said. \"Our intention is to bring the best practices from each organisation and leverage the scale of the combined group to grow earnings for the benefit of all shareholders. A larger company would also have a superior sharemarket presence, and should see more trading liquidity.\n \"Importantly, the combined group would have a broader and more diverse product offering that would be able to naturally compensate for seasonal trading patterns.\"\nSeveral sources who know Mr Duke and the Kathmandu business said he is well known as a top retail operator in New Zealand.\n\"While Briscoes has very little liquidity, Rod has a good reputation as a good trader. He's got two great businesses and hoping to add a third. Rod has a made a good go at Briscoe and started Rebel in NZ, and there is no reason he can't add another string to his bow,\" said one source.\nKathmandu, which posted its first loss in the first half since listing five years ago, has been vulnerable and leaderless since former chief Peter Halkett stepped down last November.\nNew Kathmandu CEO Xavier Simonet was in the top job one day before Mr Duke pounced.\nBriscoe quietly amassed a 4.9 per cent stake in Kathmandu over the last few weeks, before snaring a 14.9 per cent holding of Kathmandu shares on Friday and Monday from institutional investors at $NZ1.80 ($1.60) - lifting its stake to 19.9 per cent and blocking potential counter offers.\nJan Cameron founded Kathmandu with a sleeping bag in the 1970s and sold it to Quadrant Private Equity fund in 2006 for $300 million. It was listed on the ASX in 2009.\nA merger between Kathmandu and Briscoe would create a trans-Tasman retail group with sales of more than $900 million and 225 stores selling a range of goods from furniture and homewares to sporting goods and apparel and outdoor clothing and camping equipment.\nKathmandu shares fell 3c to $1.54 at 1425pm AEST on Wednesday, after surging 31 per cent on Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T13:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T10:07:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
