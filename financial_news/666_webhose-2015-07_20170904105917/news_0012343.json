Minister Mzembi said very few tourism players would be able to keep their businesses afloat after paying such high rates. \n\"I am really shocked by the degree of bureaucratic intransigence and overzealousness to administer vestiges of quasi-colonial municipal by-laws, consultation processes and one size fit all anti business tariffs that disregard completely operational viability. And this business of disregarding ministerial directives will not assist Zim-Asset,\" he said. \n\"We are only taxing the tourist to death. And who will visit us? I am definitely engaging my counterpart Cde Saviour Kasukuwere (Minister of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing) over this increase.\" \n\"In fact, you may be interested to know that I had engaged the then responsible Minister of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Dr Ignatius Chombo over this matter and we had agreed that the increase should be frozen.\" \nMinister Mzembi said it was wrong for Local Government officials to rush to Parliament with the matter before consutations were over. \n\" Our bilateral position with Dr Chombo was a directive to Victoria Falls Municipality through Principal Director for Urban and Local Authorities Ms Erica Jones that the two parties further engage towards a differential tariff formula and get back to us, not Parliament or the press,\" he said. \n\"I am sure the new minister has not been appraised about this, but being a businessman that he is in his other life he will certainly understand what we sought to achieve.
