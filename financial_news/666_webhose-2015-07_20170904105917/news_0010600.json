Depending on market conditions, the IPO is expected to proceed at a later date,\" Manulife said in a statement emailed to Reuters.\nThe books for Manulife's REIT IPO were scheduled to close last Friday but demand did not materialise amidst the Greek crisis, Thomson Reuters IFR cited a source as saying.\nAsian stocks and the euro stumbled further on Monday, and while China shares jumped on government rescue steps they recouped only some of recent steep losses.\nStock flotation plans have also been pulled or delayed in Europe. In China, authorities orchestrated a halt to new share issues, with dozens of firms scrapping their IPO plans in separate but similarly worded statements over the weekend, a tactic authorities have used before to support markets.\nThis year had already been a slow one for IPOs in Southeast Asia, hurt by weakness in Malaysia's economy and currency and as Singapore has lost much of its appeal with investors favouring Hong Kong and China.\nBankers said the latest market volatility might affect issues in the pipeline. These include an IPO from Malaysian helicopter operator Weststar Aviation Services and a Singapore REIT offering from China's Kailong, comprised of business parks in Shanghai.\nManulife had been aiming to sell 694.4 million units, including cornerstone units, at S$0.82 each. Cornerstone investors included Malaysia's Fortress Capital Asset Management Sdn Bhd, Japan's Nikko Asset Management Asia Ltd, and the Oman Investment Fund.\nDBS was the sole financial adviser. Both DBS and JPMorgan acted as bookrunners.\n($1 = 1.3504 Singapore dollars) (Additional reporting by Denny Thomas in HONG KONG; Editing by Edwina Gibbs )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T08:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T08:06:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
