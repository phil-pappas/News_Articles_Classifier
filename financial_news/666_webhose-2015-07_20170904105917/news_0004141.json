Mr Stehr is still a major shareholder in Clean Seas Tuna, a company that is symbolic of the volatility in the industry, with a share price now languishing at 6¢ after being at $1.30 in early 2008.\nDr Sexton has built up an array of premium food assets across dairy, lobsters, meat and health nutrition under the Beston Global Food banner, which is raising up to $130 million in an initial public offering before listing on the ASX next month, and will use some of the proceeds for the acquisition of Mori Seafood, founded in 1989 by the Moriarty family.\nDr Sexton – who is also the chairman of IOOF Holdings, the under-fire financial services company that has been in the spotlight over serious allegations of misconduct by some staff which resulting in its chief executive Chris Kelaher being grilled by a Senate committee earlier this month – said there is high demand for premium seafood in Asia.\nMori Seafood processes about 600 tonnes of tuna each year under the MORITUNA label, with the vacuum-packed southern bluefin tuna mainly sold to high-end restaurants in the northern hemisphere. The entity being used to purchase Mori is lobster company Ferguson Australia, of which Beston Global Food owns 36 per cent.\nChinese tastes becoming more Japanese Dr Sexton said the changing tastes of consumers in China are telling: \"as incomes rise, the tastes of people in China are moving more towards those of Japan,\" he said on Monday.\n\"You can see it Shanghai and Beijing – the sushi and sashimi bars are everywhere\". The long-term fundamentals make it an attractive business even though there is volatility.\nMori Seafood also exports about 50 tonnes of live lobsters to China each year.\nJapan, China and Hong Kong are the three main export markets for Australia's fish and seafood industry and make up about 70 per cent of total exports. Lobsters make up about 45 per cent of total exports from Australia, with tuna at 10 per cent and abalone at 13 per cent.\nBeston will spend $5.4 million of the float proceeds to fund the purchase of Mori Seafood and a Five-Star Seafoods lobster quota, and has also earmarked $19.2 million to acquire the Pedra Branca dairy farm near Mount Gambier, and $12 million to acquire a 20 per cent stake in hi-tech food nutrition company Neptune Bio-Innovations. It also owns a stake in premium milk and yoghurt group B.-d. Farm Paris Creek.\nPort Lincoln outstripped even the affluent eastern suburbs of Sydney such as Bellevue Hill and Double Bay and the blue-chip Melbourne suburb of Toorak in winning the crown of most millionaires per capita in 2003.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T21:05:56.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
