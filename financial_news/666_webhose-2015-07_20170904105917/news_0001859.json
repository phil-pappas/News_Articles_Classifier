Photo: Eddie Jim\nWhen National Australia Bank chief executive Andrew Thorburn meets investors overseas, he knows exactly what they are going to ask.\n\"It always comes down to three questions,\" he says. \"They ask them in different ways but it comes down to these three questions.\n\"The first is, there's been 24 years of unbroken growth in Australia and is that going to change? And in particular, what's going on with this housing market ?\n\"Number two; what's happening with risk weights, asset quality, regulators and capital?\nAdvertisement \"And the third is; what's happening in technology and are you going to get disrupted?\"\nSo how does Thorburn handle the queries and particularly the questions that obsess Australia – where is the economy and particularly the housing market really heading?\n\"I say two main things. The first is that as banker, you have to build a company for the long run. You have to think of risk, and you have to think of unsustainability.\n\"You do look at the 24 years and think, can it keep going? I think looking at the GDP forecasts, the answer is, yes it can.\"\nThorburn says Australians are not nearly as confident as they should be given Australia's relatively strong fundamentals – he lists relatively low government debt, Australia's AAA credit rating, its proximity to Asia, good education standards and a pretty good unemployment rate.\nTurning to housing, he's more circumspect.\n\"On the housing piece, we do say 'you have to watch it, you have to be careful'. You have to make sure that you've got the right pricing, you've got the right provisions, that your risk models are being fine tuned, that you are using good judgement.\n\"We've invested a lot of money in risk models, and they have been accurate but they've been in benign environments for two decades. So you've got to take Craig's experience, my experience … people who've worked in the business and get the [importance of the] sniff test too.\"\nLast week NAB moved to increase rates on interest-only loans by 29 basis points, which was in part a reaction to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's move to keep the growth in the banks' loans books to 10 per cent per annum but also partly about managing NAB's own loan book.\n\"I'm not pointing directly to the interest-only move as an example of that but that's probably not a bad conclusion to draw, preferencing principal and interest loans over interest-only.\n\"So I do say on the economy and housing, the economy is pretty sustainable but on housing we're being watchful .\"\nThorburn points out that \"really the major issues are in two cities – really, Sydney\", with growth moderate in other capitals.\n\"I think you've got to understand the nuance. You've got to be watchful but not panicking.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/news/economy/worried-about-a-housing-bubble-rba-pushes-review-of-negative-gearing-tax-breaks-for-property-investors-20150715-gicxgt"], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:19:51.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
