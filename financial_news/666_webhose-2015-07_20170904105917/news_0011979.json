The operations are located on the central Queensland coast and have been in operation for 25 years, with a capacity to produce more than 500,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate each year. That capacity is expected to be reduced to about 280,000 tonnes. \"Orica is operating in a highly competitive market in which supply of ammonium nitrate is higher than demand levels, and we need to pursue strategies that secure the long-term viability of the business,\" Mr Buick said.
