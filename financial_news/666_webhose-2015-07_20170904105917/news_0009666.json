We call on community members, parents and learners to take ownership of the assets that government is bringing to their lives and ensure their longevity, and to keep Tshwane connected, moving us to be being the e-Capital of Africa as well,\" said Executive Mayor Kgosientso Ramokgopa. \nAs national policy implementation on 4G spectrum continues to delay the roll-out of high speed mobile broadband services, Wi-Fi has emerged as a key technology. \nExpanding internet access \nData from Tshwane shows that 720 000 unique users have used the service since launch in 2013. That translates to 22 million sessions and in 2015, the service has seen 165 000 users per month. \n\"The Tshwane Free Wi-Fi service not only aligns to the SA Connect objective for 2016 of 'connecting 50% of broadband users at speeds of 10mbps'. It goes further to connect various schools and health facilities through the service, bringing broadband closer to a digitally included citizenry in the City for improved education, economic development and social cohesion,\" said Zahir Khan, chief operating officer of Project Isizwe, which has been tasked with delivering the connectivity. \nWi-Fi is expanding internet access in SA, but projects are patchy and data caps limit true universal access. \nThe City of Cape Town is among several local governments implementing Wi-Fi programmes to deliver internet access and offers residents of Khayelitsha and Mitchells Plain a daily cap of 3GB. \nTshwane offers 250MB though only 7% of users are reported to reach that daily cap. \nThe City of Tshwane has 633 Wi-Fi sites heavily invested in education with 514 at educational institutions. \nWi-Fi in poor communities provide a sustainable way to access internet services, said a key manufacturer. \n\"Wi-Fi installations could mean the difference between no ICT access of any kind and an affordable service as it can be used as a complementary medium to enhance the operators' offering - allowing them to get cost effective access to consumers in these areas,\" Michael Fletcher, sales director sub-Saharan Africa at Ruckus Wireless told Fin24 recently. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T18:08:27.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
