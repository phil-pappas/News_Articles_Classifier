It should be handled by the Europeans,'\" she told reporters. \n\"At the time when I was (France's) finance minister I also supported this viewpoint.\" \nBut, she said, the IMF is involved \"because the IMF was asked by Greece to be involved.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T02:27:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
