Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Pressure is building on the Abbott government to water down its trade agreement with China from the federal opposition, which says the deal does not adequately protect Australian jobs.\nAs the trade union movement prepares for an assault on the signed agreement at next week's Labor National Conference, shadow trade minister Penny Wong said it \"lacks critical safeguards\" and the opposition would seek changes when legislation to enshrine the deal came before Parliament later in 2015.\n\"Labor is committed to maintaining and strengthening safeguards so the FTA's potential can be fully realised,\" she said.\n\"The agreement [Trade Minister] Andrew Robb brought home from Beijing lacks critical safeguards for Australian jobs. For that reason, Labor is exploring ways to ensure labour market testing and skills assessments occur before foreign workers are granted visas to work in Australia.\"\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott and Chinese President Xi Jinping feel the free trade agreement is a good deal for both countries. The issue of the trade agreement and foreign labour is set to boil over at the conference, which is Labor's top decision-making body. Seven trade unions plan to seek a binding commitment that the opposition will run the ruler over the deal and demand changes before voting for it.\nMr Robb said the union campaign was a \"vile xenophobic scare based on falsehoods\".\nThe unions include the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, Bill Shorten's former union the Australian Workers Union, the Transport Workers Union, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, the Textile Clothing and Footwear Union, the Electrical Trades Union and the Maritime Union of Australia.\nMuch worse In a three-page letter sent to Senator Wong this week, the secretaries of the unions say the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement \"includes provisions that make it much worse than the usual FTA\".\n\"In our view, these provisions – around labour mobility, training, worker protections (or lack thereof), corporate rights and more – make the agreement diametrically opposed to core Labor values and, as such, cannot be supported by the ALP in its current form.\"\nThe unions takes particular issue with the Investment Facilitation Agreements, which they say would \"allow the importation of entire workforces for investment projects worth at least $150 million, with a Chinese component of as little as $22.5 million, or 15 per cent\".\nThe letter lists the removal of skills assessment for 10 occupations under the 457 visa program for imported workers, \"including for trades that are potentially lethal if practised by workers who do not meet Australia skills standards, such as electricians\".\nIt lists the removal of labour market testing from the non-concessional 457 visa program for Chinese workers and the inclusion of an Investor State Dispute Settlement mechanism, which give the Chinese the right to legally challenge decisions by the Australian government.\nThe Labor conference motion seeks to bind Labor to oppose any trade deal that includes the above provisions, creating a potentially awkward situation for the federal Labor Party and a lumpy passage for the legislation through the Senate.\nA Greens spokesperson said the party was concerned primarily with the ISDS provision and it agreed the trade deal was \"a much more anti-labour movement agreement than any other agreement\".\nHarboured concerns Independent Senator Nick Xenophon said he harboured concerns about the labour market provisions, as did some other independents.\nThe legislation for the trade deal will be scrutinised by two parliamentary committees before being put to a vote in about October.\nMr Robb said the fears were unfounded. He said 457 visa applicants would need \"to demonstrate to Immigration that they have the necessary skills and qualifications to work safely in Australia\".\nHe said with regard to IFAs on projects worth $150 million or more, \"proponents must be able to demonstrate to Immigration that a skills shortage is hampering progress on a project in order to bring in skilled workers on a temporary basis\".\n\"Australian workers will continue to be given first opportunity. Employers will not be permitted to bring in skilled overseas workers on a temporary basis unless there is evidence of genuine labour market need.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-16T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:11:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
