Louise Kennerley by Phillip Coorey Jacob Greber Frustration with the lack of economic reform is building in the business community, with Tony Shepherd, the head of the Audit Commission, warning of the risk of another wasted three years and former Treasury secretary Martin Parkinson criticising the timidity of current political leaders.\nIn an interview with The Australian Financial Review , Mr Shepherd said the tendency to rule out tax and other budget reform before the next election risked there being no changes in the next term of government as well as the current term.\n\"The fear among the community generally is that we just tread water. We will condemn ourselves to another three years of inactivity and the price will be high,\" Mr Shepherd, a former Business Council of Australia president, said.\n\"We have an election next year. We need to get the community on board to accept the need for general reforms across the whole of the economy. If we don't we are going to languish with low productivity, high unemployment, an ageing population, a budget in deficit, and growing net debt.\"\nMr Shepherd wanted to speak out in support of Treasury secretary John Fraser, who, in a speech on Friday , said Australians had become overly complacent about the need for industrial relations, tax and budget spending reform.\nWhile shrugging off the prospect of immediate dangers posed by China and Greece, Mr Fraser said Australia was at risk of being left behind by Asia over the longer term.\nMr Shepherd said he, like Mr Fraser, was \"not a doomsayer\" but \"unless we reform now we are going to get ourselves into trouble\".\n\"But we've got to lift productivity if we want to grow the economy and lift standards of living.\"\n Seek solutions The concern is being echoed by business and employer groups, welfare organisations and unions, all of which will gather in August for a summit, called the National Reform Summit, to seek solutions to end the policy paralysis .\nWhile Labor has proposed changes to superannuation taxes and left open the prospect of making changes to negative gearing at the next election, it has ruled out touching the GST. The Abbott government has slammed the door on changes to the GST, negative gearing and superannuation and has no appetite for significant industrial relations changes.\nLabor employment spokesman Brendan O'Connor welcomed the summit as needed \"in the absence of the Abbott government's focus upon economic reform\".\n\"The summit is a clear repudiation of the government's approach to reform, a vote of no confidence from representatives of all sectors of the economy in the Abbott government's willingness and ability to tackle Australia's future challenges,\" he said.\nOn Tuesday Mr Fraser's predecessor, Mr Parkinson, will challenge today's political leaders, arguing that those who pretend the country doesn't face challenges or pretend they can be fixed without cost are doomed to failure.\nIn a wide-ranging speech that will reflect on more than three decades as a public servant, Dr Parkinson nominates politicians he regards as a success – in a list that conspicuously doesn't include any recent or current federal leaders.\n\"It is the honesty of communication with voters that has been an important factor in the recent success of politicians like [New Zealand Prime Minister] John Key, Mike Baird, and the past success of Hawke, Keating, Howard, and the state premiers Nick Greiner and Jeff Kennett,\" Dr Parkinson will tell an audience at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane on Tuesday.\nA 'repeated game' In remarks that could be interpreted as critical of the current government, Dr Parkinson will say good leaders recognise that pushing for policy changes is a \"repeated game\".\n\"You may win sometimes but at other times you will not – so at all times you need to be conscious of your professionalism and integrity and recognise there are no shortcuts. Only hard work will get you to the end of the process,\" he will say.\nHe will add that regardless of the size of a leader's organisation, \"pretending problems don't exist and waiting for something to turn up, or pretending that they can be fixed costlessly, does not win a leader trust and respect.\"\nDr Parkinson thinly disguises a comparison with the current political crisis and reform stalemate to what Australia confronted in the 1970s, when \"a sense of what we could have been, but were not, was influencing debates\".\nAt the time, Australia's budget was \"challenged\", national competitiveness \"eroded\", and \"unemployment newly persistent\".\n\"One side of politics was in denial about its failures in government, while the other side promised much and delivered little in terms of righting the economic ship. It was the lost opportunity of the Fraser years,\" he will say in the speech.\nThe National Reform Summit is being co-sponsored by The Australian Financial Review and the The Australian.\nNo surprise Mr O'Connor said it was \"no surprise that concerns over Australia's future challenges are growing under the tenure of the Abbott government, which is significantly lacking political leadership and vision\".\n\"Labor understands that digital disruption is changing the industrial landscape, and science, technology, engineering and maths disciplines will be central to the jobs of the future,\" he said.\nThe government declined to comment on the summit.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey is scheduled to give a speech on the tax white paper process on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:05:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
