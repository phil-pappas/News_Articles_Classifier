That would extend its decline since a June 12 peak to 38 per cent. The gauge's moves since March are tracking those of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1929 when the gauge lost as much as 48 per cent, he said.\nThere's a certain way in which the market unfolds. The only thing the government could do is to postpone it.\nTom DeMark Monday's selloff came after the government's market- boosting efforts, including a selling ban on major shareholders, helped halt a rout that wiped out $US4 trillion in market value in less than a month. While the securities regulator denied speculation that policy makers are withdrawing their support, concern is mounting that the unprecedented intervention to prop up share prices may not be sustainable as the economy slows.\n\"The die has been cast,\" DeMark, 68, the founder of DeMark Analytics in Scottsdale, Arizona, who has spent more than 40 years developing indicators to identify market turning points, said by phone. \"You just cannot manipulate the market. Fundamentals dictate markets.\"\nHe made similar statements in February 2014 about the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, saying that if certain conditions were met, US stocks had reached a point resembling the time before the 1929 market crash. The S&P 500 rallied 8 per cent over the next two months. He said Monday that those conditions didn't materialise at the time.\nThe Shanghai gauge had rebounded 16 per cent from its July 8 low on Friday as officials went to extreme lengths to support stocks. Officials allowed more than 1,400 companies to halt trading, suspended initial public offerings and supplied China Securities Finance Corporation, a state-run financing vehicle with more than $USUS480 billion to intervene in markets.\nThe Shanghai Composite dropped 2.6 per cent at 10:39 a.m. local time on Tuesday.\nChina Securities Finance hasn't pulled support for equities and the government will \"continue efforts to stabilise market and investor sentiment,\" China Securities Regulatory Commission spokesman Zhang Xiaojun said in a statement after the close of trading Monday.\nDeMark said the intervention won't be able to sustain the recent rally.\n\"Markets bottom on bad news, not good news,\" he said. \"You want to have the last seller sell. We got good news at the recent low. The rally is artificial.\"\nDeMark predicted in February 2013 that the Shanghai Composite would retreat, one day before the index began an almost 20 per cent tumble from a nine-month high. Four months later, his call for a bottom in Chinese stocks proved prescient as the gauge hit a four-year low within days and started rising. By early August 2014, DeMark forecast that the Shanghai Composite would fall after rallying about 10 per cent from the June low. Instead, the benchmark kept rising, surging more than 130 per cent through mid-June.\nDeMark said the euphoria and panic in the Chinese market resembled that in the US market in the late 1920s. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed for five straight years in the run-up to the crash of 1929, adding more than 200 per cent. It peaked in September 1929 before plummeting almost 50 per cent in less than three months.\nDeMark said he'll reassess the market once the Shanghai index hits 3200, which would almost wipe out this year's gain. If that level, which is around the 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement from the June peak, fails to hold, the market could \"unravel\" quickly, he said. Some technical analysts use Fibonacci ratios, based on proportions found in nature, to predict stock market levels.\nWhile some investors are concerned that the benchmark has gotten unhinged from the real value of stocks due to government intervention, DeMark said his indicators work best to pick up buy and sell signals when the market is \"manipulated.\" That is because intervention makes the imbalance in the supply and demand of stocks \"more apparent\" and easier to identify, he said.\n\"Lip service and intervention like that -- it's false,\" DeMark said. \"There's a certain way in which the market unfolds. The only thing the government could do is to postpone it.\"\nDeMark has provided consulting to hedge funds including George Soros's Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors. His company makes money by charging traders for access to its indicators. It also sells subscriptions to the indicators on the Bloomberg Professional service.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T06:50:17.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
