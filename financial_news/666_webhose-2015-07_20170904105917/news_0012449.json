At the same time, the economy continues to expand with first-time jobless claims falling to a 42-year low this month and the unemployment rate at its lowest since April 2008.\n“The Fed remains at the gate,” said Richard Schlanger, who helps invest $30 billion in fixed-income securities as vice president at Pioneer Investments in Boston. “They don’t want to show their cards today.”\nSchlanger said he is overweight corporates, but recently has trimmed that position to build up cash.\nThe 10-year note yield rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.27 percent at 2:23 p.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The benchmark 2.125 percent security due in May 2025 fell 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 22/32. The yield climbed three basis points on Tuesday.\nFed Policy “The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment,” the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement. It said that “underutilization of labor resources has diminished,” dropping the modifier “somewhat” to describe the change.\nTraders are pricing in a 39 percent probability that the Fed raises rates at or before the September meeting, based on the assumption that the effective fed funds rate will average 0.375 percent after liftoff. That compared with a 40 percent probability before the Fed announcement.\nThe likelihood of a December rate increase was 70 percent, unchanged.\n“I don’t think it changes the outlook for September, but it makes the next two jobs reports very important,” said Kathy Jones, fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab & Co. “It’s a more balanced assessment of the economy, and” indicates the Fed is “more dependent on job growth.”\nMarket Reaction Treasuries rallied after the Fed downgraded its forecasts for growth and the pace of interest rate increases in 2016 and 2017 after policy makers met June 16-17, even as they indicated a pickup in the economy was keeping it on track for an interest rate-increase this year.\nFed chair Janet Yellen reiterated that view in testimony to Congress July 15-16, and said the increase could come at any meeting of policy makers.\nHigher rates will be appropriate when there has been “further improvement in the labor market” and policy makers become “reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium-term,” Yellen said at her news conference after the statement.\nThe Treasury Department sold $35 billion of five-year notes at a yield of 1.625, compared with an average forecast of 1.637 percent from six of the 22 primary dealers that are obligated to bid at the auctions.\nThe sale rated a ‘4’ by seven of the primary dealers. The characterization is based on a scale of one through five, with one being a failed auction and five judging the results as outstanding.\nThe U.S. also auctioned $15 billion of two-year floating-rate notes at a yield of 0.077 percent, compared with 0.076 percent at the previous auction on June 24. Interest payments rise and fall based on discount rates in auctions of 13-week bills.\nThe U.S. sold $26 million of two-year notes on Tuesday with a yield of 0.69 percent. Treasury will sell $29 billion in seven-year securities Thursday.\nTreasuries with maturities of one year or longer have gained 0.6 percent this year, according to the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index. U.S. debt maturing in 10 years and longer has lost 2 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T21:47:18.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
