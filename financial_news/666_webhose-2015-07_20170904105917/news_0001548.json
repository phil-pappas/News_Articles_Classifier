Photo: Peter Rae\nNews that financial services business IOOF is in hot water over multiple potential alleged breaches of the financial services laws and its regulatory obligations should be a lesson to all investors.\nBusinesses like IOOF offer a variety of services to retail and professional clients including funds management, research, advice and trustee services. Many professional fund managers will use trustee services to outsource complex investment administration tasks around fund accounting, distributions or unit pricing for example. This allows a fund manager to concentrate on the business of investment, while creating profit-spinning but operationally complex sidelines for businesses like IOOF primarily involved in money management themselves.\nPlenty to hide IOOF also has asset management and advisory functions liable to operational errors such as dealing, performance reporting, research, marketing, distribution, institutional business development and the portfolio management functions. The key takeaway for managed funds investors is that there are multiple moving parts to vertically integrated financial services businesses like IOOF. Consequently, operational errors like some of those uncovered by the Fairfax press are not uncommon.\nAdvertisement Usually the operational errors are the result of fat fingers, misunderstandings, untrained staff or other human failings that checks and controls fail to prevent. Other common sources of operational errors include timing issues around late trades, failed settlements, the striking of a unit price, cash distributions, counterparties or third-party services. A simple example is executing a buy order when a sell order is required, in this instance the trade can be reversed, but usually at a loss or fortuitous gain that will have downstream consequences.\nAlternatively a fat finger on a spreadsheet could impact a unit price, buy/sell spread or distribution to investors. Notably these errors can go unnoticed for a long time and it's likely some are never picked up.\nBrushing it under the carpet ASIC's regulatory guides state that if these types of breaches are deemed significant they must be reported to the regulator on a timely basis. Whether a breach is classified significant or not generally comes down to the discretion of a firm's risk and compliance function with agreement from other senior stakeholders.\nThe IOOF story shows how the easy option is to brush these breaches under the carpet on the basis that an uninformed regulator or client are unlikely to ever find out. Generally operational losses are worn by the business line responsible and fortuitous gains on reversing a trade for example are retained. Arguably fortuitous gains should sit or be split with the client (or affected fund), although this is rare in practice and not a regulatory requirement in Australia. Firms will normally work on the principle that in the event of an error then affected clients must be put back in the position (financial or otherwise) they would have been but for the error.\nFoolish takeaway IOOF has also been accused of far more serious issues than failing to report operational breaches of its regulatory obligations. However, for investors in collective investment schemes there are some key takeaways:\nCheck distributions like you would check a credit card statement to make sure they're in line with what you expect Make sure you're comfortable with the integrity of your managed funds services provider as issues like unit pricing or buy/sell spread errors are impossible to pick-up externally Query anything unusual Consider the impact of the various fees on your investment returns Best of all educate yourself to take control of your investments without worrying about the potential incompetence of financial services providers. This will set you free from annual management fees and give you an instant head start in creating lasting wealth for you and your family.\nInvestors, don't miss out: Low interest rates mean dividend-paying shares are very attractive, compared to term deposits.
