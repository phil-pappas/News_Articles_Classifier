The shares are down 40 percent in July, after falling every month since December, as a group calling itself Iceberg Research published criticism of the firm’s accounting. Noble has rejected the criticism and hired PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP this month to review its practices.\nA 12 percent drop yesterday prompted the Singapore Stock Exchange to ask if Noble knew of any reason for the move and warn investors to exercise care when trading the shares. The bourse said the stock has seen three instances of “unusual trading activities” in the past six months.\n“Some people may be spooked by the ‘Trade With Caution’ notice,” said Carey Wong, an analyst with Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. There is also negative sentiment about commodity stocks, he said.\nA representative of Noble Group said the company couldn’t comment.\nThe Bloomberg Commodity Index lost 9.8 percent in July, the most since September 2011, after sinking to a 13-year low.\nNoble has bought back its stock at least 11 times since last month and built up a 2.8 percent stake from zero. Two weeks before reporting earnings, companies listed in Singapore aren’t allowed to repurchase their shares , according to Singapore exchange rules, the Business Times reported Thursday.
