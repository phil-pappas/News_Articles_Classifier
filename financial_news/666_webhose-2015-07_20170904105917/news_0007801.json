Photo: Reuters\nIt might seem pedantic, but there's a big difference between what was the Greek crisis and what's now Greece's crisis.\nWhen Greece's massive debt hit the fan five years ago as the result of dumb bankers being blind to industrial-scale tax evasion, grandiose government spending and insanely indulgent social security topped by widespread rorting, it was the Greek crisis that quickly morphed into the PIGS or PIIGS crisis – Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain.\nIn any event, there's a strong case made for Greece being better off by in effect declaring bankruptcy and leaving the euro zone.\nWhen markets were panicking then, most of the Greek debt was owed to banks. The possibility of Greek default threatened Europe's banks with a contagion effect that would have spread through the world.\nAs Band-Aids were applied to Athens and various half-hearted promises were made about reform, there were plenty of commentators suggesting that Greece's debt could not be fixed. Even with bond holders taking a sharp haircut, the debt was simply too large for the little Greek economy to work its way out from under – and that was without the impact of greater austerity.\nBut the refinancing and emergency funds weren't really about solving the Greek debt problem. They were about kicking the Greek can down the road until the threat of contagion was contained, until the other PIIGS members were stabilised, and most of the Greek debt was transferred from banks that couldn't handle the loss to institutions that could.\nFive years later, it is primarily Greece's crisis, rather than the Greek crisis. There are still concerns of course – markets are all interconnected and don't like uncertainty, fear is a reason for international investors to seek what they consider is relative safety – but it's now Greece that is doomed to suffer most of the pain whatever deal is done or not done in Brussels.\nIt is a big, colourful story that is getting disproportionate play here, partly because of the large Greek population in Australia, partly because the idea of Western country's banks being closed and cash rationed is rather frightening. Barring some institutional catastrophe, there are almost no economic links between Australia and Greece that matter.\nIndeed, much of the story is being covered from the social and political angles rather than the economic. The protests, the genuine tales of people suffering a slide back to Second World status, the dramatic politics make good television. And in some quarters, the idea of a brave left-wing government taking on the evil capitalists stirs hearts.\nBut it also lacks perspective. Democracy certainly is at work in Greece, but that doesn't guarantee Greeks have a government that offers anything like a reasonable plan for a sustainable future. This is a mob that's happy to cosy up to Putin, for heaven's sake.\nOne of the more reasonable insights I've come across was in a media release from the Warwick Business School promoting one of its staff, Hari Tsoukas, a Professor of Organisational Studies. He stood for the To Potami party in the recent Greek elections and is a co-editor of From Stagnation to Forced Adjustment: Reforms in Greece, 1974-2010 (Columbia University Press, 2012).\nProfessor Hari Tsoukas said: \"The strong rejection of the bailout proposal creates less room for compromise for Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. The left in his party will be emboldened to become even more intransigent.\n\"While both creditors and Syriza talk about 'reforms' they do not mean the same thing. Creditors push for market liberalisation and deep state reform, while Syriza is bent on offering protectionism, versions of clientelism, and state expansion. Moreover, creditors demand reform in exchange for debt relief, while Tsipras demands debt relief in exchange for reform. It is a classic dilemma of 'who-goes-first' between parties that do not trust each other.\n\"A possible way out would be for Tsipras to do a radical reshuffle to signal his commitment to reform. Dropping his coalition partner ANEL (a populist right-wing party) for centrists and social-democratic MPs would be such a move.\n\"The referendum has pushed Greece nearer Grexit. It has created a dynamic of defying creditors within Syriza, from which Tsipras will find it difficult to disengage.\n\"In a country where national pride is important, people were moved by the way Tsipras stood up to the creditors. However, they may be surprised to find that national dignity is not so much served by confrontation and protests at rallies but by pragmatically building alliances, searching for compromises, and making credible commitments.\"\nBut that is mainly Greece's problem now.\nIn any event, there's a strong case made for Greece being better off by in effect declaring bankruptcy and leaving the euro zone. Germany has gained from a euro that is weaker for the presence of fringe countries, but Greece has suffered from a euro that is stronger for the presence of Germany and its northern neighbours.\nHowever Syriza wants to paint it and whoever it wants to try to blame, Greece returning to its pre-euro status will hurt. There will be more austerity with or without European debt deals.\nAnd does anyone think the hard left is going to be able to manage that well? Greece's colourful and tragic political history looks set for more such chapters.\nMichael Pascoe is a BusinessDay contributing editor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T21:51:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
