The news came to light after photos of Disick spending time with an old flame and celeb stylist, Chloe Bartoli, while in Monte Carlo, Monaco surfaced. \nKardashian reportedly broke up with Disick over the Fourth of July holiday weekend after she saw the publicized photos. People magazine reports Kardashian decided to end things with Disick, who has publicly struggled with alcohol and substance abuse on the E! reality show “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” for the sake of her children. \nA “Kardashian source” told the magazine, “[Kourtney] was over dealing with his constant lies and addictions. It was becoming a poor environment for the kids to be raised in, and she refused to let that be the case.” \nRead: Ben Affleck Net Worth Vs. Jennifer Garner Net Worth: Who Wins Out After the Divorce? Palimony Could Shrink Kourtney Kardashian’s Net Worth \nKardashian and Disick began dating in 2006 and have three children together — 5-year-old Mason, 2-year-old Penelope and 6-month-old Reign. The two were never married, but for a couple who has long shared the spotlight, family and finances, a breakup can still have far-reaching financial effects on their net worths. \nThanks to her appearance on “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” as well as its other spinoffs, Kardashian has earned fame and fortune. A lot of her money comes from endorsements deals and other business endeavors, including clothing lines designed with her sisters. Currently, Kourtney Kardashian’s net worth is $25 million, according to CelebrityNetWorth. \nLike Kardashian, Disick also comes from a rich family. CelebrityNetWorth states Disick’s now-deceased parents had a net worth of around $25 million. Scott Disick’s net worth is $12 million, and he also earns paychecks for making club appearances and other paid publicity. \nBecause Kardashian and Disick were never married, they won’t have to deal with the financial hassle of a divorce — but the length of their relationship could complicate their split. Though California does not recognize common law marriages, Disick often referred to Kardashian as his “wife,” reports Radar Online. And if Kardashian had made agreements about financially supporting Disick, this could possibly fall under California palimony laws. \nRadar Online reports a source said, “There are big concerns that Scott is going to go after Kourtney’s fortune by seeking alimony and child support.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T23:41:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
