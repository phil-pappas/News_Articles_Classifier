The western Greek region of Dytiki Ellada isn't far behind, with a long-term unemployment share of 76.7pc . \nLong-term unemployment is damaging for several reasons. As researchers at the London School of Economics put it: \nFirst, it tends to have detrimental effects on the individuals involved. Workers’ human capital (whether actual or perceived by employers) may deteriorate during a spell of unemployment, and the time devoted to job search typically declines. Both factors imply that the chances of leaving unemployment fall the longer it goes on. More generally, long-term unemployment adversely affects people’s mental and physical wellbeing and it is one of the most significant causes of poverty for their households. \nOver time, some of these people may drop out of the workforce altogether. \nMark Carney , the Governor of the Bank of England, has warned of the dangers of long-term unemployment. He told an audience in Davos this year : \nWhen people are unemployed for too long, they lose their skills, so called hysteresis. There has been a race against hysteresis. In the UK, we created over 600,000 jobs in the last year. Wages are starting to pick up, and we're winning that race. \nUnemployed Greeks wait in a long queue to collect benefit payments in Athens (Photo: AP) \nThe crisis may have forced a generation of workers out of employment forever. \nAccording to the data, seven out of the ten EU regions with highest share of long term unemployment are in Greece . The regions where the share of long-term unemployed is lowest are mostly in Sweden. Övre Norrland has the lowest share. According to Eurostat, just 14.8pc of people who are out of work in the northern Swedish region have been out of work for more than a year. \nThe statistics on long-term unemployment are grim throughout Europe. According to Eurostat, in a third of EU regions , the majority of the unemployed had been out of work for at least a year. \nThe share stood at 49.3pc on average in the EU in 2014, compared with 47.2pc in 2013. \nYouth unemployment is Europe's other problem, although rates have fallen over the past year. \nSpain continues to have the highest youth unemployment rate, at 53.2pc , although this is down from 55.5pc in 2013. Youth unemployment in Greece stood at 52.4pc in 2014, down from 58.3pc in 2013. \nIpeiros , in north west Greece , has the highest rate of youth unemployment, at 69.8pc. The European Commission has described Ipeiros as one of Greece's less-developed regions, with one of the lowest figures for per capita gross national product (GNP). \nGreece had the highest unemployment in Europe last year, at 26.5pc , although six out of the ten EU regions with the highest joblessness were in Spain . Almost 35pc of people living in Andalucia are unemployed, according to the data. Nine out of the ten regions with the lowest overall unemployment rate can be found in Denmark, although Prague in the Czech Republic takes the overall crown, with an unemployment rate of just 2.5pc. By comparison, London's unemployment rate averaged 6.9pc last year. \nThe situation is also bleak for those who have managed to stay in work. Greece has the highest rate of underemployment in Europe. A staggering 72.1pc of all part-time workers wanted to work more hours in 2014, compared with 65.9pc in Cyprus , 22.4pc in the UK, and the EU average of 22.2pc. Eurostat noted that underemployed part-time workers were predominantly women in every country in the EU except Romania and Slovakia .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T11:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T12:27:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
