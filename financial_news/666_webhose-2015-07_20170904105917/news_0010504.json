A daily close above the 38.2% Fibonacci expansion at 1.1016 exposes the 23.6% level at 1.1092. Alternatively, a push below the 50% Fib at 1.0955 opens the door for a challenge of the 61.8% expansion at 1. 0894. Prices are wedged too closely between near-term support and resistance levels to justify taking a trade in line with our long-term outlook from a risk/reward perspective. With that in mind, we will continue to stand aside until a more attractive opportunity presents itself.
