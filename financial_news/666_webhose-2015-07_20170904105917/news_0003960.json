Analysts have speculated that Fishman could consider an acquisition to keep pace, possibly of Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. Fishman said for the first time Tuesday that he weighed the economics of a possible Chubb deal.\n“The return just didn’t measure up,” Fishman said. Travelers saw only a “modest opportunity to improve the performance of an already high-performing company,” the CEO said.\nFishman ran Travelers when it was still a part of Citigroup Inc. under CEO Sanford “Sandy” Weill. He left the post in 2001 to run St. Paul Cos., then engineered a merger three years later with his former insurer that was valued at more than $15 billion.\nStock Issuance He subsequently made smaller transactions to expand in Canada and Brazil. So far, he has sat out during the most recent wave of dealmaking.\nThe CEO said Tuesday there’s “no question” that the company would be prepared to issue stock for the right deal after years of focusing on share repurchases. He also said he believes that credit-rating firms would be comfortable with his New York-based company taking on more debt if it has a plan to reduce leverage.\nTravelers climbed 0.5 percent to $103.15 at 10:15 a.m. in New York, the fifth-highest gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Hartford, based in the Connecticut city of the same name, advanced 1.6 percent.\nFishman posted second-quarter profit Tuesday that increased 19 percent and beat analysts’ estimates as natural-disaster costs dropped . He said that while he’d welcome a deal, he’s not rushing into one.\n“We have the luxury of a plan A that sets a very high bar,” Fishman said. That’s “a strategy that comes from having highly differentiated competitive advantages, and highly successful business franchises with industry-leading product breadth.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T17:46:07.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
