AP The hardline stance taken by Greece's creditors reflects the growing strength of the hawkish camp within European politics. This camp – which consists of Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, the Baltic countries, Spain, Portugal and Slovakia – believes that Athens can not be trusted to introduce reforms, particularly since Tsipras campaigned so strongly against them in the lead-up to the country's July 5 referendum.\nAs a result, they wanted Greece to temporarily leave the eurozone – a \"Grexit\" – or else to punish Tsipras for his previous intransigence.\nAgainst them were ranged the less-numerous doves: France, Italy and the Cypriots. This camp worried about the costs of a Grexit and warned that, if Greece were to return to the drachma, the country would never repay its debts.\nFrench President Francois Hollande argued strongly in favour of an agreement that would avoid Greece's departure from the eurozone.\n For his part, Tsipras himself was concerned to save the Greek banks, which would collapse without the emergency liquidity provided by the European Central Bank.\nHigh level of supervision The conditions that Tsipras has now agreed to go beyond anything on the table in negotiations between Brussels and Athens in recent months and well beyond the sales tax hikes and pension reforms that Greece's creditors – the ECB, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund – were demanding as late as last week, which were rejected by Greek voters at the July 5 referendum.\nIn order to reassure the hawks that Greece's €50 billion privatisation program will be conducted efficiently, Tsipras has agreed to put the state-owned assets into a special fund (although as a concession to Greece, the fund will now be based in Athens, rather than Luxembourg, as suggested by Germany).\nThe proceeds from the sell-off will be used to recapitalise Greek banks and repay the country's debts, with any leftover funds being used for fresh investment in the country.\nTsipras has also been forced to accept a high level of supervision by the country's creditors – formerly known as the \"troika\" and now referred to as the \"institutions\" – as well as having Brussels oversee his overhaul of the country's public administration.\nA further defeat for Tsipras is his failure to get a promise of debt relief, with Germany saying that consideration of this issue will only take place after Athens demonstrates it is making headway in implementing reforms.\nAnd even though the hawks and the doves have come to an uneasy compromise on the issue of Greece, there is still room for yet another unexpected plot twist in this long-running tragedy.\nNot only must the new agreement get approval from the Parliament in Athens, but also from German, Dutch and Finnish legislators, who show little inclination for generosity towards Athens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T05:08:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
