For years, CME has said options are complicated, so it’s tough to shift the business over to computer screens -- explaining why it still lets humans gather together in person.\nOn Thursday, CME spent time during its quarterly conference call highlighting the growth of electronic options trading on its exchanges. “Electronic Options Growth Leads to Deeper, More Diverse Markets” a slide declared in its presentation. CME touted the fact that 53 percent of its options business was conducted on computers in June, up from 50 percent in June 2014.\n“What’s key for us is that we don’t force the markets to move,” John Pietrowicz, CME’s chief financial officer, said on the conference call. “We want the market to determine it.”\nFor now, CME plans to keep the options pits open.\n“We have no conversations on the table whatsoever to make changes on those platforms today,” Chairman Terry Duffy said Thursday in an interview. While products including energy options are more suitable for electronic trading, others, like eurodollars, still need open-outcry trading, he added.\nCME generates more than $100 million in revenue from its options pits a year. That compares with total revenue of $3.1 billion at the company in 2014.\n“The pits remain viable for the options,” Phupinder Gill, chief executive officer of CME, said on the conference call with analysts.\n“The general trend is we’re going to go closer and closer to 100 percent electronic until there’s an event that forces us to reconsider whether we want to put all our eggs in one basket,” said Steven Todd, an associate professor of finance at Loyola University’s Quinlan School of Business in Chicago. Certain investors want the additional service of the trading pits for the transactions that are more challenging, Todd said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T21:27:43.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
