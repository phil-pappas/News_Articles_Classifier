By Jack Tang | Fool.co.uk â€“ 7 hours ago 432.20 +6.90 \nUK motor insurers have seen their profitability squeezed in recent years, as intense competition led to falling insurance premiums. Over the past 20 years, the industry as a whole made an underwriting loss in every year except 2013 and 2014. \nBut there are early signs that motor insurance premiums, which have been falling for three consecutive years, are beginning to rise again. Accounting firm Ernst & Young said motor insurance rates had risen by 2% on the previous year in the first quarter of 2015. Claims inflation also appears to be slowing slightly, having dropped 0.1 percentage points to 4.3% in 2015. \nIt also appears that the rise in insurance premiums is being sustained, as Confused.com and consultancy firm Towers Watson found average premiums rose 1.5% in the second quarter of 2015. Thus, premiums have been steadily increasing over the past year. \nLast week's budget saw Chancellor George Osborne raise Insurance Premium Tax (IPT) from 6% to 9.5%, starting from 1 November 2015. Although insurers are likely to pass on much of the added cost to policyholders, it could lead to more aggressive price competition in the industry and lead to more people choosing not to take out insurance. In a soft insurance market, insurers may not be prepared to raise premiums for fear of losing customers; which could lead to premiums falling again. \nOn a brighter note, the chancellor also announced tighter regulation on claims management companies, and in particular tackle organised insurance fraud. Whilst the overall effect of the budget on the insurance industry is uncertain; motor insurance premiums should continue to rise as unprofitable insurers withdraw capacity from the market, and higher premiums are being passed onto consumers. \nAdmiral Group (LSE: ADM), Direct Line (LSE: DLG), Aviva (LSE: AV) and RSA Insurance Group (LSE: RSA) are some of the UK's largest motor insurers. The introduction of higher solvency requirements and increased regulation on the industry have depressed the valuation of these shares. But, with signs that motor insurance premiums are sustaining rate increases, profitability should improve from here. \nAdmiral Group, which most resembles a car insurance pure play, should gain the most from higher premiums. Its industry leading combined ratios of 78.5% for UK car insurance gives it a strong competitive advantage. The company also has a growing price comparison websites business, which is expanding in France, Spain and the US. After seeing EPS fall 2% to 103 pence in 2014, analysts expect earnings will fall by another 10% in 2015 to 92.3 pence, which gives its shares a forward P/E of 15.5. But, these estimates may seem a little pessimistic, given the sustained rise in premium rates. \nValuations for Aviva and RSA are much cheaper, with their shares trading at forward P/E ratios of 10.8 and 14.3, respectively. But, their diversification will mean they will have less to benefit from higher premium rates. \nDirect Line, which is the UK's largest private motor insurer, is especially attractive on expectations of greater shareholder returns. The company pays a regular dividend of 13.2 pence per share, which equates to a 4.0% yield; but analysts expect it to pay special dividends of around 33.5 pence, which boosts its total dividend yield to 13.8%. On top of this, analysts expect underlying EPS will rise 12% to 28.8 pence in 2015, which gives it a forward P/E of 12.5. \nToo much uncertainty? \nIf you are looking for reliable income-generating opportunities, The Motley Fool has a free special report that lists alternatives more aligned with your investing strategy: \"The Fool's Five Shares To Retire On\" .
