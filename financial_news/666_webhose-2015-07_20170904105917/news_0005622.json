The timing of the maiden flight will be announced after that, he added.\nThe spokesman did not give a reason for the delay but people familiar with the matter had told Reuters in May there were delays in the final assembly process.\nThe sources had also said the maiden flight had been postponed to the first half of 2016, with deliveries scheduled for 2018 slipping to as late as 2020.\nFurther delays will make it harder for the plane to make an impact beyond its home market, industry analysts say.
