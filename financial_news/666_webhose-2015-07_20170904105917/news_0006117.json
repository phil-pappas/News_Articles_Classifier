Louise Kennerley Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Simon Evans There is $7 billion of \"dry powder\" sitting in private equity and venture capital funds across Australia – and it's proving a headache as private equity firms hunt for the right acquisitions to invest the vast amounts that have already been raised.\nThe funds have come from outside investors busting to extract a better return as interest rates sit at 60-year lows, and from firms themselves pocketing the proceeds of a rush of 12 public floats in 2014 in what was the busiest year for 14 years for private equity exits via initial public offerings, as businesses such as Healthscope and Sorbent toilet paper maker Asaleo Care came onto the stock exchange.\nBut investing this \"undeployed capital\" – as it is known in the sector – is not easy.\nA range of dynamics is at work. There is some nervousness about where the economy is headed, which is bringing some extra caution and restraint. There is also fierce competition as funds battle hard when good businesses are put on the market in higher-growth sectors such as healthcare and financial services. And high price tags are being demanded by sellers in a low-rate environment where they are looking to maximise their returns from selling their life's work after building up a business.\nYou get what you pay for Chris Hadley, the managing director of Quadrant Private Equity, has been in the private equity industry in Australia for more than two decades and been through several cycles. Quadrant has bought 56 businesses since the mid-1990s and sold out of 44. It snapped up VIP Petfoods for $410 million in June in a sale process from long-time owners Tony and Christina Quinn, who, while selling the Queensland-based business, are still retaining a meaningful stake.\nHadley says you get what you pay for, and those who are penny-pinching and seeking assets for a bargain-basement price will come away disappointed, and most likely end up buying inferior assets without much upside. He says it is competitive out there among private equity funds and other buyers.\n\"We're always happy to pay a fair price for a good business,\" Hadley says.\"It's what you do with the business that's more important.\"\n Quadrant has clear plans to accelerate growth at VIP Petfoods, a major player in the fresh chilled pet food market, with six hi-tech manufacturing plants and a growing overseas business. The underlying fundamentals are strong, as pet owners spend more and more on their beloved pets in a pet food industry headed toward $3 billion in total sales.\nHadley says VIP Petfoods has built up a strong market position and been investing strongly in the business. It's no fly-by-night operation, having been founded in 1994, and it's now ready for the next leg of growth.\n\"These are state-of-the-art plants; they have a very good market position.\"\nQuadrant's fund raisings have been getting progressively larger over the past 20 years. Its latest fund is $850 million in size.\nCaution about the economy The overarching body for private equity firms, the Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AVCAL), says there is some anxiousness about the economic outlook and where the economy is headed. Even Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens raised the prospect on July 22 that perhaps Australia might need to adjust to a \"new normal\" where annual trend growth is lower than the 3.0 to 3.25 per cent that most experts assumed it would keep running at.\nAVCAL chief executive Yasser El-Ansary says there is around $7 billion in capital among funds that is uninvested, but points out there is $25 billion at work that has been injected into Australian businesses over the past few years. Still, he concedes caution about the economy and where it is headed over the next three to five years is a consideration holding some funds back.\n\"The three-to-five-year horizon is quite uncertain,\" Mr El-Ansary says. \"It's about the confidence to make the call and pull the trigger and do the deal.\"\nThe economic outlook is an important factor in making the decision to buy, and use those funds that have been raised, he said.\n\"That pool of capital is waiting for the right opportunities to emerge\".\nGrowth ahead in healthcare and financial services The giant United States private equity firm KKR, which entered the Australian market in 2006, says the historically low interest rates in Australia haven't changed its investment approach, but it does have an impact on valuations.\nOne of KKR Australia's directors, Ed Bostock, says \"Regardless of the market environment, KKR assesses every opportunity on its merits. Interest rates don't determine our opportunity set, though they can indirectly impact the valuations to the business that we can ascribe.\"\nKKR sees solid growth ahead in two sectors in particular: healthcare and financial services.\n\"Within the context of the broader macro environment we see any number of sectors that have a bright outlook, such as healthcare and financial services.\"\nKKR has already invested in the healthcare sector and owns 46 per cent of Australia's largest provider of radiotherapy services, GenesisCare, with management holding 13 per cent and about 150 doctors owning the remainder.\nHealthcare is where much of the action is because of the long-term demographics as Australia's population ages, and healthcare spending consistently grows at an annualised rate of more than 8 per cent.\nPrivate equity firm Archer Capital owns Healthe Care, a company that is the third-largest private hospital group with 17 hospitals and 1500 beds, and revenues of $500 million-plus. Archer hired investment bank Luminis Partners in June to consider sale options for Healthe Care, which may include a trade sale or an initial public offering. Another group, Evolution Healthcare, which runs 11 hospitals, is undergoing a recapitalisation process to bolster its firepower, and may be a potential buyer.\nTiming is everything for private equity. KKR has owned mine site trucking company BIS Industries for nine years and it's having a tough time as the mining industry contracts. About 18 months ago KKR tested the market's appetite for a potential $500 million-plus initial public offering of Bis, but poor sentiment meant the offer was put on the backburner.\nBIS is now going through a difficult refinancing of its debt. Contrast that with what happened in 2006 when KKR originally acquired the broader BIS Cleanaway business from Brambles for $1.83 billion, in what was its first major investment in the Australian market.\nIn 2007, KKR sold the Cleanaway part of the business to Transpacific for $1.25 billion in what was a very short time of ownership.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/103351169357344338991", "https://twitter.com/SimonMEvans"], "published": "2015-07-24T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T20:09:11.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
