It’s not just same-sex couples who might see changes to their eligibility; it also could be heterosexual unmarried couples and those in civil unions and common law marriages.\nIt’s employers who decide what employee benefits are available to spouses and/or significant others. The Supreme Court case, Obergefell v. Hodges , didn’t address employee benefits, but it did change the definition of marriage. “The question will be–are we going to continue domestic partner benefits or expand the definition of spouse?” says J. D. Piro who leads the health law group at Aon Aon Hewitt, adding, “Every employer will be looking at that decision.”\nWhen employers started offering domestic partner benefits to same-sex partners, it was because they couldn’t get married. Many employers extended those benefits to opposite-sex cohabiting couples too. Of large employers, 77% offer domestic partner benefits to same-sex couples, and 51% offer benefits to opposite-sex couples , according to Aon Hewitt. Here’s a breakdown, courtesy of Aon Hewitt, showing the types of domestic partner medical coverage available to employees at 1,000 large employers:\nEmployers take note: opposite-sex unmarried couples make up a growing part of the workforce. In 2014, there were 7.9 million heterosexual cohabiting couples, up from 5 million in 2006 , according to Susan Brown, a demographer at Bowling Green State University . And they’re not just Millennials on the verge of marrying: 57% of them are ages 30 to 64.\nAs same-sex couples have won the right to marry, some employers (like Verizon) are dropping their same-sex only domestic partner coverage. The thinking is these employees can get married and get benefits as a spouse. But other employers (like Google Google ) are maintaining domestic partner health coverage that is available to same-sex and heterosexual couples alike.\nThe primary reason to offer employee benefits is to attract and retain talent. For employers who have already expanded the definition of spouse to include same-sex spouses in the states that permitted gay marriage before the recent Court decision, they will probably just expand it in the rest of the states that now have to allow same-sex marriage. For employers that didn’t expand the definition of spouse and don’t offer domestic partner benefits, they’ll have to make a decision whether to do that. If they decide not to offer same-sex spousal coverage, they’ll be subject to discrimination lawsuits in the states that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, Piro says.\nEmployers who cover only same-sex unmarried partners might deem it most fair to require those employees to marry in order to retain their benefits, says Todd Solomon, an employee benefits lawyer with McDermott Will & Emery in Chicago. But employers shouldn’t rush to this decision, he says. It might not be desirable to “force” an employee to take the public step of marriage, given that a gay or lesbian employee can still legally be fired in many states. Also, many of these employees have arranged their financial and legal affairs, assuming they wouldn’t be able to marry.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonforb.es%2F1LGkEPb&text=77%25%20of%20large%20employers%20offer%20domestic%20partner%20benefits%20to%20same-sex%20couples%2C%2051%25%20offer%20benefits%20to%20opposite-sex%20couples", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonforb.es%2F1LGkEPb&text=In%202014%2C%20there%20were%207.9%20million%20heterosexual%20cohabiting%20couples%2C%20up%20from%205%20million%20in%202006."], "published": "2015-07-01T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T02:22:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
