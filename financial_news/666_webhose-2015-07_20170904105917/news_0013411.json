We were selling one Green Frog to every 10 Red Frogs,” he said.\nSales of Spearmint Leaves have been in decline, says Allen’s.

Spearmint leaves were a favourite of mine and, of course, the Killer Python was too.”\nKiller Pythons have already been downsized by the confectionery giant, wriggling down from 47g to 24g. Red Skins will also be downsized from 15g to 11g.\nThe spokesman said the move was “aimed at bringing our confectionery serves down to appropriate portion sizes”.\nA number of other famous lollies, including cars, snakes and Chico Babies, have also been tinkered with to remove artificial colour and gelatine.\nSnakes and cars have had blue colour changed to purple.\nGoing, gone. Source: HeraldSun\n“We may be able to bring them back into the fold when we can source a non-artificial shade of blue that can be used across our entire range, but in the meantime we’ve replaced it with a rich non-artificial purple colour, which tastes exactly the same,” the spokesman said.\nFormer Melbourne wholesale confectionery distributor Craig Teal slammed the changes as “horrendous”.\n“It is just spin and trying to be doing the right thing in the community’s eyes,” he said.\n“To change the colour seems superfluous because the lolly is still going to be full of sugar.”\namanda.horswill@news.com.au\nOriginally published as Disaster!
