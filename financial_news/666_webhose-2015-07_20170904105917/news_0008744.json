Some investors expect it to signal that rates will rise as soon as September, while others say slowing growth in China and persistently weak commodity prices will see the central bank hold off until next year.\n\"We're in for a little bit of a wait now that we have just over 24 hours to go until the Fed,\" BMO Capital Markets' European head of FX strategy, Stephen Gallo, said.\n\"Yesterday's move in the dollar is a symptom of people not wanting to be over-exposed to the dollar and the fact that the Fed might not be as hawkish... The long dollar trade is to a degree a risk-on trade.\"\nThe dollar index, which tracks the U.S. unit against a basket of six major rivals, rose 0.3 percent to 96.774, after falling to a two-week low of 96.288 on Monday. Against the euro, it was 0.3 percent up at $1.1059.\n\"We think FOMC will surprise on the hawkish side, provided a highly conditional lean to a 2015 lift-off is viewed as hawkish,\" CitiFX's global head of G10 FX strategy, Steven Englander, wrote in a note to clients.\nAfter this week's Fed meeting, the next big event for the dollar will be second-quarter U.S. gross domestic product data on Thursday. The economy is seen returning to growth after a contraction in a weather-hit first three months.\nWith UK growth data due at 0830 GMT, sterling edged down 0.2 percent to $1.5532.
