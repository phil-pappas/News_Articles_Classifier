NPS is not obligated to follow KCGS’s recommendation, Chi said.\nThe advice comes ahead of NPS’s decision on what may turn into the biggest proxy fight Korea has ever seen. The contest pits billionaire activist Paul Elliott Singer against the founding family of the country’s largest conglomerate, Samsung Group, amid a leadership transition. The state-run pension fund’s actions will be a key to the outcome as it may have the swing vote with its 10.15 percent stake in Samsung C&T.\nIn May, Samsung’s de facto holding company Cheil announced that it would acquire Samsung C&T. The deal would solidify the 47-year-old Lee Jae Yong’s control over Samsung Group, including the crown jewel, Samsung Electronics Co. C&T also owns about $10 billion of group company shares, making it a vital asset to Lee and his siblings who control Cheil.\nSinger took a stake in Samsung C&T and has argued that the all-stock takeover offer “significantly undervalues” the target’s worth. The proposed deal would pass 7.8 trillion won ($6.8 billion) of C&T book value to Cheil without compensation, according to Elliott.\nNPS, which has more than $430 billion in assets and is overseen by the nation’s health ministry, has declined to comment on how it will vote.", "external_links": ["http://www.cgs.or.kr/ECGS_main.asp\\", "http://fund.nps.or.kr/jsppage/fund/mcs_e/mcs_e_01.jsp\\"], "published": "2015-07-08T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T05:40:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
