Lloyds Sets Aside Extra £1.4bn For PPI Payouts By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 1 minute 23 seconds ago View Photo \n\nLloyds Banking Group is setting aside another £1.4bn to deal with claims over the mis-selling of Payment Protection Insurance. \nHowever, the partly taxpayer-owned bank has seen profits increase by 38% to £1.2bn in the first six months of 2015. \nThe PPI scandal continues to haunt the lender - and now, its total provision for mis-selling claims has reached £13.4bn, with £2.2bn in that fund unutilised. \nLloyds described the additional provision as \"disappointing\", adding: \"It mostly reflects higher than expected reactive complaints with higher associated redress.\" \nAccording to its half-year results, 98% of customers affected by PPI mis-selling in the past have been contacted by Lloyds as part of its past business review - with any remaining customers to be sent letters by the end of the year. \nAnnouncing that the group will make an interim divident payment of 0.75p per share, chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio added: \"Today’s results demonstrate the strong progress we have made in the first half of the year. \n\"We remain focused on our aim to become the best bank for customers and shareholders while at the same time supporting the UK economy.\" \nThe Treasury's stake in Lloyds has shrunk to less than 15% in recent months. \nLloyds' figures also reveal a £660m charge relating to the disposal of TSB, which is being bought by Spain's Banco de Sabadell. \nIn June, Lloyds was fined £117m by the Financial Conduct Authority - after the regulator uncovered several examples where customers making PPI mis-selling claims were poorly treated. \nSome cases saw complaint handlers reject customers' claims on the basis that the sales process used was robust, even when this wasn't the case. \nOther customers were told their grievance had been \"fully investigated\" with \"appropriate weight and balanced consideration\" given to all available evidence, when in reality this wasn't the case. \nMore follows...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T09:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T09:43:04.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
