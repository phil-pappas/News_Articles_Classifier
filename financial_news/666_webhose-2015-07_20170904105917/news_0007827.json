The automaker also faces rapidly shifting tastes among Chinese consumers, now showing a pronounced preference for small, affordable sport-utility vehicles.\n\"SUVs and MPVs (multi-purpose vehicles) are growing fast but that growth was offset by the segment shift - sales slowing in the sedan and mini-commercial vehicle market,\" GM spokeswoman Irene Shen said.\nIn the first six months of the year, GM sold 1.72 million cars, up 4.4 percent from a year earlier.\nFor the market overall, sales for January to May rose only 2.1 percent from a year earlier, giving 2015 the slowest start since 2012, according to the most recent statistics available from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).\nCAAM is due to report June sales for the overall market on Friday.
