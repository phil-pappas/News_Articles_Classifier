JCB's Long-Term FCRs remain constrained by the ratings assigned to the sovereign ('BB-'/'B'/'Stable'). The Outlook for JCB's FCRs remains at 'Stable', in line with the Outlook for Jordan's Sovereign FCRs. This reflects JCB's incorporation and base of operations in Jordan, as well as its exposure to Jordanian sovereign debt. A possible downgrade of the sovereign or any improvement in Jordan's creditworthiness would have a corresponding effect on JCB's FCRs. In view of the high probability of support from the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ), as well as from the shareholders, in the event of financial distress, the Support Level of '3' is maintained.\n\nThe Financial Strength Rating (FSR) is affirmed at 'BB', underscored by the substantial decrease in non-performing loans (NPLs) and the NPL ratio, the reduced level of unprovided NPLs to free capital, and the improved Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR). The FSR is also underpinned by the Bank's ongoing ample liquidity and growing customer deposit franchise, and by the improvement in net profit and return on average assets (ROAA). The FSR is constrained by the still comparatively high level of NPLs, despite the recent improvement. The difficult operating environment and heightened geopolitical risk in the region are likely to continue weighing on JCB's asset quality, whose operations are limited to Jordan. The FSR is also constrained by the high concentrations in both the loan book and investment portfolio, which elevate the credit risk of the Bank, as well as high related party exposure. JCB's comparatively small size, limited market share, and relatively high cost structure also weigh on the FSR. Given the significant improvement in the NPL ratio and the level of unprovided NPLs to free capital, as well as the noteworthy increase in profitability, the Outlook for the FSR is revised to 'Positive' from 'Stable'. The FSR could be upgraded if the Bank's CAR increases further from the current level and the loan loss reserve (LLR) coverage is enhanced, provided that other key indicators of liquidity and profitability do not materially deteriorate.\n\nJCB ranks among the small sized banks in the Jordanian domestic banking sector. Over the years, the Bank has built a sizeable branch network, which has helped it expand its customer deposit and loan franchises. In 2014, the Bank's management took the strategic decision to transfer more than one-half of NPLs off balance sheet, resulting in a substantial decrease of NPLs in both money and percentage terms, although the ratio remained comparatively high. The Bank's LLR coverage slightly retreated in 2014, after the noteworthy improvement in the previous year, mainly due to large NPL write-offs and transfers, with the coverage remaining below the sector average. The Bank aims to continue addressing the LLR coverage level through ongoing provisioning.\n\nThe past capital infusions in 2012 and 2013, together with the ongoing full retention of net profit have restored capital adequacy to an adequate level. This has alleviated to a large extent the concern over the Bank's high unprovided NPLs to free capital ratio, which fell to a low level at end 2014. Nonetheless, the Bank's CAR remains well below the sector average and provides limited scope for business expansion.\n\nIn 2014, as a result of much reduced provision charges “ largely reflecting the steep drop in NPLs “ combined with a healthy increase in gross income, the Bank's ROAA improved threefold to an adequate level. While JCB's operating profitability has been declining, although at a much reduced rate in the year under review, it remains satisfactory and continues to provide the financial flexibility to boost provisions as necessary. Gross income generation is supported by good net interest income levels, and a much improved non-interest income (NII) in the last two years.\n\nIn common with other Jordanian banks, JCB's balance sheet remains very liquid and this strength constitutes an important ratings driver. Liquidity is supported by a growing base of customer deposits that forms the Bank's principal source of funding. Liquid asset holdings consist of a large share of Jordanian government securities, which although not traded in an active market are repoable with the CBJ.\nJCB is the successor bank of the former 'Jordan Gulf Bank', which was established in Jordan in 1977 as a public shareholding company. In 2004, following its restructuring and a private placement of shares to a group of prominent investors including the Social Security Corporation (Jordan government), the Bank was recapitalised and renamed Jordan Commercial Bank. JCB is modelled along universal banking lines to provide a comprehensive banking service to corporate and retail clients. The Bank also has a significant trade finance operation generating good levels of fee income. As at end 2014, the Bank reported total assets of JOD1,169mn (USD1.646 billion) and total capital of JOD124mn (USD174mn).\n\nCONTACT\n\nPrimary Analyst\nGeorge Panayides\nCredit Analyst\nTel: 357 2534 2300\nE-mail: george.panayides@ciratings.com\n\nSecondary Analyst & Rating Committee Chairman\nMorris Helal\nSenior Credit Analyst\nE-mail: morris.helal@ciratings.com\n\nThe information sources used to prepare the credit ratings are the rated entity and public information.
