Some investors including Aberdeen Asset Management, APG Asset Management and Ilsung Pharmaceutical Co have publicly spoken out against the deal. \nSamsung Group needs the support of least two-thirds of the votes cast at the C&T shareholder meeting for the deal to proceed. \nElliott said in a statement it would continue to try to block the takeover. An Elliott spokesperson declined to comment on whether the fund would appeal to the ruling. The court said it would rule before July 17 on a second injunction request from Elliott against C&T's attempt to sway the shareholder vote by selling shares to ally KCC Corp. \nTo secure support, Cheil on Tuesday promised bigger dividend payouts and potential share buy-backs from the post-merger company to boost shareholder value. The firm also promised to establish a special committee to protect shareholder interests, while Samsung C&T sent out letters to investors asking them to vote in favour of the takeover.
