Each count carries as much as 10 years in prison.\nHayes told the SFO that the Facebook posts weren’t an attempt to manipulate the rate as he wasn’t friends with anyone in the market, but were an expression of what he wanted to see happen.\n“Either I’m the stupidest fraudster ever because I wrote everything down or there was an element of me that actually just genuinely didn’t think anything about it,” Hayes said in the SFO interview. “I might be a lot of things, but I’m not stupid.”\nProsecutors say Hayes bullied and cajoled fellow traders and brokers to move benchmark rates to make his positions more profitable. Hayes’s lawyers say the practice was widespread.\n“I used to dream about libors,” Hayes told the SFO. “They were my bread and butter, you know. That was the thing. They were the instrument that underlined everything that I traded.”", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/?_rdr=p\\"], "published": "2015-07-03T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T19:55:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
