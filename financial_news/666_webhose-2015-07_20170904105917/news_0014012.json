It plans to increase asset disposals to $50 billion between 2014 and 2018 as it pushes ahead with its proposed $70 billion acquisition of BG Group. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) jumped more than 4 percent. \n\"Shell's move of cutting jobs and reducing capex has pleased investors as it's a good way of maintaining a strong dividend culture,\" Jawaid Afsar, senior trader at Securequity, said. \n\"Sentiment has also improved as its integration with BG is also going well.\" \nThe broader market also got some support from earnings reports. Rolls-Royce rose 2.2 percent despite reporting a 32 percent drop in half-year profits as the numbers came in slightly better than expected after the engine maker slashed its forecasts three times in the past nine months. \nRoyal Bank Of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) gained 2.5 percent after reporting a modest rise in second-quarter profits, while asset manager Schroders (LSE: SDR.L - news ) gained 2 percent after posting forecast-beating first-half profit, helped by strong demand for its fixed income products. \nOn the downside, engineering and support services firm Babcock dropped nearly 5 percent, the biggest decliner in the FTSE 100 index, with revenue from the defence and security division coming in lower in the first half of the year. \nBT Group (LSE: BT-A.L - news ) , Britain's broadband market leader, fell 1.2 percent despite posting first-quarter revenue and core earnings in line with forecasts. \n\"Results were in line with expectations but Global Services performance was disappointing despite all the cost cutting. Broadband disclosure was also slightly weaker than expected,\" Brenda Kelly, analyst at London Capital Group, said.
