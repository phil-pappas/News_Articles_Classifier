It fell after a private gauge of Chinese manufacturing dropped to the lowest in 15 months, signaling decreased commodities demand. The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, has tumbled since the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate on July 15 for the second time this year.\n\\r “The Canadian dollar has a triple whammy against it” of falling commodity prices, monetary easing by the Bank of Canada and an expected interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve, said Steve Barrow, head of Group-of-10 strategy at Standard Bank Group Ltd. in London. He expects Canada’s currency to weaken to C$1.40 over the next two years.\nPolicy makers led by Poloz said the collapse in oil prices is eroding the outlook for the nation’s economy, which is undergoing a “significant and complex adjustment.”\nThe Canadian currency fell 0.3 percent to C$1.3082 versus the U.S. dollar as of 9:31 a.m. in Toronto. That’s weaker than C$1.29, the median year-end estimate of analysts and strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. The loonie is poised for a 4.7 percent decline this month.\nBearish Bets Traders are still pricing in the chance of another interest-rate cut, though these expectations have moderated in the last week. Trading in overnight index swaps show an implied policy rate of 0.39 percent in six months, compared to the Bank of Canada’s current 0.5 percent, Bloomberg calculations show. Last week they were pricing a rate of 0.36 percent.\nHedge funds and other money managers boosted net bearish bets on the loonie to a 16-month high in the run-up to the Bank of Canada meeting, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.\n“The market is pretty bearish” amid concern that global commodities demand will slow, Bipan Rai, director of foreign-exchange strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce’s CIBC World Markets unit, said by phone from Toronto. “The Canadian economy right now is hurting, there’s no two ways about it.”", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i1XSKAaSPP9E/v1/460x260.jpg\\"], "published": "2015-07-24T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T16:48:35.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
