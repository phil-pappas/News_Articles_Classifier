Louie Douvis by Duncan Hughes House renovators hoping for a quick turnover and big profit could run the risk of turning their flip into a flop because of paying too much for the property and facelift, professional developers and lawyers say.\nThey say there is growing evidence that rising house prices and higher expectations of profit are causing some developers to over-reach, sometimes resulting in bigger costs and smaller profits.\n\"Renovation shows on television make it look easy,\" Daren McDonald, a veteran property adviser and negotiator, says.\n\"But with any development comes regulations, taxes, negotiations, contractors and costs,\" says McDonald, a partner and consultant in the business and client advisory division of accountancy firm ShineWing Australia.\nThere is growing evidence that record prices being paid for development sites in Melbourne and Sydney are causing some building and renovation to be delayed, he says.\nRobert Kern, a conveyancing lawyer with Slater and Gordon, says there are also examples of buyers paying too much and \"getting caught\" by not having enough cash to complete the job.\nUnderestimate the cost \"Most renovators and developers underestimate the cost,\" he says, adding too much borrowing for the wrong property can bankrupt.\n \"Generally there are cost over-runs, sometimes up to 40 per cent. That means a renovator needs to buffer in a safety margin,\" he says.\nNeither says the problem is widespread but both believe there is enough evidence of over-paying to urge caution.\nCherie Barber, a professional renovator with a $16 million housing portfolio who is also a TV presenter and owner of a company providing renovation courses, remains bullish about buying for renovation and sale.\nBarber says it makes her cringe to \"hear people claim you cannot renovate for a profit\".\n\"You cannot talk about a single Australian market,\" she says. \"There are more than 4000 suburbs and as many markets.\"\nAnalyse the costs She says renovating to sell or hold depends on individual markets, which means wannabe renovators need to analyse the costs and benefits of the property, street and suburb.\nMarket research shows about 6 per cent of residential properties sold in Australia were sold again in less than two years.\nMcDonald encourages those considering an investment to value the time involved and the risks.\n\"It ultimately comes down to a percentage and value. Ask what are the costs of development, acquisition, holding and selling?\" he says. \"Then work out how they are going to be funded.\"\nThat means talking to town planners about permits, tradespeople about costs, accountants about tax and real estate agents about what the market wants.\n\"Flippers\" could be considered to run a business liable for stamp duty when buying and capital gains and GST upon sale.\n\"Depending on what needs to be done, there could be lots of red tape,\" McDonald says. \"While developing sounds great in theory you really need to consider all the issues and talk to the right professionals who have done it before. You just cannot rock up to a property and start adding a new bathroom.\"\nThat is not discouraging a new generation of determined developers coming into the property market as speculators, landlords and renovators.\nMario Borg, a finance strategist at Melbourne-based Strategic Finance, owns 10 properties and estimates their value at more than $10 million.\nBorg says the trick to successful investment is finding attractive properties with unique features where people want to live and financing that provides protections against market fluctuations.\nFor example, he never allows the loan-to-value ratio to drift above 50 per cent of the portfolio's value and maintains a credit limit equivalent to 80 per cent of the portfolio value to cover any unforeseen events.\nCASE 1\nRenovation diva Cherie Barber is completing a 10-day complete makeover of a house she says would take other renovators between six and 12 months at double the cost.\nCherie has sold 10 properties recently from her $16 million portfolio and added another two, worth $5 million and $3.6 million.\nThe multi-media maven, whose rusty nails to riches business started 25 years ago and now includes a television show, also runs a Renovating for Profit course, whose students pay up to almost $6000 for her methods and insights.\nShe has trained 8000 students in the past six years and has 1500 enrolled for seminars in the final quarter of 2015.\n\"There are more than 4000 suburbs in Australia, which means there are more than 4000 housing markets,\" she says.\nEven in red-hot property markets like Melbourne and Sydney there are still pockets where a renovate-to-sell strategy, which means to freshen-up a property for flogging, is still viable.\nCherie, 45, a single mother of Milan, 9, says she works to strict profit-driving criteria for selecting a property and deciding whether to sell or hold.\n\"If the numbers step up, we do the deal. If they don't, we don't do the deal. This is driven by a strict system, not gut instinct.\"\nInserting the words \"courses for house renovation\" in a computer search engine will produce dozens of training courses on offer, from government departments to private institutions.\nCherie says success in renovation and sales is more than using faster plasterers and nailing deals.\n\"You have also got to look at the area you are buying into,\" she says. \"The demographics, disposable income of residents, historical and projected future capital growth rates.\"\nShe says she \"fell into renovating by accident\" 25 years ago when she bought the \"wrong property\" on a noisy, busy road and sold it quickly to buy another.\nAt 30 she quit her job as a customer service co-ordinator to renovate full-time.\nCASE 2\nMitchell Watson bought his first property within months of completing school and well before obtaining his driving licence.\nWatson's generation is more switched on than its predecessors about the need to get into the market before being priced out.\n\"The Queensland property market was booming,\" he says about his purchase of a three-bedroomed house about 10 kilometres north of Brisbane's central business district.\n\"I knew I needed to get into the property market,\" he says about his decision, which was supported financially by his parents.\nSince buying the Stafford Heights' house 10 years ago property prices in the area have nearly doubled, from $240,000 to $450,000.\nMitchell, a research manager for a financial services company, continued living with his parents before moving into a rental apartment closer to Brisbane.\n\"I put buying a house before a car,\" Mitchell, who turned 30 recently, says about his investment agenda.\n\"I'm definitely thinking of getting another house,\" he added. \"But this time it will be my house.\"\nProperty investors are becoming younger and are more likely to own several rental properties, with the number of investors with more than five properties having increased by 35 per cent in the past 12 months, from 175,000 to 272,000, research by Digital Financial Analytics shows.\nFor the first time since records began, more first-time buyers are expected to be investors rather than owner-occupiers by the end of 2015, heralding a significant change in the nation's home-owning culture, the research reveals.\n\"I'm definitely going to keep my first property and use it as security to buy the next,\" Mitchell says about his investment strategy. \"It has been fruitful.\"\nRenovations to the house included a new kitchen, carpet and painting, he says.\n\"It is well located near schools, shops and public transport and has not been difficult to find tenants.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:15:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
