Yes, U.S. crude prices have dropped into an official bear market, down around 20% since the beginning of June, which will undoubtedly hurt the oil industry and companies like Exxon Mobil and BP . But there are a number of benefits from the decline. Here are 10 of them: \n1. -- Stocks Tend to Rally After Oil Price Drops. When the price of oil goes down, stocks tend to surge. That's the conclusion of a study published in The Journal of Financial Economics in 2008 by professors Gerben Driesprong, Ben Jacobsen, and Benjamin Maat. They found that when oil prices moved down one standard deviation (that's a price movement of about 11%) then stocks would rally by 1% the next month. That's based on three decades of market data. Given the 20% oil price drop, look for a bounce in the S&P 500 and SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund . 2. -- The U.S. Economy Will Likely Benefit . Prices for gasoline are intimately linked to the price of crude oil. Given the recent slump, you should expect the amount paid at the pump to drop. That's great for most Americans, since they drive to work and will now have more money in their pockets at the end of the month. They might spend the extra, which would be good for the economy and for stocks. Some of the benefit would be offset by the layoffs and lower profits in the oil industry but overall, look for a bounce in retail stocks like Wal-Mart . \n3. -- The European Economy Will Likely Benefit. The oil-price plunge is global. Europeans pay an awful lot for gasoline -- about $7 dollars a gallon last week in the U.K., based on current exchange rates and data from the BBC. Europe needs a boost, and a drop in gasoline prices may help as much as a tax cut. Again, some of the benefits would be offset by layoffs and reduced profits in the energy sector across Europe. Keep an eye on European stocks, like those held in the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF . 4. -- Japan's Economy Will Benefit. Japan, despite having a stagnating economy for the past two decades, is the third-largest consumer of oil in the world -- about 4.5 million barrels a day in 2013, according to the Energy Information Administration. It imports 80% of that, which is a drag on economic growth. Lower crude prices should mean less drag on the economy, other things being the same. Watch the iShares MSCI Japan ETF . 5. -- It Hurts Islamic State . The so-called Islamic State makes money off sales of oil from the territories it has conquered. The total is estimated at $1 million a day in revenue, according to a report last year from CNN . Lower oil prices may mean lower revenues for the terrorist organization, although exactly what's going on inside its borders is murky. Still, the drop could help the U.S. and its allies.
