It is also expected to increase the rates on its market-leading 10-year loan by as much as 0.26 percentage points, adding more than £300 to the typical annual mortgage repayments. \nOn Tuesday, Santander is expected to increase rates by around 0.1 per cent. Yorkshire Building Society is also understood to be considering changing its rates. \nMr Hollingworth said: \"The good news is that strong competition should keep a number of good deals out there, but lenders can't hold on forever with rate rises rumoured to be round the corner.\" \nHe said some lenders would be forced to increase their rates because they would not be able to cope with a surge in business. \nMark Harris, chief executive of SPF Private Clients, one of Britain's biggest brokers, said the cost to banks of lending money had risen by substantially since March – and the effects were finally being passed on to customers. \n\"By the time the Bank of England raises rates, which it says could be at the turn of the year, the best rates will have long gone.\" \nAdrian Anderson, director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris, said: \"Fixed rates are only going to get more expensive; if borrowers wait until interest rates are actually rising before securing one then they will pay a lot more than they would now.\" \nThe brokers said inquiries about remortgaging had increased since the Bank of England gave its strongest indication yet that a rate rise is imminent. Bank Rate has been at a record low 0.5 per cent for six years and any rise would be felt by any home owner on a variable deal. \nLast week Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank, said that while rate rises would be gradual, they were likely to start at the \"turn of the year\". \nThe first increase is expected to be 0.25 percentage points. The knock on effect for borrowers would be to increase the cost of the typical variable rate mortgage by around £30 a month. \nMillions of borrowers are on banks' standard variable rates, which can be altered at any time, or have taken so-called \"tracker\" deals that rise in line with Bank Rate. \nMr Harris said: \"If you cannot afford to gamble on rate rises and increased monthly payments, then fixing gives you that surety. \"There are still some excellent cheap fixed rates available – but they really won't be around forever.\" \ndan.hyde@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T00:22:33.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
