Mr Hunt told listeners he could still block the project if the scientists raised objections.\nBut Greens Senator Larissa Waters told AFR Weekend Mr Hunt was using \"weasel words\". Ms Waters, a former environmental lawyer, said Mr Hunt approved the project on July 8 under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act on the condition Shenhua provided a water management plan.\nShe said it was unheard of for a minister to block a mine at this stage of the process. She said the status of the water management plan which Mr Hunt would get from Shenhua was \"blurry\" and using it as a pretext to block the project would very likely trigger a demand for compensation. She said in any case the public would have no chance to comment on the water plan.\nShe said Mr Hunt clearly intended to approve the project and he had just used the water plan as an excuse to fob off Mr Jones. \"He is not going to block it. This is a way for a wimpy Environment Minister to wimp out of the fact that he has just approved a project,\" Ms Waters said.\nA spokesman for Mr Hunt referred AFR Weekend to the conditions issued with the Shenhua approval requiring the company to prepare the technical water plans.\nBlockade promised The Abbott government argued the coal mine which was on a ridge, will not affect the surrounding farm land or its aquifers but it faces an exploding social media campaign which aimed to mount a blockade of more than 40,000 people to stop the mine.\n Estimates by social media monitors suggested there were about 200 web sites, Facebook pages and Twitter accounts opposing the mine. One site urged people to \"join in the greatest event in Australian history\" – a December 31 blockade of the Shenhua mine site.\n\"This event will begin before the first soil can be cut, and it will not end until the project is abandoned,\" the site said.\nJones this week told his audience the anti-Shenhua project had gone national. He claimed it involved one million hits on various anti-mine social media sites. Jones said the campaign was Australia's new \"Eureka moment\" – a reference to the 1854 rebellion by gold miners at the Eureka Stockade near Ballarat, Victoria.\nAnother site claimed the social media-generated people-power campaign meant the mine's owners \"will need to consider how is work going to start when the area will be so overwhelmed.\"\nOne professional social media analyst, who refused to have his name published, said the proposed Shenhua mine had become \"one of the most discussed political issues across social media.\"\nThe anti-mine campaign was marked by rapid momentum, professionalism, and the \"convergence of a lot of different groups taking the opportunity to oppose the mine for different reasons\".\n\"It is reaching the point of bridging off-line activities\" such as protests at the proposed mine site \"with social media,\" the analyst said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T08:16:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
