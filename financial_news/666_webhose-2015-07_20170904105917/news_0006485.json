Australians should brace for further turmoil in China's financial markets. Sean Davey Share on twitter by Jacob Greber The Chinese government's top steel-industry forecaster says production will fall this year for the first time in two decades, a drop that could cost the federal government more than $6 billion over the next two years.\nSpeaking after the benchmark price for iron ore fell to a record-low US$44.10 on Thursday , Li Xinchuang, president of the China Metallurgical Industry Planning Association, said weak demand from property and infrastructure construction would shrink steel output 2 per cent. Production may fall even more than that if exports falter because a softening global economy.\n\"If exports can't remain strong then the situation will be very bad as the local market is weak,\" he told The Australian Financial Review .\nSteel exports have been a rare bright spot for the Chinese economy. They rose 28 per cent over the first half of the year, but are threatened by anti-dumping penalties by the United States and Japan.\nThere was more bad news from the International Monetary Fund, which downgraded its forecast of global economic growth to 3.3 per cent this year from 3.5 per cent, citing China's sharemarket crash and the Greek debt crisis.\nThe bleak steel outlook means Australian iron ore producers – and the revenue they produce for investors, workers and state and federal governments – face faltering demand from their biggest customer as shipments smash records.\nThe benchmark spot iron ore price fell 11 per cent to the lowest level since records began in late 2008. Based on the annual pricing that preceded the current system, it is the lowest since 2005, according to Goldman Sachs.\nWhile the new financial year is only nine days old, the federal budget faces a big shortfall if the iron ore price doesn't rebound strongly from its current level, which is almost US$10 a tonne below the forecast in the May budget for 2015-16.\n According to a budget \"sensitivity analysis\", a drop in the average ore price of that magnitude could wipe $2.1 billion from tax revenues this year and another $4.4 billion in 2016-17.\n\"This does look bad for the budget,\" said Stephen Anthony, chief economist at Industry Super Australia and co-founder of Canberra budget consultants Macroeconomics.\n\"We're in that sensitive range where it'll look like we'd have a revenue impact if the price level is sustained. And it does look like the Chinese economy is softening – certainly financial markets are very volatile and storm clouds are forming.\"\nA worse than forecast budget deficit would be a political blow to Treasurer Joe Hockey, who has pushed out forecasts of a return to surplus several times already.\nTreasury secretary John Fraser warned that Australians should brace for further turmoil in China's financial markets as they become integrated with the Chinese economy.\nWild swings in stocks have provided a \"taste\" of the \"transition risks\" created by the opening up and development of the country's financial sector, he said in Sydney.\nStocks in China have collapsed by around 30 per cent over the last three weeks, and stabilised on Thursday for the first time in days , trading up 0.5 per cent late in the day after opening 3.8 per cent lower and surging 2.6 per cent to an intra-day high.\nIn turn, this helped trigger a global sell-off of commodities from gold to coal and iron ore.\nSpeaking via phone from Beijing, China Metallurgical Industry Planning Association's Mr Li – whose forecasts are used by the government to help formulate its five year plans – said domestic steel consumption dropped 5 per cent over the first half of the year.\nThis follows a decline in Chinese steel production over the first three months of this year.\nPig iron, which is produced from loading iron ore into a blast furnace rather than using scrap metal, fell 2.3 per cent during the March quarter.\nIn 2013 China's pig iron production grew by 6.2 per cent and it was up moderately last year.\nThe dramatic reversal in China's steel output comes as analysts including Xi Xiangchun, the chief information officer at research group Mysteel cautioned the worst was not over for iron ore.\n\"China's steel demand is still declining, steel mills are in the red and supply is going up. Why would the price go up?\" he said. \"We haven't seen the bottom yet. The iron ore price will see a continuous fall this year and next. We might see some rebounds in between but the general trend is down.\"\nIn another worrying sign for Australia's iron ore producers, China's inflation data, released on Thursday, showed steel prices in June slumped 16.7 per cent from a year ago.\nQiu Yuecheng, an analyst with XiBen New Line Co, a steel products trading platform in Shanghai, said the price of rebar, which is mainly used for construction, is at its lowest since 2001.\n\"Some steel mills have liquidity problems so they are just selling whatever they can,\" said Mr Qiu. \"Demand is very weak.\"\nAt the same time the supply of iron ore is surging. Qian Yi, a manager at industry consulting group Steelhome, said 959,000 tonnes of iron ore was delivered to the five main ports in northern China's on Wednesday.\nThat is 31 per cent more than the daily average for last week and 27 per cent higher than the week prior.\nWeak demand for iron ore comes after a sluggish start to the year for infrastructure investment across China, as growth rose by 11.4 per cent in the first five months, well below the government's target of 15 per cent growth in 2015.\nThis is expected to pick up in the second half, but it won't be sufficient to rally the price of iron ore.\n\"If the economy is not good, the Chinese government might launch some stimulus policies, but the aim of these policies is to stabilise growth and this won't lead to a huge increase in steel demand,\" said Mysteel's Mr Xi.\nMr Anthony echoed the concern. \"Just as demand has diminished somewhat, we're pushing supply to an extremity, and the consequences for prices are predictable,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-07-09T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:04:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
