That’s up 77 percent since 2007. For those out of work for two years or more, “their chances of finding work again are shrinking,” the OECD said.\n“Time is running out to prevent the scars of the crisis becoming permanent, with millions of workers trapped at the bottom of the economic ladder,” said OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria. “If that happens, the long-run legacy of the crisis would be to ratchet inequality up yet another notch from levels that were already far too high.”\nThe OECD forecasts that average unemployment in its 34 OECD countries will decline only very gradually this year and next. It sees the rate slipping from 7.1 percent at the end of 2014 to 6.6 percent in the last quarter of 2016. Jobless rates will remain above 20 percent in both Greece and Spain.", "external_links": ["http://www.oecd.org/employment/oecd-employment-outlook-19991266.htm\\"], "published": "2015-07-09T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T14:04:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
