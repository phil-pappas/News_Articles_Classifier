"AUSTRALIA’s Hooters chain, including a recently opened restaurant in Townsville, is ­expected to be sold off after several companies associated with its operations fell into administration.\nInsolvency and restructuring firm Deloitte has been appointed to manage the affairs of Hooters, which has five ­restaurants in NSW and Queensland and employs 400 people, mostly scantily costumed waitresses who are employed as casuals.\nWhile Deloitte restructuring service partner Michael Billingsley would not comment on the reasons for the group’s difficulties, Hooters has been beset by problems ranging from complaints from staff they were not being paid superannuation or that their wages were late to the collapse of a builder who was fitting out their Townsville restaurant.\n“It’s very early days as far as our involvement in these businesses is concerned,” Mr Billingsley said.\n“For now, all restaurants in NSW and Queensland are trading normally while we begin investigating the performance of each business and determine the next steps.\n“We expect to commence marketing the businesses for sale shortly with a view to selling as a going concern to maintain employment for staff and ongoing trading for suppliers.”\nThe Townsville restaurant on Hervey Range Rd opened in May after a lengthy delay.\nIt is reportedly regularly full of customers and appears to be trading strongly.\nSydney-based Deloitte partners Neil Cussen and David Lombe were appointed voluntary administrators to five companies that trade the Hooters restaurants.\nAccording to company records, the Townsville entity, Hoot Townsville Pty Ltd, is owned by Nichole Schlebusch of Bella Vista, NSW.\nAdministrators say an initial creditors’ meeting for the three Sydney restaurants will be held on July 24, while another will be held for the two Queensland restaurants on July 27.\nOriginally published as Hooters is in pretty big trouble ", "external_links":
