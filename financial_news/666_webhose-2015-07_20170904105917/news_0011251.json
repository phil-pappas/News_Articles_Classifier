GVC provides Centric with a gambling technology platform and the Greek company markets the betting operation under local brands. \nIn a drastic attempt to prevent the collapse of its banking system , Greece introduced capital controls a week and a half ago. GVC warned investors on Wednesday that the extreme measures have caused a fall in betting by Greeks, sending its shares down 2.5pc in early trading. \nPanmure Gordon analyst Karl Burns estimates that Greece, which faces a chaotic exit from the eurozone if it fails to reach a deal with its creditors, accounts for about 10pc of GVC’s revenues. Sports-betting is a hugely popular pastime among Greeks. \n“Following the recent imposition of capital controls by the government restricting the movement of funds both within and outside of Greece, the company notes that it has registered a softening in player activity in that territory,” GVC said. \nAlexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, recently imposed capital controls \n“GVC continues to monitor events. However, it is too early to forecast what, if any, the implications will be, and whether they will have a material effect on the second half of the financial year for our Greek operations.” \nIt emerged on Tuesday evening that the company, in partnership with Canadian gambling giant Amaya, had made a cash-and-shares bid worth £900m for beleaguered online betting business Bwin.Party. \nGVC, which confirmed in May that it had approached Bwin, on Wednesday said that discussions “are continuing, although there can be no certainty that such talks will result in an offer being made”. \nOverall, GVC said it enjoyed “record” trading during the six months to the end of June. Sports wagers were up 19pc to €823m and net gaming revenue rose 14pc to €120m. The company said it experienced the increases despite the tough comparatives with last year, when the football World Cup kicked-off in June. It declared an interim dividend of 14 euro cents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T12:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T13:20:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
