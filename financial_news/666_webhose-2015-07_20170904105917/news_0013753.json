In contrast, our economic and financial exposure to the euro area is considerable.”\nLater on Wednesday, after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told international creditors that Athens could accept their bailout offer if some conditions were changed, Carney told Sky News that the situation was very fluid. It was in the interests of Greece and its creditors to reach a deal as soon as possible, he said.\nBritish banks’ direct exposure to peripheral euro zone economies other than Greece amounts to 60 percent of the core reserves that they hold against losses.\nBRITTLE MARKETS\nThe FPC said it was alert to how the Greek crisis might prompt a broader reassessment of risk in financial markets, especially as a shortage of liquidity could make it harder for investors to sell bonds when markets fall.\n“The risks arising from Greece and the global economy will test market liquidity and could potentially trigger broader adjustments,” Carney said.\nPartly because of tougher regulation since the financial crisis, banks have scaled back on market-making, or being willing to take buy and sell orders from investors at any time.\nPolicymakers worry that when interest rates rise, the bond market will have trouble coping with a rush for the exits by investors, ultimately making borrowing harder for ordinary businesses and households.\nThe past year has seen significant volatility in normally safe financial assets such as British, German and American government bonds, and the BoE said the pricing of a number of securities assumed they could always be readily sold.\nMarket regulators say asset managers already have tools to cope with a surge in redemptions. But BoE Deputy Governor Andrew Bailey has said central banks could face pressure to be market makers of last resort.\nThe FPC also said on Wednesday that the fines faced by banks for misconduct had risen enough to undercut public trust in the sector and threatens stability, and that it would soon start to test banks’ resilience against cyber-attacks.\nHigh debt had become less of a problem in Britain’s housing market, but the BoE said lending curbs imposed last year remained necessary.\nFirst Published on July 1, 2015 11:34 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T09:15:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
