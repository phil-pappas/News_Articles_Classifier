We have already clocked a healthy 31% growth at over Rs 5,700 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal year,\" chairman S K Roy told PTI in an interview on completion of his two years at the helm of the nation's largest financial powerhouse.\n\nTo achieve this, the Corporation \"will be focusing on adding the number of marketing intermediaries, increase competency and professionalism of our field force and launch innovative products apart from periodical review of our marketing strategies,\" Roy said.\n\nHowever, he added that the tied channel shall continue to be the core distribution channel. The Corporation is open to exploring other channels depending as well.\n\nSounding bullish about a better show this year, he said, \"We are fully geared up and are confident of putting up a better show in the current fiscal year.\"\n\nIt can be recalled that LIC's market share in new premium business fell to 69.21% in 2014-15 as the Corporation did not have any Ulips in the market.\n\nThis was for the first time since the industry was opened to private players that LIC lost so badly, losing a full 5% of new premium market and taking their combined share to 30% in 2014-15, according to annual data from the Life Insurance Council.\n\nThe Corporation could not introduce new products during the year, especially Ulips, after the regulator Irda forced its hand to withdraw many of its existing offerings.\n\nDue to this, LIC saw a whopping 14% decline in its new premium collection and a still steeper 42% plunge in the number of policies during the year, pulling down its overall market share to 69.21% from 75% in 2013-14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T16:50:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
