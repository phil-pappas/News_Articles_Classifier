We immediately realized we had numerous data quality issues. Using C*Nect, we could address and fix data quality issues ourselves directly in a controlled and audited manner”, says Transparent Healthcare President and Co-Founder, Andy Rieger. “We have greatly improved both the accuracy and completeness of our customer data that better positions our company for accelerated growth and improved customer service.”\nC*Nect CEO and Founder, Bill Gardner, states “We’re excited to be working with Transparent Healthcare in their mission to bring access to affordable Healthcare to people who can’t afford expensive and ineffective Insurance Plans that are available today. C*Nect was founded with the specific objective to help business users connect with their data in a self-service manner at a cost effective price without the complexity that typically requires extensive IT or Professional Services involvement and that’s exactly what we’re doing with Transparent Healthcare.”\nThe dramatic increase in Data Visualization and Business Intelligence solutions over the past few years have made it easier for management and business owners to understand data they generate as part of doing business. Yet, in many cases, the underlying data quality is poor and either leads to incorrect representation of what is really occurring, or, induces additional overhead in improving data quality. Too often, businesses rely on numerous data downloads to spreadsheets, which creates a complex and error-prone workflow for managing their data. “C*Nect’s purpose is to offer a self-service platform to work directly with data in a familiar ‘Excel-like’ manner that fits our customers’ comfort zone, but comes with the scalability, performance, and control expected of an enterprise technology solution. C*Nect’s Data Management Platform enables businesses to easily identify and correct data quality problems that can greatly improve data used in Business Intelligence and Data Visualization tools including Tableau, PowerBI, and Qlikview.” adds Mr. Gardner.\nC*Nect is excited in this summer’s launch of its new visual Configurator, which allows business users to connect to data sources, explore data, and easily create their own custom data ‘collections’ for use and sharing with team members across an enterprise. “We’re really excited to start working with Configurator as this allows us to create our own specialized views without having to ask IT every time we need a new set of data or for tweaks to an existing set,” states Mr. Rieger.\n“We believe that we have simplified the data exploration and creation phase with our Configurator product so that users can connect to and understand their data from different systems and utilize it effectively with C*Nect’s Platform. Poor Data Quality can now be addressed in a true self-service fashion without relying on IT or Professional Services staff to turn their data into real Business Intelligence”, adds Mr. Gardner.\nAbout Transparent Healthcare\nTransparent Healthcare delivers products and services that give the uninsured and underinsured access to affordable healthcare.
