Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow The Palaszczuk government is considering directing Queensland Investment Corporation to invest $30 billion in super assets into state-owned companies rather than them picking the best of global assets.\nThe Labor government will also take the unprecedented step of suspending its contributions to its $30 billion superannuation scheme for the next five years in a bid to begin to pay down the state's spiralling debt.\nOnly a day after promising he would not raid the state's fully funded superannuation scheme, Treasurer Curtis Pitt announced in Tuesday's budget the Palaszczuk government would stop annual employer contributions to the direct-benefits scheme – a move which will save them $2 billion over the next five years.\nMr Pitt said the accounting restructure – combined with the move to pay long-service leave at the time it is needed rather than from a central pool – would allow the government to reduce general government sector debt by $7.5 billion this financial year, with a further reduction of almost $10 billion over the forward estimates.\nThe move to direct QIC to use the $30 billion defined benefits scheme to invest in state-owned energy, port and water assets is expected to rankle the fiercely independent fund manager which controls $70 billion in funds and global infrastructure and property assets.\nBut Mr Pitt said it would only expect QIC to invest in productivity-enhancing infrastructure which would deliver commercial returns. A decision on the controversial proposal is expected by later this year.\nThe move to pay down debt was well received by credit rating agency Standard & Poor's which said it had no plans to downgrade the state's AA+ credit rating.\nThe Treasurer said the Labor government could afford to take a \"contribution holiday\" with its defined benefits scheme because it had a surplus of more than $10 billion.\n \"Given the size of the surplus and the importance of reducing the state's debt, the government will suspend employer contributions in the defined benefits scheme for up to five years,\" Mr Pitt said.\n\"No money is being taken out. Nothing is being raided.\"\nIt is understood the idea was suggested by Treasury to the former Liberal National Party government, but they were focused on the $37 billion privatisation plan which was abandoned after Labor won the January election.\nMr Pitt said the change should have been made years ago.\n\"The LNP were a lazy government that had a lazy balance sheet. This is the sort of balance sheet reform that should have been undertaken by the former LNP government instead of trying to sell assets,\" he said.\nOpposition leader Lawrence Springborg​ accused the Palaszczuk government of \"artful manipulation\" of the budget.\n\"I think if public servants in Queensland government knew that a Labor government was going to raid their superannuation and their long service leave entitlements, we may have had a very different outcome five months ago,\" Mr Springborg said.\nThe superannuation shake-up overshadowed the Palaszczuk government's first budget, which delivered an operating surplus over the next three years, including $1.2 billion in 2015-16.\nA surge in property taxes has helped make up for a $3 billion shortfall in mining royalties, but unemployment is set to remain persistently high (over 6 per cent) over the next four years.\nRoyalties from liquefied natural gas exports are not as high as expected, but the surge in activity from the $60 billion liquefied natural gas industry based around Gladstone is still expected to deliver economic growth of 4.5 per cent this financial year.\nPremier Annastacia Palaszczuk said Tuesday's budget was a \"measured and responsible\" response document which focused on Labor's strengths of training and jobs creation.\nThe government will undertake a $10 billion infrastructure program, including $200 million for local councils to improve roads in the regions, in a budget bereft of big-ticket projects.\nThe Palaszczuk government has re-directed funding from the former Newman government to its pet projects including extra money for TAFE and apprenticeships.\nThere will be a record health ($14.2 billion) and education ($12.4 billion) spending this financial, while cuts to tourism funding will be restored with an an extra $400 million over the next four years.\nDespite the creative accounting by the Palaszczuk government – which also included stripping $4 billion from the state-owned energy companies – the total debt will still reach $78 billion by 2018-19 which makes it harder for the state to reclaim the AAA credit rating.\nOther new funding measures in Tuesday's budget were a $500 million schools and hospital fund as well as $52 million for drought relief.\nNow read about the winners and losers from Queensland's budget , and Mark Ludlow's comment", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-07-14T12:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:05:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
