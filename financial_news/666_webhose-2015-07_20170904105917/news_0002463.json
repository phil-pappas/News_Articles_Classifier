Labour availability and cost remain challenging but we continue to manage this effectively, working closely with our supply chain.” \nThe company now has a record total landbank of 15,750 plots, up 13pc on 2014, while Linden Homes has all of its plots secured for the new financial year and 87pc secured for the year after that. \n“Housing market conditions remain positive and the directors take further confidence from the significant increase in the group's landbank,” added Mr Fitzgerald. \n“Following a resilient performance in construction throughout a tough recession, we are pleased to report another profitable year for the division, and are encouraged by the outlook, with opportunities growing across multiple sectors.” \nGalliford Try’s construction division reported growth in revenue and profits, while the order book more than doubled to £3.5bn, following its £16.6m acquisition of Miller Construction. \nGalliford Try also trades under the Morrison Construction and Pentland brands. \nMr Fitzgerald is due to retire from the FTSE 250 business later this year, after serving 33 years at the helm. \nThe housebuilder will report its full-year results on September 16.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T11:46:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
