The company is still one of the most innovative stories in the automotive industry, and its \"differentiation relative to its peer group is nothing short of total,\" Erikson wrote in a note to clients. \"We simply believe the stock price now more fully reflects these core attributes.\" The shares dropped 4.2% Tuesday, the biggest one-day slide in five months, after Deutsche Bank downgraded it, also on valuation concerns.
