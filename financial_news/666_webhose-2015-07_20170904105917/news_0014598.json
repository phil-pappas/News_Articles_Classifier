In \" Rock Breaks Scissors: A Practical Guide to Outguessing and Outwitting Almost Everybody ,\" William Poundstone explains how to trick websites into offering you discounts using a method he calls the \"abandoned shopping cart ploy.\" It's simple: Fill up your cart on any retail site and start the checkout process, partially filling out your shipping information and email address — but no payment information. Then exit the site and wait. Much of the time, retailers will email you a reminder about your abandoned cart, usually including a discount coupon or free shipping. Why does this work? According to Poundstone, 65% of all online carts end up abandoned, so retailers send follow-up emails in an attempt to close the deal. \"Some companies are willing to discount their profit to gain a new customer, knowing that repeat customers might not care so much about price,\" he writes. Poundstone likens the practice to walking away from a car salesman — it forces him to put the best deal on the table. The shopping cart ploy might not be a foolproof method, but it's certainly worth a shot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T18:15:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
