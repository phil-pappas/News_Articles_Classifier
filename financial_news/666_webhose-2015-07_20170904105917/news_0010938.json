BPCL bought 1 million barrels of Sokol from Statoil ASA, traders said.\n\nIt was BPCL's first purchase of the Russian crude grade, according to an industry source with direct knowledge the matter. The oil is due to load in September in South Korea, where Statoil has kept the crude in storage for several months, the traders said. Statoil declined to comment, and BPCL officials were not immediately available.\n\nThe price of the cargo is unknown, although traders said it was low enough to justify paying the shipping costs to India. The source said it looks like there is plenty of crude in the market and that's the reason Statoil offered the Sokol grade at such a competitive price.\n\nThe high-quality sweet Sokol grade usually goes to refiners in nearby South Korea and Japan. Trading companies seeking to sell million of speculative barrels stored for months have added supply into a saturated market, putting pressure on physical crude oil markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:24:35.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
