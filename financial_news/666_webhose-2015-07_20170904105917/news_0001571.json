Nic Walker by Jessica Gardner Strong-arm tactics by Medibank Private to reduce its hospital costs may push dying patients and the chronically ill on to the struggling public system.\nMedibank, which was privatised by the Abbott government in a $5.7 billion float last November, said last week it had dumped Catholic operator Calvary Health Care as a supplier after contract renegotiations broke down .\nCalvary chief executive Mark Doran said Medibank was acting unreasonably. His concerns have been supported by four other private hospital executives, who have also questioned Medibank's tactics and demands.\n\"They are dictating and are not prepared to negotiate on any reasonable set of terms,\" Mr Doran told Fairfax Media.\nAbout every two years insurers and hospitals embark on negotiations over what the insurer should pay for care, such as a night in a rehabilitation bed or a hip replacement.\nIn addition to pushing back on an agreed price rise, Medibank is playing hardball on its new quality and affordability criteria.\nMedibank has told Calvary that it will refuse to pay when any of a list of 165 of what it calls \"highly preventable adverse events\" occur, such as a patient taking a fall while in care. It is also refusing to pay for any patient readmissions within 28 days of a procedure. In the parlance of Medibank's contract \"the second episode is considered a continuation of the first\" and should be paid for by the hospital.\nMr Doran argued that many of the adverse events were not \"highly preventable\" and were instead common complications. In the case of chronic illnesses, like diabetes, he said there may be appropriate reasons why a patient might visit a hospital more than once in a month. Similarly for palliative care, patients might require multiple admissions in a four-week period for care like managing pain relief.\n \"If we take end-of-life patients, we know that on average they will have seven admissions in the last year of life,\" he said. \"You can't predict what is going to happen. It doesn't come in 28-day lots.\"\nMedibank senior medical adviser Ian Boyd said the highly preventable adverse events were a \"relatively small subset\" of all the things that can go wrong in a hospital. And on the 28-day readmission criteria he said other funders like the Department of Veterans Affairs were moving to this model. \"Up until now we have paid full freight for every adverse event and every 28-day readmission â€¦ no questions asked,\" Dr Boyd said. \"As a funder I think we have a duty to our members to move from that.\"\nDr Boyd said the readmission criteria were designed to carve out conditions like chronic illness and palliative care, but Mr Doran said this was not playing out in negotiations. \"The carve-outs on the readmission are limited to cancers, airways disease, heart failure, sleep studies, dialysis and lithotripsy,\" he said. \"There is no right of repeal.\"\nMedibank and other insurers are battling against the soaring cost of medical care. In the past 10 years the annual amount Medibank has paid to hospitals has surged from $1.5 billion to $2.9 billion. Medical claims inflation is running at more than double the rate of inflation because of price rises demanded by hospitals, but also growing volume due to an ageing and growing population.\nMedibank chief executive George Savvides has previously said the insurer wanted to use its leading market share of 29.1 per cent to \"flex its muscle\" over hospital groups , to control this cost.\nIn general, the hospital groups say they are supportive of Medibank's push for improved quality, but say it is trying to force its own definitions without consultation.\nHealthscope chief executive Robert Cooke, who oversees the country's second-largest private hospital operator and will face Medibank for contract negotiations in 2016, said he had moved to a funding model with Medibank's biggest rival, Bupa, where Healthscope has scope to be rewarded for significantly improving quality of care.\nOn its website, Healthscope publishes quality indicators, such as falls and infection rates, for each of its 45 hospitals. \"We are committed to the transparent reporting, but also a payment model that reflects improvements in quality and the cost savings that are passed on to health funds and their members from our efforts,\" Mr Cooke said. \"We estimate that our low infection rates not only save patients from unnecessary hospitalisation but also save health funds millions of dollars.\"\nThe chief executive of listed group Pulse Health Phillippa Blakey, who runs seven hospitals, said \"onerous\" readmission criteria put too much financial risk on operators. \"What that will cause operators to do is to look again at the kinds of patients that they will look after,\" she said.\nMr Cooke agreed that the private hospital system \"needs to ensure that our doors are open for all patients and we're not encouraged to selectively choose\".\nSt Vincent's Health Australia chief executive Toby Hall signed the Catholic provider up to Medibank's criteria after tough negotiations last September. He said because St Vincent's was a \"high-performing\" group it could absorb costs that flow from the strict readmissions and adverse events criteria. However he said there was pressure on smaller groups to comply with Medibank's not sufficiently nuanced criteria.\n\"They have a very long list of outcomes which is very generic and it doesn't take into account a range of reasons why people do come back to hospital,\" he said. \"Medibank has a team of corporate people, some with medical knowledge, but they mostly have people negotiating on very complex clinical conditions [who] don't fully understand them.\"\n\"About 10 per cent of the adverse events and readmissions that Medibank is trying to claim back I would say are unreasonable,\" Mr Hall said. \"They say 'Here's our list of what we feel are the problems.' It's almost a take-it-or-leave-it approach.\"\nSt John of God chief executive Michael Stanford said he sympathised with Medibank and Calvary's Mr Doran. \"The issue is that both Mark and Medibank [are] right,\" Dr Stanford said. \"Mark is right in that you can't make a hard and fast rule [about readmissions]; where Medibank right is that they should be trying to promote to their members that theirs is a quality offering.\"\nIf the two parties cannot reach agreement before August 31, Medibank members going to Calvary's 11 private hospitals will not be completely covered for the cost of their treatment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:07:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
