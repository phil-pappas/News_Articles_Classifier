PUBLISHED: 10:35, Sun, Jul 26, 2015 | UPDATED: 10:46, Sun, Jul 26, 2015 GETTY One in three Britons run up an overdraft \nThat is bad news for the one in three Britons who runs up an overdraft, collectiveley racking up £1.2billion in charges each year. \nIt is enough to make anybody see red, but with careful planning you can avoid them. MYTH EXPLODED \nEvery year, 17 million Britons go overdrawn or bounce a payment, with 10 million of those incurring charges of £100 or more, according to ThinkMoney.co.uk . \nSpokesman Ian Williams says its research shows that free banking is a myth. \nHe said: “For millions of people, the ‘free’ current accounts on offer sting them with overdraft charges, daily usage charges, interest charges or fees for bounced cheques and unpaid direct debits.” \nIt also means that customers who run into financial troubles partially fund “free” banking for everybody else. HARSH USAGE \nThe traditional advice to anybody in danger of going overdrawn was to contact their bank, as authorised overdrafts incur fewer charges than unauthorised ones. \nBut new research from MoneyFacts.co.uk shows that banks have upped their authorised overdraft charges by introducing new “usage fees” while cutting charges on unauthorised debt. Customers who plan their authorised overdraft and pay it back diligently each month are being attacked with higher charges \nIn 2008, just a fifth of current accounts levied a usage fee for an arranged overdraft, now almost two thirds do. \nDesigned to make bank charges clearer, instead, the fees have raised the cost of borrowing. \nRachel Springall, finance expert at MoneyFacts, warns the cost of dipping into the red has hit an all-time high. \n“Customers who plan their authorised overdraft and pay it back diligently each month are being attacked with higher charges,” she said. \nThe average monthly cost of an authorised overdraft is six times higher than seven years ago, rising from £2 a month to £12. \nWith Halifax, the cost of going overdrawn by £300 for 15 consecutive days has soared from £2.40 a month to £15. \nOverdraft charges on current accounts from Barclays, Lloyds, Santander and NatWest have risen almost as sharply. \nSpringall says charges on unauthorised overdrafts may have shrunk because some banks now put a cap on the total cost to protect vulnerable customers and adds: “Those who arrange their overdraft are taking on the burden of those who do not plan ahead.” SWITCHING OVER \nIf you risk going overdrawn, consider shopping around for a bank that takes a more lenient approach. \nHowever, comparing charges can be tricky, given the bewildering range. \nKevin Mountford, head of banking at MoneySupermarket.com , says some banks offer attractive introductory overdraft rates for new customers. \nHe said: “Nationwide’s FlexDirect account is fee-free for 12 months, although you have to credit the account with £1,000 a month.” \nSantander’s popular 123 account has no overdraft usage fee for the first four months, but you must pay in £500 a month and set up two direct debits, while First Direct offers a £250 overdraft free of interest. \nMountford adds that authorised borrowing is still cheaper than unauthorised and reduces the danger of rejected payments. PLAN BETTER \nDamien Fahy, director of personal finance website MoneyToTheMasses.com , says a better option is to avoid going overdrawn in the first place: “Smartphone apps such as Spending Tracker can help you budget by highlighting where your money goes every month. \n\"Most of the big banks allow you to set up free text alerts too.” \nAnother option is to take out a credit card with a low APR as a spending buffer and clear the balance when you get paid. \nFahy says contact your bank if you go overdrawn accidentally. \n“If this is the first time, it may waive any charges especially if you clear the debt quickly, but never cover the shortfall by taking out a payday loan.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T12:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T00:37:42.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
