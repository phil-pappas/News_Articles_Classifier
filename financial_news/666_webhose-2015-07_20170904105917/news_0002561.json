Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Anne Hyland Type the word \"relentless.com\" into your internet browser and you'll be redirected to the world's biggest online retailer Amazon.com.\nWhen Jeff Bezos launched Amazon's website two decades ago, relentless was the name he initially chose for his dotcom baby before deciding that naming it after the world's largest river had more appeal.\nThis month Amazon turns 20, just as Australians are starting to tighten the purse strings on overseas online purchases. It's not that we're falling out of love with Amazon, or other overseas online retailers for that matter. It's the fact our dollar is buying much, much less than it did a year ago. In that time it has lost one-fifth of its value.\nA report from Asia Pacific stockbroker CLSA, titled Mr & Mrs Australia, said a 20 per cent increase in prices for overseas products would see two-thirds of the 1400 Australians surveyed \"significantly reduce their purchases or not buy at all\" online. It also comes at a time when many big retail chains – from Uniqlo, H&M, Forever21 to Zara – are coming to us in bricks and mortar outlets and hiring plenty of staff.\nTwenty years on, the sharemarket continues to value Amazon by its future, not by its present. Getty That Australians are buying less online from overseas might warm the hearts of domestic billionaire retailers such as Gerry Harvey, but it's unlikely to cause much pain to Amazon.\nAmazon – which began its life as an online book store and now sells so much more, from grocery items such as tinned tomatoes to computers and other electronics, clothing and music to cloud computing services – is expanding its footprint in Australia. It's hiring staff and seeking office space here as it rolls out its data storage service for businesses and consumers, taking on rivals such as Telstra.\nTurf battles For the generation that grew up alongside Amazon, however, it remains first and foremost an online book store, or increasingly an e-book store, even if the revenue from everything else it sells dwarfs what it earns from books.\n And books are still the turf on which Amazon faces its biggest and most controversial battles. In the United States, where it's the nation's biggest bookseller, authors and book publishers are calling for an investigation into what they allege is a misuse of its power as both a seller and buyer of books.\nLast month, the European Union launched an investigation into whether Amazon was choking competition in e-books because of conditions it had put on contracts with publishers. Amazon is the largest distributor of e-books in Europe.\nSeparately, France has tried unsuccessfully to halt the rise of Amazon. In France, they have the Lang Law (after Jack Lang, the culture minister at the time of its passing), which means books are sold essentially at a fixed price because no retailer can sell a book for more than a 5 per cent discount.\nAmazon was selling at that discount and offering free shipping, which some French politicians saw as an unfair advantage over independent book stores.\nIn 2014, France passed a bill forbidding an online retailer from offering both a discount and free shipping. Amazon charged 1¢ for shipping.\nThe push back in Australia also hasn't been that successful. Local online book stores have launched here though anyone who's used them knows the customer service and efficiency is no match for Amazon.\nAmazon has had a long, complicated relationship with authors and book publishers, ever since it sold its first book, Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought .\nExercising the imagination On the one hand, Amazon has made it possible for hundreds of thousands of authors frustrated with the structure of traditional publishing to have their work read.\nOn the other, it's infuriated authors and book publishers who claim it's almost a monopoly that behaves like a thug. As well, Amazon is blamed for the multiple closures of independent book stores globally. So, for some, there's not much to celebrate on Amazon reaching adulthood. (Amazon's website launched in 1995 while the company was incorporated a year earlier.)\nAmazon has survived in the past two decades, whereas many of its dotcom peers of the 1990s have fizzled and crashed. All of this could be attributed to the relentless drive of its founder Jeff Bezos, whose favourite book, incidentally, is Kazuo Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day . Bezos's expansion of Amazon has made him the world's ninth-richest person, with a fortune of $US42 billion ($56.5 billion). He owns almost one-fifth of Amazon stock.\nThe sharemarket, 20 years on, continues to value Amazon's future and its rapid growth, significant market power and influence, rather than its present, or the fact that it loses money. The company is valued at $US217 billion.\nAmazon's success and the reason customers, even its critics, continue to use it lies in the fact that few other online retailers can match the vast selection of the hundreds of millions of products it sells or its ambition which, in the words of Bezos, is to be \"the world's most customer-centric company\". Indeed there's a whole generation of customers who couldn't contemplate a time when Amazon didn't exist or, for that matter, a time when you couldn't shop online.\nBut what does Amazon mean for the future of books, if one company controls most of the distribution of what we read in the world? Books add to a society's intellect and are tools of factual record – either of historical events or scientific discoveries, as well as being tools of enjoyment, through the transmitting of stories and how we learn about different cultures or exercise the imagination.\nAmazon has shown it will punish publishers and authors that don't bow to its wishes by limiting the availability of their books to customers. It's little wonder the company continues to generate endless discussion, concern and investigation.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/newsandimages", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/113603699450999731037"], "published": "2015-07-17T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:13:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
