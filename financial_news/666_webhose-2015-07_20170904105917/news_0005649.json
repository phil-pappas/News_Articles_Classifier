New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) work and repair and maintenance output both fell month-on-month. \nCompared with a year earlier, output rose by 1.3pc, but that was well below forecasts for a 3pc rise. \nWhile later data had showed a shallower decline in construction output than previously thought in April, Friday's figures suggest the sector is still likely to act as a drag on the UK's total growth in the second quarter. \nBritain's economy expanded by 0.4pc in the first three months of this year. Economists expect growth to strengthen in the second quarter, despite the weakness in construction, which accounts for 6.4pc of gross domestic product (GDP). \nGeorge Osborne , the Chancellor, has also announced plans to overhaul the country’s planning system in a move that he claims will address Britain's chronic housing shortage. Mr Osborne said the Government would in future “intervene” and ensure councils have plans “setting out how housing needs will be met”. \nBritain's trade deficit was at its narrowest since 2013 in May \nIt came as data showed Britain's trade gap narrowed to its smallest size in almost two years, as imports fell and exports to the euro region climbed. \nThe trade gap fell to £0.4bn in May, compared with £1.8bn in April, according to the ONS. This reflects a deficit of £8bn on goods, partially offset by an estimated surplus of £7.6bn on services. \nThe trade in goods deficit with the EU also narrowed, by £0.6bn to £6.4bn, as imports fell. The deficit with countries outside the EU narrowed £0.8bn to £1.6bn, the smallest level since June 2013, again attributed to a decrease in imports. \nTrade and construction data are not currently considered to be national statistics because of concerns about data quality. \nMr Osborne announced on Friday that Sir Charlie Bean, the former deputy governor of the Bank of England, will lead a review into the quality of UK statistics as part of the Chancellor's plan to boost productivity. \nSir Charlie will look at the effectiveness of the ONS in delivering UK statistics, as well as \"future statistics needs in particular relating to the challenges of measuring the modern economy\". \nA preliminary report is expected in the autumn, with a final assessment published by the Budget in March 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:33:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
