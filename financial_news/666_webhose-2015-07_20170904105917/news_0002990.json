Share on twitter by Tony Boyd Deposits held by Australia's major banks will be safer following the regulator's move to strengthen capital held against mortgages by $12 billion â€“ but the flip side is more costly borrowing rates for home loan borrowers and business.\nRates on lending will most likely rise because banks will deploy capital based upon the economic analysis of the best available returns. That analysis is very different to the regulatory capital analysis done for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.\nHome loans will remain the most attractive assets for banks because of the high return on equity (ROE). A typical mortgage at a big four bank has return on equity of about 30 per cent.\nBut the banks try to balance the interests of shareholders and borrowers by maintaining an amount of capital within the bounds set by APRA. Shareholders have demanded ROE from Australia's banks of at least 14 per cent. Commonwealth Bank of Australia has achieved ROE of 18 per cent.\nNow that APRA has lifted capital levels by about 80 basis points for the big four banks and Macquarie, the chief financial officers will revisit the economic capital equation. That will be faced with the issue of where to deploy capital to maximise returns to shareholders.\nCBA said it will need 96 basis points of additional capital, while National Australia Bank said it will need another 70 basis points of core equity capital. Westpac said the APRA changes meant it would need new capital totaling $3 billion.\nThere will be a three pronged response to APRA's demand for higher capital. First, the banks will raise the necessary core equity through asset sales, dividend reinvestment plans, equity capital raisings or a combination of all three.\nThe second response will be to lift lending rates to try to maintain the high levels of ROE for mortgages and business lending. Also, the banks will lower deposit rates.\n The third response will be a reassessment of less attractive lending propositions such as higher risk business and property loans. The banks will deploy their capital to maximise the returns and protect the interests of shareholders.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-07-20T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T04:08:19.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
