However, investors and analysts indicated they were not convinced by the improving gold price. Three-day gold spot price. Source: Bloomberg \nMark O’Byrne, of GoldCore, warned “there is ‘blood in the streets’ of the gold market and the gold mining sector”. \nThe spot price fell by more than 3pc last week after a rout prompted a sell-off, and Mr O’Byrne said further weakness was quite possible. \n“We are bearish and nervous in the short term as we are seeing some of the worst sentiment towards gold since 1999,” Mr O’Byrne added. \nHowever, Peter Ward, of London Capital Group, said sentiment towards gold remained mixed after last week’s losses, with the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and the strength of the US dollar the key drivers of the gold spot price this week. \n• Why is the gold price falling and where is it going next? \nWith all eyes on the Federal Reserve, ahead of its two-day meeting, markets will scrutinise the policy statement for further hints that a September rate hike is on the cards. Analysts at UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) expect the meeting announcement will keep the Fed on pace for a rate rise at the September 17 meeting. \n“Any hawkish sign from the Fed could increase downside pressures for an extension to $1030/10 before $1,000, the critical psychological target,” Mr Ward added. \nNonetheless, mining stocks were among the biggest risers in early trade on Monday morning. Randgold Resources jumped 94p, or 2.5pc to £8.38, Fresnillo advanced 1.5pc to 628p and mid-cap miner Centamin (Toronto: CEE.TO - news ) added 1.3pc to 54.8p. \n• Gold hits five-year low as US interest rate rise looms", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T15:45:22.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
