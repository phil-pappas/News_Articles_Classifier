The collateral damage will kill the eurozone as a beacon of hope, democracy and prosperity.\"\n\"To Chancellor Merkel our message is clear; we urge you to take this vital action of leadership for Greece and Germany, and also for the world. History will remember you for your actions this week.\"\nThe letter was signed by Piketty, the French economist known for his work on income disparity; Columbia University development economist Sachs; Harvard political economist Dani Rodrik; Simon Wren-Lewis, an Oxford University economist; and Heiner Flassbeck, former state secretary in the German finance ministry.", "external_links": ["http://www.thenation.com/article/austerity-has-failed-an-open-letter-from-thomas-piketty-to-angela-merkel/"], "published": "2015-07-08T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T18:51:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
