AP Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires China's gyrating sharemarket is causing weakness in Asian markets, but HSBC says it is distracting from real opportunities in companies whose growth is resistant to the region's macro events.\nHSBC's head of Asia Pacific equity strategy, Herald van der Linde, said there was plenty of opportunity in the \"Asian paradox\": while markets are weak, there were growth stocks unfazed by the surrounding fireworks.\nAside from China's sharemarkets, other events hindering short-term performance in Asian equities include the impending Federal Reserve rate hike, plunging commodity prices, a stronger US dollar and the slower pace of reform in some countries.\nBut there were growth opportunities for buyers who looked beyond the short term trouble, Mr van der Linde said.\n\"Key to these longer-term developments are a potential recovery in profit margins in Asia in the years ahead, growth of 'financial inclusion' and financial assets across the region,\" he said.\nOne of the reasons for Asia's recent underperformance had been its poor return-on-equity performance, Mr van der Linde said.\n\"In the not-so-distant past, 2009 to be exact, operating margins in Asia averaged 14 per cent,\" he said.\n\"They have been sliding ever since and are now around 11 per cent.\"\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

Alibaba shares were trading at $US80.23 on Wednesday. The company announced this week it would invest $US1 billion into its cloud computing arm to directly compete with cloud behemoth Amazon.\nBaidu.com Baidu Incorporated is a Chinese web services company based in Beijing. Founded in 2000, it listed on Wall Street's Nasdaq index in 2005.\nHSBC says Baidu has a 24 per cent upside to its trading price. But the company, often referred to as the Chinese equivalent to Google, was punished on Wednesday after it reported a 3.66 billion yuan profit, which was better than the previous corresponding period, but missed analysts expectations.\nIts shares fell 8.7 per cent in after-market trading, to $US180.50.\nBeijing Enterprises Water The Hang Seng-listed water-treatment systems developer fit HSBC's \"best in class\" criteria with a 33 per cent upside. The company, the largest publicly-traded of its kind in China, has a price-earnings ratio of 23 times earnings with an expected dividend yield of 1.6 per cent.\nLenovo Group HSBC said Lenovo, which is already a household name for its computers, had an impressive 65.8 per cent upside to its trading price. The Hong Kong-listed, Beijing and North Carolina-based company's share price was about $HK9 ($1.59) on Thursday, but HSBC has a target price of $HK15.20.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-07-31T12:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T10:12:52.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
