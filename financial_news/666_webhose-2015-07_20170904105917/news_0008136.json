Photo: Tamara Voninski\nThe biggest bank in the country is jacking up interest rates for housing investors, as lenders act to rein in the boom in borrowing by landlord buyers.\nThe Commonwealth Bank of Australia on Friday said it would would increase interest rates for housing investors by 0.27 percentage points, joining ANZ Banking Group, which raised rates for investors by the same amount on Thursday.\nWith other banks tipped to make similar changes, analysts predict the big four banks' combined profits would be boosted by almost $800 million if they raise their interest rates by the same amount as CBA and ANZ.\nCBA argued the rate rise was aimed at complying with a 10 per cent a year cap on lending to landlords , put in place last year by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).\nAdvertisement \"As Australia's largest home lender, we support the prudential regulator's actions to ensure lending practices remain sustainable and we have been actively managing our investment home loan portfolio to remain below the 10 per cent growth limit,\" CBA's group executive for retail banking services, Matt Comyn, said.\n\"Despite making a range of changes to our investor lending policies in the past few months, we have witnessed ongoing investor lending growth, and at an industry level, investor lending approvals remain 22 per cent higher than 12 months ago.\"\nAmid fears Sydney and Melbourne's housing markets are overheating , banks are being forced by APRA to slow the growth in their housing investor loan portfolios to less than 10 per cent a year.\nThis has prompted them to tighten lending conditions and raise rates for new investor borrowers, but ANZ and CBA are the only banks to raise rates for all existing customers.\nA report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Andrew Hill said other banks were also likely to raise home loan borrowing costs to some degree in response to APRA's policy.\nThe report argued that if other banks did not follow the lead of ANZ \"they will likely gain more share and once again exceed the 10 per cent speed limit\".\nAs well, however, raising interest rates will also boost banks' bottom lines, when profit margins are being squeezed by tougher competition.\nMr Hill wrote that over a full year, ANZ's move would lift net profit after tax by $124 million, while CBA's profits would benefit by $244 million.\nIf National Australia Bank made the same move, its profits would be lifted by $127 million and Westpac's would increase by $296 million, the report said.\nAs a share of total profits, raising rates on investor loans would be most profitable for Westpac, lifting earnings by 3.8 per cent, it said.\nPrevious moves by banks to raise interest rates for owner-occupiers independently of the Reserve Bank of Australia have sparked political anger and risked a backlash from customers.\nHowever, CBA equities analyst Victor German said APRA's cap on investor credit growth removed some of the \"downside risk\" of \"out-of-cycle\" interest rate hikes.\n\"While in a normal competitive environment repricing changes of this nature may potentially lead to customer attrition, in this instance we believe the regulator has essentially removed that risk,\" Mr German said in a note to clients.\n\"Given that APRA has restricted the banks' ability to grow their investor lending books, we don't expect the major peers to target ANZ's customers and expect the industry to follow ANZ's pricing lead (either in the form of a higher base rate or further reductions in discount available to investors).\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/apra-launches-crackdown-on-loans-to-property-investors-20141209-123lko.html", "http://www.afr.com/real-estate/residential/median-house-price-in-sydney-tops-1-million-for-first-time-20150723-gihqjk"], "published": "2015-07-24T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T23:31:29.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
