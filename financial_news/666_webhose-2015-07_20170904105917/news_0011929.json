There is nothing going your way,\" says a recruiting executive. \nMore than 60% of physicians work in practices with 10 physicians or fewer, and that practice size didn't change much between 2012 and 2014, the American Medical Association says in a new study . \n\"These data show that the majority (60.7%) of physicians were in small practices of 10 or fewer physicians, and that practice size changed very little between 2012 and 2014 in the face of profound structural reforms to healthcare delivery,\" AMA President-elect Andrew W. Gurman, MD, said in prepared remarks. \nThe findings seem at odds with reports that physicians are flocking towards employed models, either with larger physician groups, hospitals or health systems. Nonetheless, the AMA study shows that the trend toward employment and migration to larger practice is occurring. \nThe Changing Economics of Medicine \nNearly 57% of the physicians worked in practices that were wholly owned by physicians in 2014, which is down from 60.1% in 2012. The percentage of physicians working for hospitals or in practices that had some hospital ownership increased from 29% in 2012 to 32.8% in 2014. \nThe study also found that: Physicians as practice owners decreased from 53.2% to 50.8%. Solo practitioners decreased from 18.4% to 17.1%. Physicians directly employed by a hospital increased from 5.6% to 7.2% Physicians in practices that had some hospital ownership increased from 23.4% to 25.6%. \nTravis Singleton, a senior vice president at Dallas-based physician recruiters Merritt Hawkins, says the AMA findings are largely consistent with Merritt Hawkins' data of physician demand. \n\"The one number that is probably significantly different from ours is they have 60.7% physicians in practices of 10 or fewer and our number is at around 50%,\" Singleton says. \"The core message of what they are saying is that independent and small practices are alive and well and a large portion of our delivery system.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T15:39:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
