The ChiNext board 399006, -3.99% , composed of small-cap stocks, fell 2%.\nOfficials have taken a number of steps in recent days to shore up investor confidence--from cash injections into the financial system to interest rate cuts--after nearly three weeks of volatile trading has wiped out some gains from a yearlong rally. Even after recent declines, though, China’s main stock market has almost doubled in value over the past year.\nOn Wednesday, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges lowered fees on securities transactions by about a third after sharp stock selloffs. Both the Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Composite are down more than 20% from recent highs, marking bear territory.\nAlso Wednesday, the China Securities Regulatory Commission amended rules governing stock purchases funded by borrowed money, a move intended to limit the forced selling of shares as losses incur. Such selling has added pressure to an already battered market in recent weeks. So-called margin trading has driven much of the increase in China’s stock prices over the past year. The CSRC abolished regulations that forced brokers to recall loans of customers whose leverage exceeds maximum levels, allowing brokers instead to negotiate rollovers of loans directly with clients, Xinhua reported.\n“The CSRC announcement will bring forward the point at which sufficient leverage has been bled out of the system for the rally to resume,” analysts from ING wrote in a research report.\nElsewhere in Asia, stocks rose in early trading after European markets stabilized on Wednesday amid recovering investor confidence, despite the absence of progress in debt talks between Greece and its creditors.\nGreece will hold a referendum Sunday to decide whether to accept creditors’ demands--a vote that effectively is over whether the country should stay in the eurozone.\n“If it’s Armageddon, the markets seem oblivious to it and despite some risk aversion there’s hardly any panic,” analysts from Société Générale wrote in a research report. “Some assets are even gaining ground against the odds.”\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average NIK, +0.95% rose 1.2%, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index XJO, +1.52% gained 0.8%. South Korea’s Kospi Composite SEU, +0.45% was up 0.3%. The euro rose against the dollar, up 0.3% at $1.1070.\nHong Kong’s market reopened Thursday after a public holiday on Wednesday, with the Hang Seng Index HSI, +0.12% last up 0.2%. Hong Kong listings of Chinese companies HSCEI, -1.51% , known as H-shares, fell 1.5%.\nMacau casino stocks soared after June casino revenues declined by the slowest rate since January--albeit by a sharp 36%--and China eased visa restrictions for travelers to the former Portuguese colony. Galaxy Entertainment Group 0027, +13.27% rose 11.3% while Sands China Ltd 1928, +12.07% jumped 14.8%.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T12:27:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
