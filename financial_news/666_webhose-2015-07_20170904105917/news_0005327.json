Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce says he is not a \"xenophobic loony\" for passionately opposing the Shenhua Watermark mine approval, saying the suggestion from the project's manager Paul Jackson was \"desperately disappointing\".\nTensions over Environment Minister Greg Hunt's decision to grant the mine conditional approval simmered on Monday with Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Mr Hunt insisting the proposed mine was not on prime agricultural land, a view Mr Joyce rejects.\nAs Mr Joyce spoke in his home electorate of New England, Mr Abbott made his second media appearance promoting the agriculture white paper without his minister by his side at a farm near Goulburn, NSW.\nDespite their geographic distance, Mr Abbott attempted to hose down ongoing speculation of a split with Mr Joyce, saying he did not need to resign from cabinet over his opposition to the mine and his position in cabinet was safe\n\"Absolutely. He is doing an outstanding job,\" he said.\nLast week Mr Joyce said the conditional approval of the controversial mine in the Liverpool plains was a sign of a \"world gone mad\", leading Labor to call for him to resign for disobeying cabinet solidarity rules.\nShenhua Watermark's Australia manager Mr Jackson responded, saying the opposition was \"naive and xenophobic\" against Chinese investment.\nMr Joyce said building the mine in the Liverpool Plains would be like doing the same in Sydney's botanical gardens, and it had nothing to do with a hostility to Chinese investment.\n \"This section of the Liverpool plains is the best section.\n\"[Mr Jackson's comments] are desperately disappointing I don't see myself as a xenophobic loony as he politely points out. What I do think that shows is the abrupt nature of Mr Jackson,\" Mr Joyce said.\nAt odds over siting Mr Hunt and Mr Abbott contradicted Mr Joyce's statements on the siting of the mine.\n\"It is not on prime agricultural land,\" Mr Hunt said.\nMr Hunt, however, also played down a split with Mr Joyce, saying he was allowed to have his views.\n\"It wouldn't be reasonable for him to pretend he did not have those views,\" he said.\nMr Hunt also tried to redirect Mr Joyce's opposition away from federal cabinet, saying Mr Joyce was mostly against the former NSW Labor government's 2008 decision to grant a $300 million exploration licence to the company.\nTrade Minister Andrew Robb suggested on Sunday that Mr Abbott was \"managing\" Mr Joyce's fiery opposition.\n\"The Prime Minister is comfortable that it is not going to cause a fracturing within the Coalition,\" he said.\nMr Hunt also said his federal role was \"simply confined to the questions related to matters of national environmental significance\" and no other federal minister could have made a different decision in his shoes.\n\"The federal act is clear and prescriptive that if the scientific advice, the legal advice and the departmental advice all line up and we put in place the toughest conditions in Australian history, no federal environment minister could have reached another decision,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-07-13T08:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T21:07:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
