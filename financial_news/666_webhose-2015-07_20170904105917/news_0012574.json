Buerger. \nOne of the biggest challenges for the banking industry in the aftermath of the financial crisis is in navigating new and changing regulations, many of which have emanated from the Basel III Accord. Banking Pillars —now available through Amazon.com and RMA's website—walks readers through the latest Basel requirements and summarizes the most important issues on the regulatory landscape. \nThe book's areas of focus include key risk and performance indicators, sound capital planning, corporate governance, the liquidity coverage and leverage ratios, and requirements for systemically important financial institutions. Ultimately, the author notes, the book is about prudent and simple things in life that are important to human beings all over the world: having money (capital or solvency), having some cash in your pocket (liquidity), knowing your risks, operating with realistic and sustainable goals in mind, and acting as an honest businessperson. \nBuerger is Managing Director of Risk & More and specializes in banking- and risk management-related consulting and advisory projects. Within the last three years, he has also provided tailored training services to banks, institutions, and corporations in many financial centers around the world, including North America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Prior to this Buerger worked in banking for 20 years with Commerzbank in Frankfurt and London and UniCredit in Munich. \nBuerger recently spoke at RMA's Governance, Compliance, and Operational Risk (GCOR) Conference, and is slated to appear at the 2015 RMA Annual Risk Management Conference in the fall. \n\"Peter is able to present technical subject matter in a clear way that sticks with his audience, whether he is delivering a keynote speech, leading a training session, or writing an article or book,\" said Bill Githens, RMA's President and CEO. \"I highly recommend Banking Pillars to anyone who is interested in or affected by the far-reaching impact of Basel III.\" \nBuerger said, \"I truly enjoyed writing this book and would like to express my sincere gratitude to RMA for its support during the process. It is an honor and a privilege to be associated with RMA. Further, I would like to acknowledge the large number of individuals I have met and worked with since 1990, as they all contributed to some extent to the experience and know-how in this book.\" \nBanking Pillars is available now in paperback at Amazon.com and through the RMA website at www.rmahq.org .
