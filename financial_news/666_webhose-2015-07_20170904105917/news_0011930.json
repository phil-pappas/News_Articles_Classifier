I apologise for my wording and take responsibility for upsetting those involved, and I was careless in my actions,\" she wrote. \n\"The issue I regrettably tried to raise was about parental negligence and the precautions needed to ensure the safety of those who are unable to care for themselves. \"I never aimed to target or isolate this issue to one family. Again, for my actions and have the family in my thoughts.\" \nHooper later deactivated her Twitter account. \n\"As I said on Sunday, the views she expressed in her tweet were distressing, and are obviously not shared by me, or the Herald on Sunday ,said Alexander. \n\"I have also apologised to a family spokesman for the contents of the tweet and the distress it caused them.\" \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T04:34:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
