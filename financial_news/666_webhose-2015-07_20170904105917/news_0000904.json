Similar fears saw Chinese vendor Huawei booted off the national broadband network.\nBut the groups said they were \"alarmed\" by the lack of an appeals process for any decision made by agencies under the new system.\n\"The associations are alarmed by the lack of an appeals process for decisions made under the new sections,\" they said. \"Given the severe penalties associated with non-compliance, an appeals process seems imperative.\"\nThe groups were also worried that confidential information could be shared with a disparate range of agencies, from obvious players such as as the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to the State Emergency Services â€“ all of which could keep the information for as long as it was felt necessary.\nThe joint opposition to the government's measures represented a powerful and embarrassing challenge just as Prime Minister Tony Abbott attempts to use national security to boost his public standing.\nOne of Mr Abbott's most popular attributes with voters was his perceived strength in national security issues. He held a cyber-security conference in Sydney last week with some of the nation's leading chief executives to discuss the need to boost the safety of services and citizens on the internet.\n\"A spokeswoman for Senator Brandis declined to comment and referred back to an earlier press release, which said it was vital to maintain the security and resilience of telecommunications networks.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:38:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
