Wojtowicz has ended a longtime practice of avoiding foreclosure on properties with delinquencies of less than $1,700. \nDavid Szymanski, the county's chief deputy treasurer, says it's bad for neighborhoods but he notes: \"If you don't pay your taxes, your neighbor is subsidizing them for you. That's not fair.\" \nThe tally is down from about 67,000 Detroit properties served with foreclosure notices last fall. That's because 40,000 owners agreed to payment plans and other programs. There have been 139,000 mortgage and tax foreclosures in Detroit since 2005. \nInformation from: The Detroit News, http://detnews.com/ \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T15:29:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
