I don’t know what the actual analysis would reveal. I think that if the heads are important there would be some deterioration, whether it is significant or not I do not know.”\nIn April, the department of financial services had relaxed the eligibility criteria for appointment of heads of public sector banks.\nWhile the age limit was increased from 55 to 57 years, the mandatory board-level experience for the applicants was reduced to one year from three years to invite more experienced talent for heading large public sector banks.\nIn December, the government had appointed Managing Director and CEO in four state-owned banks — Indian Overseas Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, United Bank of India and Vijaya Bank. The MD and CEO of Syndicate Bank was appointed in May.\nFirst Published on July 2, 2015 4:05 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T09:04:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
