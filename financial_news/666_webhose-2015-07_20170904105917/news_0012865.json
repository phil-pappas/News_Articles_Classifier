The growth was due to the number of cattle exported on hoof that increased 185.5% compared to a decline of 58.6% register in the same quarter of 2014,\" said Kamatuka.The NSA also reported that the utility sector recorded an estimated growth of 7.5% in real added value in the first quarter of 2015 compared to a decline of 3% in real value added in the corresponding quarter of 2014.
