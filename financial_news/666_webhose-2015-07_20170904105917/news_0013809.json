A third consecutive gain in monthly new orders internationally is supporting their optimism as they reckon it’s the best lead indicator of demand for goods.\nThe upbeat tones stand in contrast to that of the International Monetary Fund, which this week said the world economy will grow 3.3 percent in 2015, below the 3.5 percent it estimated in April.
