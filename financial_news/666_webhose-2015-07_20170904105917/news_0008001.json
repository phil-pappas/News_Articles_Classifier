The annual comparison has been adjusted to take into account the new lending rules introduced in April 2014, the BBA said.\nRichard Woolhouse, chief economist at the BBA, said: “The housing market is beginning to hot up again, with a pick-up in the number of mortgage approvals for the last month.\n“Interestingly, we’ve also seen an increase in the number of people remortgaging, which could be down to savvy borrowers taking advantage of competitive deals on fixed-rate mortgages ahead of a possible rise in interest rates.”\nThe figures are for a period before the Bank of England governor’s recent warning that interest rates could rise at the turn of the year , which is likely to prompt more borrowers to consider locking in at current low rates.\nMark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said confidence in the housing market had improved since the election.\n“However, the real growth in lending has been on the remortgaging side, with borrowers keen to snap up a cheap fixed-rate mortgage. With Mark Carney’s recent comments about a potential rate rise at the turn of the year, we expect to see significant growth in the number of people remortgaging in coming months,” he said.\n“Anecdotally, the first rate rise is the trigger point for many people remortgaging but it may even be the second or third increase, as that is when there is a significant impact on a household’s expenditure and people then remortgage to ‘save’ money. However, by then the best fixed rates will have long gone.”\nThe financial website Moneyfacts said the two-year fixed rate mortgage had fallen from 3.67% a year ago to 2.75%.\nCharlotte Nelson, from the site said: “With Mark Carney’s announcement that base rate is likely to rise in the near future, these low rates will not be around for long.\n“Borrowers still sitting on their SVR or coming to the end of a fixed mortgage deal need to act fast to secure a low rate.”\nThe BBA’s figures for unsecured consumer borrowing showed a rise in credit card use in June, with 231m purchases made worth a total of £13.1bn. Two-thirds of credit card accounts were active during the month – the highest proportion in four years – but 42% of all balances attracted no interest.\nBorrowing through personal loans remained static, with £1.6bn of new loans taken out as in May, but consumers went into their overdrafts by a collective £227m after two months of paying them off.\nPersonal deposits into savings and current accounts increased by £3bn – well above the six-month average of £1.6bn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T15:59:30.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
