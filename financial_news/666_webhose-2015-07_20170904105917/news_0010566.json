But I want to ensure that all this money is clean money. \n\"There is no place for dirty money in Britain. Indeed, there should no place for dirty money anywhere. \" \nOver 100,000 property titles are registered to overseas companies, with more than 36,000 properties in London owned by offshore firms. In total, some £122bn of property in England and Wales is owned by offshore companies. \nAccording to Transparency International, 75% of properties where owners are under investigation for corruption made use of foreign companies to shroud the property's ownership in secrecy. \nMr Cameron will link corruption to poverty, lack of growth and the migrant crisis – and further claim it is fuelling religious extremism. \nHe will say that defeating the \"cancer of corruption in all its forms\" will \"strike the biggest blow for our generation in the struggle to ensure greater prosperity in every part of the world\". \nCampaign groups including Transparency International and Global Witness have welcomed the move. \nChido Dunn of Global Witness said: \"Some of the Gaddafi family’s stolen loot ended up in London – a famous example but far from a one-off. \n\"Unless we know who is behind these companies and where their money has come from, the cash will keep pouring in.\" \nMr Dunn said the move should also apply to Britain's overseas territories, while Transparency International said other G20 nations also need to take these \"significant steps\". \nThe Prime Minister has chosen to give the speech in Singapore to highlight a successful anti-corruption drive by the island state's founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who died earlier this year. \n\"One of the most understated, but most important elements of a rules-based world order is a commitment to transparency and to tackling corruption,\" he will say. \n\"No one understood that better than Lee Kuan Yew. It was his commitment to tackling corruption that helped to give people confidence to invest in this incredible country.\" \nLater this week, Mr Cameron will be visiting Malaysia, where his counterpart Najib Razak is defending himself from allegations of corruption from an official investigation into an investment fund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T08:52:45.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
