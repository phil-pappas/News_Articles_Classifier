Council's business committee Tuesday and will now advance to the health committee for consideration. Under the proposed legislation, acute-care and psychiatric hospitals would be required to keep a certain ratio of nurses on duty for patients at all times under threat of a $25,000 a day penalty. The rules range from a 1:1 ratio in the operating room to a 1:6 ratio in behavioral health units. A similar measure floundered in the health committee in 2013. But earlier this year, council chairman Phil Mendelson revived the legislation", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T14:50:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
