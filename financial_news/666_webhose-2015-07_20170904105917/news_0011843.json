What and when you collect will make a huge difference to your lifetime benefits.\nToday’s Social Security question is about what benefits are available to people with multiple exes.\nQuestion : I have recently become a widow and have been talking to Social Security. I am 65 and was looking to retire at 66. I was married for 26 years before my divorce and married 11 years to my deceased spouse. Social Security will only give me the SSI from my deceased spouse (11 years) which is larger, but I read that I should be able to also collect at least half of my first spouse’s also? Social Security did not say that at all. I would like to retire but just do not know what to do or whom to believe.\nMy stepmother was able to collect Social Security from her deceased husband as well as her own Social Security. How? Somewhere it feels like I am getting ripped off.\nAnswer : I’m extremely sorry to hear of your loss. I know those words aren’t worth much, but they are sincere. Let me see if I can be of real help.\nI’ll ignore the earnings test that may eliminate all or most of your benefits before you reach full retirement age (66) regardless of which spouse you collect on. Social Security is, I think, wrong about your ability to choose the ex or deceased spouse on whose work record you want to collect.\nBut the bottom line is that you can’t collect more than one full benefit at a time. If you are entitled to benefits on more than one account at the same time, you essentially only receive the higher benefit. Read “ When Social Security will let you take only one benefit at a time .” So, your stepmother likely received her own benefit, plus the difference between that amount and the higher widow’s benefit payable on her deceased husband’s record. In some cases, however, you can file for the full lower benefit first, then apply for the higher benefit at a later date.\nSo, depending on your earnings, your optimal strategy is either A) to collect benefits on your deceased spouse as soon as possible and then collect your own retirement benefit at 70 or B) collect your own retirement benefit right away (plus excess divorcée spousal benefits if your full benefit is less than one-half of your ex-husband’s), then collect widow’s benefits when you reach full retirement age.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/rtea.html", "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/when-social-security-will-only-let-you-take-one-benefit-at-a-time/"], "published": "2015-07-02T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T16:59:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
