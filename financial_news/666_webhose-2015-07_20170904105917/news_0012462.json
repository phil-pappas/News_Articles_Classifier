Whether it's about business or everyday life, Russel knows sometimes you simply have to go against the tide,\" says the book blurb.\nAt least Howcroft seems to have a proper day job, unlike his Gruen co-panellist Todd Sampson , whose CEO title at Leo Burnett does not seem to interfere with his extensive extracurricular activities.\nThis includes his own TV show, Redesign My Brain , and boardroom roles at CBD publisher Fairfax Media, and Qantas.\nHis long list of activities means he does not even have space on his Twitter page to include his role at Leo Burnett. Surely he is not worried about second-hand smoke issues from the ad agency's close role with big tobacco?\nIt probably helps that the Twitterati are suitably distracted by the slow striptease, which has recently seen Sampson swap his trademark T-shirt for a bare torso – all in the name of publicity, of course.\nHow times have changed. Going back five years, CBD found a publicity still from The Gruen Transfer that shows Sampson was willing to don a long-sleeve, collared shirt on at least one occasion.\nEx MasterChef Speaking of Ten. The former executive chairman who fell on his sword for Rupert Murdoch on Monday, Hamish McLennan , may have been displaying a sense of humour by lunching at Sydney pasta bowl Machiavelli on Wednesday.\nHe was suited up but no sign of a CV.\nAd man Harold Mitchell , who chairs Free TV, was at a separate table viewing the portraits he curated for the corporate diner.\nCabin fever Virgin Australia's workaholic rev head, John Borghetti , will have to a burn a bit more of the midnight oil to catch his Qantas nemesis, Alan Joyce .\nVirgin reported a $94 million net loss for the 2014-15 financial year, slightly behind the flying roo's resurgent earnings for the same period that are expected to fall just shy of the $1 billion mark.\nVirgin's number crunchers would argue that Qantas has given itself quite a financial tailwind with the recent multibillion-dollar write-offs, but it is the bottom-line numbers that will have everyone's attention.\nThe big question is whether Borghetti is focused on this race, or the supermarket aisles at Woolies?\nFair cop So, Greg Medcraft 's corporate cop shop has offered a bit more clarity on the user-pays model it is adopting, now that Treasurer Joe Hockey has stiffed ASIC on the funding front.\nIt will make the corporate wrongdoers foot the bill for its work. Pity it isn't backdating its billing given the extensive work it has done on our big banks and their wealth-stripping operations.\nIt would be a great place to start given the restrictions ASIC is placing on its recovery efforts, which include judging the offender's ability to pay.\nAs bank robber Willie Sutton reputedly told a reporter who asked why he robbed banks: \"Because that's where the money is\".\nOf course, ASIC has to actually win its actions before it can send the bill, which is easier said than done. Just ask ABC Learning's Eddy Groves , and Fortescue's Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest .\nWealth effect We can do the final numbers on NAB's grand adventure in the American mid west with Great Western Bank.\nThe exit, engineered by new broom Andrew Thorburn , yielded $1.464 billion in sales proceeds for a bank now worth just under $2 billion in Aussie peso.\nSo that's a big thanks from the new shareholders whose investment has performed much better than NAB's shares in the same period.\nNAB will also be wearing a $400 million loss on the valuation in its book valuation, just to rub salt into the wounds for Aussie investors.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T01:09:07.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
