Actually, this is not a difficult question to answer because history is rife with examples of countries being unable to pay back loans. In most of these cases there is a restructuring, which boils down to a new repayment schedule. In many cases, a portion of the debt is written off, described as a \"haircut\" for the creditors. Since 1950, there have been 633 cases of sovereign debt restructuring involving 95 countries, according to an IMF study of 2012. Of these, in 186 cases, the creditors were private entities like banks and bond holders, while in 447 cases the creditors were government entities, functioning under the informal grouping called the Paris Club . So, Greece, led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras , but without finance minister Yannis Varafoukis , who has resigned after the referendum, will have to sit down with the troika — European Central Bank , the IMF and the European Commission — to work out a repayment schedule, and perhaps a haircut. Days before the referendum, the IMF said in a debt sustainability report that the only way out is to give Greece a 50 billion euro loan to keep it afloat for the next three years and put in place a moratorium on repayments for the next 20 years. There is also the possibility that a portion of the debt may be written off, with the creditors accepting a haircut. This in itself is not an unprecedented step. A study by sovereign debt expert Christophe Trebesch of the University of Munich found that of the 180 debt restructurings done since 1970, 123 involved only rescheduling, while 57 involved a haircut. Creditors on an average accepted a 37 per cent haircut. The haircuts varied between 23 per cent and 53 per cent. It also found that haircuts were an increasing trend in the past few decades compared to the 1970s and 1980s. So, there is a distinct possibility that Greece and its Euro creditors will hammer out a deal which will postpone repayment and may also involve some portion of debt getting written off. Why should the troika accept a rescheduling? Because there is no other option. They have tried to implement an austerity programme since 2010, which involves cuts in Greek government spending, freeze on wages, better tax compliance and others. At that time the debt was owed to private banks. In the restructuring of a $266 billion bailout given in 2010 by the troika, which effectively paid off the private creditors and the debt got transferred to multilateral government entities like ECB and IMF. But the austerity has failed to resolve the crisis. The Euro-group countries, especially the dominant economies like Germany and France will also be worried about contagion — spreading of debt risk to other countries having huge debt overhangs. While Greece had a debt to GDP ratio of 177 per cent in 2014, Spain (98 per cent), Italy (132 per cent), Ireland (110 per cent), Portugal (130 per cent) were also heavily indebted and could be at risk. Any further spread of the crisis would be lethal for the whole Euro area and creditors to Greece will want to limit the risk.
