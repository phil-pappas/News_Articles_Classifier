The NCT will go into effect on July 1, 2015, and the first NCT returns will be due on June 30, 2016. \nThe applicable tax rate is based on the industry in which the business entity is primarily engaged. Any person engaged in a business is considered a business entity, including natural persons required to file with the Internal Revenue Service a Schedule C, Schedule E, or Schedule F on their Form 1040. The term “engaging in business” means commencing, conducting, or continuing a business, and the liquidation of such a business. \nEvery business entity engaging in business in Nevada during the taxable year (the 12-month period beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30) is required to file a tax return within 45 days after the end of the taxable year, regardless of whether the business entitys Nevada receipts exceed the $4,000,000 threshold. \nUnlike a traditional gross receipts tax, the NCT provides for numerous exclusions and deductions. The NCT provides for exclusions based both on taxpayer status and type of revenue generated. \n“business entity”) include the following (subject to additional qualifications): Natural persons not required to file with the Internal Revenue Service a Schedule C, Schedule E, or Schedule F on their Form 1040; Governmental entities; Tax-exempt organizations that qualify under 26 U.S.C. 501(c); Credit unions; Grantor trusts; Trusts qualified under 26 U.S.C. 401(a); Passive entities; Persons whose activities within Nevada are confined to ownership, maintenance, and management of intangible investments of such persons or certain statutory trusts or business trusts; and Persons who take part in exhibitions held in Nevada, but are not required to obtain Nevada business licenses. \n“gross revenue”), including the following (subject to additional qualifications): Cash discounts; Complimentary goods or services; Amounts realized from transactions subject to, described in, or equivalent to the following sections of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC”): 118, 331, 332, 336, 337, 338, 351, 355, 368, 721, 731, 1031, or 1033; Amounts indirectly realized from a reduction of an expense or deduction; Donations to tax-exempt organizations that qualify under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3); and Amounts that are not considered revenue under generally accepted accounting principles. Gross revenue attributable to dividends and interest upon bonds or securities of governmental entities; Gross receipts used to determine license fees pursuant to NRS 463.370; Gross proceeds used to determine the excise tax on net proceeds from mineral extraction and royalties pursuant to NRS 362.100 to 362.240; An amount equal to excise tax paid under chapter 369 of NRS (relating to alcohol); Amounts related to the taxes and fees imposed pursuant to chapter 680B of NRS (related to insurance); The amount of the premiums used to determine the taxes imposed pursuant to NRS 694C.450 and 685A.180 (related to captive insurers and nonadmitted insurance); Amounts received from a health care provider (this deduction is limited to 50 percent of the amounts received if the business entity is a health care provider that is a health care institution); For employee leasing companies, amounts received from clients for wages, payroll taxes on those wages, employee benefits, and workers compensation benefits for employees leased to the client company; Pass-through revenue (including certain advances and reimbursements and revenue received by a business entity that is part of an affiliated group from another member of the affiliated group); Tax basis of securities and loans sold by the taxpayer, as determined for federal income tax purposes; Revenue derived from the operation of a facility located on property owned or leased by the federal government and managed or operated primarily to house members of the U.S. Armed Forces; Interest in Dividends and distributions from corporations, and distributive or proportionate shares of receipts and income from a pass-through entity; Receipts from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of an asset described in sections 1221 or 1231 of the IRC, without regard to the length of time the taxpayer held the asset. Receipts from hedging transactions; Receipts from loan repayments; The principal amount received under a repurchase agreement or loan; Proceeds received from the issuance of the taxpayers own stock, options, warrants, put calls, from the sale of the taxpayer’s treasury stock, or as contributions to the capital of the taxpayer; Proceeds received from insurance policies (unless for the loss of business revenue); Litigation damages (to the extent such damages would not have been considered gross receipts for purposes of the NCT if received without litigation); Bad debts expensed for federal income tax purposes; Returns and refunds; Amounts received from the sale of an account receivable (to the extent receipts from the underlying transaction are excludable from gross receipts); and Amounts received from a passive entity in which the taxpayer owns an interest (but only to the extent the net income of the passive entity was generated by the gross revenue of another business entity). \nThe manner in which revenue is sitused to Nevada depends upon both the type of property and type of transaction involved in generating such revenue. \nGross revenue from the lease of tangible personal property is sitused to Nevada to the extent the property is located or used in Nevada. \n\n\n’s benefit in Nevada bears to the purchaser’s benefit everywhere. The physical location at which the purchaser of a service ultimately uses or receives the benefit of the services that was purchased is paramount in determining the proportion of the benefit in Nevada to the benefit everywhere. \n\n“primarily engaged.” If a taxpayer is engaged in business in more than one business category, the taxpayer is “deemed to be primarily engaged in the business category in which the highest percentage of its Nevada gross revenue is generated.” The taxpayer must designate the business category in which it is primarily engaged on its first return and may not change its business category designated without formal approval from the department. The NCT sets forth 26 possible business categories, each corresponding with at least one NAICS category, with rates ranging from 0.051 percent to 0.331 percent. If a taxpayer’s business does not fit into any of the specific business categories, then its Nevada receipts will be taxed under either the “other service” category at a 0.142 percent rate or the “unclassified” business category at a 0.128 percent rate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T00:10:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
