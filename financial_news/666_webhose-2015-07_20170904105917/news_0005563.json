Photo: Louise Kennerley\nAPRA lifts mortgage capital on big banks It is a near certainty that banks will pass on some of their newly imposed capital safety cost to their customers by way of charging higher interest on loans or paying lower interest on deposits.\nThe finance regulator APRA has placed higher capital requirements on the four large banks plus Macquarie - which means they will need to raise a combined $12 billion.\nIn large part the booming residential property market is behind the regulator move to ensure that the banks have more capital in reserve against the mortgages they write.\nThe heating property market which many experts say is displaying all the hallmarks of a bubble has worried regulators.\nSix months ago, the regulator took some more gentle steps to flex it muscle to hose down property lending but the mortgage lending figures suggest there has been plenty of growth and property prices in Sydney and Melbourne are still rising.\n The recent Financial Services Inquiry urged APRA and the government to fortify the financial system by mandating the banks to bolster capital reserves.\nMore stringent capital needs will also prompt banks to take a more hardline assessment of their lending risk.\nSome higher risk loans that have been approved in the past may no longer make the cut - this includes the booming sector of investment loans to buy real estate.\nIncreasing the amount of capital that needs to be held is an expensive exercise for banks and it increase their costs.\nThe banks will have two choices when faced with higher costs. One is to content themselves with producing a lower return on capital. This outcome is possible but not likely.\nThe other option is to pass on the cost increase to customers. Like most businesses that face higher costs the pass through is most common - unless competition doesn't allow it.\nBut there are only five banks faced with the new capital requirements. And while it can't be said that they will act in concert, history suggests their response will be similar.\nHaving said that some banks are more exposed than others to the new rules imposed by APRA that will come into effect in a year.\nThose with larger mortgage books will be hit disproportionately harder.\nWestpac has already said it will be up for about $3 billion to get its capital levels into appropriate territory and the Commonwealth Bank says it needs to bolster by 97 basis points (almost 1 per cent). It is estimated this could cost CBA up to $4 billion.\nThe National Australia Bank which is in the process of raising billions via an equity placement and asset sales, and has a much smaller mortgage book, will still need to add 70 basis point in capital .\nANZ which also a smaller mortgage loan books that the two market leaders said it will need $2.3 billion in additional capital - or 55 basis points.\nThe banks already knew the increase in credit risk weighting on mortgages was coming and have instituted pre-emptive moves to raise additional funds. SOme like Westpac have used dividend reinvestment schemes and sold down its stake in BT Investment Management to bolster capital.\nNAB is in the process of selling its UK and US assets and has undertaken a $5.5 billion equity issue.\nThe bad news for the banks - and potentially for bank customers - is that the regulator is not yet done.\nLast week it said the big five Australian banks would need to add 200 basis points of capital to be comfortably among the top quartile in the world. The moves announced on Monday will get them less than half of the way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T12:13:57.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
