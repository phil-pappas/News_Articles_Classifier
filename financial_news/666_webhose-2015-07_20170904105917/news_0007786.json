Expected corporate ratings are BB-/B from S&P/Fitch. \nWhispers of mid 6% are being heard on a US$750m 7NC3 from Sable International Finance Limited (Cable & Wireless) as it kicks off roadshows via BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) , JP Morgan, RBC and Scotiabank. Expected ratings are Ba3/B. \nBrazilian conglomerate Cosan Overseas has wrapped up roadshows week after marketing a possible 144A/Reg S bond offering. \nBank of America Merrill Lynch, Bradesco, Itau BBA, Morgan Stanley (Shenzhen: 002588.SZ - news ) and Santander organized the meetings. Expected ratings are Ba2/BB/BB+ by Moody's, S&P and Fitch.
