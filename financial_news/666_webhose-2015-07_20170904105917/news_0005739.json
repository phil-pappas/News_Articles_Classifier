This will allow ERA to revisit the project's economics over time.\"\nRio has offered to cover any funding shortfall that may arise in the rehabilitation process, so long as ERA agrees to give up hope of a future expansion.\nThe traditional owners of the Ranger site indicated in June that they would not support an extension of the Ranger lease beyond its current expiry in 2021.\nThe traditional owners could not be contacted on Friday but were expected to make a statement over the weekend.\nERA has not mined at the Ranger site for more than four years but has continued to sell uranium oxide extracted from stockpiles at Ranger.\nThe company produced 390 tonnes of uranium oxide in the June quarter, which was 20 per cent less than in the March quarter.\nERA also updated its mineral resource estimate for the Ranger expansion project, which is now estimated to contain 43,858 tonnes of uranium oxide, up from 34,761 tonnes.\nBut the increased resource size was partially due to ERA lowering its uranium grade threshold, which enabled it to include ores that were previously excluded from the resource estimate for being too low grade.\nERA shares closed half a cent lower at 39Â¢.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T07:41:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
