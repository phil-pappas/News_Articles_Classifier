John McCain (R-AZ), the man who almost single-handedly launched the political career of one of the most divisive and ill-equipped people ever to pollute a modern day presidential ticket, blasting another politician for stirring up the “crazies” in the Republican Party. \nRelated: As Trump Surges in the Polls, Hispanic Voters Flock to Hillary Clinton \nThat man was, as anybody paying attention well knows, real estate magnate and dinner-guest-from-hell Donald J. Trump. There was no need for Trump to respond to McCain, but there were a lot of options for him if he wanted to do so. \n“Crazies?” he could have said. “Two words: Sarah Palin.” Boom. Argument over. Advantage: Trump. \nOr, he could have gone straight to the point that the “crazies” McCain was referring to were actually his own constituents, who showed up to cheer Trump at an Arizona rally. \nInstead, Trump decided to attack McCain on the one issue on which is he is objectively invulnerable: his status as a war hero. McCain, a pilot shot down over Vietnam, was injured in the crash, wounded again when he was discovered, and then tortured during more than 5 years of captivity. To this day, McCain can’t lift his arms above his head because of his injuries. Given the option of early release, he refused, insisting that men held longer than he had been had to be returned home first. \nRelated: After Trump Claims McCain Was No War Hero, the GOP Hits Back \nNevertheless, at a conservative summit in key early primary state Iowa, Trump ripped into McCain, “He’s a war hero because he was captured,” Trump said. “I like the people who weren’t captured.” \nAmid the firestorm of criticism that followed, Trump correctly pointed out that he is leading the GOP field in national polls and that some of the most vocal members of the GOP lining up to denounce him happened to be presidential candidates with the lowest poll numbers. \nHe refused to apologize for denigrating McCain’s service. On Twitter and in campaign press releases, he continued to attack McCain, claiming that the Arizona Republican has failed to do enough to help American veterans. \nIn an interview with ABC’s Martha Raddatz on Sunday morning, he said his appearance in Iowa had been a huge success. \n“When I left the room it was a total standing ovation,” he bragged. \nHe added, “I’m very disappointed in John McCain…He’s done nothing to help the vets. They are living in hell.” \nRelated: Who Are These People Giving Money to Donald Trump? \nTrump went on to defend, with much hand-waving, his own multiple academic exemptions from the draft as well as his medical exemption based on a bone spur in his foot – which foot, he couldn’t remember. \nHis fellow GOP presidential candidates – some of whom had been conspicuously unwilling to criticize him for calling most illegal Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists – didn’t hold back this time. They lashed out saying he was unfit to be commander in chief of the armed forces and he should drop out of the race. \nEven the GOP itself, which does its best to stay above primary infighting, got in on the act. \n“There is no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably,” said Republican National Committee chief strategist and communications director Sean Spicer. \nTelling Trump he has no place in the GOP could be a good thing for the party, if he packs his tents and leaves. But from the Bull Moose Party to Ross Perot to Ralph Nader, third party candidates have a history of playing hell with presidential election, and the GOP may need to be careful what it wishes for. \nGiven the extraordinary Republican infighting over the weekend, one might have expected the Democrats to just make some popcorn and settle back and wallow in Schadenfreude. \nNot so much. \nOn Saturday, the progressive Netroots Nation conference in Los Angeles attracted the two Democratic candidates who most arguably represent the party’s left wing: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley. \nBoth can make credible arguments for being demonstrably to the left of Hillary Clinton, the prohibitive frontrunner, on most social issues. Yet both were attacked and interrupted by protestors focused on police violence against African Americans. \nO’Malley was more or less chased from the stage, and faced massive criticism for making what, in most other contexts, would have been the mundane observation that, “Black lives matter, white lives matter, all lives matter.” \nRelated: 15 Facts You Didn’t Know About Donald Trump \nHowever, in the context created by the protestors – members of the organization Black Lives Matter – his comments made him look as though he was equating the demonstrably unequal treatment of African Americans by police with the less frequent abuse of white suspects. \nSanders tried to push back against the protestors, but his appearance was also cut short by his interviewer in the face of vocal protestors. \nOnly 16 months to the election.
