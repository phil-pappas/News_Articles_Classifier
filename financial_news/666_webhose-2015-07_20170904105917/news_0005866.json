Send questions to Noel Whittaker at asknoel@fairfaxmedia.com.au The analysis is from consumers' VedaScore, which is a score out of 1200, produced by credit reporting agency Veda that summarises an individual's credit record.\nPeople living in the inner cities have poor credit ratings. Photo: Tamara Voninski TVZ\nIt is a reflection of someone's behaviour in repaying credit, such as making credit card payments, on time.\nAdvertisement The higher the score the less of a credit risk is the consumer to a lender.\nThe national average VedaScore is 760. Residents of inner Sydney have a score of 722 on average. Melbourne city has a score of 724.\nThat makes inner Sydney equal 6th worst region in NSW and Melbourne city the equal third-worst area in Victoria.\nOnly one area, Manningham East in Victoria has what Veda considers an \"excellent\" rating of 834 and the highest score nationally.\nKu-ring-gai in NSW is number two with a score of 823 followed by Burnside in South Australia with a score of 822, considered by Veda as \"very good\" scores.\nWhile there is no surprise that some of the most disadvantaged areas of both cities features among those with the lowest scores, the inclusion of both inner areas was not expected.\nIf is often thought that it is those in their 30s and 40s with young families who are under financial pressure are likely to have lower credit scores.\nA spokesperson for Veda, Belinda Diprose, says on average, across all areas, Australian's have good credit scores but there are some areas where people are struggling more than others and have a higher risk.\nShe says the worst regions have young families, in their 30s and 40s, who are juggling many expenses, such as childcare, education and the daily cost of living.\nDiprose says Veda research has shown that young families are feeling the pressure with 17 per cent at risk of financial trouble in the next 12 months. About 11 per cent of those in their 20s and early 30s and of baby boomers are at risk of financial trouble in the next 12 months. ï»¿\nThe shift to comprehensive credit reporting from March last year means that much more data is now being collected on consumers.\nMonthly payment histories on loans and credit cards can be shown on credit reports as well as any missed payments of more than 14 days noted.\nBefore March, credit reports, which credit agencies provide to lenders when they check on applicants, held only limited information.\nA VedaScore of 200 means the person has 50 per cent chance of having an \"adverse credit event\" within the next 12 months. A score of 621 to 510 under is considered \"average\". And a score of 509 and under is \"below average\" and puts those with this score in the bottom 20 per cent of Veda's credit active population.\nAccording to research by Veda from 2014, 78 per cent of Australians have never checked their credit report history and have no idea what is on their credit profile.\nCredit agencies are required to make available to consumers a free copy of their credit reports at least once a year.\n @jcollett_money", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@jcollett_money"], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T12:22:15.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
