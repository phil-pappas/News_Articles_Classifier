Then in March, it bought a 5 percent stake in Thomas Cook as part of a deal which it said could lead to greater collaboration between the two holiday firms. \nThe pair, which already have a relationship in France, said that they would aim to achieve 100 million euros (70.15 million pounds)of sales of Club Med holidays through Thomas Cook channels by 2018, a jump of 60 percent on current levels. \n\"This partnership aims to generate strong sales growth in the European countries where Thomas Cook is present, a real opportunity for both our groups,\" Club Med Chairman Henri Giscard d'Estaing said. \nThomas Cook, the world's oldest travel group and Europe's no.2 holiday company behind TUI Group (TUIT.L), will report its third-quarter results on July 30, which are expected to indicate the costs to the business of cancelling holidays in Tunisia after an attack in June which killed 38 tourists. \n(Reporting by Sarah Young; editing by Kate Holton)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T16:10:27.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
