Bloomberg by Ruth Callaghan Gone are the days when getting some work experience over summer meant photocopying documents and fetching coffee for the sales team.\nAs new figures – published in The Australian Financial Review/GradConnection list of The top 50 most popular internship employers – show, thousands of undergraduates each year are competing for prized vacation internships as a way to improve their employment chances.\nAnd the firms being targeted by students are those that offer hands-on, paid internships that could potentially fast-track them into jobs.\nDirector of the GradConnection graduate job placement service Mike Casey says universities have woken up to the importance of students spending time in the workplace to boost employment prospects, and employers also see benefits in working with students long before they finish their studies.\nAFR graphic \"What we see from our clients is that the majority use internship programs as a kind of 'try before you buy' in preparation for their graduate programs,\" Mr Casey says.\n\"They have a chance to work with interns, think about who they would like to keep on for the graduate programs, and who they are happy to have move on.\"\nGradConnection finds the big four consulting firms, with their structured internship and graduate programs, capture the most interest – in part reflecting the priorities of universities.\nBut the top 10 companies targeted by undergraduates include technology giant IBM, investment services companies Fidelity, Macquarie Group, and Telstra.\n \"In some of the more formal disciplines like accounting it is drilled into students that getting into a career means starting in a summer intern program, progressing to a graduate program, and that's the entry process,\" Mr Casey says.\n\"There are a lot of other students in other disciplines who don't realise that vacation programs are even available.\n\"Engineering is an interesting one, as a lot of universities require students to log a certain number of hours with work experience, but many students don't think about the different kinds of employers where they can get that experience.\"\nGlobal engineering group Aurecon ranks fifth overall and is the top-ranked intern target for students in most engineering courses, for example.\nBut among those studying electrical engineering, KPMG and PwC are lead employers of choice.\nWood McKenzie tops the list for those studying mining, oil and gas disciplines; Holden is top of the list for design students.\nTogether, the 10 leading companies capture more than half of all students clicking through to apply for internships, yet being popular can pose some challenges when it comes to sifting through applications.\nFor PwC, which tops the overall list with 6170 click-throughs from undergraduates – over 1000 more than next-ranked KPMG – this means weeding out those students motivated by brand recognition.\nThe firm puts candidates through a four-step process, including tests in numeracy, reasoning and personality traits, before requiring video interviews, group activities and interviews with partners, says Daniel Simons, human capital consultant at PwC.\nIt also weighs undergraduates based on whether they embody PwC's values before selecting 400 to 450 interns nationwide each year.\n\"What we are really looking for is how people apply our values in their own unique way,\" Mr Simons says.\n\"They are the students who reach out to us before applications opening. They are the ones who come up to us when we are on campus and talk about their interest in the firm.\n\"They have thought about our values as a firm and they have thought about how those values apply to them. They aren't just regurgitating something from our website.\"\nWhile accounting students make up a significant proportion of PwC interns, Mr Simons says discipline doesn't matter for the right candidates.\n\"We take a lot of tech students in software engineering and computer science; we also take electrical engineering students and those from backgrounds in risk and assurance,\" he says.\n\"Accounting makes up a big part of what we do, but there's a huge untapped area of technology and maths and science that we are interested in as well.\"\nOnce in, interns can take PwC's vacationer program, which runs from three to eight weeks, and they are encouraged to develop the role to match their interests and talents.\n\"It is up the candidate themselves,\" Mr Simons says.\n\"We give them work to begin with but if they have interest in a particular field, they can research that and undertake secondments. They are coached to look at the opportunities and to see where their skills could lead them. There are a lot of different opportunities.\"\nFor Deloitte, key characteristics in a successful intern include a passion for learning, exceptional critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as an ability to thrive in teams.\nThe firm looks for students with degree backgrounds including business, commerce, engineering, technology and law, with particular interest in those who can bring diverse experiences or backgrounds to the consultancy.\n\"We try and offer a fun and engaging program that aims to support summer vacationers and interns to determine their future career direction and to experience all the elements that make Deloitte a great place to start their careers,\" says Gemma Hudson, Deloitte talent graduate manager.\n\"There is the opportunity to be offered a graduate role for the future as a result of their placement with us.\"\nMultinational investment services group Fidelity took just three interns last year, but GradConnection recorded more than 1500 expressions of interest for its sought-after roles.\nPaul Taylor, who manages Fidelity's Australian equities portfolio, says there is no better way to test intern appetite for bottom-up investing than to put them to work straight away.\n\"I think why we end up at the top of these sorts of lists is that we give them a lot of responsibility,\" he says. \"You can get other companies where someone's an intern where they are preparing PowerPoint presentations or something like that. We get people to do the actual job for two or three months and, hopefully, it works really well for both of us.\"\nNew interns at Fidelity are given five or six companies to analyse and then sent to review that industry in depth.\n\"They talk to competitors, suppliers, distributors; they analyse the industry and its prospects,\" Mr Taylor says. \"They look at the valuation model of the company, do an earnings, cashflow and valuation balance sheet model for those companies, and then at the end of the two or three months they do an industry review.\n\"Of those five or six companies they recommend whether there are any we should buy.\"\nJust getting a foot in the door as an intern at Fidelity is difficult, with the recruitment process almost identical to that used to employ permanent staff.\nTo cap off several rounds of interviews, undergrads face what is called the P Test – spending half a day in an office with a prospectus and detailed information about a given company.\n\"At the end of the half day you have to present to the investment team: should we be buying or selling that company,\" Mr Taylor says. \"Based on the interviews plus that, we will hire the person as an intern.\"\nWhile he concedes it can be a daunting process, that's part of determining who will thrive in a challenging industry.\n\"We are looking for someone who loves investing, who loves finding out how companies make money, looking at valuing companies, and who wants to turn that into a career,\" Mr Taylor says.\n\"We want obviously very smart but also highly motivated, intellectually curious people who want to do this for the rest of their life.\n\"For the intern, they get an idea if this is what they want, as it will be what they will do day-in, day-out. For Fidelity, it is basically a three-month-long job interview.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T04:09:27.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
