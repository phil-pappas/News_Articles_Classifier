Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. surged on merger hopes. \nThe Saudi Arabian index fell in early trade but closed 0.2 percent higher at 9104 points. Telecommunications operator Zain KSA added 5.3 percent while Atheeb Telecom rose 1.7 percent in unusually heavy trade. \nZain has been strong since Sunday when rival Etihad Etisalat (Mobily) whose shares remain suspended said it had decided to increase provisions for \"Zain account receivables\" by SR800 million (213 million). \nSaudi Ground Services which listed last Thursday after an initial public offer at a price of SR50 per share climbed a further 1.4 percent to SR74.00 and was once more the most heavily traded stock. \nIt came well off its intra-day high of SR80.25 however after passing levels which analysts see as fair value; SICO for example has a target price of SR74. \nSalama Cooperative Insurance plunged 35 percent to SR19.00 after announcing plans for a rights issue between July 1 and 28. Shareholders will be entitled to buy 1.5 new shares for every share held at a price of 10 riyals. \nKingdom Holding fell 1.0 percent in thin trade. \nDubai's market also dropped in early trade but closed 0.1 percent higher as Amlak Finance the most heavily traded stock climbed 0.4 percent. \nAbu Dhabi slid 0.6 percent as blue chips First Gulf Bank and Etisalat lost 1.0 percent and 0.7 percent respectively. \nBut TAQA closed 5.7 percent higher at 0.74 dirham off a high of 0.80 dirham after sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Abu Dhabi might merge the company into another state-owned business to make its debt more manageable and try to turn around its performance. TAQA declined to comment. The stock has declined from 1.58 dirhams in December 2013. \nQatar's index fell 1.3 percent as banks came under profit-taking; Qatar National Bank lost 2.1 percent and Masraf Al Rayan slid 1.8 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T22:57:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
