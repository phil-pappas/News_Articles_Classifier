Pat Quinn . It culminated in a 1980 ballot measure to reduce the size of the House of Representatives by one-third, to 118 members. \n1984: Lawmakers create an outside Compensation Review Board to determine fair salary and cost-of-living increases. Board-proposed increases take effect unless both chambers vote to reject them. \n1990: Compensation Review Board provides for automatic annual inflation adjustments, provided lawmakers appropriate money for them. \n2008: After a 13.8 percent raise in 2007, a board-recommended 3.8 percent adjustment takes effect when the Senate — with intra-party name-calling between those who want the money and those who want to turn it away — takes no vote. \n2009: Lawmakers abolish the Compensation Review Board, but retain automatic cost-of-living adjustments. \n2013: Quinn, now the Democratic governor, vetoes money for legislative salaries. Democratic legislative leaders win a lawsuit that finds Quinn violated the state constitution's prohibition on \"changes in salary\" during legislative terms. \n2014: The Democratic-controlled Legislature makes the annual cost-of-living increase automatic, with no legislative approval necessary. But the General Assembly votes to reject the increase for that year anyway. \n2015: Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner disparages Democrats for accepting a 2 percent adjustment during a budget impasse. \nSource: Legislative Research Unit, news reports. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T18:29:11.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
