Let's not fool ourselves,\" Padoan said in the interview posted on the newspaper's website.\n\"Some believe that the way it works is more or less fine with minor adjustments. I think this is not enough,\" he said.\nPadoan's comments came days after a report in German magazine Der Spiegel that Germany was willing to discuss the creation of a euro zone finance minister who would have his own budget and the power to raise extra taxes.\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last month laid out a vision for tighter joint control over the currency zone's economies, including an eventual common euro zone treasury.\nItaly has long advocated tighter economic and political integration in the currency bloc.\nTo strengthen the single currency, Italy wants a wide set of measures including the swift completion of banking union, the establishment of a common euro zone budget and a common unemployment insurance scheme.
