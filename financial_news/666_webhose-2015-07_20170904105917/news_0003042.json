Editor's Pick   NEW DELHI: To attract more overseas money into the country, the Union Cabinet today cleared a proposal allowing foreign entities to invest in Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs). The decision will help make available more funds to start-ups, early stage ventures, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which are generally considered as high risk investments. Official sources said the Cabinet has given its approval for foreign investments in AIFs that are set up under Sebi regulations and would widen the avenues for overseas entities to put in their money. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced in this year's Budget that foreign investors would also be allowed to invest in the AIFs. They were set up in 2012 by the capital markets regulator Sebi as a new class of investment entity. AIFs are funds incorporated in India for the purpose of pooling in capital from Indian investors. The move would also reduce the pressure on the banking system to which the infrastructure sector looks for funding needs, they added. According to official sources, uncertainty in investors mind would be removed with the introduction of a clear cut written policy, which would not only improve the investment environment but also induce development activities. Now, foreign investments would be allowed in AIFs that are established as registered trust, structured as incorporated company or limited liability partnership. The same would be enabled in the FDI policy and FEMA regulations including foreign investment by way of units of AIFs set up as trust in terms of Sebi regulations, official sources said. AIFs -- which include private equity, venture capital and hedge funds -- are regulated by Sebi, but the Foreign Exchange Management regulations are governed by the RBI. These funds have been consistently gaining traction since coming into play in late 2012 and there were 135 AIFs registered with Sebi as on March 31, 2015. Collectively, these AIFs had raised investment commitments totalling over Rs 22,600 crore till that date, while over Rs 9,500 crore worth funds have already been raised by them. Their total investment stood at Rs 7,350 crore. While Sebi has made provisions in its norms for AIFs to collect funds from the foreign investors, there is no enabling provision under the FDI policy or in the Foreign Exchange Management Act. Because of this, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board has been considering the foreign investment proposals in AIFs on a case-by-case basis. Under the RBI's Foreign Exchange Management (Permissible Capital Account Transactions) Regulations, 2000, only Sebi-registered foreign venture capital investors are allowed to invest in a Venture Capital Fund or in a Venture Capital Undertaking. Besides, the FDI policy does not permit foreign direct investment in any trust other than by the FVCIs (Foreign Venture Capital Investors). The Cabinet's approval today would ensure that foreign investment in AIFs is in compliance with the FDI policy and with the RBI norms.
