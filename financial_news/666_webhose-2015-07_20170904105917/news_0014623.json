However, the APR is especially important to be mindful of with any credit card, simply because a small purchase can end up costing hundreds of dollars more. If you tend to pay your balance in full each month during the grace period, rather than just making your minimum monthly payment and spreading it out, a high APR is less of a threat. If, however, you have a tendency to carry a balance or are unable to pay your balance in full consistently, you should look for secured cards that charge the lowest APR possible. \nIf you are working on your credit rating and might be inclined to carry a balance, here are the five best low APR secured credit cards. Primor® Secured Visa Gold \nThe primor® Secured Visa Gold includes many of the features you’ll find on secured credit cards, with one of the lowest APRs available of 9.99%. There are also no credit checks for this card, so you can rest assured your creditworthiness won’t determine the APR. This is also one of the only two cards on the list that don’t require membership in a credit union. \nOn the downside, however, in exchange for one of the lowest APRs offered, it carries an annual fee of $49 and a foreign transaction fee of 3%. There is also a primor Secured Visa Classic Card with a lower annual fee of $39 and a slightly higher APR of 13.99%, which when compared to secured credit cards with APRs as high as 25%, is still considered relatively low. Depending on how much of a balance you plan on carrying each month, the extra $10 for the gold card can be well worth it. \nClick here to learn more and apply for the primor® Secured Visa Gold card today! SDFCU Savings Secured Visa Platinum \nThe lowest APR offered among secured credit cards is 6.99% with the SDFCU Savings Secured Visa Platinum card . Like many other secured cards offered by credit unions, you must be a member of the State Department Federal Credit Union (SDFCU) in order to qualify for the card. There are many ways to become a member including membership in DeVry University of Virginia or the Motley Fool. \nThis card also stands out among other secured cards because there is no annual fee, balance transfer fee, or foreign transaction fee. Furthermore, it offers a rewards program, not often available with secured credit cards, which allows you to earn a point for each dollar spent. First Progress Platinum Prestige MasterCard® Secured \nThe First Progress Platinum Prestige MasterCard® Secured offers a 11.99% APR and since it’s not a credit union, has no membership requirements to be eligible. There is an annual fee of $44 and a foreign transaction fee of 3%. Note however that there is no option to transfer a balance, so one of the benefits of having a low APR credit card doesn’t apply here. \nClick here to learn more and apply for the First Progress Platinum Prestige MasterCard® Secured today! Navy Federal Credit Union nRewards Secured Card \nThe Navy Federal Credit Union nRewards Secured Card offers an APR as low as 8.99% to 17.99%, depending on your creditworthiness. Even if you qualify for the highest APR of 17.99%, it’s still among the lowest offered by other secured cards. This card requires membership in Navy Federal Credit Union, with a number of ways to become a member including as a family member of military personnel. \nThe card has no annual fee, balance transfer fee, or cash advance fee, but you could pay up to 1% for foreign transactions. The card also comes with the nRewards program which awards one point for each dollar spent with the card. USAA Secured Card® Platinum MasterCard® \nThe USAA Secured Card® Platinum MasterCard® is available as a MasterCard or American Express card . The APR for purchases and balance transfers is 9.9% to 19.9%. You also need to become a member of USAA to qualify for the card, as either active military, or spouse or family member of a USAA member. \nAlthough the USAA Secured cards offer some of the lowest APRs, there is an annual fee of $35 per year, a balance transfer fee of 3%, and a foreign transaction fee of 1%. However, your security deposit does earn interest on a CD, offers free credit monitoring for six months, and includes exclusive military benefits. \nClick here to learn more and apply for the USAA Secured Card® Platinum MasterCard® today! \nEditorial Note: Any opinions, analyses, reviews or recommendations expressed in this article are those of the author’s alone, and have not been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by any bank, card issuer, airline or hotel chain.
