Lex Golden is chairman and CEO of Acme and holds the title of special assets manager at Allied. \nAcme’s obligation on the debt is on hold since it entered bankruptcy court 15 months ago in the first legal action. The loan dates back to December 2010, one of two Chambers made to Acme with a combined outstanding balance of more than $4.5 million. \nChambers Bank holds all the shares of Allied as security on the loans. \nAccording to Acme’s bankruptcy paperwork, Lex and Ellen Golden also personally guaranteed both Chambers loans as well as $3.4 million of debt held by two other Acme creditors. \nFour weeks ago, we told you about the Goldens opening a second legal front with Chambers Bank in Crawford County Circuit Court through Acme and Allied. \nThe complaint alleges tortious interference by Chambers with the planned sale of three Allied Bank branches last year. \nThe proposed $2 million transaction, made as part of Acme’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy, was opposed by Chambers, bank regulators and others because Allied’s assets are separate from Acme’s. \nU.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Ben Barry ordered the case converted to Chapter 7 liquidation last Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T08:47:30.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
