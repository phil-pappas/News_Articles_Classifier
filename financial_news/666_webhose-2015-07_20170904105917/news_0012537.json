Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Joyce Moullakis The National Guarantee Fund has started receiving individual investor claims relating to the collapse of stockbroking firm BBY, as many former clients continue to hit obstacles in recovering their holdings or seeking redress.\nKPMG, which was appointed liquidator to several BBY entities, remains in talks to put a procedure in place where it or another independent party can administer bulk claims on behalf of former clients. KPMG is also seeking court directions on several aspects of the liquidation, with dates for some of those applications likely to be set in the latter half of this month.\nKPMG has already outlined to creditors that in relation to the inter-mingling of client money accounts a decision of the NSW Supreme Court in an MF Global case would likely assist in expediting a court application for BBY. The firm was placed into voluntary administration on May 18 , after failing to repay a loan to St George Bank.\nBut former BBY clients, or those that traded through firms that used BBY for clearing, are still coming up against difficulties in accessing their holdings or seeking redress from the guarantee or fidelity fund.\nThe guarantee fund only covers compensation for certain losses incurred by investors who trade in shares on Australian Securities Exchange, meaning that foreign exchange and futures clients fall outside its scope.\nOne former BBY client, who declined to be named, said he had to ring the guarantee fund six times and email three times just to receive a claim form.\nThe Securities Exchanges Guarantee Corporation, the fund's administrator, declined to comment. It has a poor record of paying investor claims, distributing just two in the wake of the global financial crisis. It had two claims being reviewed as at June 30 last year.\nThe ongoing client angst has litigation funders assessing whether to take up a BBY class action.\n Many former clients are also frustrated with the corporate regulator. While statements in May said it would look further into compliance matters and suspend the financial services licences of BBY, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission has otherwise remained silent. That is despite having since received an explosive KPMG report on potential fraud and possible breaches of the Corporations Act at BBY.\nASIC's markets surveillance boss Greg Yanco declined to comment on Thursday.\nBen Ezra, a client of a securities dealer that traded through BBY, said he was still waiting for the bulk of his equities and options portfolio to be unfrozen six weeks after BBY's demise and the ASX's unwinding of some positions.\n\"I'm just a sitting victim â€¦ and I don't know at what price they sold my shares,\" he said. \"I have not been able to balance my book before the end of June and who knows what that is going to cost.\"\nMr Ezra, who is expecting losses, has been assured his holdings will be released on Friday.\nFirms that used BBY to clear trades are battling to fill out new client paperwork and recheck identification.\nDirector at New York Securities Collin Vost expressed dissatisfaction in the way BBY's collapse was handled.\n\"The ASX and ASIC should have had a representative go into BBY to see how they could get the situation fixed for Australian investors quickly and easily,\" he said, noting that his firm would take about another five weeks to complete the transfer of clients to a new clearing firm.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/joycemoullakis"], "published": "2015-07-02T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:09:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
