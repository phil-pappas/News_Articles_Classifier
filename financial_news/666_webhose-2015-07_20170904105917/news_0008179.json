The FTSE 100 skidded lower by a hefty 1.5% or 101.73 points to reach 6,667.34, while the FTSE 250 ended the session down by another 110.24 points to 17,645.65. \nThat came alongside a 0.88% drop in the front month Brent futures contract and losses of 2.1% in three-month copper futures on the LME to $5,336 per metric tonne. \nAccording to the minutes of the BoE (Shenzhen: 000725.SZ - news ) 's meeting ended on 8 July a number of Monetary Policy Committee members thought the \"balance of risks to medium-term inflation relative to the 2% target was becoming more skewed to the upside.\" \"Support for a hike will likely continue to build as the year-end approaches, leading, we believe, to a hike in February 2016. By then, six more months of wage and activity data, as well as inflation likely above 1% as negative base effects fall out of the annual variation, may have convinced a majority of MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) members,\" economists at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) said in a research note e-mailed to clients. \nGovernor Mark Carney had in recent days been signalling that a decision to start hiking rates is nearing, with the turn of the year specifically being mentioned. \n\"From now on, interest rate decisions at MPC meetings are going to become progressively harder to call,\" said Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight . \"While there was a 9-0 vote in favour of unchanged policy in July, this will highly likely have been the last time that unanimity prevailed for keeping interest rates at 0.50%.\" Meanwhile, Greece's parliament was set to vote on the remaining reforms signed by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, with the new bailout negotiations between Athens and its creditors expected to begin afterwards. \n\"There has been a suggestion that the talks should be concluded by 20 August but given the snail's pace seen so far by Europe's bureaucrats, this might be wishful thinking,\" said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK . \nLate in the afternoon Athens denied reports that fresh elections would be called for in mid-May. \nTsipras had been attempting to distance his party from radical left supporters and reassert his control after 32 members of his own party voted against accepting creditors' latest demands for reforms, RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) analyst Alberto Gallo said in a research report e-mailed to clients on 20 July. \nMiners slump A gauge of miners declined including BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) as it trimmed its production guidance for 2016 in the face of waning prices and warned its underlying profits will be hit by a charge of between $350m to $650m from impairments and redundancies at its copper business. Fresnillo (Other OTC: FNLPF - news ) , Randgold, Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) and Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) were also lower. \nEasyjet (Other OTC: ESYJY - news ) soared after the company said second half sales would spur a gain in full year earnings. \nTate & Lyle (LSE: TATE.L - news ) gained after after Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) upgraded the stock to 'neutral' from 'sell' and raised its price target to 470p from 460p following its recent underperformance. \nLand Securities (LSE: LAND.L - news ) was a high riser after saying it has had a solid start to the year and is maintaining good momentum, with healthy take-up in London, low vacancy rates and rental values rising. \nARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) dropped after the chip maker reported second quarter earnings that fell short of expectations. \nBarclays slipped as the bank denied receiving an offer from the Serious Fraud Office, relating to an investigation into its multi-billion pound fundraisings during the 2008 financial crisis. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,161.37 -1.06% FTSE 100 6,667.34 -1.50% FTSE 250 17,645.65 -0.62% FTSE 100 - Risers easyJet (EZJ) 1,748.00p +4.92% RSA Insurance Group (RSA) 449.50p +2.11% International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (CDI) (IAG) 570.00p +1.69% Sage Group (LSE: SGE.L - news ) (SGE) 541.00p +1.03% CRH (CRH (NYSE: CRH - news ) ) 1,876.00p +0.81% Direct Line Insurance Group (DLG) 361.50p +0.67% Persimmon (PSN) 1,958.00p +0.67% Marks & Spencer Group (MKS) 535.00p +0.66% Shire Plc (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) (SHP) 5,465.00p +0.55% Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) (HL (Shenzhen: 002105.SZ - news ) .) 1,198.00p +0.50% FTSE 100 - Fallers ARM Holdings (ARM) 970.00p -6.64% BHP Billiton (BLT) 1,180.00p -5.71% Anglo American (AAL) 813.50p -5.59% Glencore (GLEN) 228.00p -5.41% Weir Group (WEIR) 1,568.00p -5.37% Pearson (PSON) 1,209.00p -3.82% Johnson Matthey (LSE: JMAT.L - news ) (JMAT) 2,900.00p -3.72% Rio Tinto (RIO) 2,502.50p -3.64% Meggitt (MGGT) 459.20p -3.53% Ashtead Group (LSE: AHT.L - news ) (AHT) 1,007.00p -3.45% FTSE 250 - Risers Mitchells & Butlers (LSE: MAB.L - news ) (MAB) 405.60p +5.60% Aldermore Group (LSE: ALD.L - news ) (ALD) 269.60p +3.53% Morgan Advanced Materials (MGAM) 341.00p +2.71% Wizz Air Holdings (WIZZ) 1,689.00p +2.12% Paragon Group Of Companies (PAG) 399.90p +2.02% Marston's (MARS) 158.20p +2.00% Tate & Lyle (TATE) 520.50p +1.86% CLS Holdings (LSE: CLI.L - news ) (CLI) 1,831.00p +1.72% Betfair Group (LSE: BET.L - news ) (BET) 2,636.00p +1.66% Croda International (Other OTC: COIHF - news ) (CRDA) 2,998.00p +1.59% FTSE 250 - Fallers TalkTalk Telecom Group (TALK) 355.70p -8.91% Brown (N.)
