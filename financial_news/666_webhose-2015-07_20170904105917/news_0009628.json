Like much of the UK, the South Coast city has had a miserable start to the summer courtesy of rain and gales unpleasant enough to drive even the hardiest of holidaymakers indoors.\nHowever, a bit of bad weather isn’t enough to wipe the smiles off the faces of the city’s technology entrepreneurs. After years of being touted as the UK’s next exciting tech cluster story, Brighton now seems to be living up to its promise – Silicon Beach, as some have dubbed it, boasted no fewer than nine successful equity fundraisings during the first half of the year, new data reveals.\nTo put that number in perspective, market analyst Beauhurst, which compiled the numbers, says it is three times as high as in the whole of 2013, when only three Brighton businesses picked up funding. It suggests the story told by the city’s entrepreneurs is at last gaining some traction.\nSo it should. The TechCity UK Technation report claims Brighton is home to no fewer than 1,500 technology companies – roughly the same number as have set up shop in the much better-known Silicon Roundabout development in East London. Indeed, the report claims the city has the highest density of digital businesses anywhere in the UK.\n“Since 2013 people have been heralding the arrival of a Brighton start-up hub, but we reckon it’s only now that all that hype is really cementing into something worth talking about,” say Beauhurst’s analysts. “It’s promising that at least some of these fast-growth companies are starting to attract the attention of investors.”\nSeveral factors explain Brighton’s success in building a community of developing technology businesses, but the most obvious is its location. By the sea, the city boasts good rail links to the capital, which can be reached within 45 minutes. And in addition to the aesthetic charm, it’s cheaper than London too.\n“I think Brighton’s growth embodies a larger, nationwide shift away from London,” Sam Silverwood-Cope, co-founder of Intelligent Positioning, one of the successful fund-raising companies of 2015, tells Beauhurst. “It’s only 45 minutes away, but companies like us pay lower rents so can be more flexible and competitive than established London agencies.”\nAnother fund-raiser, Brandwatch, argues that Brighton’s reputation for counter-culture has also been a positive. The firm’s Joel Windels says: “The quirkiness that pervades the city drives innovation by nurturing a less risk-averse culture.”\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:07:31.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
