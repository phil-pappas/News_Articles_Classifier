The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core PCE deflator, had a 1.8 percent quarter-to-quarter gain, but was still only up 1.3 percent year over year. \n\"We have a Fed that is by all accounts … overtly dovish in its perspective. That number this morning gave them no reason, no reason at all to consider monetary tightening going into the next quarter,\" the editor and publisher of The Gartman Letter said in an interview with CNBC's \" Closing Bell. \" \n\"Unless suddenly you got commodity prices spiking to the upside, that PCE is going to remain under pressure and it's not going to get above 2 percent.\" \nRead More This one word could hold key for Fed's rate move \nGartman noted that right now there are problems in commodity markets globally, with prices of grain, oil and metals all under pressure. \n\"They would like to raise rates,\" he said. \"Everybody wants to see them raise rates but I think their propensity to do so, especially given this composition of the FOMC and the voting members, their propensity to tighten I think is very, very limited.\" \n—Reuters contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:48:17.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
