That was $4.6 million less than in the first quarter of 2015, but nearly the same as in the last quarter of 2014. \nThe Columbus Dispatch ( http://bit.ly/1g9vErC ) reports that of those proceeds, Cleveland will receive $2.62 million, Columbus will get nearly $2.6 million, Cincinnati $1.89 million, and Toledo $1.4 million. The money is distributed to cities, counties, schools and other agencies. \nThe money comes from a 33 percent tax assessed on casinos. The total doesn't include proceeds from the state's seven racinos. \nInformation from: The Columbus Dispatch, http://www.dispatch.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T18:28:34.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
