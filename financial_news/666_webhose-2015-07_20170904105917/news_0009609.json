Unfortunately, a number of people were injured.\" \nIt has been reported that two migrants were hit by a train. \nVideo has emerged showing what appears to be people walking unchallenged towards the tunnel entrance. \nSky News understands it was filmed late on Monday in a supposedly secure part of the freight depot in Calais. \nMigrants disrupting the terminal in Coquelles, not far from Calais, has become a regular occurrence. \nSome 5,000 people, mostly from Africa and the Middle East, have set up camp around the area. From there, they often try to board trains, lorries or ferries to the UK. \nIn recent weeks, they have tried to take advantage of disruptions caused by industrial action by French port workers. \nThe situation has prompted Eurotunnel to bolster security on both sides of the Channel, a cost it wants the UK and French governments to pay for . \nHome Secretary Theresa May has announced that Britain will provide an extra £7m to help further improve security at the railhead in Coquelles. \nThe funding is on top of £1.4 million announced earlier in the month to build a new secure zone for UK-bound lorries . \nSpeaking after a meeting between British and French officials, Mrs May said: \"The French and UK governments are working in close collaboration and cooperation on this issue which affects us both. \n\"We are both clear that we need to ensure we are dealing with the terrible criminal gangs, the people smugglers, who are making a profit out of the human misery of many people.\" \nAsked why British taxpayers should be paying to deal with issues on the French side, she said: \"We have juxtaposed controls at the border. We work together on dealing with this particular problem.\" \nOn the UK side, police brought back Operation Stack in the early hours of Tuesday - after it was stood down on Sunday. \nIt caused the M20 in Kent to again become a giant lorry park while drivers waited to cross the Channel. \nThe Eurotunnel spokesman said the migrant activity was becoming \"an almost nightly occurrence\". \n\"This is an issue that is a really for the Government to sort out,\" he said. \n\"We need them to stop the migrant flow from Calais but it appears to be too much for them to handle.\" \nThe company on Tuesday advised anyone planning a day-trip to France via its passenger service to postpone their travel because of long delays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T22:43:08.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
