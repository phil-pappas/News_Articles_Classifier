The company's largest brand by sales in the region is Smirnoff Vodka. Unfortunately, vodka is falling out of favour in the US. \nFalling vodka sales have hurt Diageo and compounded the group's troubles during the first quarter of this year. Diageo's North American sales only increased by 0.9% year on year during the first quarter, well below estimates, which were calling for growth of 2%. \nBut even though Diageo's North American sales growth missed expectations, it was the only bright spot in the company's first-quarter results release. Group net sales during the three months to March 31 fell 0.7%. Sales fell in every single one of the company's markets bar Africa and the US. \nAnd it's not just fashion trends that are holding back Diageo. \nThe group's sales remain under pressure within China as sales of expensive cognac, baidu and whisky have fallen following the country's anti-corruption drive. Further, a clampdown by the Indonesian government on sales of drinks with less than 5% alcohol volume hitting beer sales in the world's fourth most populous country. \nSubdued growth \nAll of these factors mean that Diageo's sales growth will be subdued this year. Earnings per share are set to fall. \nSpecifically, according to City figures Diageo's sales will expand by 4.8% this year. Meanwhile, earnings per share will decline by 5%, following a decline of 7% last year. After two years of declines, Diageo's earnings will have fallen back to the same level they were at four years ago. \nWith this being the case, it looks as if Diageo is overvalued at present levels. If City estimates are to be believed, at the end of this year the company's earnings will be 7% above the level reported for full-year 2011. \nHowever, since the end of 2011 Diageo's shares have gained 35%. Moreover, during the same period the company's P/E ratio has increased from 15 to 21. \nSo all in all, Diageo is approximately 40% more expensive now than it was back in 2011, although the company has failed to achieve any growth over the period. \nWhat about a takeover? \nEven though I believe that Diageo looks overvalued at present levels, I wouldn't rule out a takeover. Rumours have circulated recently that 3G, an investment vehicle controlled by three Brazilian billionaires, has been eyeing up Diageo. \nAs the value of merger deals has recently surged to an all-time high, it seems as if there is a strong appetite for deals across the market. 3G might not make an offer for Diageo, but another suitor could be willing to fork out the cash. \nExplosive growth \nDiageo's growth is stagnating and, as a result, the company's shares appear to be expensive at present levels. \nHowever, our top analysts here at The Motley Fool have recently discovered a company that they believe could see its sales increase by 300% to 500% over the next few years. \nThis company could be one of the most impressive growth stocks around. \nNevertheless, few have realised its potential. . As a result, the company in question has been touted a one of the market's hidden gems . \nTo find out more download our free report today .
