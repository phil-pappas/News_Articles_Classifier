PSI's founder and President, Paul V. Kanitra, reiterated \"This is only the beginning, we are committed to further expand our offerings and product line.\" ATLANTA, GA, July 27,   Peak Soil Indexes , LLC (PSI) announced today a major expansion of their farmland index offerings. The indexing boutique will add to its \"Peak Soil Iowa Farmland Value Index\" (PSIFVI) with soon to be released indexes on both Minnesota and Indiana farmland. The indices are expected to be unveiled in late August. A Wisconsin index is next in line for publication in October, followed by two additional state indexes scheduled for late year launches. By 2016 first quarter end, PSI anticipates publishing farmland indices on six or seven major agricultural producing states. The development of new indexes will continue throughout 2016 in other geographic areas. PSI will continue to be at the forefront of innovative index design. The company revealed the new indexes would differ in structure than the Iowa index. The releases will however still be structured from observable, recorded, arms-length transactions, not surveys. Specifics will be made public prior to initial postings. PSI's founder and President, Paul V. Kanitra, reiterated \"This is only the beginning, we are committed to further expand our offerings and product line.\" The visionary firm sees opportunity in related sectors. Mr. Kanitra goes on to state, \"We are already working on our next generation releases for later in 2016.\" Peak Soil Indexes continues to \"democratize farmland\" with inventive indexes for the agricultural and investment communities. Mr. Kanitra claims \"These are genuinely usable indexes for derivative product development. They succeed in standardizing the commodity, are accurate, transparent and timely. Their purpose is not constrained to being but a historical reference point.\" Mr. Kanitra has 30+ years of financial industry experience. For the last six years he has worked on the development of farmland indices and alternative products. Prior to this involvement, Mr. Kanitra was the founder of Piedmont Select Properties, a micro-cap commercial real estate fund. Mr. Kanitra previously acted as an investment advisor for a global fixed income hedge fund. Earlier in his career, he managed arbitrage portfolios at ING Capital Markets, Marine Midland Bank and Metropolitan Securities in New York City.
