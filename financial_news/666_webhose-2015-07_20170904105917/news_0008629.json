The online home carnival generated whopping numbers; it received over 21,000 queries across India, scoring more than 200 bookings in the first five days of the carnival. The GOHF site witnessed 20 lakh visits and has also generated more than 1500 coupons. The event still has 5 more days to go.\nThe festival is offering discounts for every strata of the target audience in the residential and commercial property space.\nGOHF is the largest property festival till date in India. The quantum of response has been evenly distributed across projects. Initial trends indicate a special inclination for projects of less than Rs 1 cr and for projects which have had ‘attractive’ deals running on them. The response has come from across markets and generated massive leads from Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.\nSudhir Pai, CEO, Magicbricks said, “There has been tremendous interest across India and this event has seen unprecedented response in the digital space. The discounts and deals offered during GOHF have boosted buyers’ sentiments. With over 5 days left to go, we hope to end the event with over 40 Lakh visits and over 40,000 enquiries.”\nThe bookings are rising continuously and Space India, Navi Mumbai’s premier real estate, has exceeded all expectations by selling 50 flats in the first two days itself. Also, the 27 units of Brigade Group, one of the leading developers from South India, were booked online: Brigade Apartments across their flagship projects in Whitefield, the integrated enclave in Devanahalli and their new launch on Mysore road saw interest.\nNitin Bawankule, Industry Director Google India, “The unprecedented response has been heart-warming and the increasing booking requests and 20 lakh site visits are testimony to GOHF’s success. This is largely due to the excellent developments, lucrative offers and the strong efforts put in by Magicbricks, Google and GroupM.”\n 23, 2015 9:53 pm © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T00:13:44.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
