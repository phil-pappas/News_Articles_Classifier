The battery life has been boosted to two hours and the wireless connectivity has been improved. \nThe iconic glass prism on the original Glass that projects images into the user's line of sight is longer and thinner, and can now be moved vertically as well as horizontally. \nGoogle has also developed its own battery pack for the gadget, the Wall Street Journal reported. \nAccording to WSJ, the device has been handed to businesses to use in offices and will not be released to the public. A new version will not be available to buy until at least the middle of 2016. \nHowever, it will raise hopes that Google is working on a consumer version of Glass, just six months after scrapping its global launch. \nIn a dramatic U-turn, the search giant said it would stop selling the £1,000 smart glasses just months after launching in the UK. \nDespite having been in development for more than three years, Google Glass was still officially a prototype. \nNick Clegg tried out Google Glass last year \nThe Google Glass team was moved out of the Google X division, where projects are incubated, and became its own entity within the wider business. \nTony Fadell, who was placed in charge of the Glass team, reportedly wanted to redesign the product from scratch . \nDespite the best efforts of fashion designers, like Diane von Furstenberg and Luxottica (Milan: LUX.MI - news ) (the company behind Ray-Ban and Oakley), Google Glass failed to shake off its nerdy image, due to the prism-like display that juts out from the frame and sits in front of the lens on any pair of glasses. \nGlass was also beset with controversy, due to the ability of the wearer to take photos and record videos surreptitiously. Bars in San Francisco stopped people from wearing Glass, after a series of attacks on users, and the device has also been banned in cars, cinemas, casinos, hospitals and banks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T01:34:16.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
