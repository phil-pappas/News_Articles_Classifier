Loving it!\" Borschberg tweeted earlier from the cockpit. \nOn the third day into the eighth leg of the global circumnavigation, expected to take five days and five nights and billed as the most difficult part of the adventure, the plane crossed a potentially problematic cold front, the project said. \nThat front - which stretches across the Pacific - is one of the factors that had kept the team stranded in Japan for almost the entire month of June. \n\"#Si2 crossed the 1st cold front, major hurdle overcome,\" the team tweeted. \nThe experimental solar-powered aircraft left Japan around 6am NZ time on Monday after spending a month in the central city of Nagoya. \nThe propeller-driven plane was originally scheduled to fly directly from Nanjing in China to Hawaii, but bad weather along the way forced a diversion to Japan that stretched to a month. \nBorschberg is alone and entirely self-reliant in the 3.8-cubic-metre unpressurised cockpit. \nTravelling at altitudes of more than 9000 metres, he has to use oxygen tanks to breathe and experiences huge swings in temperature throughout the day. \nHe rests for only 20 minutes at a time and cannot move from his seat, which has a built-in toilet, as well as a parachute and a life raft attached. \nSolar Impulse 2 set off from Abu Dhabi earlier this year in a multi-leg attempt to fly around the world without a single drop of fuel. \nIt has 17,000 solar cells and on-board rechargeable lithium batteries, allowing it to fly through the night. \nIts wingspan is longer than that of a jumbo jet but it weighs only 2.3 tonnes - about the same as a car. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T02:13:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
