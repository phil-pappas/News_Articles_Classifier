Jim Rice Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Clancy Yeates National Australia Bank finance chief Craig Drummond says conditions on financial markets are supporting the bank's move to sell assets, as it pushes ahead with plans to spin off Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank later this year.\nAs the bank updates shareholders on plans cut its troubled ties with the United Kingdom, Mr Drummond on Tuesday acknowledged that high levels of liquidity on global markets in recent months, and strong investor demand for bank assets, were assisting NAB's efforts to focus more on Australia and New Zealand.\nNAB announced in May a plan to spin off up to 80 per cent of Clydesdale to shareholders and sell the remainder of the business in an initial public offering by the end of this year.\n\"The various financial markets, whether it be debt capital markets, equity capital markets, have been supportive of us selling a whole range of assets and repositioning the bank,\" Mr Drummond told Fairfax Media.\n\"Who knows whether it's the top of the market, the bottom of the market, but what we do know is there's a lot of liquidity in markets today that gives us an opportunity to re-position the bank by selling a lot of these assets.\"\nThe UK float market for banks has been performing strongly, with a successful float of TSB, an offshoot of Lloyds Banking Group of similar size to Clydesdale, last June. Mr Drummond noted that since then TSB had been taken over by Spain's Banco de Sabadelle.\n\"There is institutional interest in these types of assets at the moment,\" he said.\nA presentation lodged by NAB on Tuesday said \"material\" work on the Clydesdale sale was continuing, but also acknowledged that there was still \"a great deal of uncertainty\" over its full liabilities relating to misconduct.\n New Clydesdale chief executive David Duffy is set to present to investors in the UK on Tuesday night Australian time, setting out Clydesdale's growth strategy.\nNAB has overhauled Clydesdale's management and cut costs at the bank after it was hit by fallout fro the UK's grinding recession and costs from a mis-selling scandal that has dogged the British banking sector.\nMr Drummond highlighted its shift away from business banking towards retail lending - the share of its loan book in mortgages has risen from 46 per cent in 2012 to 69 per cent today. It is seeking to position itself as a mid-tier \"challenger\" bank to take on the UK's largest lenders, Lloyds, RBS, Barclays, Santander UK and HSBC.\n\"The way forward for this bank is very much focusing very heavily on their core regional SME and retail footprint rather than trying to take on the world,\" he said.\nUnder the spin-off plan - which is still awaiting final regulatory approvals - NAB's 500,000-plus shareholders would receive shares in the new British bank, which would have a primary listing in the UK, with the stock also tradeable on the ASX.\nCredit Suisse analyst Jarrod Martin said the fact NAB was updating investors on its plan for Clydesdale was a minor positive, because it suggested the IPO process was continuing.\nNAB's presentation showed that although Clydesdale's financial performance has improved in recent years, it is still significantly less profitable than most Australian banks.\nClydesdale's return on tangible equity was 8.1 per cent compared with 15.8 per cent for the big four. Mr Drummond said the bank was looking to improve this but did not provide a target figure - brokers estimate Clydesdale could potentially achieve ROE of about 12 per cent.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117021518580315645042", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/nab-seeks-55bn-to-fund-exit-from-clydesdale-and-yorkshire-20150507-ggwek4.html", "https://twitter.com/clancyyeates"], "published": "2015-07-07T09:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:08:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
