With the new party getting into the picture, the IPAB has now fixed November 3 as the date for kick-starting the process of final hearing.\nThe IPAB had in February this year allowed the Madhya Pradesh farmers’ body, New Darpan Social Welfare Society, that sought inclusion of the state in the geographical area where Basmati rice was traditionally grown, to implead itself in the legal proceedings arising out of an appeal against the GI Registry’s order to re-study the area of cultivation of Basmati rice in order to grant GI tag to the ‘slim and aromatic rice’ in the country.\nThe patent, trademark and GI tribunal also allowed Pakistan’s Basmati Growers’ Association (BGA) appeal that has opposed the inclusion of Madhya Pradesh in the scheme of things while objecting in totality to the granting of GI tag for Basmati rice in India.\nWhen the matter came up for hearing on Wednesday, IPAB bench was informed about the new miscellaneous petition (MP) by Basmati Growers’ Association, Patiala, seeking to implead in the proceedings. The bench comprising Justice KN Basha, chairman, and Sanjeev Kumar Chaswal, technical member-trademarks, allowed the MP, with rider that it should not repeat what other respondent parties already stated in the earlier pleadings.\n“As we don’t want to close door to anyone, we are allowing the plea and making Basmati Growers’ Association, Patiala, as the respondent. Since the counsel for association has asserted that he will not repeat what was already in the document and will only submit fresh insights into the case, we are directing him to submit his written submission in another four weeks time,” the IPAB bench said.\nHowever, the bench made it clear that it will not allow any further request from any third parties to implead in the case as it will protract the whole process.\nFollowing the Madhya Pradesh government’s intervention seeking inclusion of some areas of the state, the registrar of GI had asked Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (Apeda) to amend the application of GI tag. The Pakistan-based BGA’s appeal was among the slew of opposition before the IPAB after Apeda approached the tribunal opposing the proceeding arising out of the order of registrar of GI.\nPV Yogeswaran, counsel for Basmati Growers’ Association, Patiala, submitted that while the association objects to the inclusion of Madhya Pradesh in the geographical areas where Basmati rice has been grown, it argued that the producers of Basmati rice are traditionally cultivating the rice in the area specified within the boundary of East-Pithoragarh (Uttarakhand), West Firozpur (Punjab), North, Chamba (Himachal Pradesh) and South Auraiya (Uttar Pradesh).\n 09, 2015 12:48 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T01:14:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
