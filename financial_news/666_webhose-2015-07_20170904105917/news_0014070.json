The Chicago Board of Education last week approved a $200 million cash-flow borrowing that could be tapped for the pension fund.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan said legislation giving CPS 40 more days to make the pension payment was moot because \"reliable sources\" had told him the full contribution would be made by the midnight deadline.\nBurbridge called on policy makers to address school funding \"so that teachers do not need to choose between teaching security today and retirement security tomorrow.\"\n\"The need for long-term solutions is not erased with this payment,\" he added.\nThe nation's third-largest public school system is struggling with a projected $1.1 billion hole in its next budget due largely by escalating pension payments. Last week contract talks between the school system and the Chicago Teachers Union broke off, according to a union official. The current contract expires at midnight.
