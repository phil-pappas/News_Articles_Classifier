The chief financial officer at Twitter, Anthony Noto, was also formerly at Goldman Sachs.\nUnder the U.S. Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, companies with less than $1 billion in revenue can file confidentially for an IPO with the Securities and Exchange Commission and test investor appetite while keeping financial and operating details outside the public eye. A confidential filing does not necessarily lead to an IPO.\nAaron Zamost, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Square, declined to comment to the media.\nSquare raised $25 million in funding from Victory Park Capital in May, taking the total the company has raised to more than $590 million. Its private-market valuation, according to The Wall Street Journal, is $6 billion.\nMOBILE PAYMENTS, LENDING AND PAYROLL PROCESSING\nIn addition to processing about $30 billion in payments from merchants last year, Square also provides business lending and payroll processing.\nSquare Capital, the company's lending arm, offers loans to merchants that are repaid through a portion of sales processed by Square and has extended more than $100 million to more than 20,000 businesses, the company has said.\nSquare Cash, the company's peer-to-peer payments software, processes more than $1 billion in transactions on an annualized basis.\nIn June, Square launched a payroll processing service for merchants in California, which the company said it will bring to additional U.S. states soon.\nLast month Square also unveiled a wireless device that enables merchants to accept payments from Apple Pay through a smartphone or tablet.\nLast year, Square acquired Caviar, a food delivery service, to offer delivery to businesses that use Square.\nHowever Square's revenue is not public and it is unclear whether the company is profitable. One of Square's products, Square Wallet, a way to pay for goods without taking out a credit card, failed.\nDUAL ROLE FOR DORSEY\nIn February, Square disclosed some details of its ownership in February in a document filed with the Department of Commerce in Alaska.\nDorsey, the company's CEO, owns 26.2 percent of Square and 3.6 percent of Twitter. Dorsey is Square's largest shareholder and the next biggest is Khosla Ventures, a venture capital firm, with 17.4 percent. Others with big stakes in Square include Jim McKelvey, the co-founder and a director, with 9.4 percent.\nBut Dorsey, who also founded Twitter in 2006, returned to the role of Twitter CEO in June this year after Dick Costolo said he planned to step down. Dorsey had relinquished the role of Twitter CEO in 2008 but retained the role of chairman.\nTwitter has said it's seeking a full-time commitment to the company which may rule out Dorsey if he stays at Square.\nDorsey, 38, is now splitting his time between two companies which have offices about a block away from each other on Market Street in San Francisco.\nOn Tuesday this week, Dorsey will face Twitter investors when he reports the San Francisco-based company's quarterly earnings.
