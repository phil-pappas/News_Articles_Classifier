Advertising Print This Post Photo: Bloomberg \nICAP plc (IAP.L), a markets operator and post-trade risk mitigation provider, has announced that ICAP Global Broking launched its inaugural matching session using the South African rand (ZAR) government bonds, according to an ICAP statement. \nThe matching was executed via ICAP Global Broking’s e-Commerce portal, under the premise of a mounting demand for ZAR-denominated government bonds – ICAP’s voice brokers are also conducting multiple sessions per day in both London and Johannesburg. \nICAP’s newest matching sessions follow on the heels of its corporate Eurobonds expansion back in June, as its Global Broking business expands matching capabilities via its e-Commerce portal. \nAccording to Clive England, Global Head of Matching, ICAP Global Broking, in a recent statement on the launch, “We are encouraged by the success of the first series of ZAR government bonds matching sessions, which have received strong market interest. Having offered screens in this market for 10 years, pooling liquidity and streamlining the trading process through this new product was the next logical step for the business.” \n“Providing enhanced services and functionality through the e-Commerce portal , Global Broking customers can view ZAR government bonds-related news feeds, intraday pricing and participate in matching sessions in one consolidated view, benefiting from the expertise, market knowledge and assurance that our voice brokers are behind the trade,” noted Dean Berry, Global Head of eCommerce, ICAP in an accompany statement. \n“Global Broking’s e-Commerce portal has successfully provided an electronic offering to customers which enables trades to be concluded with the assistance of our voice brokers. As we grow our global footprint in hybrid execution services, we’re pleased to announce the launch of the ZAR government bonds matching session, and look forward to rolling out further matching sessions across all asset classes over the next 12 months,” added David Casterton, CEO Global Broking, ICAP. \nJust last week, ICAP made headlines after it fortified its investment in AcadiaSoft, Inc , a provider of electronic margining for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. The latest investment from ICAP was conducted in parallel to DTCC, Euroclear, and four additional banks, which brought the total to over thirteen individual investing institutions. Got a news tip?
