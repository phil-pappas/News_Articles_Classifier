This is faster than electronics and general merchandise purchaser growth overall for the group. \n&quotWe estimate the US apparel business will grow from $16bn gross merchandise value (GMV) in 2015 to $52bn in 2020,\" the analysts predict. &quotThis implies a gain in US apparel and accessories market share from 5% to 14%.\" \nThis apparel growth for Amazon, Cowen believes, will likely contribute to further consolidation, M&A, and physical store closures. \n&quotWe see non-differentiated retailers at greatest risk, with longer-term risks to department stores and broadlines.\" \nKey risks to traditional retail, they say, include: greater price transparency driving merchandise margin pressure, conflicting vendor/supplier relationships, Amazon’s distribution/speed brawn versus traditional retail, and Amazon’s customer loyalty/checkout. \nLong-term winners, Cowen says, will be brand owners with the most innovative product and category leadership, and retailers leveraging bricks 'n clicks. \nIn particular, while the analysts expect Nike, Under Armour, and other global brands to benefit from Amazon's apparel growth, the analysts believe PVH Corp in particular has the highest exposure to the web giant with over 6,000 listings through first-party relationships for CK and Hilfiger. \n&quotPVH sells directly to Amazon on a wholesale basis in the US and Europe with its CK and Tommy brands. Of critical importance to PVH is protecting its brand image and management strictly oversees pricing, promotions and product that appear on Amazon and other e-tailing partners.\" \nPVH has been busy growing its partnership with Amazon and they collaborate on promotional events to avoid unplanned discounting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:08:22.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
