From bargains in Bicester to boutiques on Bond Street, retailers across the UK are wise to the opportunity that Eid offers,\" Mr Hobday added. \nAccording to Worldpay, turnover from Middle Eastern shoppers is expected to rise by an average of 368pc in the month after Eid Al-Fitr, with an average of £251.05 spent on each transaction. \nVisitors from Qatar are expected to lead the way, with an average spend of £466.89, followed by UAE at £275.17, Saudia Arabia at £186.29 and Bahrain at £134.07. In comparison, people from Europe are expected to spend an average of just £32.76 in the UK in a single transaction. \nWorldpay also found that Bicester, in Oxfordshire, will reap the biggest rewards from the shopping spree, with sales in the town set to rise by 276pc. \nLondon will see a 162pc rise in turnover, Manchester 61pc, Edinburgh 46pc and Brighton 35pc. \nNigel Smith, founder of Morgan (Other OTC: MGHL - news ) car dealer London Morgan , said: “There is a clear demand among Middle Eastern buyers for British hand-made products and the increasing interest in Morgan cars is a perfect example. Judging by recent enquiries into our showroom, we are expecting a significant surge in Middle Eastern purchases over the next week.” \nWorldpay has also offered retailers a five-point checklist to boost sales. Its tips include: *Allow international shoppers to pay in their local currency *Improve foreign language signs *Employ multi-lingual staff and train them in cultural expectations of different nationalities *List tax-free prices in-store *Offer special services for high spenders Ramadan falls on the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar and Muslims around the world fast from dawn to sunset during the period. Because the calendar is dictated by the moon, a precise timing is virtually impossible, but this year it has run from June 18 to July 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T03:08:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
