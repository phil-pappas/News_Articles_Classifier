Not priced in? Nope, wrong question. Here's what we have seen since the bottom in 2009. \nIt doesn't matter if the Greek \"no\" vote is priced in. The hedge funds that have been leaning negative will press the bet from the get-go in both futures and ETFs. They press it everywhere. \nThat, then, causes the mutual funds and the less-clued-in hedge funds to panic. They sell and sell hard right into the trap laid by the hedge funds, who need the market to collapse to make good on their short bets. \nThen, and only then, do the actual fundamentals of the action come into play and the fundamentals aren't nearly as bad as investors will realize. Sure, the European authorities have some thinking to do. Can you really let a country repudiate its debts but stay in a currency predicated on no debt repudiation? Will the Germans demonstrate their view that \"we pay our taxes, we fund our pensions, so who are the Greeks to do this, they are out?\" \nMust Read: Build a Billionaire Portfolio With These 20 Stocks \nOr does it all play out in slow motion and Alexis Tsipras goes back to the bargaining table with a \"Hey, I told you I couldn't sell this deal, now let's start talking a restructuring that I can bring back to the Greek people for another referendum.\" \nI would say that whatever takes the longest and is the most torturous becomes the course. \nYou can figure out what's most prolonged. Big debate among the European authorities on whether Greece can stay in the euro. Big debate among the authorities about giving it one more try. Big debate with the IMF on whether to just call it quits with Greece over the course of the next month to see if something develops. \nOr all three, because that is what would be the worst and the worst case has turned out to be the odds-on case each time. \nSo what is the so-called worst case? Greece gets evicted. The authorities are out some couple of hundred billion, the Greeks look for alternative aid from the east -- wow, is that stock market crash in China poorly timed -- and there's rationing and hardship.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T15:16:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
