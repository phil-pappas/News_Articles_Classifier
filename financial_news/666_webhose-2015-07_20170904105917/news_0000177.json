Then it assured me that all had been corrected and quarterly accounts would be issued by post. I then gave a meter reading and was told an invoice would come. It still hasn’t. \nWill you please assist me by persuading it to issue accounts by post and take the appropriate monthly payments by direct debit? Can you negotiate a settlement figure to clear the outstanding amount, remembering the time, worry and distress involved? This has been a terrible ordeal for a 95-year-old man and his 88-year-old wife. TS, Cheshire \nIt is unclear how, or indeed where the blame lies, but, without your say-so, your gas and electricity had been moved to a different provider. As a by-product of this Kafkaesque mayhem the new power company’s meter readers called at your home twice. Understandably you wouldn’t let them in. \nMy involvement led to ScottishPower accepting that it had somehow “lost” your gas and electricity supply and then that it had “received the gas and electricity supplies back under the 'erroneous re-registration process’”. This means that a supply wrongly taken is reinstated as if it had never left. \n• 'Scottish Power keeps insisting that I'm dead' \nScottishPower accepts that none of this was any fault of yours. It has withdrawn all charges since the “loss” date 15 months before this resolution. It is treating you as a new client with the current meter reading being used as the starting point. Any charges outstanding are being written off. \nYou say this is a settlement you would never have contemplated. You live in an old house and, given your ages, need a lot of heat. The cost of free gas and electricity equates to more than £4,000 and is a huge bonus to you. \n• If you want to contact Jessica, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T18:36:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
