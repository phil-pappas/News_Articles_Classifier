But mainland shares have plummeted some 30 percent in recent weeks, pulling down Hong Kong's China Enterprises Index by more than 10 percent. \nAll major stock exchanges use an auction at the end of the trading day to reduce volatility when calculating closing prices. Buy and sell orders are pooled during a five- or 10 minute period and are then matched at the best available price. \nIn Hong Kong, the closing price is based on continuous trading, whereby orders are matched immediately. \nAccording to research by State Street Global Advisors published in 2012, volatility in Hong Kong during the closing period can be as much as six times greater than in other developed markets. \nThe HKEx launched a closing auction in May 2008 but scrapped it 10 months later after design flaws actually exacerbated price swings. \n\"We are pleased that the majority of respondents from the various market segments supported the implementation of the two market microstructure reforms, which will put us on par with other leading exchanges,\" said Roger Lee, HKExâ€™s head of market operations, in a statement. \nMany major exchanges, including the New York and London bourses, try to mitigate such swings through so-called circuit-breakers that temporarily suspend trading in a stock if it behaves erratically. The HKEx plans to introduce similar controls that will restrict a stock to a trading price band. \nIn a statement, Sally Wong, chief executive of the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association, which represents global institutional investors, said she \"warmly welcomed\" the move, which she said also would help lower overall transaction costs for investors. \n(Reporting by Hong Kong newsroom; Editing by Kim Coghill)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T09:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T10:10:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
