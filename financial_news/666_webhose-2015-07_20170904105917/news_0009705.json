Also, debt guarantees issued by a federal province can’t be rendered completely invalid retroactively, the court said.\nThe debt moratorium, as well as Austria’s bank restructuring law on which it is based, are expected to become the subject of a separate case at the Constitutional Court, Holzinger said.\nAustria is breaking new ground in Europe with the wind-down of Heta, the bad bank of failed Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International AG. Lawmakers in Vienna last year enacted legislation that wiped out Heta’s junior debt and the state guarantees on which creditors had relied. That bill preceded Heta’s own resolution, which kicked off in March when regulators imposed a moratorium on its remaining debts.\nGroups fighting the junior debt cancellation included insurers like Uniqa Insurance Group AG and Vienna Insurance Group AG, fund managers like Deutsche Bank AG’s DWS, and the World Bank. The instruments affected are subordinated bonds including a 230 million-euro floating-rate note due 2017, a list of privately placed debts.\nBayernLB Claim The Constitutional Court’s decision comes less than a month after Austria agreed to pay 1.23 billion euros to the German state of Bavaria to settle all the pending litigation over Heta between the neighbors. Under the deal, BayernLB will drop its claim concerning 800 million euros it was owed by Heta and that were also reinstated by today’s court decision, according to the Austrian finance ministry.\nHeta has said that it will suffer a 900 million-euro loss if the junior debt is reinstated entirely. It also said that the junior bonds will become subject to the moratorium in that case, and that they may still be wiped out in the wind-down process. Carinthia’s guarantees for debt owed by Heta will rise to 11 billion euros from 10.2 billion euros.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T13:32:57.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
