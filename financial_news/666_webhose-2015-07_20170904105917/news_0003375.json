The slide in revenue was driven by a 32 per cent fall in the price the company received for its oil, driven by a global oversupply of the market. But the increase in production has seen the company fare better than rival Woodside, which suffered a 47 per cent slide in year on year revenue for the same period. Santos shares were down six cents, or 0.78 per cent, at $7.66 at 1537 AEST. Meanwhile, Santos has cut its capital expenditure in half so in 2015, and is bringing down production costs in response to sliding oil prices. \"Santos is taking positive steps to strengthen the company's operating position in the lower oil price environment,\" chief executive David Knox said in a statement. The company's flagship GLNG project at Curtis Island in Queensland was on track to produce its first liquefied natural gas by the end of the September quarter, he said. Santos also reaffirmed its full year guidance for production of 57 to 65 mmboe, production costs of between $14.20 to $14.60 per barrel of oil equivalent, and capital expenditure of $2 billion.
