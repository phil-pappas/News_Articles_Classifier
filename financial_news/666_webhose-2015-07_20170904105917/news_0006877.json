A study published this month in the peer-reviewed Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy suggests that pining for someone else when you're taken probably won't change your relationship, and could actually make it stronger.\nThe findings, published by sexual health researchers at Columbia, the Indiana University, and the University of Kentucky-Lexington, could be interpreted as a sign we should not be so hard on ourselves for having extracurricular needs.\nThe researchers based their analysis on an online survey of around 200 women who had been in relationships for three years or longer. The women, who were typically married to men, highly educated and between 19 and 56 years old, were asked open-ended questions about their significant other and their sexual attractions.\nPerhaps the least surprising finding was that the vast majority of women-70 per cent-said they had ever had a crush on someone else while dating their current partner. In most cases, the women came upon their object of desire at work. This should also not be a shock. Work is like high school: when you're stuck in a building for eight hours doing the same thing as everyone around you, it requires some effort to not get distracted by at least one of those people.\nIt turns out that most women were not that worried about their flirtations. The most common response from women asked about the impact of a crush on their relationship was that it had none at all.\nA smaller slice said coveting someone else actually made them more attracted to their long term boo. (The respondents were not asked to measure their desire for partners during and after crushes, which could have indicated how their feelings had changed, but did describe the feelings they had for the other person in detail, and whether they noticed those desires making an imprint on their dynamic with the person they came home to.)\nThe women explained that crushing on someone made them have more sexual thoughts, and \"described transferring the emotion from the crush to the partner and acting on this with their partner.\"\nThe authors concluded that \"women often funnelled increased sexual desire from a crush into their primary relationship.\" This may seem like a rationalisation, but it also sounds like it could be true, which should be good enough for anyone with an office obsession.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T23:18:29.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
