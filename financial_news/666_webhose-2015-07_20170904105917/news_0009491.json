Times have changed.\n“Misogyny and discrimination haven’t been eliminated, but they are no longer entrenched in law, and the institution of marriage has evolved, too.\n“We are your brothers and your sisters, your sons and your daughters, your friends and your fellow Australians, and this is a debate about us. A debate about rights, a debate about intimate and personal relationships, a debate about the people we love.”\nRight-wing Liberal warrior Cory Bernardi took on left-wing Labor frontbencher Penny Wong in a debate streamed live on Advertiser.com.au. Source: The Advertiser\nSenator Bernardi said the campaign was not about equality — it was about redefining one of the fundamental pillars of society.\n“I believe, and I think it’s crystal clear, this campaign is not about equality, but it’s about personal desire and self-interest of a vocal minority,” Senator Bernardi said.\nHe said those against same-sex marriage were painted as “bigots”.\n“We’re called homophobes or worse and on the name-calling, once again it’s simply another well-known propaganda technique designed to silence an alternative voice.\n“I believe it’s crude, it smacks of hypocrisy and intolerance, but it is very effective in silencing many from sharing their view.”\nHe said he feared that legalising same-sex marriage would open the floodgates to redefine other relationships, such as polyamory and bestiality.\n“I can’t and I will not deny that some same-sex couples make much, much parents than some married heterosexual couples,” he said.\n“However, it doesn’t change the general principle that the ideal is still a child being raised by their married mother and father.”\nSenator Wong said she would not be willing to support multi-member marriages and that businesses didn’t have any need to fear discrimination if they were against same-sex marriage.\nLive coverage (Frame content direct link: http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1403808&ThemeId=16707 .)\nThe South Australian pair met at the National Press Club at lunchtime to go head to head over whether Australia should legalise gay marriage.\nSenator Bernardi caused outrage when he linked same-sex legalisation to the acceptance of bestiality .\nSenator Wong — who is in a same-sex relationship with partner Sophie Allouache — has decried the extreme language used by marriage equality opponents.\nThe debate came after it was revealed some Coalition MPs were pushing for same-sex marriage to be put to a national vote.\nSame-sex marriage supporters believe a plebiscite , which has the support of Social Services Minister Scott Morrison, could delay a law change.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten announced at Labor’s national conference at the weekend he would legislate for same-sex marriage within 100 days of government.\nThe party also agreed to bind MPs to vote for the Marriage Act change — rather than have a conscience vote — if laws had not been enacted by the end of the next term.\nThe national ballot would mean setting aside current talks on a cross-party bill, which could come to parliament as early as next month.\nOriginally published as Bernardi vs Wong: Who won the gay marriage debate?", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/national/politics/cory-bernardi-and-penny-wong-debate-same-sex-marriage-at-national-press-club/story-fns0jze1-1227461263485", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content6.video.news.com.au/95NGVrdjrt9T8DAfAMkXVwn2YhHVlDRz/promo262414323&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227461/436083-b2c27ef2-358e-11e5-a34b-af8954b82b5f.jpg", "http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1403808&ThemeId=16707"], "published": "2015-07-29T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T18:43:54.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
