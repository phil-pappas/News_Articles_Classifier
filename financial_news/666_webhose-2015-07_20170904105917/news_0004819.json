'we stand ready to provide debt relief.' That is not very concrete,\" the official added. \nAn analysis the IMF presented to EU leaders over the weekend forecasts that Greece will never get back in a position of being able to repay its debts unless \"dramatic\" measures are taken in the new program to lighten the burden. \nThe IMF suggested three choices: stretching out debt repayments over decades, with a 30-year grace period, paying cash regularly to Athens to repay its debts or writing down some of the current value of the debt via a \"haircut.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T03:19:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
