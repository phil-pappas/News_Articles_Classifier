Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow We go to Bali. We go to the Barossa. But Brisbane? Can a spend of $2 billion finally transform the fortunes of tourism's Cinderella city?\nBrisbane Airport Corporation chief executive Julieanne Alroe is one who is convinced. The corporate high-flier, back in Queensland's capital city after 30 years away working in glamorous cities like Sydney, remembers how Expo 88 and the redevelopment of South Bank transformed the river city in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nMs Alroe believes Echo Entertainment's $2 billion Queen's Wharf integrated resort and casino will do the same for the government precinct on the northern banks of the Brisbane River. Brisbane, long regarded as the poor cousin of Sydney and Melbourne when it comes to attracting international and domestic tourists, will finally, she says, have an iconic attraction.\nStanding on the man-made beach at South Bank looking back towards the Queen's Wharf site – which will have 50 new restaurants, 1100 new top-end hotel rooms including a Ritz Carlton and top-end retailers when it is complete in 2022 – Ms Alroe says Brisbane will finally be able to overcome its tag as the stepping stone to the Gold and Sunshine Coasts.\n\"I spend a lot of my time working on airlines to come through Brisbane, not just as a gateway to Queensland, but to stay a bit longer in the city,\" Ms Alroe told AFR Weekend. \"We were just going to become a nice place to get a bus to the Gold Coast if we weren't careful. I feel very confident now as we go to talk to airlines.\" .\nThe Queen's Wharf development will be more than be Brisbane's \"Bilbao moment\" – where one building, the Guggenheim, came to define the town in northern Spain – but it will help rectify a perennial problem for this country's third largest city – a lack of high-end hotels and top-end retailers.\nAdding a lot of pizazz Brisbane has long been mocked as \"Brisvegas\", partly because it lacked a bit of spark. Nor has the murky Brisbane River helped. Echo's solution is to build up – and add a lot of pizazz.\n As Echo chief executive Matt Bekier admitted on Tuesday, the three residential towers next to the casino will help pay for the rest which includes a casino, five hotels and high-end shops.\nTourism Australia managing director John O'Sullivan said for the first time in years, tourism buyers in Asia were talking about Brisbane.\n\"I was in Shanghai a couple of weeks ago and all the senior executives from the likes of China Southern and China Eastern airlines were very keenly interested in this project. \"\nQueensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk believes the integrated resort, which begins construction in 2017, will lure tourists to the city in the same way they head to the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore. She said she was won over by the 12 football fields of public space – enough for 26,000 people.\nEcho Entertainment's property development director Josef Seidler said the main people to win over in the battle for Brisbane were the locals. But, he says, \"if you make it cool for locals, both domestic and international tourists will love it\".\nWith Matthew Cranston", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-07-24T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:08:58.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
