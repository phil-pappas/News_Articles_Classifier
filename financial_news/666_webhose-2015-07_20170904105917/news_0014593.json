Project Isizwe offers a cap of 250MB but it has increased the speed to 15mbps. \nFree Wi-Fi internet access aligns with national policy that stipulates universal broadband access by 2020, and the service may yet prove critical to assisting mobile operators with network load. \n\"Wi-Fi has proven to be a complementary solution for mobile operators in their effort to improve their service delivery to their customers and Wi-Fi calling is the next step,\" Michael Fletcher, sales director sub-Saharan Africa at Ruckus Wireless told Fin24 recently. \nThe GSMA's Mobile Economy Sub-Saharan Africa 2014 report found that the mobile ecosystem makes a healthy contribution to the GDP of countries in the region. \nThe report shows that mobile operators alone contribute $27bn or 1.9% of the region's GDP, and a further $8bn in related industries. \nBut beyond economic growth, internet access is regarded as a human right. \n\"For too many people in South Africa, using the internet has turned into a privilege, when it should be a right. We hope that this project will galvanise a nationwide call for free and subsidised internet for all people living in South Africa in under resourced communities,\" said Fatima Hassan, executive director of Open Society Foundation of South Africa, a partner in the Western Cape Wi-Fi rollout. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T16:11:24.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
