Reuters But what is the likelihood that Athens will be able to reach an agreement with its creditors – the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union? After all, interminable talks have dragged on for five months this year over the reforms that Athens should introduce in exchange for fresh financial assistance. In the end, the country's creditors just didn't believe the country would reform its pension system (which costs the country about 16 per cent of GDP each year), or put in place an effective tax collection system.\n1) Athens renegotiates a new agreement with the eurozone\nThis outcome isn't impossible, and certainly is the option favoured by Paris and Rome. What's more, it's been made easier by the resignation of Greece's abrasive finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, and his replacement by Euclid Tsakalotos.\nAnd at the end of June, Tsipras was ready to accept the reforms being demanded by the creditors (increases in sales tax and reform of the country's pension system). But in exchange he wanted some reduction in the country's huge €322 billion ($475 billion) debt burden (that stands at 177 per cent of Greece's GDP).\n This means the question of Greece's debt will become critical in fresh talks.\nSpain, Ireland and Portugal are opposed to writing down Greece's debt, because all three countries have endured tough austerity programs, without the benefit of debt relief\nThis means the only way to reduce Greece's debt burden – which the IMF argues is imperative – is to extend the repayment dates for the debt (at present the average maturity of Greek debt is 16 years) or to reduce the interest rate (at present the country pays an average interest rate of 2.4 per cent).\nBut the Europeans won't want to write Tsipras a blank cheque, particularly as in Germany there is a growing resistance to giving Greece one more euro.\nIn exchange for fresh financial assistance – the IMF estimates the country will need €50 billion in fresh funds over the next three years – the eurozone will propose new demands for reforms and budget cuts that will be at least as tough as those negotiated before the country's referendum.\n2) Greece's amicable departure from the eurozone – or Grexit\nFor Berlin, Madrid, Bratislava and Lisbon, the no vote is proof Athens simply doesn't accept the eurozone's rules.\nAs a result, for Athens and its creditors to reach an agreement, the most constructive approach might be to work towards an orderly Greek exit from the eurozone. Although Tsipras appears determined that Greece remain within the zone, he might be persuaded that it would be better for the country to leave the common currency, while remaining in the European Union.\nSome argue that if Athens dropped the euro and reintroduced the drachma, the Greek economy would get a huge benefit. A weaker currency would restore the competitiveness of Greek businesses, while foreign tourists, who would find the country much cheaper, would arrive in droves. The Greek central bank would also have the power to print as many drachmas as required to prevent the collapse of the country's banking system and the Europeans might provide humanitarian aid to Greece to soften the effects of the transition.\nDuring the transition to the drachma, Greece would have to keep capital controls in place, and the ECB would have to continue to provide life support for Greece's banks. The European Union could also provide technical assistance on the printing of the new coins and notes, and in converting financial contracts from euros into drachmas.\n3) An unplanned Greek exit from the eurozone – or Grexident\nTsipras has less than a fortnight to decide on either of the above options before risking the third, most disruptive option. Greece is due to repay €3.5 billion to the European Central Bank on July 20. If it fails to meet this payment, the ECB will have little option but to suspend its emergency funding of the Greek banks.\nThere is a growing revolt on the ECB's board over the €89 billion lifeline the central bank has already extended to the Greek banks. In the wake of Sunday's referendum, the ECB refused the Greeks' request to increase the ceiling on emergency funding and has tightened the rules under which the Greek banks will be able to tap this critical source of funds.\nWithout emergency funding, the Greek banks will collapse and most likely have to be nationalised.\nIn addition, the Tsipras government would be forced to start printing IOUs in order to pay pensions and public servants. But although these IOUs would be used in shops and would start to form a parallel currency, their value would quickly collapse against the euro. This would cause the price of imports to soar, while the purchasing power of ordinary Greeks would collapse, pushing the economy into a deep recession.\nNow read Why markets didn't tank on Greece's no vote .", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/greece_details_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-07T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:10:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
