What it’s going to be driven by is business and business investment in space. \n\"You’re seeing a new industry emerging. \n\"Where we are in terms of exploiting space resources now is the same as where we were with the internet 20 years ago and who would have thought that would explode and change the world in the way it did?\" \nAccording to their website, Planetary Resources launched a spacecraft from the ISS (Copenhagen: ISS.CO - news ) on Thursday last week beginning a 90-day mission to test the avionics, control systems and software needed to mine asteroids. \nIn 2013, Deep Space Industries voiced similar ambitions. \nMeanwhile, Mr Berman said the public had nothing to fear from this particular asteroid, which will be so far away that it cannot be seen with the naked eye. \n\"This still puts it many times further away than the moon so this time we're safe and the next time it passes Earth we're safe too. \n\"Before that time, maybe those guys will have succeeded in snagging (the asteroid) and mining it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T12:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T16:57:39.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
