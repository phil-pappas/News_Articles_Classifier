Advertising Print This Post \nAlpari RU has reported its volumes in Russia and the Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) for the month ending June 2015, which notched a marginal decline MoM from May, according to an Alpari RU statement. \nLast month saw Alpari RU’s Russian and CIS volumes come in at an upbeat $95.0 billion in May 2015 , which orchestrated a growth of nearly 4% MoM from $91.4 billion in April 2015, snapping a weakened performance across its volumes during Q2 2015. \nHowever, volumes at Alpari RU for the month ending June 2015 were slightly less robust, notching a figure of $94.4 billion. This corresponds to a marginal decline of less than a -1% drop MoM from $95.0 billion in May 2015. \nIn addition to the volumes report, during the month ending June 2015, the currency pair that secured the highest monthly turnover was the EURUSD, which exceeded 56%. This represents a massive jump over last month, which saw the EUR/USD only encompassing 11% of trading turnover. \nThe decrease in volumes this month is commensurate with the rest of the industry, which has seen waning volumes as we head into the most tranquil period of the year. Regardless, Alpari RU’s figures, as well as the broader industry, has managed to avert a complete breakdown of volumes such as those seen last year, when volatility dropped to a standstill during the summer months.
