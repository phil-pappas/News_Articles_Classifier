Microsoft earned $1.48 per share based on yearly revenue. \nHowever, while revenues grew by $6.7bn in 2015, Microsoft's profits were effectively halved from the $22bn in 2014. Earnings per share also fell from the $2.63 reported at the end of the company's previous fiscal year. \nMicrosoft's share price fell by four percent in after-hours trading, driven by the losses despite a generally positive reaction among analysts. \nA report on Bloomberg said that, if the restructuring costs were discounted for the quarter, analysts on average predicted profits of 58c per share based on $22bn in revenue . \nWith Microsoft reporting earnings of 62c per share, adjusted to leave out the $8.4bn charges, it would appear that the company surpassed expectations. \nChief executive Satya Nadella claimed that the company's investments in its wide product and service portfolio are paying off. \n\"Our approach to investing in areas where we have differentiation and opportunity is paying off, with Surface, Xbox, Bing, Office 365, Azure and Dynamics CRM Online all growing by at least double-digits. And the upcoming release of Windows 10 will create new opportunities for Microsoft and our ecosystem,\" he said. \nCloud and hardware happy \nMicrosoft's commercial cloud products appear to be in rude health, and the firm reported that Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics CRN Online drove cloud revenue up by 88 percent. \nMicrosoft added three million Office 365 subscribers during the quarter, taking the total number of paying users to 15 million. \nThe computer and gaming hardware divisions saw 44 percent growth in the quarter, generating combined revenues of $1.9bn. \nThe performance of the Surface Pro 3 and Surface 3 saw Microsoft's surface hardware arm grow by 117 percent, drawing in $888m for the company. \nMicrosoft also claimed success with Bing search and advertising, which grew by 21 percent, while Microsoft's Xbox division grew by 27 percent. \nInterestingly, Microsoft's spending on research and development for the fiscal year was up from $11.3bn to $12bn, hinting at the development of products such as HoloLens and the Cortana virtual assistant over the past 12 months. \nThis indicates that Microsoft is pushing ahead with its cloud and data analysis empowerment ethos outlined by Nadella .
