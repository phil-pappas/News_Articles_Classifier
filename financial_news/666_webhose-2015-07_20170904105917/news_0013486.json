Photo: Andrew Taylor\nThe Commonwealth Bank is ramping up efforts to promote the \"digital wallet,\" with a new app that will sense when shoppers are entering a Westfield shopping centre and send them offers from retailers on their smart phone.\nConsumers have so far been reluctant to ditch their physical wallets in favour of digital equivalents, despite predictions to the contrary.\nThis is prompting banks, and technology giants such as Apple, to look at how they can make phones do more than make payments or allow access to accounts.\nA mock up of how the new CBA app might look. Photo: Supplied\nOn Thursday the country's biggest bank said it would soon pilot a new app that senses when customers using it walk into a Westfield centre.\nAdvertisement When they arrive, it will send them \"tailored\" offers from businesses inside the centre, such as a discounted cup of coffee and a muffin. Customers will need to have opted into receiving theses alerts.\nShoppers will then be able to use their phone to redeem the offer, paying with their phone, card, or cash.\nThe bank is hoping the change, which will be trialled with a limited number of customers over the coming months, will encourage more people to use their phones as wallets.\nIncreased competition It is also a sign of the competition between banks as they seek to develop new technology-based products that can give them the edge in winning consumer and business customers.\nCBA's executive general manager for retail products and strategy, Angus Sullivan, said the app would be designed so that the offers reflected customers' shopping behaviour and preferences.\n\"This is a very targeted pilot as we look build that whole mobile wallet experience,\" he said in Sydney.\nThe app will be tested in certain centres first, but the bank has not yet said where. Nor did it provide details about which retailers were likely to participate.\nThe general manger of brandspace at Westfield's owner Scentre Group, Bill Burton, said retailers were keen on the app as a new way of driving customers into their stores and making their businesses more efficient.\nThe bank also said it had changed its mobile banking app so that customers could record loyalty cards such as FlyBuys details on their phone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T08:09:40.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
