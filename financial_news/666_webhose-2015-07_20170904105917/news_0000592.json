Expectations were for S&P 500 earnings to fall by 4.3% - their first year-on-year decline since 2009. However, the entirety of the drop could be accounted for by lower profits in the oil patch. \nThat came as shares in Google (Xetra: A0B7FY - news ) rocketed by 11% after the close of US markets the day before 0 which saw the Nasdaq-100 break out to a new 15-year record closing high - following its latest results. \nM&S's Dixon to step down Online gambling company 888 Holdings has agreed to buy Bwin.party Digital Entertainment in a cash and stock deal worth around Â£898.3m, beating a rival offer from GVC.
