Fund managers are holding the most cash since the collapse of Lehman Brothers because they’re reluctant to take on more risk as equity-market tumult in China and Greece’s potential exit from the eurozone threaten to weigh on global economic growth, according to a monthly survey of fund managers conducted by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nManagers are holding about 5.5% of their portfolios in cash, the highest level since December 2008. Lehman filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, sending shock waves through global financial markets.\nHere’s the chart:\nBAML Investors confidence in the global economy fell sharply, with 42% of survey participants expecting it to strengthen over the next year, down from 55% a month ago. China was viewed as the biggest risk to growth, with 62% expecting its economy to weaken over the same period.\nThey also tempered their expectations for the timing of the first Federal Reserve interest-rate increase since 2006. The consensus has shifted to the fourth quarter or later, from the third quarter or later in the June survey.\nInvestors also increased their exposure to global equities to 42% of their portfolios, from 38% last month—but many also hedged their short-term exposure. The percentage of investors buying protection against a decline in equities over the next three months rose to its highest level since February 2008.\nInvestors believed some of the biggest “tail risks”—events that are unlikely, but could trigger massive losses—were a eurozone breakup, a wave of debt defaults by Chinese enterprises and the fallout from a massive decline in Chinese equity prices.\nThe survey included feedback from 149 portfolio managers, and was conducted between July 2 and July 9.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:25:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
