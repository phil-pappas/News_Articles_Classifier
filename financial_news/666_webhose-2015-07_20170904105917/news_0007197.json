In the last campaign 257,504 tonnes were exported, and 141,434 tonnes were sold on the domestic market. International sugar prices, however, have fallen, and exports from the 2014-15 campaign earned 135.2 million dollars, compared with 154 million dollars the previous year. \nThe sugar industry employs 36,000 workers (including seasonal workers), and 150,000 people live in households dependent for their income on sugar. \nSo the loss of a large slice of the domestic market to imports is a cause for concern. Rogerio Cumbe, the chairperson of the Association of Mozambican Sugar Producers (APAMO) warned the seminar “the large quantities of imported sugar could result, in the medium term, in importing unemployment. Hence the need to take measures to protect the national industry”. \nIn Maputo, national producers find they are competing with Swazi sugar. In the central province of Manica, it is Zimbabwean sugar that is inundating the market. Malawian sugar is sold in Niassa and Tete provinces. On the coast, sugar from Asian countries such as India or Thailand is smuggled in, or dumped at prices below the costs of production, benefitting from the subsidies the governments of those countries pay to their sugar industries. \nThe difference in price has become substantial - Mozambican sugar sells at an average price of 42 meticais (1.1 US dollars) a kilo, while the average price of the imported sugar is 38 meticais a kilo. \nThe key problem is that, under the SADC (Southern African Development Community) free trade area, sugar is free of duties. Mozambique used to slap a surtax on sugar imports but nowadays, as a loyal member of SADC, it is allowing sugar from other SADC countries to enter freely. \nOther SADC members have no such scruples. \nZimbabwe, Swaziland and Malawi have all adopted measures to protect their sugar industries, regardless of the fact that they, like Mozambique, have signed the SADC free trade protocol. \nAPAMO wants the government to suspend licences to import sugar, or to reintroduce the surtax. Tonela recognized that a wave of cheap imports could undermine the sustainability of the local industry and promised that the government will take measures. \n“The fact that Mozambique is importing sugar in quantities and at a price which call into question the sustainability of our sugar industry is a matter which the government has been studying”, he said. A solution was required that would protect the producers, without increasing the price consumers pay for Mozambican sugar - in other words, he did not want any restrictions on imports to be used as an excuse to raise the price of the local product. \nTonela said legislation already exists that sets a reference price for sugar. However, that price is out of date. Once a realistic reference price is set, sugar entering the country at below that price could be obliged to pay a surtax.
