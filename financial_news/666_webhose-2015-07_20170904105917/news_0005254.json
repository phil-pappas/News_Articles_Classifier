The parliament in Athens will vote on a second package of economic reforms on Wednesday and is drawing up a final bundle of measures for approval in the first week of August.\nThe Greek government also expects to wrap up the talks in time to repay the ECB, spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili said Tuesday. Greece’s creditors plan to finalize the terms by Aug. 6 and disburse the first tranche by Aug. 17, an international official with knowledge of the matter said Monday.\nGrace Period The European Union already provided a 7.2 billion-euro bridge loan that helped Greece repay the ECB on July 20. Missing that payment could have prompted the central bank to pull the emergency funding keeping Greek banks afloat.\nNadal said the debate over whether Europe should write down the value of Greece’s existing debt or grant Tsipras easier repayment terms is a distraction from the more important issue of getting the country’s economy growing.\n“We all know the volume of debt is very high, but the interest isn’t,” he said. “We can deal with that later on.”\nGreece already has a 10-year grace period on interest payments on its 30-year rescue loans from the euro area and they account for more than 70 percent of the country’s total debt, Nadal said.\nWhile Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said it will take a “miracle” for Greece to deliver all its commitments over the three years of the bailout program, Nadal said he’s confident Greece can comply.\n“Why isn’t Greece able to do that?” he said. “Ireland has done it, Portugal has done it, Spain has done it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T17:14:36.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
