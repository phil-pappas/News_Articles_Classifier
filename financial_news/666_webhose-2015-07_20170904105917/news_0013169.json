Arsineh Houspian Share on twitter by Misa Han The Fair Work Commission has found a team leader who told a board member to \"f--- off\" and kissed a female colleague at his work Christmas party was unfairly dismissed because his employer was partly at fault for serving unlimited free alcohol.\nLast December, Stephen Keenan's employer, a Leighton Contractors, Boral and Amey joint venture, organised a Christmas party at a private room at Novotel Sydney Brighton Beach Hotel, where alcohol was served to employees free of charge.\nAt the event, Mr Keenan, a team leader, had about 10 beers and one vodka and coke. Over the course of the night, he told a board member of the joint venture to \"f--- off\".\nLater, he suggested to a female colleague they and their children should go horse-riding and ice-skating together, and said three or four times: \"I want to ask for your number, but I don't want to be rejected.\" The colleague did not respond.\nAfter the function officially ended at 10pm, the party moved to the public upstairs bar, where Mr Keenan kissed another female employee on the lips and said to her: \"I'm going to go home and dream about you tonight.\"\nOn the day of the Christmas party, his supervisor had warned his employees: \"Do me a favour, don't be that idiot that I have to deal with on Monday morning. Don't be that person who gets blind drunk, abuses someone or punches someone.\"\nMr Keenan was fired, with four weeks' pay.\nThe team leader was an elected Australian Workers' Union delegate and a work, health and safety representative.\n Fair Work Commission vice-president Adam Hatcher found none of the three incidents were valid grounds for dismissal and Mr Keenan had been unfairly dismissed.\nThe tribunal found there was no evidence the board member took offence or remembered the incident.\nThe tribunal also found proposing to meet up with a colleague was not sexual harassment, even though there may have been a desire for a romantic relationship.\nMr Hatcher found the kiss occurred at the upstairs bar after the function had officially ended, and was not connected to Mr Keenan's employment.\nHe added the employer was partly at fault for serving unlimited alcohol at the function and not making sure the venue implemented responsible service of alcohol requirements.\n\"In my view, it is contradictory and self-defeating for an employer to require compliance with its usual standards of behaviour at a function but at the same time to allow the unlimited service of free alcohol at the function,\" he said.\n\"If alcohol is supplied in such a manner, it becomes entirely predictable that some individuals will consume an excessive amount and behave inappropriately.\"\nThe tribunal will hold a further hearing to decide whether the employer should give Mr Keenan his job back.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan"], "published": "2015-07-01T08:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T10:05:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
