Reuters by Matthew Stevens Andrew Mackenzie has introduced BHP Billiton's Melbourne-based management elites to the real-world meaning of shrinking to greatness by enforcing a profound depopulation of the Global Australian's swank new Collins Street headquarters.\nMackenzie has delivered on the productivity promise of the $US10 billion ($13.75 billion) demerger of South32 by driving a new era of austerity at headquarters that will reduce numbers from a recent peak of nearly 480 to about 300.\nTo put that into historical context, only a decade ago Australia's global miner employed nearly 1000 at head office. That number fell promptly to nearer 600 under former chief executive Marius Kloppers and had fallen steadily from the time BHP identified that the boom was busting in 2012.\nAnd to put the cost drive into more contemporary context, the culling of Collins Street will leave it home to fewer (though more powerful) people than currently call BHP's Singapore headquarter home.\nThe culling of BHP Billiton headquarters in Melbourne will leave it home to fewer people than currently call BHP's Singapore headquarter home. Bloomberg Singapore is, to some recent tax office infamy, the home of BHP's commodities marketing operations but it also plays host to the company's mission-critical and very substantial IT and global procurement teams. Even with the shape-shifting and staff movement that followed the South32 merger, with 400 employees Singapore will boast a bigger BHP population than Melbourne when Mackenzie's latest laser blast is done with.\nThere is always considerable external sensitivity to dabbling with the shape of BHP's Melbourne domain. That the southern city continues to be home to BHP is required under the commitments offered to the Foreign Investment Review Committee in securing sign-off for the 2001 merger with Billiton.\nFor the record, the other defining commitments are that the chief executive, chief financial officer and their key support functions will sit inside the Melbourne HQ.\nThe new target for head office numbers will be reached through an already mature wave of redundancies that is already the talk of Collins Street. BHP's forced redundancy program has focused mostly on support staff but has already resulted in the departure of very senior figures in the company secretariat, legal and corporate affairs functions.\n But the HQ paring will also be achieved through the widespread redeployment of senior staff to points hither and thither around BHP's functional globe and, in one case at least, through the relocation of whole functions.\nBHP has confirmed that the Melbourne-based members of its treasury operation will be moved back to London progressively over the next six months. This would seem to represent a big change of mind somewhere.\nIt is not yet two years since BHP's treasury, finance and tax functions were integrated into a new capital management function in Project Unification. As a result senior members of the treasury team, along with all of the tax, finance and divestments and acquisitions teams, moved south to Melbourne.\nThe prodigal's return to the north will mean London's withered numbers will recover to an historically light 70 souls. From year's end treasury will be the only full function working out of BHP's South London base. It will be left without functional representation in areas like corporate affairs, investor relations, marketing, tax and IT.\nNeedless to say, post-South32 blood-letting at senior and support levels of BHP is not limited to Melbourne HQ. For example, we hear that BHP coal has said quiet farewell to up to 13 senior managers in recent months, with the most senior and well-regarded being the now-former BMA president Lucas Dow.\nThe Griffen paradox The Fair Work Commission has refused to indulge union-contested plans by a loss-making Western Australian coal miner to cut costs by ending weekend shifts and reducing its miners' working week to 35 hours.\nGriffen Coal has lost $160 million over four years and five months since it was acquired for $760 million from administrators by the ambitious Indian energy company Lanco Infratech Limited.\nTo observe that Griffen has been a bit of a dud for Lanco would be understatement on a grand scale.\nWith loses increasing and with no signs of new life in the price of the thermal coal that Griffen digs from its mines near Collie, the company went to the coal mining union seeking changes to shifts that would keep miners gainfully employed at the company's Ewington mines.\nEwington currently runs a four days on, four off roster. The work force is divided into four groups, called panels, and each panel works two consecutive 12-hour-day shifts and then two 12-hour-night shifts. They work to a 35-hour week but on rosters that demand 42 hours of actual work. This means they get seven hours of enriching overtime baked into a working week and live on a steady drip feed of even more-enriching weekend work.\nGriffen wants to put its mines on to a five-day week and its workers on to seven-hour shifts that demand few hours of night shift and require no weekend work. The net result would be that average annual salaries of a Ewington miner would fall by 38 per cent, or by an estimated $50,000.\nFor all that the miners might like having their weekends back, the idea of a $50,000 pay cut appeals to no one much. So, as you might expect, the CFMEU has offered typically stout resistance to the Griffen plan.\nTo some degree you can understand that. Outside of the massive pay cut explicit in the Griffen plan, the union warned that accepting the changed rosters would more than halve redundancy entitlements at a pair of mines that the FWC itself recognised were in \"a parlous economic state\".\nUnder the existing roster Griffen would be obliged to pay a total of $30 million in redundancy payments. Under the arrangement proposed and rejected by workers and FWC, that obligation would fall to $11 million.\nThe layers of uncomfortable industrial paradox here are mind boggling.\nGriffen says the only way for this mine to survive is to reduce labour costs that currently account for 26 per cent of a cost base that was unsustainable as long ago as 2010, when Griffen fell into administration at a point where coal prices were far better than they are now.\nSo management has worked up reforms that keep everyone in work but that, in turn, encourage suspicion of union, miners and columnists because they allow Griffen to avoid the immediate cost of redundancies and reduce future obligations if closure becomes necessary.\nThe coal union, on the other hand, is defending a roster that is financially unsustainable and that risks employment of all at Ewington. The union's understanding of this was made clear in the representations made about the risk the changes made to redundancy payments should the mines close. The union's clear preference is for Griffen to make a few redundant in the name of the same 12-hour shifts that, not a generation ago, it fiercely resisted.\nHaving failed to win any level of support for its plan to leap-frog to financial viability, Griffen turned to the FWC in March. Its primary argument was that the roster change was allowed under the existing enterprise agreement and that it expressed simple management prerogative. Barring that, it invited FWC arbitration of the dispute under options expressed in the same EA.\nUltimate the FWC rejected any idea that these changes could be forced on the miners and Griffen earned no joy either on the arbitration idea. And that leaves it stuck with some harder and likely more expensive options if it is to ever make a profit selling 2.8 million tonnes a year of thermal coal to its three Western Australia customers, Bluewaters Power, Cockburn Cement and South32's Worsley Alumina.\nThe Griffen dilemma is playing across the troubled landscape of Australian coal. Having built their businesses on 24-7 shifts and the 12-hour rosters that make them possible, marginal operators across NSW, Queensland and Western Australia are working out now how to ratchet back on working hours.\nHaving initially resisted the challenge of those taxing rosters, workers have built family balance sheets on the additional income they generate. Now they are being asked to wear the financial pain of coal's recession and, anecdotally, their resentment is intense and accumulating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:12:03.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
