Portugal and Spain have undertaken considerable reforms,\" said Robin, adding that economic growth has also resumed. \n\"Above all the European Central Bank is out there buying bonds every day,\" added Robin, referring to the quantitative easing (QE) programme launched in March, under which the ECB purchases around 60 billion euros of debt of eurozone member countries and companies. \nThe programme provides powerful support to bond markets and keeps interest rates low. But even that didn't prevent an upward swing in the second quarter of the year. \nIn the first quarter, galvanised by the ECB's announcement of its QE programme, sovereign yields dropped -- in some cases into negative territory as investors sought a safe haven investment amid fears of recession and deflation. \n\"(But) the second quarter was very tumultuous,\" said Jacq, citing two periods of significant rises in bond yields. \nAnd analysts agree that Greece played no role in those surges, which began before a Greek euro exit had become a serious possibility. \n\"There were several catalysts, including better than expected economic statistics and declarations by market heavyweights arguing rates were too low and calling for a sell-off. That's when the market took off,\" said Jacq, who anticipates more placid activity in the near term. \n\"The summer should be calmer... but come September -- between the looming rate rise by the US Federal Reserve and negotiations on Greece's debt restructuring -- volatility could make its return,\" said Robin. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Robb heading to Hawaii for TPP talks AAP \nTrade Minister Andrew Robb hopes negotiations in Hawaii this week will mean aloha to the much anticipated 12-country â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T12:15:55.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
