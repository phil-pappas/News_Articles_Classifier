It had bagged the project by projecting reduced expenses of about Rs1,048 crore to get this important PPP project from MMRDA. That the company is now working against its own planned projection and causing harassment to Mumbaikars for earning high profits can be understood from the following facts. This Information has been provided to RTI activist Anil Galgali by the MMRDA administration. The dispute between Reliance and the MMRDA has resulted in inconveniencing the Mumbaikars due to a fare hike as well as a projected fare hike. With an objective to understand the dispute RTI activist Anil Galgali had filed an RTI query seeking information pertaining to the project from the MMRDA. In a reply, MMRDA Informed Galgali that, Reliance and IICU-IL&FS had bid for the Mumbai Metro project under PPP method. The financial bid of Reliance was at a projected cost of Rs2,356 crore and sought a viability gap funding of Rs1,251 crore, whereas the IICU-IL&FS had submitted its bid by projecting a cost of Rs3,404 crore and seeking VGF of Rs1,296 crore. Hence, Reliance promoted Mumbai Metro one private limited had secured the project, points out Galgali. As per the agreement executed between Reliance and the MMRDA, the project was to be completed by 2010. In the business plan submitted by the Reliance it was estimated that the company will require 8 years to break even in this project and hence had planned to sustain loss upto 2018, reminds Galgali. Instead of sticking to its business plan the Reliance, right from day one had started cribbing about the losses, which is still going on, feels Galgali. The state government along with the Reliance Co had finalised the fare pattern on 3 September 2013 and had approved the fares for the Mumbai Metro uptil year 2044-45 and had allowed for stage wise fare increases of 11% every 4 years, which was agreed upon by the Reliance as well. To secure the Mumbai Metro bid, Reliance agreed to all the terms and conditions of the project. It is also understood that such projects need a long gestation period, which was reflected in its business plan of operating in loss for 8 years. It has now reversed its stand and is taking the MMRDA, the state government and the Mumbaikars for a ride, criticises Galgali. Looking at the scenario, Galgali wondered as to why MMRDA is not filing a case of cheating and breach of trust and violation of agreement case against the Reliance. Galgali in his demand has asked CM Devendra Fadnavis to ban Reliance from taking part in any of the PPP projects in future. Also, Reliance is seeking an additional assistance from the government which is similar to the difference between the bid of Reliance and IICU-IL&FS, that of Rs1,048 crore. This exposes the chinks in the armour of Reliance that it had purposely under-bid to just secure the project and is now resorting to arm-twisting by holding the Mumbaikars to ransom, observes Galgali.
