It also predicted that by 2025 more than 7 million households will be privately renting, up from less than 4.5 million in 2014.\nInstead of a blunt cap, the research suggests that long-term tenancies of up to five years with rent rises limited to inflation would provide security and stability for tenants, and be acceptable to many landlords as long as they were able to take back the property to sell or live in.\nRelated: Prime London rents exceed £100 a day\nShelter’s chief executive, Campbell Robb, said: “As the charity for people experiencing bad housing or homelessness, our first priority is tenants. That’s why although many have called for rent caps as the solution, we have found that this could add fuel to the fire by pushing landlords out of the market and making it even harder for renters to find a home they can afford.\n“This research is further proof that the government should give renters the stability they need to put down roots and save for their future by introducing longer-term tenancies with rent increases that can’t go above inflation.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T23:12:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
