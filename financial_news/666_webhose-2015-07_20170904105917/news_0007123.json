Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Simon Evans Luxury car importer Porsche Cars Australia has tripled profits and lifted revenues by 37 per cent to $428 million at a time when local car makers such as General Motors-Holden are reporting heavy losses which have totalled almost $1 billion in the past three years.\nStrong sales of the luxury brand enabled the local arm of Porsche to generate a net profit after tax of $18.8 million for calendar 2014, up from $6.81 million a year earlier.\nThe strong financial performance of Porsche is outlined in its latest financial statements which have been lodged with the corporate regulator. Directors of the Porsche Cars Australia entity expect \"another robust sales year\" in calendar 2015 although they are a little wary of dampened consumer sentiment in the broader retail sector which they say could have an impact later in 2015.\nThe tripling of profits comes in stark contrast to the financial performance of local car makers, with General Motors-Holden revealing on Friday the Holden operations in Australia had tumbled to an after-tax loss of $255 million in 2014, with a loss of $361 million on a pre-tax basis.\nHolden's sales dropped 10 per cent to $3.6 billion but the company's chief financial officer Jeff Rolfs said he was confident it had a bright future in Australia as an importer after it shuts down its local car-making operation in suburban Adelaide in 2017.\nHolden's total losses in the past three years amount to $966 million once restructuring charges and impairments are included. Toyota is also shutting down its local car-making operations in 2017 at Altona in Melbourne's west, while Ford will close its car-making plant in outer Melbourne at Broadmeadows in 2016.\nMining slowdown no barrier to sales Even the sharp slowdown in the mining boom in Western Australia hasn't crimped sales of Porsche vehicles at the state's largest Porsche dealer, Porsche Centre Perth, in the suburb of Nedlands.\n Porsche Centre Perth dealer principal Greg Arnold said sales were still solid at his dealership even though there had been a big fall-off in iron ore prices, a mainstay of the Western Australian economy.\n\"We're still going reasonably well even though there has been a big drop in iron ore prices,\" he says. Demand for Porsche vehicles was still strong from local buyers.\nMr Arnold says publicly available VFACTS industry sales figures showed the Porsche brand was delivering strong growth in Australia for the first six months of calendar 2015.\nIn the month of June it was the No. 25 brand in the entire market, not just luxury vehicles, with 382 Porsches sold, up 70 per cent on a year ago.\nPorsche Cars Australia's financial accounts for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014 showed the local arm didn't pay any dividends to its European-based parent.\nBut its tax bill shot up to $8.83 million in 2014, compared with $3.48 million of tax paid in 2013.\nProfit before tax for 2014 for the local company was $27.6 million, compared with $10.3 million a year earlier.\nPorsche Cars Australia employs 141 people across Australia. The brand was first introduced into the Australian market in 1951.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/103351169357344338991", "https://twitter.com/SimonMEvans"], "published": "2015-07-19T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T19:03:53.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
