Yields on 10-year German Bunds fell 9 basis points to 0.76 percent, while U.S. 10-year Treasuries yields declined 3 basis points to 2.367 percent. \nSteady to higher U.S. and European equity prices offset the drop in some Asian and emerging market stocks despite better-than-expected Chinese economic data. \nIn the oil market, Brent crude was down $1.01 or 1.7 percent at $57.50 a barrel, while U.S. oil futures were down $1.23 or 2.3 percent at $51.81. \nSpot gold prices were down 0.6 percent at $1,147.66 an ounce. \n(Additional reporting by Sinead Carew in New York, Marius Zaharia in London, Lisa Twaronite in Tokyo and Emelia Sithole Matarise in London; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Nick Zieminski)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T19:57:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
