Other publicly traded managers of hedge and private equity funds, including Blackstone Group LP and KKR & Co., are also seeking to grow by attracting more money from individuals.\n“All the firms are focused on the opportunity in liquid alternatives,” said Luke Montgomery, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York, referring to mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that employ hedge fund-like strategies. “You hear there is a lot of demand, but the uptake is a little bit slower” than such talk would suggest.\nCharles Zehren, an Apollo spokesman with Rubenstein Associates, didn’t immediately return a telephone call seeking comment on the new funds. Nor did Roger Hoadley, a spokesman for Waddell & Reed, a publicly traded asset manager based in Overland Park, Kansas.\nSub-Advisory Foray Apollo co-founder Joshua Harris said during its February earnings call that the firm had contracted to help manage the $6.1 billion Oppenheimer Global Strategic Income Fund. The agreement marked Apollo’s first sub-advisory relationship with a registered mutual fund, he said.\nThe Ivy Apollo Strategic Income Fund will divvy up its assets among three investment strategies: Apollo’s total return approach and global bond and high-income allocations overseen by Ivy, according to documents filed July 17 with the SEC. The Ivy Apollo Multi-Asset Income Fund will have four strategies: total return and global high income, equity income and real estate.\nApollo’s total return strategy focuses on high yield credit, a category that includes junk bonds, bank loans and mortgage backed securities, according to the filing. New York-based Apollo had about $163 billion of assets under management as of March 31.", "external_links": ["http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/883622/000119312515256052/d75531d485apos.htm\\"], "published": "2015-07-21T02:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T23:22:19.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
