Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Fiona Smith Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick says when she started her term eight years ago, domestic violence was a no-go topic in her discussions with business leaders.\nThey were happy to talk about sexual harassment, but violence in the home was regarded as a private matter. However, things are changing. Over the past two years, there has been a growing recognition that \"what affects employees affects employers\", Broderick told a Directioneering business breakfast this week.\nA number of large companies, including Telstra and National Australia Bank, offer employees domestic violence leave, and unions estimate 1.6 million workers are covered by such voluntary arrangements.\nThe acting director of the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, Louise McSorley, says having workplace support can make a real difference to people experiencing domestic violence.\nAgency data shows 32.2 per cent of reporting organisations (non-public sector organisations with 100 or more employees) have a formal policy or strategy in place to support employees who are experiencing family or domestic violence. Almost half of organisations with more than 5000 employees have a policy or strategy.\nMcSorley says many organisations without a formal policy or strategy have other measures which can be used, such as access to leave, employee assistance programs, and training of human resources (or other) staff. However, there is acknowledged under reporting and research shows many victims are unlikely to tell their bosses what is happening at home.\nHeavy impact The impact of domestic violence in Australia is estimated to cost businesses $456 million a year, with a further $609 million per year in productivity losses, due to lower revenue, increased costs, staff turnover and reduced access to human capital, according to Access Economics.\n The problem is widespread. Broderick says there are about 1.4 million Australian women who are living in an abusive relationship, or have done so in the past.\n\"Think of the Telstra stadium and imagine that filled 12 times over with women. That is the scale that we are dealing with.\"\nOf these women, about 800,000 are in the paid workforce. Around two women a week die as the result of violence, most at the hands of their male partner, according to advocacy group Destroy The Joint.\nAside from the the productivity impacts of domestic violence, victims can also be threatened in their places of work (US research shows 95 per cent of women stalked by a violent partner experience harassment and disruption at work) and perpetrators will often use work equipment (such as phones and computers) to continue their harassment.\nBroderick says when the reluctance to report is taken into account, it becomes clear that domestic violence is even more prevalent in Australia than official statistics first suggest.", "external_links": ["https://www.humanrights.gov.au/our-work/sex-discrimination/publications/fact-sheet-domestic-and-family-violence-workplace-issue", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/fionaatwork", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/113838175866099816066"], "published": "2015-07-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:08:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
