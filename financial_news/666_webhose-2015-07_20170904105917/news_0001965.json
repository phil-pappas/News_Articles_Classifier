Oil needs to establish a new range and we would see the WTI crude low around $50 with the upside capped at $58,\" Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note. \nA surprise increase in U.S. stockpiles despite the peak demand American summer driving season added to global oversupply as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia produce at near record levels. \nIranian exports could also resume at full throttle if major global powers and Iran find a compromise in nuclear talks this week that could lead to a lifting of western sanctions against Tehran. \n(Editing by Joseph Radford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T06:35:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
