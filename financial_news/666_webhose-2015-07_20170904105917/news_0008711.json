Indeed, Ethiopia and the United States of America have enjoyed cordial and long-standing bilateral ties. Ethiopia and the United States established diplomatic relations in 1903. However, people-to-people level relations were much older. \nHistorically speaking, the Ethio-US ties were strengthened with the signing of the September 1951 treaty of friendship and economic relations. In 1953, a further two agreements were signed: a mutual defence assistance agreement, under which the United States agreed to furnish military equipment and training, and an accord regularizing the operations of a US communication facility at Asmara, Kagnew Station. In 1957, the then US Vice-President Richard Nixon visited Ethiopia and called it \"one of the United States' most stalwart and consistent allies\". \nIn addition, during the 1960s the US Army provided mapping for much of the country of Ethiopia in an operation known as the Ethiopia-United States Mapping Mission. Ethiopia was also one of the first countries to be included in the American Peace Corps Programme, which emphasized agriculture, basic education, tourism, health, economic development and teaching English as a foreign language. The Peace Corps reported that since 1962, when its first volunteers arrived in Ethiopia, a total of 2,934 volunteers have served in that country. US Information Service educational and cultural exchanges were also an important part of the two countries' relations. After Ethiopia's 1974 revolution, the US-Ethiopian relations began to cool due to the military regime's (infamously known as the derg) linkage with international communism and US revulsion at its human rights abuses. \nAfter the downfall of the derg military regime in 1991, bilateral relations between the two countries improved. Ambassadorial relations between Ethiopia and the US were restored in 1992. Since the democratic government led by the Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) took power, the Ethio-US relations have been normal and warm. Indeed, the United States and the people of Ethiopia share a strong history as friends and partners. Today, the three pillars of the bilateral relationship are economic growth and development; democracy, governance, and human rights; and regional peace and security. \nThe United States and Ethiopia work together to enhance food security, improve health services, strengthen education, promote trade, and expand development. The United States has welcomed Ethiopia's dedication to maintaining security in the region, including through peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Sudan, and South Sudan. \nThe US has been extending various assistances to Ethiopia. It has provided emergency resources to Ethiopia in the form of food aid and humanitarian assistance. US development assistance to Ethiopia is focused on reducing famine vulnerability, hunger, and poverty and emphasizes economic, governance, and social sector policy reforms. Some military training funds, including training in such issues as the laws of war and observance of human rights, are also provided but are explicitly limited to non-lethal assistance, training, and peacekeeping support at present, according to information obtained from the US Department of State. \nConcerning Ethiopia-US bilateral economic relations, Ethiopia is eligible for preferential trade benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). US exports to Ethiopia include aircraft, wheat, machinery, low-price shipments and repaired products, and vegetables. US imports from Ethiopia include coffee, niger seeds, returns, and apparel. The United States has signed a trade and investment framework agreement with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, of which Ethiopia is a member. \nThe Ethio-US bilateral relation is expected to keep on blooming in the years ahead. It is projected that in the next few years, economic links and development issues are going to become even more important than they are today in connections between the two countries. One of the central elements of Ethiopia's foreign policy today is working towards the successful achievement of the country's objectives in the economic sphere. The US has been extremely generous in the provision of its valuable humanitarian and social sector assistance. Ethiopia is, and will remain, deeply grateful for all its aid and assistance. \nThe government of Ethiopia strongly believes that the US will also enhance its assistance in structural projects in development. These are areas which are going to be among the most important in shaping the country's future over the next decades. \nAs confirmed by the international community, Ethiopia is growing and rising fast. Its role in the Inter-Governmental Authority for Development (IGAD), in the region of the Horn of Africa, in Eastern Africa and in Africa in general is continuing to grow. This is not self-congratulatory, but realistic. It is something that is becoming apparent in the pro-active role that Ethiopia has been playing in the AU on a number of political and socio-economic issues. All this is commensurate with Ethiopia's steady progress in the economic area and in development. \nFollowing consecutive double digit economic growth over the past 12 years, Ethiopia has realistic hopes to become a middle income country in the next decade or so. It is expected to achieve many of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. In addition to its demonstrated commitment and strenuous efforts to beat poverty once and for all, Ethiopia does need the support of friends and partners to sustain and further accelerate the pace of its growth. In this aspect, the US, the world's superpower country, is expected to continue supporting Ethiopia's economic growth by increasing its all-rounded assistance in various fields of development. \nTo conclude, the bilateral relation between Ethiopia and the US, which is based on mutual benefit and reciprocal respect, is growing by leaps and bounds more than ever before. It is in the interest of both Ethiopia and the US to further strengthen their mutual ties in the political as well as socio-economic and security fields. In this regard, the visit of President Obama to Ethiopia is both historic and symbolic as it will have a paramount importance in enabling the two countries take their bilateral relations to the highest level in the years ahead.
