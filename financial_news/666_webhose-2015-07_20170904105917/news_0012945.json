The development plan for the project calls for the construction of 665 residential condominium units and townhomes, and up to 550,000 sq. ft. of commercial retail and office space. \nThe site is conveniently located near three of Toronto's major public transportation lines including the Bloor subway line, GO transit and the only intermediate stop on the newly launched Union Pearson Express airport rail link service. The property recently attracted a prime cultural tenant, the Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art (MOCCA), who recently announced it will be moving its gallery and head office to The Tower Automotive Building on the site. The building, a 10 story heritage structure built in 1919 and once the tallest building in Toronto, will be completely renovated and will sit at the center of this new community. \n\"Acquiring a property this substantial in physical land size and development density, over 1,000,000 buildable feet of mixed use space, will give Castlepoint and Greybrook a blank canvas to transform a previously underutilized area within the core of Toronto into a community where people will live, work and play,\" said the CEO of Greybrook Securities, Mr. Sasha Cucuz. \"This development has similar characteristics to Greybrook's initial investment in the previously underdeveloped Toronto neighbourhood of Liberty Village in mid-2007. Greybrook and its development partners have completed over 1,600 residential units in Liberty Village and have another 700 units actively in development that will contribute to this bustling Toronto neighbourhood.\" \nSince 2014, affiliates of Greybrook Realty Partners and the Castlepoint Group of Companies have jointly acquired over 2,500,000 sq. ft. of mixed use residential/commercial development land in Toronto's downtown core and an additional 200 acres of single family housing in the surrounding Greater Toronto Area. \"Greybrook has co-invested nearly $90,000,000 of equity into these developments, and we look forward to building on our success and collaborating on a number of projects in the future,\" said Mr. Cucuz. \nThe Castlepoint Group, which is now in its 25 th year of leadership in the development industry, has developed a wide range of properties across the Greater Toronto Area and in select U.S. markets. \nAbout Greybrook Realty Partners Inc. and Greybrook Securities Inc. \nGreybrook Realty Partners offers investors the unique ability to partner with top-tier North American real estate developers and share in their value creation activities.
