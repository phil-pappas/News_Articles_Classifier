PUBLISHED: 11:33, Mon, Jul 6, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:00, Mon, Jul 6, 2015 GETTY Greek protestors gathered in London over the weekend \nPrime Minister David Cameron, Chancellor George Osborne and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney have already today held an emergency meeting to workout how to protect Britain from the fallout of the Greek debt crisis. The meeting comes as financial markets around the world have been shaken as result of last night's Greeks referendum and the fallout has the potential to further wreak havoc on the British economy.In the coming weeks and days the uncertainty is set to continue.The Greek economic basket case can often feel like the preserve of economists but there are REAL and serious implications for every man, woman and child in the UKThe key issues for Brits are: GETTY The crisis in Greece affects British savers \nPensions hit \nThe value of pension and savings pots have plunged over the past week, thanks to the ripple affect of the crisis on global financial markets, and are set to fall further in the coming days. The typical British pension fund has around 15 per cent invested in Europe and around 35 per cent invested in the UK, according to pension provider Hargreaves Lansdown. It means that while British pension savings have little direct exposure to Greece debt, their value is dependent upon UK and Europen market highs and lows. The changes in market sentiment also affects savers who have turned to stocks and shares investments in order to try to generate returns in the face of low cash interest rates.London's FTSE 100 dropped sharply around 1 per cent in Monday morning trading hovering at around 6520, meaning that Britain's main share index is now around 8 per cent below a high of 7,104 at the end of the April. The drop means that the index has seen around £125billion wiped off its value over the past couple of months. European markets fell around 2 per cent in early trading on Monday morning.And experts have warned that investments are set for further losses, as the situation is set to worsen while Greece continues to negotiate its future.

He said: \"Investors should resist the urge to cash in their stock market investments, provided they are still in it for the long term. \"If you sell up every time there is bad news out there and buy back in when things look rosier, you’re probably going to lose out in the process. \"Stocks may yet have further to fall, but the question for potential investors is not where markets will be in two weeks’ time, but in five to ten years’ time.\"Over this time period equities still look like a decent bet compared to cash paying close to zero in interest, and gilts yielding 2 per cent and carrying a fair amount of downside risk.\" AP The Greek crisis has pushed global markets into the red \nBoost for holidaymakers to Europe... The crisis has gradually seen British sterling strengthen against the euro over the past few months. The exchange rate of the pound is now around €1.40 - last week it reached an eight-year high of €1.43. It means that holidaymakers to the continent will see their money go much further than it would this time last year when the rate stood at about €1.21. In the short-term the exchange rate is set to remain volatile, but as long as the crisis carries on, it's set to be in favour of the pound. But travellers to Greece urged to remain on high alert The situation on the ground in Greece is increasingly unpredictable and off the back of the 'No' vote, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) stepped up advice to British travellers . The office has warned that credit cards and banking services could stop working at short notice and has told travellers to take enough cash to cover their entire holiday. ATMs across the country have started to run dry after Greek banks were closed last week and limits on csh withdrawals were put in place. It's not yet clear if and when the firms will reopen and there are fears that the country is to run out of cash in the next few days. REUTERS Alexis Tsipras arrives for a meeting with political party leaders in Athens today \nHowever, the advice to carry extra cash could see tourists without cover if money is stolen or lost, as most travel policies have cash limits of up to around £200-300.Some insurers, including Virgin Money, have increased limits on cash cover for holidaymakers to Greece - travellers should check the details of their policy before leaving.The FCO told travellers to take extra security precautions when travelling with increased sums of money. British families who are planning to travel to Greece should consider buying travel insurance with robust cancellation cover included, as soon as they book their holiday. It means that holidaymakers will be reimbursed should they find that they are forced to cancel or cut their trip short.As travellers are only covered for events they didn’t know about before buying their insurance, the sooner people buy their policy the more protection they will have.
