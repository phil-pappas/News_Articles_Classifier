However, its early success was muted after the May launch of Periscope.\nThe partnership is an interesting one for GoPro as well, which continues to expand the functionality of its cameras in an effort to become a media and production powerhouse.\nGoPro has been joining with events and broadcasters to live-stream action-oriented events in real time. It told MarketWatch in February that it had plans to increase the pace of deals related to content and streaming over the next two years. GoPro continues to explore ‚Äúnew and innovative approaches‚Äù to bring its content to consumers, a spokesperson said.\nEarlier this year, GoPro launched a streaming channel on the LG Smart TV app. It also signed a deal with Vislink to enable broadcasters to live-stream GoPro content during big events. The GoPro brand has recently been associated with the Tour de France and MotoGP.\nOn a conference call with analysts discussing its stronger-than-expected quarterly results late Tuesday, GoPro President Anthony Bates said GoPro content has the potential to ‚Äúgenerate additional revenue streams‚Äù for the company over time.\nGoPro launched a premium content licensing portal this week as well, which pays users for professional-grade GoPro footage.\n‚ÄúGoPro is enabling content for major broadcasters, including NBC,‚Äù Bates said.\nGoPro and Meerkat did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of GoPro climbed 5.3% to $64.95 in recent trade. They have risen 50% over the last three months, outperforming the broader S&P 500, down 0.3% over the same period.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/GoPro", "https://twitter.com/AppMeerkat/status/624247946809315328", "http://t.co/R2ABeAmYrs", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShakeIt?src=hash"], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T06:35:52.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
