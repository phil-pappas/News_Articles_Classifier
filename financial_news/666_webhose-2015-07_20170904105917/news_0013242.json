I did my best to stuff as much as I could into my 1 day weekend. Boom! \nIt is the 4th of July on Saturday and our American relations will show how a Real Party is done. More than one comedian has quipped that the 4th should be renamed Blow Something Up Day but I am OK with seeing a country truly revel in their own freedoms. Oh and for those of you who have said, ‚ÄúI am moving to Canada now that same-sex marriage is legal‚Äù, you might want to reconsider things a little. üóΩ \nGreece, ‚Äônuff said. By the way, who loaned them the money, Money Mart? \nAccording to our friends over at the Canadian Taxpayers Federation Bill C-518 died ‚Äúon the vine‚Äù, in the Senate. Bill C-518 was the bill passed in the house of commons that was, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ ( the law to revoke taxpayer-funded pensions from criminal politicians )‚Ä¶‚Äù, I guess I am curious to ask, ‚ÄúAnd you thought the Senate would pass it?‚Äù. The CTF is always fun to read (I agree with the National Post on that one). My Writings for Week Ending July 3rd \nNow that Canada Day is done, what next? August long weekend? Simcoe Days? Labor Day? Christmas? Yikes! : Did you realize that inflation is really low? Stats Canada told us last week Inflation at 0.9% for May , but is it really? As usual, all is not as it might appear to be. Canada has it‚Äôs own (smaller scale) blow things up day, and to help celebrate it, I even included a video of Bill Shatner singing Oh Canada, so Happy Canada Day Celebrate out Nation On this site‚Äôs sister publication, there was another weekly roundup with Medical Concerns and Best of Technology and Security This Week . I am also fiddling around with a Raspberry Pi 2 at home as well (as if I didn‚Äôt have enough to do). \nAnd now, deep thoughts with Preet Banerjee: Oh, the airport: in men's room a guy had his elbows on ledge above urinal so he could text while‚Ä¶ urinating on his feet. \n‚Äî Preet Banerjee (@preetbanerjee) June 27, 2015 The Week the Greek Economy went Boom, and other Explosive Money Stories \nMark from 2nd Career Search asks a really hard question (and tries to help answer it) with How Much Can I Spend in Retirement? The answer will depend on your lifestyle, but still some very good points here. In other thoughts (to do with a second career search surprisingly) were you really thinking of quitting your current job? Well here is an interesting article from the Penny Hoarder on How to Quit Your Job: What to do Before You Resign (remember don‚Äôt quit before reading it). Getting back to that retirement theme, Marie from Boomer and Echo writes about Protecting Your Nest Egg in Retirement (and ensuring you don‚Äôt eat high ash cat food (OK she didn‚Äôt write that part)). \nBarry from Money We Have took a page out of My Own Advisor‚Äôs book and gave us an RRSP Update ‚ÄìJuly 1, 2015 , brave soul that he is (no I won‚Äôt be doing that any time soon). Mark from Blunt Bean Counter brings us a more interesting question for those who are incorporated, Should You Fund Your TFSA with Corporate Funds? Read on to find out. Million Dollar journey goes into their mailbag with Reader Mail: 17 Year Old Saving $500/Month, What Next ? All I can think is next would be 21 year old goes away to school, and blows entire nest egg on booze and partying? \nMr Money Mustache make a very interesting philosophical statement, If You Wouldn‚Äôt Buy it, You Should Probably Sell it. I won‚Äôt ruin it for you, but the opening photo is worth the link. Money Magazine on-line says that America is Going to Spend BIG to Celebrate independence . How much $725 Million on fireworks alone, that is a lot of BOOM ! Do you realize it is also the 50th anniversary of the Canadian Flag, but here is an interesting History of the Canadian Dollar , as well. \nI have bought 1 new car in my life (OK it was a Montana Van that must been built on Lemon Day) so I am on board with Mark from My Own Advisor on his artcle, Why I Still Drive My 15 Year Old Car . I am just not a car guy I suppose. Looks like a few of our regulars are taking a break this week. \n\nWonder what the author looks like ?
