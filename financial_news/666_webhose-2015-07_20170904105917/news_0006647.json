Last month, President Joko Widodo threw his weight behind the drive by inaugurating a national campaign by the OJK to promote awareness of Islamic finance. \nAttracting foreign capital is part of those plans; the OJK is considering easing foreign ownership ceilings for Islamic banks, now at 40 percent. Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank said this week it was considering entering the market as part of its acquisition plans for 2016. \nIt joins Bahrain's Al Baraka Banking Group and Dubai Islamic Bank , which plan to expand their operations in Southeast Asia's largest economy. \nMeanwhile, companies can raise cash in foreign currencies more easily with Islamic instruments, after the country's national sharia board approved sharia-compliant currency hedging tools in April. \nThe potential was illustrated in May when national flag carrier Garuda Indonesia became the first Indonesian corporate to tap the offshore market for Islamic bonds (sukuk) with a $500 million, five-year deal. \nGaruda's sukuk attracted $1.8 billion in orders, with 56 percent going to Middle East investors. \nCURRENCY \nLast week, Indonesian Islamic banks launched a standard contract template for sharia-compliant repurchase agreements, allowing the use of government-issued sukuk as collateral. \nBut other foreign-currency tools still need to be developed to attract Islamic investors which operate predominantly in U.S. dollars. \nIndonesia's central bank in 2010 helped establish the International Islamic Liquidity Management Corp (IILM), which regularly issues dollar-denominated sukuk for use as liquidity management tools. \nBut five years on, the IILM has made only modest headway in Indonesia. IILM sukuk have not yet been traded in the local money market and there are still no domestic primary dealer banks assigned to make that happen, Indonesia's central bank said in response to Reuters questions. \nIILM sukuk have been classified as a 20 percent risk-weighted asset, equivalent to a corporate bond for capital adequacy purposes, the central bank said. \nThis falls short of the IILM's intended purpose of being a top-rated cash management tool, known as a high-quality liquidity asset (HQLA), that could be used to meet Basel III regulatory requirements. \nThe issue of classifying IILM sukuk as HQLA is still being discussed, the central bank said. \n(Writing by Bernardo Vizcaino; Editing by Andrew Torchia & Kim Coghill) ((Bernardo.Vizcaino@thomsonreuters.com; Tel: +61293218168; Reuters Messaging: bernardo.vizcaino.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net)) \nKeywords: ISLAM FINANCING/INDONESIA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T10:16:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
