They predict growth will slow, before prices stall rather than slump after a peak some time in the coming couple of years.\nAlthough mortgage rates should stay low over the coming year, caution among lenders could make it tougher to get a loan, said Cameron Kusher, research analyst at housing industry information firm CoreLogic RP Data.\n“After three years of strong value growth in Sydney and Melbourne we expect growth to continue, however it should start to slow over the year, especially as housing supply continues to trend beyond the current record highs,” he said.\nThere are also signs that high prices are pushing homebuyers further afield.\n“We are already seeing signs of growth in other markets around the country, particularly areas like Newcastle and Wollongong adjacent to Sydney as well as certain pockets in Brisbane and the Gold and Sunshine Coasts,” Mr Kusher said.\nAcross the country, markets in Adelaide, Hobart and Canberra are likely to be “contained”, and weakness is likely to set in Perth and Darwin as resource investment boom fades.\nAngie Zigomanis, author of a report published by building industry analyst BIS Shrapnel, said prices would likely continue to rise through 2015/2016 and start to fall in 2017.\n“But doomsday predictions for the residential market are likely to be overblown,” he said.\n“Although Australia’s residential property markets are forecast to steadily weaken from 2016/17 as a combination of rising supply and the prospect of a tightening in interest rate policy impacts on prices, any downturn will be similar in magnitude to that seen over 2011/2012.” Guy Bruten, economist at global funds manager AllianceBernstein, has said a pick-up in home building has shifted the balance of supply and demand.\n“Nationwide, rental growth has slowed from mid-to-high single digits in 2008/2009 to just two per cent now,” he said.\nWhile increased supply is capping rental returns for investors, investor demand for housing could also be stifled by more stringent oversight by the Foreign Investment Review Board, and tighter control of lending by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.\nThese measures, targeted at investors rather than home buyers, could cut demand for homes in multi-unit developments, which form a bigger part of the market than ever before, Mr Bruten said.\nThis does not mean a market collapse of the type seen in recent years in the US, Ireland or Spain, he said, especially as housing credit has not been as strong in Australia as it was in those countries before their booms went bust.\n“Having said that, it’s almost inevitable, in my view, that we end up with some sharp falls in housing construction activity from the middle of next year (with some fallout on employment).\n“And this may accompany a prolonged period of flat-to-down house prices.”\nSyd, Melb property prices to fall 0:58 Play video\nBIS Shrapnel predicts house prices in the two top property markets will drop over the next two years\nNews Corp Australia 29 Jun 2015 News Lifestyle/Money Lifestyle Lifestyle/Realestate ", "external_links": ["http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/experts-dispel-fears-of-house-price-crash/story-fndban6l-1227422045376?sv=b4da25fc2011885e8c3bd1e0f5f417e&h=Housing+crash%3F+What+housing+crash%3F", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/experts-dispel-fears-of-house-price-crash/story-fndban6l-1227422045376?sv=b4da25fc2011885e8c3bd1e0f5f417e&title=Housing+crash%3F+What+housing+crash%3F", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content6.video.news.com.au/BxNDB4dTpJKu3m4nEVhxNJhiI4yU_Eqf/promo259809718&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/experts-dispel-fears-of-house-price-crash/story-fndban6l-1227422045376?sv=b4da25fc2011885e8c3bd1e0f5f417e", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/experts-dispel-fears-of-house-price-crash/story-fndban6l-1227422045376?sv=b4da25fc2011885e8c3bd1e0f5f417e&title=Housing+crash%3F+What+housing+crash%3F", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Housing+crash%3F+What+housing+crash%3F&c=THERE+has+been+plenty+of+talk+about+a+possible+housing+market+apocalypse%2C+but+how+do+economists++really+see+it%3F&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/experts-dispel-fears-of-house-price-crash/story-fndban6l-1227422045376?sv=b4da25fc2011885e8c3bd1e0f5f417e", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/experts-dispel-fears-of-house-price-crash/story-fndban6l-1227422045376?sv=b4da25fc2011885e8c3bd1e0f5f417e"], "published": "2015-06-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T05:21:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
