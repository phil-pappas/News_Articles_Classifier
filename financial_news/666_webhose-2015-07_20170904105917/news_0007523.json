Yet I have still not seen the money. Nor have I had any special treatment or apology or compensation. For more than four years I have tried to submit meter readings via its website, telephone and text. We have had its staff at our property repeatedly, but we never had an accurate meter reading. We were told this was because the meter at the property did not match what it had in its system. We continue to have a meter British Gas doesn’t like reading and which it has failed to replace to this day. I am extremely frustrated not least because it hasn’t refunded the money. JS, London In an old and draughty house with bills rising scarily, you report that you and your children were freezing during the day and installed a wood-burning stove in one room specifically to ward off higher gas bills. • Your gas will cost £53,500, British Gas tells three-bed household I cannot see any reason for you to make up all this yet British Gas’s response is a far cry from what you have written. British Gas says that in 2013 it called at the property for a routine meter read. There was no response. It says you only approached it for the first time four months before writing to me to express concern about your bills. It was subsequently established that £6,803 was owed. On the day I contacted British Gas it made a payment of the £6,803 into your account. It states, “As Mrs S did not contact us about her concerns or submit meter readings, her bills were all based on estimated use. “As soon as Mrs S provided meter readings we recalculated her bills. We have apologised for the delay in processing the over payment, which has now been credited to Mrs S’s account.” • If you want to contact Jessica, click here Follow @telegraph Telegraph Home Insurance Get a Quote: » Up to 25% discount for over 50's", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T00:13:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
