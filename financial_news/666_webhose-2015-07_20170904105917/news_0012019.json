Coupled with the success behind the long-running “Mission: Impossible” franchise, that means the latest installment could be atop the weekend box office.\nThe 53-year-old Cruise’s latest adventure as Ethan Hunt in “Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation” is set to open in theaters this weekend. Rentrak analyst Paul Dergarabedian said his team is expecting the film to garner somewhere between $35 million and $40 million, but he said it might even do a bit better.\n“Tom Cruise is a marketing machine; he is literally everywhere,” Dergarabedian said. “This could be a film that outperforms a little bit. This could set us up nicely for a good run through the end of summer — Labor Day.”\nDergarabedian said “Mission: Impossible” epitomizes what a summer movie should be. Based on Cruise’s tireless promotional efforts, great reviews and the mythology surrounding him doing his own stunts, Dergarabedian said $40 million-plus could be conservative for the opening weekend. The franchise has accumulated $740 million in domestic box-office receipts and $2.1 billion worldwide since it began in 1996.\n“That cliché, the hardest working man in show business — it might very well be Tom Cruise,” Dergarabedian said. “No matter what you think of his personal life, you have to give it up to him. Tom Cruise is still arguably the biggest movie star in the world.”\n“Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation” is owned by Viacom Inc.’s VIA, +0.02% VIAB, -0.42% Paramount Pictures. The studio’s last film, “Terminator: Genisys,” didn’t perform to expectations. The movie brought in $27 million in its opening weekend in early July. Paramount has the fifth-largest market share among the film studios, with $362 million in revenue this year.\nAlso read: Universal Pictures has a grip on domestic box offices so far this year\nThis weekend will also be the first for Ed Helm’s “Vacation” from Time Warner Inc.’s TWX, +0.37% Warner Bros. The movie opened Wednesday to $3.8 million in box-office receipts and mostly negative reviews, landing a 27% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Dergarabedian, who’s only seen pieces of the film, likened the story line to “We’re the Millers” starring Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis. Like that film, he said “Vacation” could garner somewhere in the mid-$20 million this weekend.\nRead: This ‘Vacation’ is no picnic\nThere’s little in the way of other competition for the latest “Mission Impossible.” Most of the other films showing in theaters this weekend, including Walt Disney Co’s DIS, +0.16% “Ant-Man” from Marvel Studios, will likely see drops in attendance from their previous weeks, with revenues ending somewhere in the teens.\n“‘Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation’ will most assumedly be the No. 1 movie this weekend,” Dergarabedian said. “The movie is already a success in terms of its marketing, reviews and the amount of buzz it’s creating. This will be a huge winner for Tom Cruise.”\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/KA2_Jyb8jkY"], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:20:55.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
