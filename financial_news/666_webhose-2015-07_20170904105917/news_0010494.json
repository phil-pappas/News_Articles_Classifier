Its default is 100% certain,” says Larry Swedroe, Director of Research for The BAM ALLIANCE and the author of 14 books on investing, including his most recent, The Incredible Shrinking Alpha , co-authored with Andrew Berkin.\n“The only question is how much and what they default on,” he continues. “But with a GNP that is similar to Rhode Island’s, Greece’s default should have little to no impact on the world’s economy, at least not directly.”\nSo why is everyone so worried?\nATHENS, GREECE – JULY 02: A security guard stands outside the Athens Academy building next to graffiti saying ‘OXI’ meaning ‘NO’ to austerity on July 2, 2015 in Athens, Greece.

Or it could be the imminent default in Puerto Rico. But it also could’ve been ISIS or Libya or the financial woes of bigger economies, like Spain and Ireland. Heck, it could’ve been Greece in 2012 or 2010. Except that it wasn’t.\nRisk Vs. Uncertainty\nThe real worry over Greece is the same as what ultimately pains us about investing in “the market” in general. It’s not calculable risk that we fear when we’re planning ahead for the potential of any individual event, or even a convergence of events, to devolve into a catastrophe (the proverbial “black swan”). It’s the inherent uncertainty of such an event occurring that leads us to fret.\nPage 1 / 3 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/479197960/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/anil.kashyap/research/papers/A-Primer-on-the-Greek-Crisis_june29.pdf", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0692336516"], "published": "2015-07-02T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T17:00:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
