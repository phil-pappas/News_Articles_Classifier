Luis Ascui by Ewin Hannan Labor is resisting a push by senior union leaders to force the nation's biggest companies to hand over confidential financial information to unions during wage negotiations.\nSeveral influential unions are seeking changes to the ALP platform at the party's national conference this week that would commit Labor in government to back changes to the Fair Work Act requiring greater disclosure by business.\nUnder the proposed \"truth in bargaining\" laws, employers would be required to disclose comprehensive internal accounts, budgets and forecasts to unions.\nThe proposal, that has been sharply criticised by employers and the Abbott government, would apply to documents deemed by companies to be commercial-in-confidence. In exchange, union officials would sign agreements committing not to disclose the information.\nThe national push is being led by the Rail, Tram and Bus Union and has the backing of the Australian Workers Union, the Transport Workers Union and the Maritime Union of Australia. ACTU secretary Dave Oliver also supports the proposal.\nBut The Australian Financial Review has been told that senior ALP figures are opposed to the plan and will not support changes that force employers to hand over information to unions.\nIt is understood a compromise proposal will be discussed in the days leading up to national conference to allow unions in dispute with companies to apply to have employers release relevant financial information to a court or a member of the Fair Work Commission.\nSources said Labor had sympathy for union arguments that some companies had used commercial confidentiality to camouflage their financial position.\n However, it is understood Labor would only consider support for legislative changes that allow for unions to apply on a case-by-case basis for the release of financial information to the commission or a court. Sources said Labor would not support the information being provided directly to a union, or the release of the information being mandatory.\nACTU president Ged Kearney said on Monday that companies should provide unions with relevant rather than selective information during workplace bargaining.\n\"Honest communication between employers and unions during bargaining requires an exchange of all relevant information, not just what the employer decides to reveal,\" she said.\n\"Collective bargaining needs to be in good faith with all parties clear about where they stand, which is why unions will always advocate for truth in bargaining whether as ALP policy or through government legislation.\"\nThe clause the unions want inserted into the ALP platform says, \"Labor believes complete transparency is vital to a successful and effective bargaining system. Labor will implement 'Truth in Bargaining' laws by amending the Fair Work Act to mandate employer disclosure of comprehensive internal accounts, budgets and forecasts as part of the bargaining process.\"\nEmployment Minister Eric Abetz​ has claimed the implementation of the union proposal would be a disaster for business as union \"bosses\" could not be trusted with the financial information.\nAustralian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox​ has said the good faith bargaining obligations in the Fair Work Act currently imposed obligations on employers regarding the provision of information, and the union proposal was a \"massive fishing exercise\".\nAustralian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Kate Carnell has also described the proposal as unworkable. Accusing unions of posturing, she said bigger companies negotiating with unions were subject to significant disclosure requirements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T23:05:10.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
