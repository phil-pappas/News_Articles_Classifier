There is no question that rules are needed in these areas so that trade can flow.\nJane Drake-Brockman, ICTSD \"People are getting tired and tense as it's getting close,\" one participant said. \"People are talking bluntly to each other – it's pretty brutal.\"\nThe deal is likely to be made or broken on old-style trade questions such as tariffs and quotas in Japan and what that means for sugar farmers in Queensland and boutique dairy farmers in Quebec.\nIn economic terms, however, the creation or diversion of farm products around the Pacific Rim will be a sideshow compared with the impact of provisions that will \"set the rules\" by which global commerce is done.\nThese rules are about levelling the playing field at the expense of state firms, reducing the scourge of corruption and, particularly, they are about freeing up the flow of data across borders.\nNot that straightforward And that's not as straightforward as it seems.\n\"Data is actually the cutting edge of where protectionism is these days,\" says Jane Drake-Brockman, former senior diplomat and trade economist, and now senior advisor to Geneva-based International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development. \"There is no question that rules are needed in these areas so that trade can flow.\"\nThe importance of data security and freedom began edging onto the news agenda when huge companies such as Google, Facebook and eBay began packing up or being evicted from the Chinese market place.\n\"China has restricted market access with a number of digital service companies including Google and eBay, and that's one of the reasons why Alibaba and Baidu have become dominant players,\" says author Stephen Ezell, at The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, an industry body that has had a hand in shaping data chapters of the TPP.\nChina will not be a founding member of the TPP but it forms a large part of the backdrop. It is the stand-out example of how political security and industry protectionism can tilt the playing field in the absence of enforceable global norms. But it's certainly not on its own.\nMajor tussles of data rights Iran, Russia and even open democracies like Indonesia and Korea have had major tussles over the rights of multinationals to keep data wherever they deem it to be cheapest and more secure.\nAmong the likely TPP members, Vietnam and Malaysia have some accommodating they need to do.\nAnd data is rapidly moving beyond fixed hubs – it's \"in the cloud\" – and the debate is not just about IT.\n\"I reckon data is the future,\" says trade economist Chris Findlay, who heads the faculty of law and economics at the University of Adelaide. \"And it's so much under-appreciated by people who reckon value only resides in something you can touch.\"\nAn insurance company might be writing policies in a hundred different countries, while processing customer information in \"hubs\" that shift throughout the day.\nOrdinary bank transactions can involve packets of data flying around the world.\nNew data capabilities are creating whole new realms of value out of surplus capacity that had been built for other purposes, with Uber and Airbnb pioneering the way.\nRemote control Old manufacturers now market their products online, instantly transmitting feedback between consumer to factory, and rapidly delivering products to the doorstep through postal services that have been transformed. They're moving further into the digital world of 3D printing. And they're digging pits and moving rocks like just-in-time manufacturers – by remote control.\n\"Look at Australia's leading mining companies, like Rio Tinto, who now have centralised operations centres where they can control mining and drilling operations remotely across the world,\" says Ezell, of the IT industry body.\nEzell says the data chapter of the TPP will contain two main requirements. The first is a positive obligation, requiring nations to facilitate the open flow of information.\nThe second stops countries from forcing business to use computing services in-country.\nWhether myriad businesses thrive, die, mutate or simply move elsewhere may depend upon regulatory regimes that are yet to be put in place.\nThese new rules for 12 nations on the Pacific Rim are intended as a template for the wider world. And it's a US-centred world, as US President Barack Obama has made plain.\n\"If we don't write the rules, China will write the rules out in that region,\" Mr Obama said when he was pushing the TPP cart through Congress. \"We will be shut out.\"\nNot just aspirational And if the TPP receives in-principle approval on Friday, its clauses will not be merely aspirational.\nEffective dispute resolution and investor-state dispute settlement clauses in the TPP might be less necessary for countries who have courts that investors can trust, says Donald Robertson, partner in international law and arbitration at Freehills. In other cases, he says, even if they are controversial they are a vast improvement on the past.\n\"You go to your government to ask for help, and they might say they'd get around to it, or you'd send the gunboats in,\" Robertson says. \"And that's actually what used to happen. We wanted something better than that.\"\nGenerally, countries will be required to provide fair and equitable treatment to investors, which means refraining from appropriating property without compensation. There will be carve-outs to ensure governments can freely legislate on matters affecting public welfare, health and human rights.\nOverall, Robertson says, the TPP will update rules that have not been substantially altered since the advent of e-commerce. And this, he says, is essential for the future of open, rules-based order that Mr Obama has been talking about.\n\"This is about the rule of law and the principles are clear,\" Robertson says. \"You don't get hidden deals, you don't get property taken away from you, that people should have the confidence to move forward and invest,\" he says. \"The price of being in that free-market area is you play by the rules.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T06:53:15.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
