Local manufacturing will create jobs?” he asked. To back his disquiet, he indicated that last year the country’s manufacturing sector recorded a negative 8 percent growth, which according to him is an indictment on the country. \nHe added that “over 10 thousand people have lost their jobs just recently and it is not just about the energy crisis.” \nDr. Adu Gyamfi argues that although the energy crisis is a major concern, most jobs in the country are being lost because manufacturing firms are closing down due to the fact that products which could have been manufactured here in Ghana are rather being imported. \nHe however blamed donor support partly for the current debacle since they enjoin government to buy some medicines from external sources. \n“If Ghana government had its own monies, the governor will not be obliged to buy the medicine from outside but because of the conditions attached to donor funds government cannot use the monies to buy from within and that has been a major problem.” \nInspite of these challenges, Dr. Adu Gyamfi is hopeful the phenomenon could change in the coming months as the company is working judiciously with government to see if monies could be generated locally to ensure that government purchase their products.. \nHe hinted that a deal could soon be struck with government to enable them supply locally manufactured anti-retroviral drugs to the various health facilities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T01:50:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
