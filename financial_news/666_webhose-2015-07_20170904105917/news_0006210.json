Several children were present that play on their own U.S. soccer teams, many hoping to one day follow in the footsteps of star players like Carli Lloyd and Abby Wambach.\nLloyd scored three goals in the first 16 minutes of the team’s championship game against Japan on Sunday. The team won its third World Cup title, defeating Japan 5-2.\n“We got up at 5 a.m. to get down here,” said Kitty Falco, a mother from Syracuse, N.Y., who traveled to New York City with her family. “We are all huge fans.”\nThe parade began near Manhattan’s Battery Park, in the Canyon of Heroes, at 11 a.m.\nMarketWatch/Jennifer Booton Slide 2 of 13 Kiera Ward and Melissa Schwartz pose with an American Flag draped over their shoulders after taking several pictures of the U.S. women’s soccer team before the championship team boarded a bus to downtown Manhattan just before the start of the ticker-day parade.\nMarketWatch/Jennifer Booton Slide 3 of 13 Teenage girls Stephanie Blaskovic, Lindsey Wynne, Victoria Gianatiempo, Christina Lavelle, Diana Gorga and Kelly Grogan pose with American Flags in Times Square just before heading downtown to catch the ticker-tape parade.

The young team played a game in their own league while in Canada.\nMarketWatch/Jennifer Booton Slide 6 of 13 A group of mostly women and girls lift their cameras for photos as the U.S. women’s soccer team boards a bus to travel to Battery Park, the start of the ticker-tape parade, after an appearance on Good Morning America in Times Square.\nMarketWatch/Jennifer Booton Slide 7 of 13 The Burns family from Monmouth County, N.J., pose with their signs after traveling an hour by bus into New York City to watch the parade.
