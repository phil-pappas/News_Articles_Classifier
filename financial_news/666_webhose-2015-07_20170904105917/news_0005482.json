The fight to acquire and retain customers is set to get tougher as the central bank is likely to allow more companies, including supermarkets and telecom companies, to sell financial products. To woo customers, lenders are offering new digital banking services. Another step is advertising sharp cuts in the time taken to approve and disburse products, including loans and credit cards. Many bankers feel that to stay ahead they need to cater to customers’ demand for speedy services. “We believe that the turnaround time has always been a key differentiator and a critical component of the overall customer experience, for all financial services,” said Arjun Chowdhry, head of cards and unsecured lending, Citibank India. Technology, established credit information tracking systems and data analysis is allowing banks to shorten procedures and cut the time needed to provide services and products. “We will see reduction in turnaround time due to preapproved loans, paperless loans and loans approved by using data which is now easily available. Risk also gets reduced as there is more information now,” said Saurabh Tripathi, partner and director at Boston Consulting Group (BCG). But making promises is one thing and fulfilling them is another. So, Mint Money decided to check some of the claims that banks make about instant or very quick approvals. We did this for four categories—bank accounts, personal loans, credit cards and lockers. Here’s what we found about the country’s largest banks that claim to have the fastest turnaround times.\nBank accounts Banks promise to open bank accounts instantly, both online and offline. We tried out the online account opening process of State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd. SBI, India’s largest bank by assets, gave two options. In one, the user has to download the form from its website, fill it, and visit a branch to submit the form along with know-your-customer (KYC) documents and the minimum account balance required to open an account. In the other option, she has to visit an inTouch branch, SBI’s digital branch, and go through the online process there. Once the KYC is done, you get to pick a branch and a debit card is given. But this “instant” process is available only at around seven SBI inTouch branches. We tried both the options and found that visiting an inTouch branch is a faster way to open an SBI bank account. ICICI Bank refers to this mode of banking as Tab Banking. When a potential customer applies online to open an account, she will receive a message saying the bank will send an executive shortly. When we applied online, the executive called back the same day to confirm time and location to meet and collect documents. We were asked to show an original photo identity (say, Permanent Account Number card) and an address proof (say, a passport). The next step in the process involves taking pictures of the applicant, her photo ID and address proof, and handing over the starting kit. The account will be activated in 24 hours but money has to be deposited before further transactions can be made. With HDFC Bank and Axis Bank, one can fill all details online and even upload documents (optional with HDFC Bank). Soon after (we got a call within five minutes), an executive will call regarding when and where to meet and which documents will be needed. The bank executive hands over the kit (which has a debit card and a cheque book) and takes the documents. Since digital signatures have not come into effect, to complete the bank account opening process, documents have to be submitted even if they were uploaded earlier. Some banks, such as SBI, give the account number and the debit card in the initial 30 minutes, while others, such as HDFC Bank, also give the cheque book, the debit card and the passwords for the debit card and Net banking. One can use Net banking for transactions, avail ATM facilities and make cash transactions at a branch. Some banks give the cheque book not “instantly” but in about seven working days and only at select branches. Remember, even though the process to open a bank account has changed and become faster, costs and charges attached, say, such as minimum balance requirement, remain the same. Personal loans After bank account, the next product that many banks promise to provide “instantly” is a personal loan. We tried some of the online options available. In some banks, the instant personal loan facility works only for existing customers. For instance, if one wants to opt for the 10-second loan by HDFC Bank, she needs to be a customer of the bank and have a pre-approved loan. If she has a pre-approved loan available, the lender will notify her through the Net banking page. To avail the loan, one has to log into the Net banking or mobile banking option. The message on the Net banking page may say that the user has a pre-approved loan for Rs. 7.50 lakh at 15.5% interest rate. A click on the message will take the customer to another page that provides details of equated monthly instalments (EMI), charges, costs and the form. If the personal loan from HDFC Bank is of Rs. 1 lakh, the processing fee is Rs. 3,420 and stamp duty is Rs. 400. As the process is entirely online, if there is even a small mismatch in information that a user enters, the money will not be disbursed. If the bank finds the information to be accurate, the money—after deduction of processing fees and other charges—gets credited into the customer’s account. We followed the process online and received the loan amount in the indicated bank account. There are also banks that give instant approval for personal loans to non-customers as well. For instance, we approached ICICI Bank for an instant e-approval. The applicant has to provide certain details first to check eligibility. The loan amount, interest rate, tenor and charges are determined on the basis of job description, age, city, monthly income and outstanding EMI. The applicant has to also provide address and PAN. Once details are filled, the bank representative is supposed to collect documents within two working days. When we applied for the personal loan, the approval happened within minutes and we got a call within two hours. If documents are in place, the bank says you will get the money within 3-5 working days. How do the banks manage the process? Earlier, a bank would take the form, verify the details and offer a loan only after that. Doing this took multiple visits and several days. But now those banks that offer “instant” loans, are able to undertake the various steps of the process much faster, thanks to material already available, said Nitin Chugh, head–digital banking, HDFC Bank. Costs remain similar to what a customer would have paid while taking the offline route. Credit cards Another service that banks offer “instantly” is credit card approval. In case of Citibank, for example, the offer is available not online but only at specific branches—one in Mumbai and one in Bengaluru. We checked for Mumbai and found that the branch was closed for maintenance. We were, however, able to speak with a customer who has availed this facility. Homi Jimmy Talati, the 37-year-old proprietor of Farnaz Advertising Associates, said he had got an instant credit card from Citibank’s Palladium branch in Mumbai in 2014. “There was an offer in one of the electronics store in Palladium for a Citi credit card. I visited the branch in the afternoon, and gave my ID and address proof. By evening, I had got the credit card and bought the product for which I had taken this card,” said Talati. Are there any additional documents needed to get this instant credit card. “No,” said Chowdhry. “We follow the same checks as with any other credit card in the industry. But as a measure of safety, for the first three months, we monitor the instantly-issued card’s usage to ensure the card is being utilized responsibly,” he added. Some banks offer pre-approved credit cards to their customers. You may find these offer when you login to Net banking. Clicking on the link will take you to the online submission form. Once the details are filled, the bank verifies the information. You may get approval for the credit card instantly. We tried one such offer from HDFC Bank. After filling in and submitting the form online, we received a message saying the application reference number would be sent via SMS in 48 working hours and the credit card processing will take approximately 10 days. The bank plans to bring down the credit card approval process to three days from 15 July, said an HDFC Bank spokesperson. One can expect delay in issuance or rejection of application if the bank is not satisfied with the details provided. Bank lockers To book a locker, one has to usually visit a branch, or several of them, and check availability. But customers of Axis Bank are saved the trouble as one can book a locker through the bank’s app. To book a locker, click on the apply tab and choose city and preferred branch. Details such as size, cost and availability will appear on the screen. To test, we selected Noida and the app gave us four options—small ( Rs. 1,688 plus service charges), medium ( Rs. 3,375 plus service charges), large ( Rs. 5,625 plus service charges) and extra large (was not available). Service charge was 14% of the fee. These charges are on prorata basis. The yearly cost for small, medium, large and extra large lockers is Rs. 3,000, Rs. 6,000, Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 12,000, respectively. Locker selection and payment can be made online, but a visit to the branch is needed to get the signature verified. The process will not be completed otherwise. Also, while using the app, at times, we got blank pages. For most banks, however, one has to go branch to branch. Mint Money take In the process of trying out various “instant” products and services, we made a few observations. Banks have indeed reduced the turnaround time for products where they have either all the documents or which are simpler to offer. For instance, loans that were approved in 3-7 days even as recently as two months back, are now cleared in a few minutes or hours. “Right now, banks are trying out the faster approval and disbursement process for products that are easy to handle. Products such as home loan will take more time to get faster processes. In the lending space, credit cards and personal loans are simple to offer. Whereas auto is complicated and home loan is very complicated,” said Jairam Sridharan, president–retail lending and payments, Axis Bank. Another observation was that in many cases, the process was not as seamless and quick as advertised. A time-consuming part of an online application is filling in details, which almost always means putting in one or two addresses. Then, since the documents have to be checked, one has to wait to meet a bank representative. The bank, on its part, has to ensure it is dealing with a customer who has the capacity to repay. If banks are able to further speed up parts of the process, such as inputting user details and using digital signatures, products and services may become “instantly” available. ( We applied online in an individual capacity, or spoke to customers who have availed certain facilities. In some cases, we went through to the last step, in others we stopped before making a payment. In all instances, the bank concerned was informed of the exercise. There are various other banking services available in this ‘instant’ category .)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T05:07:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
