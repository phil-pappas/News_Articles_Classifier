By Sophie Christie | Telegraph – 7 minutes ago 33.59 +0.17 \nAsk an expert: A reader asks how a 'Grexit' would affect the euro, and whether to buy holiday money now or wait a month \nHow is the euro to sterling exchange rate likely to change if Greece leaves the EU? Should I buy my euros now or wait a month? OB, via Twitter (Swiss: TWTR.SW - news ) \nPredicting the next move in currencies is extremely difficult to do, or even impossible. \nBut the strong likelihood is that if Greece left the eurozone, and returned to its previous currency (the drachma), the euro would weaken markedly across the board, in the short-term at least, including against sterling, said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight. \nThere would initially be major uncertainty in the markets as to just how much eurozone growth would be hit by the Greek exit and it is likely that the European Central Bank (ECB) would take more stimulative action to try and limit contagion, Mr Archer said. \n• What is a Grexit and how would Greece leaving affect the euro? In 60 seconds \nSterling would likely rise less against the euro than the US dollar would, as the UK would be seen as more vulnerable to any fallout from weakened eurozone growth (mainly through the impact on eurozone growth). Which means that although sterling would rise against the euro, it would probably soften against the US dollar. \n\"The harder eurozone economic activity is hit by a Greek exit, the greater and longer-lasting sterling’s gains are likely to be against the euro,\" Mr Archer said. \n\"However, if it increasingly looks like the economic hit to the rest of the eurozone from a Greek exit was being contained (by the various firewalls that have been put in place in recent years, and the fact that Greece only accounts for some 2pc of eurozone GDP), sterling’s gains against the euro would likely be limited.\" \n• I am going on holiday to Greece should I avoid 'Greek euros'? \nMr Archer continued: \"In fact if the near-term contagion to the rest of the eurozone from a Greek exit was contained, the euro could well strengthen against sterling over the longer term, on belief that the eurozone was better off without Greece. This is particularly likely to be the case if a Greek exit fostered more cooperation among eurozone policymakers.\" \n= So, should I buy my euros now or wait a month? = \nIt's a hard call, as if there is an agreement on Greece over the coming days, then the euro could rally. Sterling is already very strong against the euro. \nToday, the euro is worth around €1.387 to every pound. The pound hit a high of €1.429 last Monday, but has since fallen and remained around the €1.39 mark. \nHowever, if there is no agreement reached and the Greek situation deteriorates further, sterling would be likely to make further gains and be stronger in a month’s time \n\"There is probably more potential for sterling to gain than soften over the coming month but it is by no means a certainty,\" Mr Archer said. \nPound to sterling exchange rate over the past month \nSource: XE.com Do you have a question for our experts?
