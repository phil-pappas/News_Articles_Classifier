During the course of the last five years, the country has, on the aggregate, built about 65 ,000 kilometers. None of the developed nations have displayed such developmental feats in their history. So, Obama's coming will open up this country to the international private sector where resource for development would be available much easily instead of loans and grants that we are receiving, he added. \nAccording to him, the first American mission was opened here in Ethiopia during the reign of Emperor Menelik. USA came here with a belief that Ethiopia is a great nation. Under Emperor Hailesellsassie, the relation was deep enough to secure America's support. The Point Four Programme in Ethiopia was one of the most prolific programmes which built roads, schools, Hailesillassie I University with American Universities support. Then of course, during the Derg regime that relationship was completely curtailed. Eventually, now we have a win-win relationship with the United States, for the US remains to be the biggest donor to Ethiopia in the area of health, education, food security and capacity building, he added. \nRecalling the 1.5 billion USD support per annum, Costantinos said the US has continued to provide huge sum to this country. The fight against HIV and AIDS is made possible through PPFR programme. \nMr Obama's coming here opens up new business opportunities. A lot of American companies will come with Foreign Direct Investment. That is what Ethiopia needs at this juncture in time. And this will be possible through re-branding the country. When Obama comes here the whole world will focus on Ethiopia, he said. \nDr. Demeke Achiso is Assistant Professor at Political Science and International Relations Department with the Addis Ababa University. \nIn an exclusive interview with The Ethiopian Herald, he said that Obama's visit to Ethiopia is testimony to the recognition of Ethiopia's role in the Horn of Africa. It attests for Ethiopia's emerging economy, which has been hailed by many financial institutions, international organizations, bilateral multilateral donors as one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Besides, it draws attention to Ethiopia's move towards a carbon free non oil producing economy. \nHe also said that this places the Ethiopian economy in a quite unique position in the global political economy. Ethiopia in the post 1990's period has almost assumed a leadership position in the entire Africa. And Ethiopia has also been hosting many international and regional organizations. So, it is a must for Obama or the US to use Ethiopia as a gateway to influence and probably to find a niche in the competition with other emerging economies in the world like China, Brazil, India, he added. \nDemeke further explained Ethiopia is a gateway and Obama should respond to this reality. Some skeptics are blaming Obama's visit alleging that Ethiopia cannot be a good model to democracy. \"But I argue that the very intention of Obama's visit to Ethiopia is not motivated by the huge game of democratization process but it is a rich point both for internal and external factors in the Horn of Africa. Externally, there are many powers that are competing and forging relations with Ethiopia like China, India and Brazil. Therefore, it is unwise for US to leave this country to all these super powers and giant economies,\" he added. \nA press release sent to The Ethiopian Herald recently by the US Embassy in Addis Ababa quoted President's National Security Advisor Susan Rice as saying : \" Trade and investment has been and will remain a centerpiece of our engagement with Africa. And we'll have the opportunity both through the Entrepreneurship Summit, through bilateral events in Ethiopia, as well as through discussions with business executives to point to the opportunities in Africa and the support that's available particularly with the 10-year renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) for increased trade and investment between the United States and Africa.\" \nShe also said : \"As we move on to Ethiopia, the President's visit will reflect the fact that we have a longstanding, strong bilateral relationship with Ethiopia. Among our shared interests are facilitating peace in South Sudan, countering al-Shabaab in Somalia, and advancing Ethiopia's growth and development, as well as promoting regional stability.\" More on This", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T00:56:17.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
