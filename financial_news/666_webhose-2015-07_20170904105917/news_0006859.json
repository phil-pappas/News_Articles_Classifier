Share your experiences and let them know that Africa is open and ready for business,\" President Kenyatta said. \nOn his part US president Barack Obama urged African countries to tackle corruption issues, as it inhibits business. \n\"International businesses are concerned if five or ten percent of the cost of investing in Kenya goes somewhere else that has nothing to do with the project - If you have to pay bribes then you inhibit entrepreneurship,\" Obama said in a news conference in Statehouse Nairobi. Kenya \nKenya now may well be on its way to becoming a \"silicon savannah,\" a hub of excellence and innovation in technology. see more » Copyright © 2015 Capital FM. All rights reserved.
