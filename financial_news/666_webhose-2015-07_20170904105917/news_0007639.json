Here's How Written by: Mia Taylor 07/07/15 - 10:21 AM EDT \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) â€” Savvy travelers long ago turned back the clock on their airport security experience to breezier, hassle-free days. \nBut for some reason, the masses continue to subject themselves to long security lines, removing shoes, belts and outerwear, and unpacking laptops in order to board a plane. \nThere are a handful of airport security pre-screening programs available to U.S. travelers these days, some of which are finally starting to pick up steam, but they have by no means reached the critical mass that would be expected given how significantly they ease the hassle of traveling. More Headlines \nBetween programs such as PreCheck , Global Entry, and the privately-run CLEAR , there's little reason travelers should stand in long queues to get on a plane or to pass through customs when returning to the country after a trip. \nYet they do. \n\"Everyone in the travel community knows about these programs,\" says Dena Roche, a luxury wellness travel expert and co-founder of Wellness Travel Media . \"But I'm still blown away by the number of people I see waiting in lines at airports to get through security.\" \nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which runs PreCheck, recently announced that the program reached a milestone of 1 million members, but it's been a long climb to that figure. Just last year TSA hired private contractors to manage an enormous membership recruitment effort. \nThe program, which started in 2011 and costs $85 for a five year enrollment, provides low-risk travelers with what is supposed to be a more efficient security screening process at airports. Members do not have to remove shoes, coats or belts when passing through PreCheck security at airports, nor do they have to remove laptops from their bags. This streamlined experience is available at 133 U.S. airports. \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection meanwhile recently announced that Global Entry , a similar pre-screening program, but one aimed at international travelers, had enrolled its two millionth member. That figure accounts for just 9% of all international air arrivals, according to the agency. But it also represents a nearly quadrupling of participants over two years. In fiscal year 2012, the program had 431,004 members. By 2014 that number jumped to more than 1.6 million. \nAnd CLEAR, the privately operated pre-screening program, is steadily working its way back from a 2009 bankruptcy. While not revealing specific figures, the company's new CEO Caryn Seidman-Becker says CLEAR's recent membership growth has been in the \"triple digits.\" \nMaybe part of the lingering challenge in CLEAR's case is that the program, which speeds travelers through airport security for departing flights, is only in 12 airports and still has not broken into major travel hubs such as Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta or New York. But Seidman-Becker says CLEAR officials are focused on changing that. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T18:34:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
