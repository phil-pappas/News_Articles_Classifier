(Image: REUTERS/Yannis Behrakis) Europe's future has been plunged into uncertainty after the \"no\" vote in Greece's referendum. It is unclear whether talks on resolving the country's debt crisis will continue, or if Greece will exit the euro. But a small group of mathematicians and economists says Europe needn't have reached this point. With no quantitative way of gauging the impact of different policies in complex economic systems like the eurozone, Europe's leaders were always doomed to indecision, the researchers say. The group has been working on computerised models that could help, but their funding – ironically, from the European Commission – has run out. The choices for Greece come down to some mix of austerity - deep cuts in government spending plus budget-balancing institutional changes - and debt write-off. The latter is something that several leading economists and even the International Monetary Fund say could be needed. Germany prefers continued austerity, but levels imposed so far have been wounding to Greece and were crucial to this week's \"no\" vote. Health and social security cuts have led to an increase in suicides and infant mortality, HIV and TB infection rates and hospital admissions , and arguably left Greece less able to repay debts, with GDP down some 25 per cent since 2008 and youth unemployment at 60 per cent. Deadlock inevitable Doyne Farmer of the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico and the University of Oxford says leaders and their economic advisers have no way to work out quantitatively which mix of solutions works best, so fall back on ideological preferences and whatever historical examples support them. Deadlock ensues. Mainstream models, called Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models , assume that left to their own devices, economic systems will reach \"equilibrium\" as a result of buyers and sellers independently acting to try to maximise their own benefit. They assume that periodic disturbances are due to outside influences, not produced spontaneously within the system. \"Empirical studies now show this cannot be true,\" says Farmer. Such models also failed spectacularly to predict or explain the financial crisis of 2008. \"The atomistic, optimising agents underlying existing models do not capture behaviour during a crisis period,\"   president Jean-Claude Trichet said in 2010. What might work, some researchers said then , are agent-based models (ABMs) , which use modern computers' number-crunching power to simulate people and institutions who do not necessarily behave optimally, and who interact. Little headway This approach has already revolutionised fields from epidemiology to ecology to weather forecasting. Yet the dominance of traditional models, says Farmer, means it has much little headway in the macroeconomics of nations. \"Leaders are flying the economy by the seat of their pants.\" \"I believe that ABMs have the potential to analyse the kind of questions [facing Greece] more than current mainstream macroeconomic models,\" agrees eurozone researcher Paul De Grauwe of the London School of Economics. In 2011 the European Commission launched the complexity research initiative for systemic instabilities (CRISIS) project to develop macroeconomic ABMs. CRISIS models are not yet complex enough to encompass whole countries, but they can now model smaller economic situations involving financial networks, such as that faced by Cypriot banks with unpaid Greek debts in 2013. \"The question is, who pays for such debts,\" says Farmer, scientific coordinator of CRISIS. The model showed different policies led to speedier economic recovery depending on overall economic conditions. Just letting a struggling bank be bought out by other banks worked best in good times with full employment. In bad times, either a tax-funded bailout or letting the struggling bank's depositors lose their investments worked best. No single solution was always optimal. ABMs often reveal such systemic changes that would otherwise go unpredicted, says Domenico Delli Gatti of the Catholic University in Milan, Italy, another coordinator of CRISIS. Expanding the model to include nations would make it two or three times more complicated, says Farmer. But it might suggest why austerity that seems to work in Ireland may not in Greece. \"In principle the CRISIS model could be adapted to a financial network where each country was a node, and calibrated and tested on eurozone data,\" says Delli Gatti. It has already predicted crisis and contagion in smaller financial networks. Political dimension Both Delli Gatti and others caution, however, that these problems have a political dimension as well. Like climate models, economic ABMs may tell us the outcomes of different policies, but leaders can still ignore them. But political costs and benefits, Farmer believes, might also be modelled – and those are considerable. Greece has seen a surge in arrivals of refugees across the Mediterranean , posing a major challenge to healthcare, among other things. If it were to leave the European Union, as some predict could happen, that could make a coordinated response to the influx harder. And James Stavridis, a former supreme allied commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, says leaving the eurozone might drive Greece into alliance with Russia, which would require the departure of this strategically important nation from both the EU and NATO. Developing ABMs complex enough to guide macroeconomic negotiations is a much cheaper option. \"We'd need €20 to €30 million and another five to 10 years,\" says Farmer. But he is still trying to secure new resources after the CRISIS funding ran out last October.
