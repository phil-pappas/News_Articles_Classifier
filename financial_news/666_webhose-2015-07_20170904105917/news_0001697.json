Mr Cameron has promised a decision before 2016. \n“Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) is the time for government decision and action,” the letter says. “Your Government must support UK businesses by implementing the Airports Commission’s recommendation and expand Heathrow.” \nThe commission, led by Sir Howard Davies, spent almost three years and an estimated £20m deliberating how to tackle the impending aviation capacity crisis in the south-east of England. Heathrow is effectively full and Gatwick is close behind. The commission reviewed more than 50 proposals before concluding that another runway at Heathrow was the “best answer”. \nCompany executives including easyJet boss Carolyn McCall, O2’s Ronan Dunne, and Ted Baker (Other OTC: TBAKF - news ) chief operating officer Lindsay Page are now encouraging ministers to act on the recommendation. They are joined by the heads of business lobby groups and trade associations including Sir Gerry Grimstone, the chairman of TheCityUK, who is also the chairman of Standard Life (LSE: SL.L - news ) , and Paul Drechsler, the incoming president of the Confederation of British Industry. \nSir Mike Rake, the outgoing deputy chairman of Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) , has also signed the letter in a personal capacity, as have a host of small businesses across the UK. \nSir Howard Davies, the chairman of the Airports Commission \n“Heathrow puts Britain right at the heart of the global economy and has helped it become one of the world’s great trading nations,” the letter says. “But Heathrow the UK’s only hub airport has been operating at capacity for the past decade. This lack of hub capacity is holding back the growth of UK businesses that want to fly directly to emerging markets; trade and transport their goods via air freight; create more jobs and connect to the UK’s regions.” \nMany local residents, concerned about increased air pollution and aircraft noise , vehemently oppose expansion. The environmental concerns have prevented the airport from securing clearance for another runway despite three official endorsements for a landing strip in the past 12 years. \nThere are fears that Mr Cameron faces insurmountable political obstacles . \nThe runway is opposed by prominent Conservatives Boris Johnson and Zac Goldsmith, and five Cabinet ministers are also thought to be against expansion. Furthermore, backing Heathrow would leave Mr Cameron open to accusations that he has broken his “no ifs, no buts” promise in 2009 to block a third runway. \nHeathrow also faces competition from Gatwick, which continues to campaign for another runway of its own. A second landing strip at the West Sussex airport failed to win a commission recommendation. \nNone the less, Gatwick has seized on Heathrow’s past failure to expand to say it remains the only “deliverable” option. It is also writing to Mr Cameron to voice concerns about the commission’s work .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T00:40:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
