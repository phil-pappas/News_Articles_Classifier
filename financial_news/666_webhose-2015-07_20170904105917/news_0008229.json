Nash highlighted the $3 service fee Betterment charges on accounts under $10,000 if customers do not auto-invest $100 monthly in their accounts.\n\"At $3 per month, an investor opening an account at $100 would be paying an annual management fee of 36 percent in the first year,\" Nash wrote. He also contended that almost one-third of Betterment's revenue comes from the $3 fee.\nBetterment, which does not have a minimum account size and whose management fee ranges from 0.15 percent to 0.35 percent, called Nash's post \"wildly misleading.\"\n\"He used screen shots that are months old and his projection of our revenue is insanely inaccurate,\" Betterment communications manager Joe Ziemer said in an interview.
