Earlier in the day, the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which tracks the prices of 22 commodities (from oil to natural gas), dropped as much as 0.8% to 96.8069, its lowest level on a closing basis since late 2001 and slightly over an intraday low of 96.258 on March 18.\nBefore starting to rise later on Wednesday following a depreciation of the dollar against a basket of currencies, China-specific commodities like copper and aluminium had hit six-year lows and nickel plunged 5%, while brent crude oil had hit an almost three-month low, having lost over 6% this week. Even gold, considered a safe-haven asset, was hovering around a four-month low and silver at seven-month low. Iron ore had lost almost 8% in China.\nThe dollar lost 0.4% against a basket of leading currencies on Wednesday. A depreciation of the greenback makes dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for non-US companies. Analysts said this link is being used by short term traders and funds, which have recently been selling short and are squaring those positions now, for their advantage.\nHowever, persistent concerns about the state of Chinese economy would continue to impact the commodity market, as the country is the world’s largest consumer of most of the commodities —from copper to iron ore to steel. China’s stock market has lost 30% since its peak around mid-June despite several measures by the government to arrest the fall. Analysts apprehend these losses could infect the real economy and consequnetly hurt its commodity demand.\nThe European Union’s decision on crisis-ridden Greece would also be closely monitored by the commodity market participants for potential impact. However, for a net importer like India, which has benefitted from a slump in commodity prices for over a year now, some gains would continue until Chinese demand rebounds, said analysts.\nHaving hit a six-year low of $5,240 a tonne, copper on the London Metal Exchange was trading at $5,375 a tonne at 1214 GMT. Three-month aluminium had crashed to $1,631.50 before bouncing back to $1,664 a tonne, while, after a fall, nickel gained almost 2% to $10,860 by 1214 GMT.\nOil bounced back after an industry report revealed a higher-than-expected drop in US crude oil stocks and as Iran nuclear talks dragged on without producing a deal with the west. Brent crude rose 34 cents at $57.19 a barrel by 1248 GMT.\nSimilarly, spot gold gained 0.2% at $1,157.22 an ounce as of 1144 GMT, having recovered from $1,146.75 — its lowest since March 18 —earlier in the day. Silver, too, went up 0.1% at $15.05 per ounce, after a 4.4% drop in the previous session, when it touched its lowest since December 2014.\n 09, 2015 12:20 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T01:40:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
