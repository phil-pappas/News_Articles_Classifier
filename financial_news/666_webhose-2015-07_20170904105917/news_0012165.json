The match was tight, but ultimately Serena earned more points and won the best-two-of-three match 6-4 and 6-3. \nThe two sisters hugged over the net when the match ended. “It’s hard to feel excited about (beating) someone you root for all the time no matter what and who you love so much and she’s your best friend in the world,” said Serena. “It’s never easy, but you just play for the competition and enjoy the moment.” \nThe Williams sisters have come a long way together, and each has seen big success — Venus and Serena have won five Wimbledon titles apiece — but only one could win. With the win, Serena has continued to prove her dominance in women’s tennis. But between the two sisters, who’s had more financial success? Here’s a look at Serena Williams’ net worth and how it compares to Venus Williams’ net worth. Serena Williams Net Worth: $140 Million \nSerena Williams is a star on and off the tennis court, and it shows in her net worth and high earnings. To date, Serena Williams’ net worth is estimated to be around $140 million, according to CelebrityNetWorth. Forbes ranked Serena No. 3 on its list of the world’s highest-paid female athletes of 2014, with her total earnings coming in at $22 million — $11 million from prize money and $11 million from endorsements such as Nike, Wilson, Gatorade and OPI. \nThe tennis star has continued her dominance and shows no signs of slowing, a determination that has been reflected in her continued high earnings. In Forbes’ list of the World’s Highest-Paid Athletes of 2015, Serena came in at No. 47 and was one of just two women who landed in the top 50 — the other was fellow tennis star Maria Sharapova at No. 26 — with earnings of $24.6 million. Of the $24.6 million Serena earned, she racked up $11.6 million from tennis winnings and another $13 million from endorsements with the likes of Chase Bank and Pepsi. \nAccording to the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA), Serena’s career total in prize money is a whopping $69.7 million. \nWith Monday’s win, Serena continued her 25-match winning streak in the Grand Slam, and she now has the opportunity to win her fourth straight Grand Slam title in the Wimbledon quarterfinals, reports the Associated Press. But first she’ll have to face the other women competing for the Wimbledon Women’s Singles title first, including fellow Americans Madison Keys and CoCo Vandeweghe. \nRelated: Wimbledon Winners Pay $30,000 a Year for a Chance to Win $3 Million Venus Williams Net Worth: $75 Million \nDespite matching her younger sister for Wimbledon wins and other impressive feats, Venus Williams’ career winnings are less than half those of Serena’s winnings. At $30.8 million, Venus William’s career winnings are behind those of her sister and second-place earner, Maria Sharapova ($35.1 million), according to the WTA. \nVenus Williams’ net worth shows a similar trail behind her sister’s, at $75 million, reports CelebrityNetWorth. But even though Serena beats Venus out in terms of net worth and career earnings, Venus has built a legacy of being one of the most successful players in women’s tennis and a force to be reckoned with on the court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T20:27:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
