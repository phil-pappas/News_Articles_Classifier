Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Amanda Saunders Australia's beleaguered coal industry must continue to hang on and wait for an inevitable recovery as prices bounce along the bottom, industry veteran Keith De Lacy says.\nMr De Lacy is the former chairman of Macarthur Coal, the miner Peabody Energy paid $4.9 billion for at the peak of the boom in 2011.\nPeabody Energy said overnight Tuesday it said it would cut Australian coal production by 3 million tonnes , as it flagged a $US901 million impairment charge, including $US700 million on Australian metallurgical coal assets, mostly from the Macarthur acquisition.\nEarlier this month, Anglo American took a writedown of up to $US4 billion , part of which was taken on Australian coal assets, and Rio Tinto is understood to be trying to sell its Hunter Valley coal assets.\nBut Mr De Lacy dismissed suggestions that the industry was on palliative care, saying \"I don't accept it is going to die, but it is certainly in a stage where it needs a lot of nursing\".\n\"I think most miners who have hung on this long will continue to hang on,\" he told The Australian Financial Review . \"There has been a major change to the cost base.\n\"Most people in the coal industry do have hope, because no one realistically thinks that coal is finished despite all the wishing from the environmental industry and others.\"\n'Great Depression' The industry is taking a battering on multiple fronts, and despite some majors like Glencore cutting production as a show of supply discipline, there has been no price relief this year.\nMetallurgical coal has fallen another 25 per cent since January to about $US82 a tonne, from more than $US300 in 2011, while thermal coal has lost 8 per cent since January to languish around $US59 a tonne, compared to about $US150 three years ago.\nMr De Lacy, also a former Queensland Treasurer, said the industry was in a \"great depression\" but prices had bottomed.\n\"I think we are at the bottom, but when the turn will come, nobody can forecast that, it usually comes when you least expect it\".\nBHP chief commercial officer Dean Dalla Valle told the Financial Review this week that depressed coal prices will persist because \"going broke is hard to do\", with the market seeing far fewer closures than expected in the past two years.\nGlobal majors, including Anglo American, Peabody Coal and Rio Tinto, have designs on a full or partial exit of their coal holdings in Australia if they can get the right price. But that is proving difficult given the state of the industry.\nMr De Lacy said it was a \"great time\" to invest in coal\", but said prices would have to start to turn before much deal activity would be generated.\n'There is something wrong with the investment community, they can only go with the flow,\" he said.\n\"I wish I was 30 years younger, I'd be out there buying,\" he said, citing Warren Buffet's phrase, \"'Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful'\".\n\"Some people are starting to reinvest again because they recognise that you're never going to get a better deal than you're getting now.\"\nMarket closures Closures had not materialised as expected in the last few years \"because most people have the view that it's [the market] is going to turn,\" Mr De Lacy said.\n\"Because everyone believes there is enough growth, particularly in Asia, to underwrite the coal industry into the future.\n\"Countries like India and China while they may say nice things at international conferences they see cheap and reliable energy as the way to the future and they see coal as underwriting that, and no one is going to change that.\"\nOxfam on Tuesday attacked the \"mining industry spin about coal and poverty\", releasing a report it said \"shows clearly that coal is not the solution to improving energy access in developing countries\".\nBut the Minerals Council of Australia said the report was \"misleading\" and \"Oxfam doesn't know more than the countries where it seeks to help and it should resist the urge to lecture and be more receptive to the views of the people it is trying to assist\".\n\"It is clear restricting the use of fossil fuels and coal in particular will delay energy access to hundreds of millions of the world's poorest people with attendant adverse impacts on life expectancy, health and education outcomes,\" the MCA said.\nMr De Lacy said the industry \"has got to hold their nerve\" in the face of the increasingly sophisticated fossil fuels divestment campaign and anti-coal lobby.\n\"It is difficult, when you are in a depressed state like this, there is very little you can do to counter it, you've just got to hang in there and when it turns go with it.\"\nRio Tinto's new coal boss Jean-SÃ©bastien Jacques told the Financial Review in May that it will likely take three or four years before there is \"a light at the end of the tunnel\" for the depressed thermal coal price, and his main priority in the new job is to try to keep each Rio mine cash flow positive in its own right.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mandaksaunders"], "published": "2015-07-29T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T16:31:45.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
