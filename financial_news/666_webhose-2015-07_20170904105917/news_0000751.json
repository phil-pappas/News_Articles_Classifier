Darrian Traynor by Jared Lynch Chinese billionaire Richard Liu has begun his splurge on Australian companies, spending about $20 million on a stake in Murray Goulburn's new unit trust.\nMr Liu's e-commerce company, JD.com, which is listed on the Nasdaq, snapped up 4.6 per cent of the dairy co-operative's trust, which listed on the ASX last Friday.\nIt is the sixth-biggest holder in the trust behind Chinese food processing and purchasing company China Resources Ng Fung, which owns 4.9 per cent.\nThe investment comes after Mr Liu told Fairfax Media this month that JD.com – China's second-biggest internet retailer – was keen to buy strategic stakes in overseas companies, particularly in Australia.\nThe website launched an \"Australian Mall\" this month, joining forces with ASX-listed companies including Treasury Wine Estates and a2 Milk, to sell more Australian products in China.\n\"Launching Australian Mall gave us a tremendous opportunity to engage with local brands and evaluate partnerships and investments,\" a JD.com spokesman said.\n\"Our team was very impressed with MG [Murray Goulburn] and we look forward to continuing to develop a relationship with them and looking for additional partners as we deepen Chinese consumers' access to world-class Australian products.\"\nSources told Fairfax Media last week that JD.com was also partnering with an international dairy company to buy a strategic stake in takeover target a2 Milk.\n A JD.com spokesman declined to comment on the speculation.\nHowever, Mr Liu said last week that the company was interested in investing in any company that could \"ensure high-quality products for our consumers\".\nThe website sells Murray Goulburn's Devondale-branded products at a significant premium compared with the same items sold in domestic supermarkets such as Coles and Woolworths.\nFor example, a one kilogram pack of Devondale full cream milk powder sells on JD.com for 89 yuan ($19.33) compared with the same item being sold at Coles for $9.89.\nChinese consumers' willingness to pay a high price for basic Australian consumer products is part of Murray Goulburn's strategy to help insulate its farmers from volatility on global commodity markets.\nThe $500 million raised from non-farmer investors and farmer shareholders to create its unit trust will be spent on upgrading Murray Goulburn's factories to enable the co-operative to move more into consumer dairy goods and away from bulk products.\nUnits in the trust, which hold no voting rights in order to maintain the co-operative's farmer control, have jumped 9.5 per cent since debut to $2.30.\nThis compares with the broader market falling 3.2 per cent after being caught in a regional rout stemming from China's biggest sharemarket plunge in more than two decades.\nThe mass sell-off threatens to send more reverberations across the globe. Investors have begun ditching US-traded Chinese stocks, which are suffering their steepest falls in four years.\nJD.com shares have shed 11 per cent in the past two weeks, while bigger rival Alibaba has tumbled to its lowest since its initial public offering.\n\"Investors are fleeing anything associated with China,\" Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at Krane Funds Advisors, told Bloomberg.\n\"They don't want to have anything related to China in their portfolio. Investors are reading the risks around China, and there is a spillover effect in the US-listed stocks.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:04:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
