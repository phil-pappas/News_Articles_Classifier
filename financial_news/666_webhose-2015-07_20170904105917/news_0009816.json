Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Former trade minister Craig Emerson says the labour movement has legitimate concerns about the China Australia Free Trade Agreement but questions whether anything can really be done.\nDr Emerson said the provisions relating to imported labour were scattered across four separate documents ranging from the text of the actual agreement, memoranda of understanding and a side letter.\nHe said it was clear that in some instances there would be no testing of the local jobs market before the Chinese were allowed to bring in their own workers on certain projects.\n\"It's very messy and it includes statements that there will be no labour market testing,\" Dr Emerson told The Australian Financial Review.\nFormer trade minister Craig Emerson. Arsineh Houspian \"So it's not surprising that it would ber attracting criticism from the unions and the Opposition.\n\"That doesn't mean that the deal should be blocked but the agreement could benefit from clarifying that there will be labour market testing.\"\nHowever, Dr Emerson said that if Trade Minister Andrew Robb had agreed with the Chinese for there to be no labour market testing in certain circumstances, then \"it won't be easy to tidy up the language\".\nAt the ALP National Conference in the weekend , it was resolved that the federal Opposition would seek to safeguard Australian jobs when the legislation for the FTA came before Parliament later ths year.\n Unions want Labor to block the agreement unless the changes are made. Shadow trade minister Penny Wong has said instead that if Labor was unsuccessful, then it would seek to make changes when in government, using the two-year review that is built into the FTA.\nMr Robb has slammed the misgivings as xenophobic and without basis and has vowed to make no changes.\n\"This is a great deal for Australia and the unions need to pull their head in,\" he said..\nThe concerns include Investment Facilitation Agreements, which would allow the importation of entire workforces for investment projects worth at least $150 million, with a Chinese component of as little as $22.5 million, or 15 per cent.\nLabor and the unions also have concerns about the removal of skills assessment for 10 occupations under the 457 visa program for imported workers, including for such trades as electricians.\nIt also lists the removal of labour market testing from the non-concessional 457 visa program for Chinese workers and the inclusion of an Investor State Dispute Settlement mechanism, which give the Chinese the right to legally challenge decisions by the Australian government.\nThe FTA will be scrutinised by two parliamentary committees before the legislation goes before Parliament.\nBusiness groups are urging Labor not to do anything to delay the agreement coming into effect.\nOn Monday, the Minerals Council of Australia said any delay into early 2016 would cost the Australian coal export trade up to $110 million dollars, give Indonesian exporters an unexpected boost and add a new risk to employment in key regional communities.\n\"The China Australia free trade deal had been expected to formally enter into force in November this year, following the completion of parliamentary processes by both countries,\" the MCA said in a statement.\n\"If the China Australian trade deal not formally start before the end of calendar 2015, Australia will miss the chance for two bites at tariff reductions a range of products, including on thermal coal exports.\"\nUnder the terms of the deal, Chinese tariffs on coal will fall both on entry-into-force and again on 1 January 2016.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-28T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T23:20:11.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
