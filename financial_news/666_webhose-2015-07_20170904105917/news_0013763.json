Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) and BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) were both sharply higher after Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) 's second-quarter results beat expectations. The Anglo-Dutch oil major posted adjusted profits of $3.8bn, down on an annualised basis but ahead of estimates of $3.4bn. At the same time, investors welcomed the group's cost-cutting plans to offset the decline in oil prices, which include axing 6,500 jobs. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in aerospace and defence group Rolls-Royce were also in the black. Although the company, which has issued three profit warnings in the last 12 months, posted a 32% fall in underlying first-half profit, the figures were in line overall and investors were encouraged by the positive outlook for the year. \nPharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN - news ) also made gains after its second-quarter earnings beat expectations as generic competition and the effects of a stronger US dollar were offset by the spinning off of assets and a good performance from the company's Brillinta drug. \nInterContinental Hotels Group rose after reporting solid interim profit growth thanks to an increase in revenue per available room across its regions. For the six months to 30 June, the FTSE 100 group posted a 21.5% year-on-year rise in pre-tax profit to $458m, while total revenue edged 0.8% higher to $915m. \nSmith & Nephew (LSE: SN.L - news ) , which makes artificial hips and knees, was on the front foot after reported a 4% rise in first-half revenue and a 6% gain in underlying trading. The company pointed to a continued improvement in its Advanced Wound Care business, growth in emerging markets and a strong global performance in its reconstruction unit. \nOn the downside, Babcock International (LSE: BAB.L - news ) slipped into the red despite saying it remains on track to meet if full- and half-year forecasts. The company said its order book remained stable at the £20bn seen in mid-May, with 84% of revenue for the full year and 60% of revenue for 2016/2017 in place. \nBritish Gas owner Centrica (LSE: CNA.L - news ) was also under the cosh after announcing 4,000 job cuts as a result of a strategic review, despite posting a near doubling of its first-half profits. \nShares in Drinks maker Diageo (LSE: DGE.L - news ) were lower after it posted flat annual sales of £10.8bn. On the plus side, though, the company raised its final dividend by 9% and pumped up its guidance for next year. \nRoyal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) was also feeling the pinch, giving up early gains to trade lower. The bank's second-quarter operating profit fell 7% to £1.8bn from the same period last year, but beat consensus expectations by 48%. \nRisers BG Group (BG.) 1,088.00p +4.62% Royal Dutch Shell 'B' (RDSB) 1,856.00p +4.45% Royal Dutch Shell 'A' (RDSA) 1,836.50p +4.08% Rolls-Royce Holdings (RR.) 750.50p +2.74% AstraZeneca (Swiss: AZN.SW - news ) (AZN) 4,283.00p +2.20% BP (BP.) 403.35p +1.19% InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) 2,654.00p +1.18% British American Tobacco (BATS) 3,720.00p +1.07% Smith & Nephew (SN.) 1,147.00p +1.06% Barclays (Swiss: BARC.SW - news ) (BARC) 287.30p +0.95% Fallers Babcock International Group (BAB (Other OTC: BABB - news ) ) 989.00p -4.81% Centrica (Amsterdam: CC8.AS - news ) (CNA) 266.80p -3.05% easyJet (EZJ) 1,636.00p -2.79% International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (CDI) (IAG) 537.50p -2.45% ITV (ITV (LSE: ITV.L - news ) ) 270.80p -1.96% Intu Properties (Other OTC: CCRGF - news ) (INTU (Swiss: OXIGTU.SW - news ) ) 326.20p -1.95% Diageo (Amsterdam: DO8.AS - news ) (DGE) 1,804.00p -1.93% Carnival (CCL) 3,370.00p -1.84% Inmarsat (LSE: ISAT.L - news ) (ISAT) 885.50p -1.61% Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS) 347.70p -1.56%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T20:00:23.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
