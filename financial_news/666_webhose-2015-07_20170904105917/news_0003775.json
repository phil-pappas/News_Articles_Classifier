In fact, in 1890 most people died while still employed. If their health held out beyond their ability to work, they “retired” at age 85. So, as you can see, our concept of retirement is fairly young.”\nChohan turns his attention to a New York Times article to further illustrate this point quoting, “In 1883, Chancellor Otto Von Bismarck of Germany had a problem. Marxists were threatening to take control of Europe. To help his countrymen resist their blandishments, Bismarck announced that he would pay a pension to any nonworking German over age 65. Bismarck was no dummy. Hardly anyone lived to be 65 at the time, given that penicillin would not be available for another half century. Bismarck not only co-opted the Marxists, but set the arbitrary world standard for the exact year at which old age begins and established the precedent that government should pay people for growing old.”\n(http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/21/jobs/the-history-of-retirement-from-early-man-to-aarp.html)\nChohan continues, adding, “The U.S. adopted 65 as the retirement age in 1935, and it was adopted in Canada shortly thereafter. This timeline makes the parents of the baby boomer generation retirement pioneers, as we now know it.”\nProviding even more statistics, Chohan states, “According to a report on Statistics Canada from the Canadian Financial Capability Survey, “in 2014, one in three Canadian adults (33.8%) were not preparing financially for retirement either on their own or through an employer pension plan.” In addition Statistics Canada also reports that, “Almost 6 in 10 (59.6%) Canadian adults did not know how much money they would need to save to maintain their desired standard of living during retirement.” (http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/141106/dq141106b-eng.htm)\nThe entire blog can be found at http://www.dfsinrichmondsouth.ca/retirement-a-relatively-new-concept/\nAbout Perminder Chohan\nMr. Chohan started his career in the financial services industry when he joined a Registered Education Savings Plan company in 1998.
