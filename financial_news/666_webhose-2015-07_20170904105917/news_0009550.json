In all cases, people recognise that it is still very early to make a decision,\" Albanese said, declining to comment on individual investors. \nThe buyout deal, first proposed last month, is the latest effort by Vedanta to simplify a complex structure which Albanese has said has held back investor interest. \nMedia reports over the past two weeks have said Cairn Energy and India's state-owned Life Insurance Corp, disagreed with Vedanta on valuation and could vote against the buyout deal. Together, the two hold more than 19 percent of Cairn India, and could potentially sink the current offer. \nOne Life Insurance Corp official said on Thursday the insurer had concerns about the exchange ratio, but had yet to take a decision on the deal. \nShareholders have questioned the timing, which coincides with a drop in Cairn's shares as oil prices have weakened, making for a more favourable merger ratio for Vedanta. \nAlbanese, however, rejected concerns among some minority shareholders that the deal would use Cairn's cash pile of around $2.6 billion simply to help pay off parent Vedanta's debt. \n\"Vedanta Limited in its own results presentation said back in May that it was intending to (refinance) its debt, in the current favourable markets,\" Albanese said. \n\"We do not need the merger to do that,\" he said, adding the main aim of the buyout was to simplify the Vedanta's structure. \nCairn Energy said on Wednesday that it continued to assess the proposal. \nVedanta Limited's parent company, Vedanta Plc bought a majority stake of just under 60 percent of Cairn Energy's Indian business, Cairn India, in a lengthy deal that completed in 2011. Cairn India has remained listed since. \nThe buyout deal is considered a test of India's new shareholder protection law, which requires an approval of more than half of the minority shareholders to go through.
