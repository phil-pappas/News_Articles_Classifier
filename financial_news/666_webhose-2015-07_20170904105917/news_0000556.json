It noted that a wide valuation gap has opened versus peers with the selloff in the stock led by balance sheet concerns rather than earnings. \n\"We think at current levels investor focus should switch to the underlying asset value,\" said the bank, adding that Anglo is trading below its 2008/2009 crisis lows and at a large discount to peers. \nGoldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) has downgraded Vodafone to 'neutral' from 'buy' and cut the price target to 250p from 275p. \n\"Post recent outperformance around the announcement that it is in talks with Liberty Global (NasdaqGS: LBTYA - news ) about a potential asset swap, we believe risk-reward appears more binary,\" said the bank. \nIt noted that since adding the stock to its buy list in December 2014, it's up 5.8% versus the FTSE World Europe up 2.1%. \nCanaccord has moved Wetherspoon's rating from 'sell' to 'hold' while other analysts reiterated views after the pub owner said expected profit to fall. \nAnalysts at Canaccord cut their target price from 720p to 750p, and earnings per share expectations from 9% for the 2016 financial year. \n\"Today's pre-close trading statement reveals the usual story of industry-leading like for like sales achieved at the cost of on-going margin erosion,\" the brokerage said in a note. \nCanaccord said the trend is likely to accelerate with news Wetherspoon committed to 8% pay increases on starting salaries. \nGoldman Sachs reinstated its 'buy' rating on Just Eat (Other OTC: JSTLF - news ) and added the shares to its Conviction List, with a 560p price target. \nIt said that in addition to rapid growth potential as more takeaway food is ordered online, network effects and platform scalability should drive strong profitability as established markets mature and losses decline in other markets. \n\"The business is highly cash generative, with low capital requirements and negative working capital,\" said GS (KSE: 078935.KS - news ) . \n\"As market leader in 12 of its 15 countries, Just Eat should benefit as online penetration increases.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T14:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T14:56:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
