Bloomberg Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Treasurer Joe Hockey says he is sticking to his budget forecasts for the Chinese economy , Australia's biggest trade partner, and described Europe's rescue deal with Greece as \"a salient\" lesson in tackling difficult reform early.\n\"If you don't undertake the necessary reforms to get your house in order when you can, then ultimately the pain will be much more significant down the track.\n\"Now Greece has to undertake the privatisation program that they promised they would never undertake; the reform to their tax system that they said they wouldn't undertake, and, of course, a reform to their pension system that they said they wouldn't undertake.\"\nMr Hockey said Greece showed it was the most vulnerable and poorest people who were paying the heaviest price for years of reform failure, with the wealthiest having already moved their money out of the troubled nation.\n\"When you don't under take that necessary reform, it ends up being the most vulnerable, the most disadvantaged that pay the greatest price.\"\nMr Hockey also moved to assuage fears about China's recent stock market turmoil , saying that despite falling 25 per cent in four weeks, it was already 18 per cent above its low point last Thursday and 90 per cent higher than 12 months ago.\nHe said he had been reassured by China's finance minister two weeks ago that China has \"significant capacity\" in both fiscal and monetary policy to tackle challenges that may emerge over the next few years as the economy transitions to more domestic-driven demand.\n\"So far as I am concerned and the Treasury is concerned, our budget forecasts for the Chinese economy remain unchanged.\n \"We expect growth of 6.75 per cent this year and 6.5 per cent next year and 6.25 per cent the year after.\n\"Our relationship with the Chinese economy remains unchanged by recent volatility.\"\nAsked whether he believed Greece will ever repay its debts, Mr Hockey said he hoped so.\n\"There's only two ways for Greece to go. Either Greece can undertake reform as a member of the eurozone, or it can undertake reform outside the eurozone.\n\"It's always going to be easier for Greece to undertake difficult but necessary reform when it has the support of the eurozone because without that support it would be a very, very lonely journey for the people of Greece.\"\nHe noted that the Greek economy has contracted by more than 25 per cent over five years of recession.\n\"A lot of wealthy Greeks got their money out, but it is the most vulnerable Greeks, the poorest people in the Greek community that are paying the heaviest price.\"", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/greece_updated_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-07-14T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:35:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
