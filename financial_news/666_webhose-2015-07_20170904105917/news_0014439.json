The move would be more violent.”\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 Index tumbled 4.2 percent on June 29 and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index had its biggest plunge in more than a year after Tsipras unexpectedly called for a referendum on austerity measures proposed by Greece’s creditors. Concern the vote may bring the nation one step closer to an exit from the euro pushed equity volatility to a three-year high.\nA poll commissioned by Bloomberg News showed Friday that 43 percent of Greek citizens intend to vote against accepting austerity conditions and 42.5 percent to back a “yes.” While support for the rejection declined from 52 percent a week ago, the crisis in Greece underscores the limitations of the European Central Bank’s efforts to shore up confidence in the currency union and contain the risk of contagion to other countries in the region.\n75% Chance Credit Suisse Group AG estimated that the probability of Greece leaving the euro would be 75 percent with a “no” vote, according to a note on Friday.\n“It would raise the question of the solidarity of the European Monetary Union,” Joy said. “If all of a sudden one member leaves, it does creates a precedent, and maybe suddenly casts some doubt on the long-term future of the monetary union.”\nStocks in Spain and Italy took the biggest hits in the week following the referendum announcement, dropping the most among developed markets with losses of more than 5 percent. A measure of stock swings for the region jumped 21 percent in five days. The Euro Stoxx 50 is now down 10 percent from a seven-year high in April.\nSo far, the market reaction hasn’t been as bad as in 2010, when Greece received its first bailout. That year, the gauge tracking 50 blue-chip companies in the euro area tumbled as much as 17 percent in less than six weeks. The crisis contributed to an 11 percent drop in the S&P 500 and a 16 percent plunge in the MSCI All-Country World Index.\nShort Lived Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a July 2 report that equity volatility caused by a rejection of the bailout terms will be short-lived as the ECB intervenes, allowing investors to refocus on Europe’s economic fundamentals.\nA “no,” which Syriza’s leader has been campaigning for, could trigger a decline in the Euro Stoxx 50 to 3,150, or 8.5 percent below where it closed Friday, strategists at the New York-based bank wrote. That’s a scenario that should spur investors to buy Italian, Spanish and German equities, they said. Acceptance could send the gauge back up to 3,830, near where it traded at the April peak, according to the note.\nA rejection of the bailout may not help Tsipras’s hand in negotiations, said Asoka Woehrmann of Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management Investment in Luxembourg.\n“No one knows how to interpret a ‘no’ vote,” said Woehrmann, chief investment officer at Deutsche Asset & Wealth, which manages about $1.25 trillion. “I doubt that a ‘no’ vote will soften the institutions’ tone,” he said of creditors. “This was the very last trump card Syriza could play.”\nMany Mistakes It’s because of mistakes from both sides that the situation spiraled into such a deadlock, according to David Kelly of JPMorgan Funds, which oversees $800 billion.\n“Europeans are very unfair and unkind to Greek people by forcing them to a level of austerity where they really couldn’t manage,” said Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds in New York. “Having said that, the way that Syriza has negotiated with Europe leaves European governments very distrustful of Syriza.”\nIf voters turn down the bailout terms, Greece wouldn’t leave the euro immediately but may begin to print its own currency to keep its financial system afloat. The country might soon run out of cash and be unable to make a 3.5 billion euro ($3.9 billion) bond payment to the ECB due on July 20. The central bank would then withdraw emergency liquidity to Greek lenders, and the probability of the country leaving the euro would climb even higher, Credit Suisse said.\n“The problem is this is unchartered territory,” said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Global Asset Management in Boston. The firm oversees $900 billion. “There is no blueprint for how a country exits the euro and redenominates. That’s going to create all kinds of uncertainty in Europe.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T23:58:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
