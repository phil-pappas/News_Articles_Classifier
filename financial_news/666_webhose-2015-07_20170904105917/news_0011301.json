The momentary pause was decided by the International Telecommunication Union , a United Nations body, and will come into effect at the stroke of midnight, Greenwich Mean Time.\nThat means that an atomic clock will read 23:59:60 before advancing to 00:00:00.\nIt is not the first time scientists have added a second to the world’s clocks to compensate for the planet’s slowing rotation. It’s been done on several occasions since 1972, with the most recent “leap second” occurring in 2012.\nBut this year is the first time since 1997 that such a tweak will happen on a working day, raising fears that it could disrupt markets.\nThe majority of global equity trading and a significant proportion of trading in bonds, currencies, commodities and derivatives, is done on electronic platforms governed by the international Financial Information Exchange (FIX) protocol.\n“On the FIX systems, the tolerance limits on an order may make it look stale if the clocks are out of sync, which is the biggest issue,” said one head of electronic sales at a European brokerage in Hong Kong.\nStock exchanges, brokers and investment banks said they were working with their vendors and clients to ensure their internal clocks were brought into line.\nThe last time a “leap second”, in 2012, a number of websites were affected, including that of Australia’s Qantas Airways, which experienced problems with its reservation system and flight delays.\n(FRANCE 24 with REUTERS)\n 06-30\nTweet print", "external_links": ["http://f24.my/1GMmPtV", "http://f24.my/1GMmO9d", "http://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx", "http://f24.my/1GMmO9j&title=World&#x20;to&#x20;gain&#x20;a&#x20;little&#x20;time&#x20;with&#x20;&#x2018;leap&#x20;second&#x2019;&newwindow=1&sr=worldnews", "http://f24.my/1GMmPtZ", "http://f24.my/1GMmPtX", "https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T15:57:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
