The aforementioned points were reflected in the keynote address of Barak Obama to the African Union this week. \nOf course, America is extending a huge support to Africa,among others, in areas of education and health: HIV and AIDS prevention, slashing down maternal death and staving off malaria claiming a heavy death toll on African children. \nIn the same vein, it is America's good wish that Africa attains the same developmental height like that of America. Through bilateral trade ties and investment job opportunities could be created for Africans and Americans. The gesture of good will need be bolstered. \nFor the effectiveness of the thrust towards Africa's complete socioeconomic deliverance and bright future, the role congress members that accompanied Obama play goes without saying. \nAmerica is due to unravel its back up programme for Africa for the coming decade. Food security, health, electricity and investment are areas of focus entailed in the programme. The economic growth of the world as well as the expansion of trade and investment are hardly possible without taking Africa on board. For the betterment and change of Africa therefore, there is an urgency for a concerted effort. \nStill today millions in Africa wallow in the quagmire of poverty. They live in areas plagued by acute water shortages and dearth of electricity. This contravenes the human right of people. \nWhat is affecting Africa today is not allowing opportunity to youths of Africa. This chasm has to be bridged. There is an enormous task ahead. More job opportunities have to be opened up. \nThe economic growth of Africa presupposes trade and investment. Though different African countries are striving to attract foreign investment still a favourable situation is missing. If Africans are willing to open up doors for trade and investment, America pledges it is more than willing to extend a helping hand. Africans too need strengthen development forging trade ties. \nIf it strives to rise by its bootstrap, Africa could materialize growth without necessarily eyeing at possibilities outside the continent. \nAmerica is displaying proneness to the expansion of electricity in various African countries. It intends to inject over one billion dollar investment money in Africa. In this era of globalization across the board global development is mandatory. \nCorruption, democracy and maladministration are identified hurdles hampering Africa's bid to unshackle itself from underdevelopment. Power mongering is also besetting the continent. This sad scenario cries out for a corrective measure. Nurturing the culture of passing down the power baton to a new generation with competent and visionary leaders is therefore a must. \nAccording to AU Commission Chairperson Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma Africa and America are indispensable for each other. \nDilating on the issue , she noted, as Africa, mapping out a half century development action plan and gearing up for tasks down the road, is flexing its muscles,the occasion lends a fertile ground for a joint action. \nAfrica has not much to do with the specter of climate change looming large, it is not immune from the possible damages that attend the tragic unfolding. Regarding prevention and adoption, Africa has turned its eye towards renewable energy sources and resorting to inclement weather compatible crops. \nAfrica needs help in areas of technology transfer, investment,transport and infrastructure expansion. Africa is the sole continent that is not represented in the security council of the united nations. This is not fair. This too begs for a remedial solution. \nAfrica is target to Al-shabaab and Boko Haram in Somalia and in Nigeria respectively. It as well is rocked by the turmoil in south Sudan and Libya. It needs also fight out corruption posing an ugly face here and there. Hence it needs support from developing countries like America. \nThe attention given to women in Africa is minimal. They are not entitled to equal educational opportunities.They deserve more attention. That is why Africa Union designated this year as a year of empowering women. \nSuch events have additional benefit to countries like Ethiopia. Ethiopia which plays a peace keeping also peace brokering role in the continent enjoys a spotlight the world over when it welcomes dignitaries like Obama and hosts international conferences. \nInternational news agencies throw light on the country's change for the better in many spheres of development including the mammoth projects and lifestyle of citizens. As Dr.Costantinos Berehe, a professor of Public Policy at A.A.U puts it \"Big events like Obama's coming will open up this country to the international private sector where resource for development will be available much instead of loans and grants. The visit is a testimony to the recognition of Ethiopia's role in the horn of Africa.\" Africa \nThe goal of the forum is to bridge the gap between science and policy. see more » Copyright © 2015 The Ethiopian Herald.
