But organic sales, an important sector indicator, were up 3.3pc, the second quarter in a row of growth for Vodafone following ten consecutive quarters of decline. \nFigures were helped by a 6.1pc rise in organic service revenue in the Africa, Middle East and Asia Pacific regions. \nIn Europe organic revenue declined 1.5pc, but Vodafone said performance was continuing to recover and the company was managing to retain more of its customers. \nVodafone now has 24.1 million 4G customers in 18 markets, the company said in a statement. \nVittorio Colao, chief executive of Vodafone \nThe UK bucked the European trend, with service revenue up 0.2pc, boosted by a 0.7pc increase in mobile service revenue. But fixed service revenue was down 1.3pc. \nVodafone now has 12.3m fixed broadband customers in the UK. \nVittorio Colao, the telecom company's chief executive, said it has been “a good start to the year”. \nHe added: “Our emerging markets have maintained their strong momentum and more of our European businesses are returning to growth, as customer demand for 4G and data takes off.\" \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in Vodafone were up 2.4pc this morning following the trading update.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T12:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T12:46:51.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
