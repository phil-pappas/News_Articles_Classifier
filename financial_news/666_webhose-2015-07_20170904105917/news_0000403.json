Meanwhile, coal exports have been hurt by the strong U.S. dollar.\nAnalysts have lowered estimates for the sector in recent weeks, citing ongoing coal weakness, but also poor grain shipments and a faltering crude-by-rail business.\nCSX said coal revenue for the quarter fell 15 percent, contributing to an overall sales decline of 6 percent. The company said it expects coal volumes to be down approximately 10 percent for the full year.\nBut CSX received a boost from a fuel bill of $263 million for the quarter, 37 percent lower than the $416 is paid out in the second quarter of 2014. The company managed overall to lower second-quarter expenses by 9 percent.\nThe Jacksonville, Florida-based company reported a second-quarter net profit of $553 million or 56 cents per share, up nearly 5 percent from $529 million or 53 cents per share a year earlier.\nAnalysts had expected earnings per share of 53 cents.\nCSX said it expects to deliver mid to high single-digit percentage earnings per share growth in 2015, but added \"the upper end of that range has become more challenging given the current energy environment.\"\nThe company reported revenue for the quarter of $3.06 billion compared with $3.24 billion a year earlier.\nAnalysts had expected revenue of $3.12 billion.\nIn after-market trading CSX shares were trading up 3.2 percent at $33.11.
