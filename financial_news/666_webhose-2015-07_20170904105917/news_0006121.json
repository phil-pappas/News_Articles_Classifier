(PRNewsFoto/ShopKeep POS)\nInvented in the 1870s, the cash register was the very first “point-of-sale system” mechanizing the transfer of money. Today, small business owners are opting for something more portable: smartphones, tablets and other mobile terminals, equipped with point-of-sale apps. Beyond making it easier than ever to swipe a credit card and add tip, POS apps are paving the way for contactless payment through smartphone apps like Google Google Wallet and ApplePay — which rolled out in the U.K. on Tuesday after it debuted in the U.S. nine months ago — to become the new norm.\nThere are many such systems marketed to small businesses, the most popular of which include Square , LevelUp , Shopkeep , and Revel. Most do not charge a monthly fee – instead, they take a cut of each transaction that ranges from 1.75% to 3.75%. They cater to different kinds of businesses offering customizations to accommodate diverse food and retail vendors. Vendors can check in on their business stats remotely from the cloud, seeing that day’s transactions in real-time, tracking inventory, and linking to accounting software. Mobile POS near field communication capabilities enable payment apps like Google Wallet and ApplePay, meaning consumers can pay by holding their smartphones up to a sensor.\nBut not all mobile POS systems are created equal. Here’s a quick look at how they serve different types of business owners, based on the experiences of owners who have used them.\nSquare: Best for Businesses Requiring Mobility\nJennifer Trecartin is a nutritional consultant based in Vancouver, Canada, taking on private clients and blogging for her website, “My Edible Advice.” When she first started her business in 2009, she required payment in cash or check, but soon realized those options were cumbersome. She began to look into other payment systems.\nFor instance, she considered a large point-of-sale terminal, such as Square’s $99 iPad stand with a credit card swiping mechanism. The stand has many customizable features, including inventory monitoring, the ability to take online orders, print receipts, print tickets to restaurant kitchens, report sales, solicit customer feedback and set up automatic tips options.\nBut because Trecartin was constantly on the go meeting clients in their homes, she was more attracted to the company’s simple $29 pocket-sized credit card reader, a white square that plugs into her iPhone’s headphone jack, turning her smartphone into a mobile POS. “I really liked the flexibility of having something that I could take with me,” she said, persuaded by Square’s “inviting and user-friendly interface” that had the “simplicity of plug-and-play.”\nPage 1 / 3 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.shopkeep.com/", "http://www.myedibleadvice.com/", "https://www.google.com/wallet/", "https://www.thelevelup.com/", "https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/", "https://squareup.com/?gclid=CJf-iOP23cYCFQ2QHwodRm8Ntw&pcrid=45203886577&pdv=c&pkw=squareup&pm=true&pmt=e", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/8fa7bb737b0c4b11bb464ee0d226888f/640x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "published": "2015-07-23T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:34:53.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
