Equipped with the power assist an e-bike facilitates pedaling with minimal effort even when riding uphill or against the wind. E-bikes are environment friendly and their increased use can really create a measurable impact on the reduction of carbon emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.  \nTechnavio's analysts forecast the global li-ion battery market for e-bikes to grow at a CAGR of 30.2% over the period 2014-2019.  \nGet More Details on this Report and a Full Table of Contents at \nThe report analyst commented \"China is the biggest market for e-bikes and Li-ion batteries in terms of production as well as exports. Most of the Li-ion battery manufacturers in China are reputed. However there are instances of batteries overheating and exploding causing damages to e-bikes property and people. The main reason for battery failure is incorrect battery assembly. Battery manufacturers are becoming more conscious and have taken steps to increase production oversight and quality control.\"\nAccording to the report the cost of Li-ion batteries is decreasing rapidly because of an increase in the end-user application base. The cost of Li-ion batteries was around four to eight times more than that of lead-acid batteries and one to four times more than Ni-MH batteries in 2010. However the cost of Li-ion batteries has decreased significantly since then driven by their growing usage in BEVs PHEVs HEVs UPS systems forklifts consumer electronics devices and backup power supplies. Manufacturers will be able to increasingly leverage economies of scale as the market increases in size and production scales increase.\nFurther the report states that safety concerns are one of the major cited reasons hindering the use of e-bikes.\nThe key players in the Global Li-ion Battery for E-bikes are BMZ BYD China BAK Battery Coslight Johnson Matthey Battery LG Chem Panasonic SAFT Samsung SDI and Tianjin Lishen Battery while other prominent vendors include Boston Power CNEBIKES DLG Battery EVPST Excell Battery Fullriver General Electronics Battery Howell Energy Jiangsu E Motors Group JOOLEE Kayo Battery LICO Technology Meidy Battery Mercuritas Technology Phylion Battery Shenzen Melasta Battery Shenzhen Mottcell Battery Technology SincPower Starnovo Technology Tongyu Technology Vmcell Tech and Wuhan V-cell Energy Technology\nThe study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.\nAbout Fast Market Research\nFast Market Research is a leading distributor of market research and business information.
