Louie Douvis by Jonathan Shapiro Sarah Thompson Slater & Gordon managing director Andrew Grech has hit the phones to reassure investors and analysts that the company's accounts are in order, after it shocked the market by admitting an accounting error in its cash flow statements and confirming it was the subject of an investigation from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission .\nSources said Mr Grech, who has not made any public comments since Monday's shock announcement, was in constant contact with shareholders to reassure them that the company's accounting policies would be found to be sound. His message was that since ASIC had reviewed its accounting policies in 2007 and 2012 and given they had not changed since then, there were unlikely to be any issues.\nA company spokeswoman reiterated the company would make no further comment on the matter beyond those referred to in Monday's ASX statement, which revealed accounting errors dating from 2012-14.\nShares in the embattled law firm fell a further 5.8 per cent to $3.56 on the last trading day of the financial year, adding to the woes of small cap fund managers who have kept faith with the company, which has had almost $1 billion wiped off its sharemarket value in just five trading sessions.\nOn Tuesday regulatory filings showed that top-performing Australian fund manager Fidelity had become a substantial shareholder, buying 1.6 million shares last week to lift its stake in the company to more than the 5 per cent level that marks a substantial shareholder.\nMeanwhile, the analyst community split again on a stock that only a few months ago has unanimously endorsed with buy ratings.\nDeutsche Bank analysts maintained their \"buy\" rating on the company \"notwithstanding the near-term risks associated with the ASIC queries and the disappointing accounting errors\".\nMore bearish Other analysts are turning more bearish, in light of the revelations of accounting errors and regulatory probes.\nUBS analysts downgraded their position to a neutral rating, saying the revelations brought into \"question the accuracy of the company's historic financial statements and reinforced concerns over the relationship between revenue recognition and cash flow\".\nMorningstar placed its recommendation under review and said recent events called into question its \"exemplary stewardship\" rating on the company, while recent events would \"impact potential client perception of the company's brand and erode the [competitive] moat\".\nShort-sellers meanwhile are profiting from the sudden plunge in the company's share price. The number of shares borrowed increased further this week, with 8.7 per cent of the free float in the hands of short-sellers.\nOn Monday, fund manager VGI Partners emerged as one of the hedge funds that has shorted the company. A presentation said it shorted the company's share based on what it believed were several key red flags relating to its accounting and audit procedures.\nFairfax Media understands several other large hedge funds have aggressively shorted Slater & Gordon stock, but for different reasons to VGI. The controversial $1.3 billion acquisition of Quindell's professional services division in March is believed to be the catalyst for the majority of short-selling interest, with hedge fund analysts concerned about the ability of the newly acquired collection of businesses to generate enough cash.\nRisk to the downside Fund manager Ben McGarry, of Totus Capital, said last week's \"investor day\" showed that with \"management admitting the acquisition would not add any accretion in 2015 – ie, already losing money – and with cash flows weighted to the second half, the market estimates for this stock have risk to the downside\".\n\"With 10 brokers rating the stock a buy, one under review and one underperform, this looks like another case of sell-side research that is favourably biased towards companies that have a continual need for money,\" he said.\nThe extent to which senior management could be subject to margin calls was also an area of further speculation. Senior staff participated in April's $890 million capital raising, with Mr Grech investing $11.15 million, while the head of the British operation, Ken Fowlie, bought $3.5 million of shares issued at a price of $6.37, 44 per cent lower than Tuesday's closing price.\nA company spokeswoman confirmed that Slater & Gordon's senior executives and directors had not taken out margin loans. Such actions would not be compliant with the company's trading policy, which prohibits directors from borrowing against shares in the company.\nThe accounting error revelations also resulted in speculation that Slater & Gordon, a class-action lawyer, would be the subject of a shareholder class action from a rival firm.\nIt is understood advisers to class-action lawyers were gathering information on Tuesday. Maurice Blackburn did not rule out leading an action against a peer law firm. A spokesperson for the law firm said it would \"continue to monitor developments closely\" but that \"it was too early to comment on the likelihood\" of further action.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T00:07:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
