Written by: Rebecca Borison 07/23/15 - 10:54 AM EDT Tickers in this article: AMZN \nNEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Amazon has quietly launched its own credit card for Prime members, offering yet another perk to its subscription program. But is the card worthwhile? \nThe Amazon Prime Store Card offers consumers either 5% back on all Amazon purchases or special financing on Amazon orders. It is only available for Prime members, but there are no additional fees on top of the $99 Prime membership fee--assuming you pay back your balance on time. \nAmazon, of course, thinks the card is a great deal. \"We're always looking for ways to reward customers and help them save money,\" said David Williams, general manager of Amazon Credit. \"The Amazon Prime Store Card with 5% unlimited rewards is a great value for Prime members.\" More Headlines DirecTV Jumps as FCC Nods to AT&T Merger, Charter Rises on Merger Efforts \nAnd if you are a frequent Amazon shopper, Williams is probably right. \"If you're an Amazon Prime junkie, it's hard to beat 5% back,\" said Gerri Detweiler, Credit.com's director of consumer education. \nBut before you sign up just yet, take a look at your spending history on Amazon. \"The last thing that anybody should do with a credit card is increase their spending just to get 5% cash back, because that's how people get into debt trouble,\" said Matt Schulz, senior analyst at CreditCards.com. \"Look at your spending, and if you're somebody who shops at Amazon regularly and is already an Amazon Prime member, then it might be worth considering this card because you'd essentially be getting cash back for something that you're already doing.\" \nThe closest comparison to Amazon's card is Target's RedCard, which also offers 5% back but unlike Amazon's, does not require any membership at Target. Plus Target's 5% comes directly off the price of your order, while Amazon will give you the 5% back as statement credit. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T18:39:43.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
