Photo: Nicolas Walker\nBut the afternoon was led by gains, bolstered by a rise in China's sharemarkets and better than expected Chinese trade numbers, but ultimately ran out of steam by the end of the session.\n\"We are now looking at three days of gains in the Chinese sharemarket, indicating the efforts from the Chinese authorities to stabilise the markets are working,\" AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said.\nRenewed nervousness on Greece as eurozone leaders gave the nation a 72-hour ultimatum to enact reforms to restore what German chancellor Angela Merkel labelled lost \"trust\" may have added to the end of day jitters.\nGreece is still the big theme on the ASX this week. Photo: Bloomberg\n\"The market's largely taken the developments in its stride, maybe because of a realisation that what the creditors was asking for was reasonable,\" Mr Oliver said.\n\"But the markets just have to get used it, it's a bit like [the conflict in] Ukraine last year, it keeps dragging on,\" he said.\nThe close into the red was led by the banks, with Commonwealth Bank down 0.7 per cent to $85.18, National Australia Bank down 0.6 per cent to $32.88, ANZ Banking Group shed 1.1 per cent to $31.90 and Westpac fell 0.4 per cent to $32.96.\n\"The threat of capital raising has been around for a while, and particularly started to impact a few months ago... but it's ultimately unlikely that they will have to cut their dividends at all,\" Mr Oliver said.\nThe mining stocks struggled, with Fortescue Metals Group among the day's heaviest sold stocks, down 5 per cent to $1.725. BHP Billiton fell 0.9 per cent to $26.41 while Rio Tinto fell 1 per cent to $51.53.\nThe sell off comes despite the iron ore price recording a second day of gains over the weekend.\nUranium miner Paladin Energy was the day's best performing stock. Its shares rose 7.3 per cent after the company hit back at media reports that its African mining operations were linked to hundreds of workers deaths and injuries.\n\"Paladin wholeheartedly rejects these various fabrications and assertions,\" the company said in a statement. It clawed back from being last week's worst performing stock after falling 20 per cent.\nCochlear also gained strongly, up 6.4 per cent to $84.57 after JPMorgan upgraded it to \"overweight\" with a target price of $90.62, saying it expected strong growth and an increase in market share in coming years.\n\"Cochlear is a high quality business that benefits from the lower currency,\" State Super Financial Services chief investment officer Damian Graham said.\n\"It is also a fairly illiquid company in general terms, price action can occur if they do see some buying,\" he said.\nOf the other heavyweight stocks, Wesfarmers fel 0.5 per cent while Woolworths gained 0.7 per cent. Telstra also gained, up 0.3 per cent.\nThe best performing sectors were health, telecommunications and consumer staples, which were the only sectors to finish in the black. The energy sector fell 1.29 per cent.\nMr Graham said the market would remain volatile ahead of Wednesday, with Greece's new action deadline as well Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen's semiannual testimony delivered to Congress both due.\n\"Those two outcomes are going to be critical drivers in a very sentiment driven market,\" Mr Graham said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T18:19:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
