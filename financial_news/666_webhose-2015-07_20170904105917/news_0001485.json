In some cases performance has been trailing their benchmarks. For many of them, raising money has become much more arduous. For example, intuitional monies such as pension funds tend to be directed to the larger, more established funds. Along the same lines, many cap-into professionals are having an ever-harder time finding investors for start-up and smaller funds.\nBased on extensive studies with single-family offices , a solid percentage of them are capitalizing upon these scenarios faced by new hedge funds. These single-family offices are committing billions of dollars to alternatives including hedge funds and are often very interested in investing in smaller (hopefully nimble) funds, which can profit in todayâ€™s volatile economic environment.\nIn some situations, single-family offices are pressuring these newer hedge funds to lower their fees. Many of them are not only getting better than conventional fee arrangements, they are also often getting better terms with respect to lock up periods and hurdle rates.\nWhat is very telling is that the leverage of many of these single-family offices is not only in their ability to directly provide significant funds, but also the fact that a majority of them will actively solicit additional monies from other single-family offices as well as ultra-wealthy investors. These additional investors brought to the newer hedge fund by the single-family office are ultra-wealthy individuals and families that would otherwise be exceedingly unlikely to be sourced by the newer hedge funds on their own. This pooling of high-net-worth investors can easily deliver tremendous amounts of capital to a new hedge fund making the trade-off on fees and terms quite reasonable.\nIn the end, the ability of the newer hedge fund to deliver solid investment returns will decide its future. Still, many hedge funds need more capital in order to get the opportunity to shine. Today, it is very clear that many single-family offices are willing to bet and bet heavily on newer and smaller hedge funds including start-up funds as well as raise capital for these funds from their peers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T16:38:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
