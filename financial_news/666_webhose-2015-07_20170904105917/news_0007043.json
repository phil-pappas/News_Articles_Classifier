GEORG RUEBENSAL​\nManaging director\nExpedia Australia and New Zealand\nFirst, business or economy?\nBusiness class is my preference for long-haul, however I mostly fly premium economy when travelling for business. It's no flat bed but on most airlines the extra space does allow for a comfortable flight.\nMost frequented destination\nFor business, it's a tie between Seattle and London, where Expedia's head offices are located. For personal travel, I spend as much time as I can in the McLaren Vale in South Australia, where we have a small property. The food and wine are amazing and there are also beautiful beaches, cross-country walks and the festivals of Adelaide.\n I f I ran my own airline I would ...\nStop serving breakfast at 4 am. No one really wants their breakfast two hours before their arrival, especially on Singapore to Sydney flights that arrive at 6 am.\nThe worst place you've been lost\nMerida in Venezuela, an amazing location in the Andes. A friend and I got caught up in student riots and we ended up in a dead-end street being followed by students and the military. We panicked but the students took care of us, led us out of the city through hidden paths and put us up in a little cottage away from the main town. I'm still not quite sure where we ended up. It was an amazing experience that we still reminisce about.\nMost memorable overseas dining\nI have a few but Omoide Yokocho, an area of small eateries in a maze of laneways behind Shinjuku railway station in Tokyo stands out. You are taking a step back in time and are guaranteed to experience authentic local food in an amazing atmosphere. You can be sure the stalls are selling ramen, sushi, soba or yakitori.\nIn the suitcase\nWaiting at the baggage carousel is one of my pet hates so I always try to travel with carry-on luggage, even for long-haul trips. I always carry a couple of books, either written by a local author, or books that are set in the destination I'm travelling to. Nothing beats reading The Quiet American while enjoying a drink at the Continental Hotel in Saigon.\nHow do you make the most of a spare afternoon in a strange city?\nI'll combine exercise and sightseeing and go for a run – my running shoes are always in my suitcase.\nTravel tips\nIt may be obvious but my number one tip is to avoid alcohol when flying. You'll feel so much better arriving after a flight on water only. I also advise tasting the local food and drinks. It always amazes me how many of my US colleagues come to Sydney and ask where the nearest Starbucks is!\nWhat technology do you use?\nI would be lost without my iPad. It allows me to read the daily paper, take notes and sync with the team, as well as stay in touch with family and friends via Skype.\nBest travel tale\nMy wife and I were on a tour through the Namib-Naukluft desert in Namibia in a hired four-wheel drive. It was an incredible landscape but was extremely dry and very remote in some areas. Taking a turn-off from a minor road towards a camp site, we suddenly saw two people coming out of nowhere, waving like crazy and running towards us. They were from Windhoek, Namibia's capital, and had been stranded at the campsite for four days with a broken clutch. Luckily they had water and food. We had great fun that evening sharing a beer or two and many stories over the campfire, before pulling them the 200-plus kilometres to the next town.\nBest thing about travelling\nBy far the best thing about travelling is meeting like-minded people and getting to learn about the local culture. It's also a great opportunity to switch off, immerse yourself in whatever is right for you and recharge those batteries.\nTop travel gripe\nWhen travellers go overseas but don't really venture out of the resort. There's always a desire to relax and do nothing for a few days, but the main reason for visiting another country should be to create a new experience, learn about the culture and get a little out of one's comfort zone. As Mark Twain said: \"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T10:41:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
