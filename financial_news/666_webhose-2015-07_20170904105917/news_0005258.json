But apparently it isn’t too late to rain down cash on the outgoing head of soccer’s world governing body.\nThe embattled FIFA boss was the victim of British prankster Simon Brodkin on Monday at a press event. Brodkin, also known as Lee Nelson, showered what appeared to be U.S. currency on a flustered Blatter as the FIFA boss was set to announce that elections for a new president would be held Feb. 26 at a special meeting of its 209 member associations. Blatter added that he wouldn't submit his name among the candidates to run the Zurich-based organization.\nFIFA’s Blatter targeted in comic’s cash prank (1:33) Reading between the lines is not difficult as Sepp Blatter’s news conference is interrupted by a shower of cash. Officials of the soccer governing body, of course, stand accused of having solicited and accepted bribes.\nBrodkin’s disruption of the FIFA news conference caps a tough period for FIFA and Blatter, who announced that he was stepping down as president back in early June, on the heels of sweeping accusations of corruption leveled against the soccer governing body.\n“We have to clean here first. Otherwise, I will not be able to speak to you, ladies and gentlemen, when we speak about football,” said Blatter on Monday, referring to the Brodkin interruption. Blatter could equally have been referring to the state of FIFA itself.\nBrodkin has crashed a number of high-profile events , mostly in Europe, but his unwelcome appearance at Blatter’s news conference — and the viral response to his prank — arguably does not even represent FIFA’s recent low point.\nA recent debut of multimillion-dollar movie “United Passions,” which lauds FIFA as an organization, bombed. The film starring French actor Gerard Depardieu and English thespian Tim Roth, who portrays Blatter, boasts the dubious distinction of having had one of the worst box-office openings in history. It cost an estimated $30 million to make but made a paltry $918 in its opening weekend .\nHere’s the trailer for that cinematic tour de force:\nBrodkin, according to a Tuesday report from Sky Sports, is to be charged with trespassing by Swiss authorities.\nBREAKING: British comedian Simon Brodkin to be charged with trespassing by Swiss authorities after throwing money at Sepp Blatter #SSNHQ\n— Sky Sports News HQ (@SkySportsNewsHQ) July 21, 2015 More from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/SSNHQ?src=hash", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/alleged-fifa-payments-suggest-link-to-top-officials-1433024740", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/JCjeD-Jqd2s", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-lee-nelson-simon-brodkins-6103050", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3133657/FIFA-s-30-million-vanity-movie-WORST-box-office-opening-U-S-raking-just-918-opening-weekend.html", "https://twitter.com/SkySportsNewsHQ/status/623533347189452800"], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T02:00:01.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
