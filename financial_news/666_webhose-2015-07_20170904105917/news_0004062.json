(NYSE: WMT) today announced it has acquired the outstanding shares in Yihaodian, taking full ownership of its fast-growing e-commerce business in China. Wang Lu, president and CEO of Walmart Global eCommerce in Asia, will lead Yihaodian as part of his overall executive responsibilities. \nWith full ownership of Yihaodian, Walmart plans to invest in both accelerating e-commerce and creating a seamless experience for customers across online, mobile and stores.

The two co-founders announced earlier this month that they are leaving Yihaodian, and will continue to serve as Chairman Emeritus and Strategic Executive Advisor respectively to ensure a smooth transition and contribute to the future success of Yihaodian. Walmart's planned investments are included in the company's previously announced e-commerce budget. \n\"Yihaodian has excelled as one of China's top e-commerce businesses.
