Paul Jeffers Share on twitter by Amanda Saunders Meet David Flanagan, iron ore bull. The founder of Atlas Iron, West Australian of the year and chancellor of Murdoch University is tipping the iron ore price will average $US50 a tonne to $US60 over the year. He says the current low price is merely a dip.\n\"The new normal is volatility,\" he told The Australian Financial Review in Melbourne. \"We could see iron ore trade in a range back up to $US70, and how low could it go? – it might go to $US40.\"\nFlanagan better be right. His iron ore miner is desperately trying to raise $180 million to avoid going broke. He acknowledges it might fail.\nThere are \"no guarantees\" the money will come through, he said. \"But we are optimistic and are going to work as hard as we can.\"\nMost in the industry don't share his optimism. Rio Tinto's iron ore head, Andrew Harding , said the price falls \" should come as no surprise to anyone in the commodities business.\n\"The iron ore price is moving around its long-term average after coming off an unprecedented high that was never sustainable,\" he said.\n\"We are seeing a pattern play out now that is entirely consistent with the history of all internationally traded commodities.\"\nMr Flanagan will hold 130 meetings over 21 days as part of Atlas Iron's capital raising. He has until Monday next week to close the retail raising and an extra two days for the institutional offer.\n Mr Flanagan has some skin in the game. He said he last bought shares – about 3 million – when the stock was about $1.40. Atlas shares remain suspended, but last traded at 12¢, and the capital raising is being done at 5¢.\n\"There are other shareholders who have worse stories, but I can feel my stomach acid,\" Mr Flanagan admitted.\nAtlas had raised $15 million on Tuesday, which had since increased to $18 million by Thursday, mostly from existing investors, and $41 million from contractors. One of the crucial contractors, haulage company McAleese, came under its own pressure on Thursday after a major truck crash involving one of its Cootes fuel tankers in Sydney – the subsidiary's second in two years.\n\"The reason it is so volatile is because iron ore is becoming a traded commodity – futures, all sorts of indexes, and there is a wash of money moving in and out.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mandaksaunders"], "published": "2015-07-09T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:05:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
