Dean Osland by Matthew Stevens Mount Thorley-Warkworth is the third-biggest coal complex in the Hunter Valley and it sits front and centre of the Australian coal operations that everyone imagines Rio Tinto would rather like to sell, maybe, to Mick Davis and his X2 crew.\nBut the five-pit complex's future has been cast into doubt again by the Baird government's unfathomable decision to overturn reforms that were introduced as recently as 2013 and that were aimed pretty obviously at extending this operation's working life.\nThis saga stretches back to 2010, when Rio made its original application to extend the boundaries of the Mount Thorley-Warkworth pits to ensure the 30-year-old operation could continue producing coal until 2036.\nThe planning authority's subsequent approval of the plan was then challenged effectively by a coalition of local and national anti-coal, anti-carbon, anti-development lobbies.\nIn April 2013 they secured rejection of the mine expansion in the NSW Land and Environment Court. Approval was overturned because the court found the economic benefit did not outweigh the \"unacceptable impacts\" on local biodiversity or the increased imposition on local communities caused by the mine's creep to within 2.6 kilometres of the town of Bulga.\nThis rejection was subsequently endorsed by a court of appeal, which found no error of law in the LEC judgment.\nWith that the state introduced reforms to the planning act that established economic significance as an overriding priority of future planning assessments and Rio promptly re-started the approval process with a proposition redrafted to deal with criticism made in the 2013 rejection.\nWe heard a couple of weeks ago that the Baird government would remove this particular trigger from the State Environmental Planning Policy once the Mount Thorley-Warkworth process was run. We didn't believe a government could be so stupid. But, as it turns out, it is on track to outperform on the stupidity index.\n In promoting economic significance to a position of primacy in the planning approval process the government quite naturally invited cynicism from environmentalists, who were concerned that Rio had somehow earned special treatment after its project had failed the public tests.\nTo so promptly extract the economic significance trigger seems only to confirm those suspicions. The government leaves itself open to allegations that it opened a legislative window for a review of the Mount Thorley-Warkworth case and now, with its progress looking to be as secure as possible, the window is to be closed abruptly.\nIt is a move that, again, announces a worryingly ad hoc approach to a planning process that sits at the gateway to the state's economic progress and re-arms critics of what was a quite rational restatement of the priorities.\nBut what truly beggars belief is that this back-flip has been formally proposed before Rio's project has been secured.\nThe most immediate issue for Rio and pretty much everyone else currently involved in the formalities of the Planning Assessment Commission will be to establish that any changes that are eventually made to the SEPP will not be retrospective.\nBy my count there have been seven PAC approvals offered to proponents wanting to extend legacy operations or build new mines over the past 18 months. Each of those successful applicants will probably need reassurance that their approvals hold.\nNeedless to say, some of the coal developments in question are just that wee bit controversial, not the least of them being Shenhua's Watermark project, which sits on the delicate fringes of the black soil of the Liverpool Plains.\nBut, if anything, the issue of retrospectivity probably hangs even more heavily on Rio's contested progress at Bulga. A final decision on Mount Thorley-Warkworth sits with the PAC. A verdict is expected by the end of July or early in August. The coal industry is reasonably confident of a green light, which is good because Rio's current approvals mean that the project's 1800 jobs can only be guaranteed until the end of 2015.\nBut the potential that the rules of the PAC assessment might be changed before a decision must surely create a bit of a dilemma for the three-person panel deciding on the Rio project's fate.\nAnd, should the PAC deliver on expectations and approve the extension, what then? Does this early redraft of the planning rules open the potential for another legal challenge that seeks to visit any new planning priorities on a PAC process that has ended? And what if the rules are changed before the PAC panel adjudicates?\nQuite unexpectedly, that potential is real, and not just because it is open to the government to move with rare speed to amend the approval regime.\nThe other side of the coin here is that Rio's PAC process has taken a few unusual turns over recent times, with one panellist being replaced and with a second round of public meetings being forced unexpectedly on the proponent.\nThe statutory meeting required to extinguish the potential of appeal of PAC rulings was held in late 2014. But the PAC decided a second community gathering was required because of the \"high level of public interest\".\nIt was not just Rio that failed to anticipate this need. As it turned out, one of the three that will decide Mount Thorley-Warkworth's future, PAC chairwoman Lynelle Briggs, was unable to attend those meetings. We are told she was on leave. But whatever the reason, the result was that, having spent six months on the case, Briggs stepped down from the panel.\nHot air Predictions that the east coast is headed for an enduring gas surplus until 2030 and beyond are expressions of a very reasonable confidence of net back pricing to reshape the supply side of our nascent and currently dysfunctional national gas market.\nHaving reviewed more than 50 individual gas projects, the oil and gas team at Citi has come to a conclusion that, on the face of it, stands in isolating contrast to accepted wisdom.\nThe more common position, of course, is that the east coast should expect to slip into gas supply deficit from 2017-18, when Gladstone's gas chillers begin their long build-up to full export production.\nCritically, Citi agrees with this thesis but it identifies that it will be a short-lived phenomenon because the export-equivalent pricing introduced to the domestic market will result in a decline in gas demand but, at the same time, induce new supply.\nCiti notes that if the price signal does not work and there is no growth in supply, there will growing shortages of supply until 2030.\n\"However, we do not expect LNG proponents to allow a shortfall to occur,\" the firm concludes.\nSo Citi has built an \"expected upside\" case on the creep of incentive pricing through the domestic gas market and the quite routine commercial response that will trigger. Citi estimates that gas customers will need to pay between $5 and $8 a gigajoule to attract new supply but at that sort of level we should expect new resources to be confirmed in the Cooper Basin and across coal seam methane.\nIn the end, Citi is predicting an over-supply of gas that will force delays on several very high-profile developments, including the pair of coal seam gas developments planned for NSW by Santos (Narrabri) and AGL (Gloucester).\nThe coincidence of Citi's impressively counter-intuitive view of the gas market and AGL confirmation that it has abandoned long-held ambitions to self-supply its gas requirements is informative of a maturing understanding of the shifting dynamics of this critical corner of the Australian energy sector.\nImplicit in AGL's change of strategy is, surely, a belief that the gas market over the medium to long term is going to be a very much more liquid and transparent beast. Indeed, it rather appears that AGL stands ready to assist in the transformation of the market by looking to gas storage as the most appropriate way to leverage its human and financial capital.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T18:09:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
