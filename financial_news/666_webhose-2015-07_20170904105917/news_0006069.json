But its main funding comes from households paying a licence fee, enforced by a system to detect who is watching live television. Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) many viewers watch online. \nCulture Minister John Whittingdale said the eight-strong panel would contribute to the review of the BBC's charter, which is due for renewal next year. \nIt includes Dawn Airey, an executive at Yahoo (NasdaqGS: YHOO - news ) and the former CEO of Channel 5, Ashley Highfield, chief executive of local newspaper publisher Johnston Press (LSE: JPR.L - news ) , and Alex Mahon, former chief executive of Shine, a TV production company owned by Rupert Murdoch's Twenty First Century Fox. \n\"Each member of the independent advisory group brings individual skills, experience and expertise,\" Whittingdale said. \nA government spokeswoman also said a preliminary paper of proposals on the BBC would be published this week. She declined to say what it would contain. \nThe Sunday Times said it would herald the largest shake-up of the corporation for a generation, including replacing the universal 145.50 pound ($225) licence fee and the scrapping of the BBC Trust regulator. \nLast week the government told the BBC, already facing a shortfall in licence revenue, to meet the 650 million pound cost of free licences for the over-75s. \nIn return, the government said it would be allowed to charge for its online iPlayer service. \nThe BBC's Director General Tony Hall told the Observer newspaper that although he had secured a financial settlement, \"we should be under no illusion that this is a period of high risk for the BBC.\" ($1 = 0.6441 pounds) (Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T16:27:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
