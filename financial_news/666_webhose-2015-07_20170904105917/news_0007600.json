In this system vehicles are owned by a separate firm organization or individuals and are shared by users for short periods of time.  Over the past three decades car-sharing has grown from a basic service provided by popular organizations to a widely recognized urban transport industry. It is also quickly developing into a globalized industry providing many transportation land use environmental and social benefits.\nTechnavioâ€™s analysts forecast the car-sharing market in APAC to grow at a CAGR of 39.06% over the period 2014-2019.\nGet More Details on this Report and a Full Table of Contents at \nThe report analyst commented \"Car sharing helps reduce the number of cars on the road. This results in lower emissions of polluting gases and a reduced carbon footprint. The inclusion of EVs in the fleet has given people the ability to use environmentally friendly cars at affordable prices. Rising concerns over environmental pollution is leading to a higher acceptance of car sharing among consumers. Car sharing will also reduce dependence on oil and gas non-renewable sources of fuel. This has huge implications for car manufacturing companies as they can save energy by limiting the resources spent on car manufacturing.\"\nAccording to the report the growing number of megacities is directly affecting the car-sharing market. A megacity is an area of continuous urban development with over 10 million people that is either a single metropolitan area or two or more metropolitan areas that have been converged. In China Shanghai and Beijing are two of the fastest-growing megacities at least over the past decade. Similarly India has plans to develop five megacities in Gujarat Maharashtra Haryana and Madhya Pradesh by the end of 2015. The rapidly rising population and growing proportion of urban residents across China and India will put excessive burdens on the transportation system leading to a shortage of parking spaces among other issues. This is expected to lead to a decline in car ownership contributing to the growth of the car-sharing market.\nFurther the report states that users' indifference and resistance toward adopting car-sharing models due to lack of awareness is proving to be a continuous challenge for the growth of the market.\nThe key players in the Car-sharing Market in APAC are Car2share (Daimler AG) Car Clubs eHi Auto Services GoGet Hertz Kandi Technologies Orix Auto Park24 and Socar while other prominent vendors include City Hop E-Car Green Car Mobility CarSharing Modo-The Car Co-op Zipcar and Zoomcar\nThe study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry.
