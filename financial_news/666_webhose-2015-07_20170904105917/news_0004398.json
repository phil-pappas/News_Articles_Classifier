SEBI found that Swasata Steel allotted non-convertible debentures (NCDs) to 795 people and mobilised over Rs12 crore, while Siyaram raked in at least Rs6 lakh from by issuing secured redeemable debentures (SRDs) to at least 63 allottees. The company, through such activities, violated various norms, it said. SEBI observed that allotment of debentures by the companies were a public issue, which under the rules require a compulsory listing on a recognised stock exchange. It was also required to file a prospectus, among others, which they failed to do. Accordingly, SEBI through two separate interim orders have restrained the companies and their respective directors from mobilising any fresh \"funds from investors through the offer of NCDs/ SRDs or through the issuance of equity shares or any other securities to the public, and/or invite subscription, in any manner whatsoever, either directly or indirectly till further directions\". Further, the companies and their directors have been barred from issuing any offer document or advertisement for soliciting money from the public for the issue of securities. They have been restrained from accessing the securities markets, SEBI said. The market regulator also asked the entities not to dispose any of the properties or assets without prior permission from the regulator as well as not to divert the funds raised from the public.
