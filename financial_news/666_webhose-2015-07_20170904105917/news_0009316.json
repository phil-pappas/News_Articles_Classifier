Louie Douvis by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Archer Capital is seeking to capitalise on merger and acquisition interest in the dairy sector, hiring Luminis Partners to sell the firm's Western Australian milk and yoghurt manufacturer Brownes Dairy.\nBrownes is one of the last remaining independent dairy companies of scale that is not farmer owned following the hotly contested auction for Warrnambool Cheese & Butter which wrapped up in February 2014.\nThe company collects 144 million litres of milk a year from more than 60 dairy farmers in south-west Western Australia, before selling it as milk, flavoured milk and yoghurt under the Brownes and Chill brands.\nMarket sources said Archer had hired Luminis after receiving inbound approaches, with a sale process expected to be up and running within weeks.\nStreet Talk reported last year that Archer had been considering an offshore joint venture partner, in the wake of interest in the industry.\nIt's understood Brownes is making more than $15 million in annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, which points to a possible $130 million to $150 million sale for Archer.\nLocal and global dairy players are expected to take an information memorandum and run the ruler over Brownes, including the likes of ASX-listed Freedom Foods and Dean Foods from the United States.\nCanada's Saputo, which owns an 88 per cent stake in Warrnambool Cheese & Butter, is likely to take a look, along with China's Bright Food Group, Philippines-based Monde Nissan and Kirin-owned Lion Nathan.\n It will be interesting to see whether New Zealand's a2 Milk Company is also tempted to make an offer. a2 is under fire from suitors Freedom and Dean Foods and could bulk up with Brownes as a defensive move.\nBrownes proved a challenging acquisition for Archer in its early years, however the firm has spent more than $40 million on the business under new chief executive and turnaround veteran Tony Girgis to reframe the business for returns and growth.\nArcher's fully-owned subsidiary DairyWest bought Brownes from Fonterra Co-Operative Group in early 2011. The size of the deal was not disclosed.\nBrownes' auction comes as a merger and acquisition wave flows through the industry, with bids for listed players Warrnambool and a2 during the past two years. Much of the interest comes as Australian companies position themselves to supply Asia and in the wake of Australia's free trade agreement with China.\nLuminis' mandate comes as the firm considers sale options for another Archer business, private hospital owner Healthe Care.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:12:19.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
