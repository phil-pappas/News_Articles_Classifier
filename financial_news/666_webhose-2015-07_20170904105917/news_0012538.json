Glenn Hunt by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Chi-X Australia is understood to be in talks with the corporate cop in an effort to beat ASX Ltd to the holy grail of domestic broking: listing heavyweight offshore stocks in Australia.\nStreet Talk understands Chi-X's move has piqued the interest of local fund managers who can only invest in locally listed stocks and wish they could plant money in the likes of Google or Apple.\nIt also comes as they consider waving goodbye to another top-100 stock in Asciano, should Brookfield Infrastructure Partners shore up its indicative and non-binding approach.\nSources said Chi-X hoped to have approval within months and was looking at numerous approaches already undertaken in several other markets, including Japan. It's understood Chi-X is hopeful the new approaches may be easier to get past Greg Medcraft and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.\nThe No.2 exchange's move is in keeping with a new push by chief executive John Fildes to spend big on products beyond the relatively limited money-spinner of straight share trading.\nBut if ASX Ltd's experience is anything to go by, that may be a tall order. ASX has been working on a new option for offshore shares to list in Australia for at least two years after its former proposal was rejected back in 2012.\nASIC was worried that the unsponsored depositary receipts that were to be used to Quote: the likes of Google, Apple or GE on the ASX would not adhere to Australia's continuous disclosure rules and would expose retail investors to unacceptable risks.\nASX chief executive Elmer Funke Kupper told stockbrokers at their annual conference in May that the ASX was still working on its plan. One idea he has floated is restricting trading to institutional investors.\n Other models include sponsored depositary receipts. In November, SIX Swiss began offering trading in more than 500 stocks from around the world using so-called sponsored foreign shares.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:12:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
