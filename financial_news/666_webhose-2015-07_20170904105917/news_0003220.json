Chinese Finance Minister Lou Jiwei, Shanghai Mayor Yang Xiong and the bank’s President K V Kamath attended the opening ceremony.\nKamath, 67, who will be the bank’s President for the first five years, said he was confident to deliver people’s expectation of the new bank.\n“Countries should closely cooperate,” Kamath, a former executive with India’s largest private bank ICICI Bank, said.\n“We will listen carefully to our members and try to offer tailor-made services for them,” he said.\nBRICS economies Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa launched the multi-billion dollar development bank at the 7th BRICS summit held in the Russian city of UFA on July 8 amid efforts to finance infrastructure projects, mainly in member countries.\n“The NDB will supplement the existing international financial system in a healthy way and explore innovations in governance models,” Lou said at a seminar following the launch of the bank.\n“Its creation is to meet the urgent demand of such countries in infrastructure construction and beyond,” he said, adding it will complement the existing international banking system, instead of challenging it.\nThe NDB will have initial capital of USD 50 billion, which will be expanded to USD 100 billion within the next couple of years.\nEach BRICS member will contribute an equal share in establishing a startup capital.\nBRICS nations, with 42.6 per cent of the world’s total population and roughly one third of the world’s land area, have a combined GDP accounting for about one fifth of the world total.\nThe NDB was conceived as a counterbalance to US-led financial institutions like the World Bank and IMF by providing funding for infrastructure and development projects in BRICS countries. Each nation will have an equal say in the bank’s management, regardless of GDP size, according its officials.\nThe NDB is also backed by the China-floated USD 50 billion Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in which India and 56 other countries have joined.\nThe World Bank welcomed the opening of NDB.\n“We would like to congratulate Mr K V Kamath, President of the New Development Bank, and the founding members Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa on this important occasion,” World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in a statement.\n“We are committed to working closely with the New Development Bank and other multilateral institutions, offering to share our knowledge and to co-finance infrastructure projects. These types of partnerships will be essential to reach our common goals to end extreme poverty by 2030, boost shared prosperity, and to reduce inequalities,” Kim said.\nFor Updates Check Banking News ; follow us on Facebook and Twitter\n 21, 2015 8:52 am", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress", "http://twitter.com/financialxpress"], "published": "2015-07-21T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T05:51:39.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
