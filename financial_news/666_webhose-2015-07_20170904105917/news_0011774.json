We could do a deal tomorrow morning,\" he said. \n\"This week has not been a dead week in term of negotiations.\" \n\"The Greek government and the institutions have come very, very close when it comes to the fiscal policy as well as the list of reforms. The difference is debt relief.\" \nTalks between Greece and its international creditors broke down last week when Athens rejected the latest terms for a deal and announced it would hold a referendum on July 5 on the proposals. \n\"The difference between a 'Yes' and a 'No' vote is that a 'Yes' is going to lead to an unsustainable and very bad agreement for Greece and for Europe, and a 'No' vote will lead to a better agreement,\" Varoufakis said. \nHe added: \"I'm sure that a 'No' vote is going to create the balance which is necessary within the Eurogroup so as to agree a sensible course of debt restructuring, debt profiling.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T13:38:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
