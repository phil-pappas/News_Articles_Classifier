It is a privilege for Sahara to stand in solidarity with Ghana at this time,” he added. \nAccording to him, Sahara hopes the cash donation, which forms part of the support, would defray some of the huge cost of treatment and rehabilitation of victims with varying degrees of injuries. Mr. Etomi further commiserated with the families of those who lost their lives in the disaster. \n“We pray for the repose of the souls of the departed and also pray that the well being of the grieving families”, he stated. \nIn order to achieve maximum impact and for the items to reach the intended recipients, Sahara is partnering with Joy FM, an Accra- based radio station to spearhead the distribution of the items. \nThe station launched an emergency relief effort after the disaster and has since been coordinating the donation of items received from the public- spirited individuals and organizations to the victims.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T02:14:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
