China disclosed on Friday a 57 percent increase in its gold reserves from 2009, far less than the market had estimated. \nSpot gold (XAU=) was up 0.4 percent at $1,101.29 an ounce by 0616 GMT, after an early low of $1,096.65. The metal fell as far as $1,088.05 on Monday, its weakest since March 2010. \nU.S. gold for August delivery (GCcv1) slipped 0.5 percent to $1,101.80 an ounce. \nHuge volumes sold on a key Shanghai physical contract hastened gold's 4 percent slide in a matter of minutes on Monday, as China appears to be shunning bullion. \nInvestors have found less and less reason to hold bullion as a safe haven, with the dollar strengthening ahead of what is expected to be the first increase in U.S. interest rates in nearly a decade. \nGold's slide has helped wipe out half the gains from the last decade's historic bull run, taking prices back to a key chart level and threatening a break toward $1,000 an ounce. \nBut the price is unlikely to fall sharply again on Tuesday as it did when it fell 13 percent over two consecutive trading days in April 2013, wrote Phillip Futures analyst Howie Lee. \n\"Those two infamous days in gold's history was marked by a constant decline in prices throughout both sessions, while yesterday's tumble was marked by a one-minute drop followed by a substantial recovery,\" said Lee. \n\"A repeat of history does not look to be on the cards but we still expect heavy downward pressure on gold in the future. It looks to be a matter of time before gold breaks again.\" \nGold holdings at SPDR (GLD), the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, dropped to 22,327,678.15 ounces (HLDSPDRGT=XAU) on Monday, the lowest since August 2008. \n(Reporting by Manolo Serapio Jr.; Editing by Richard Pullin, Tom Hogue and Michael Perry)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T11:11:06.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
