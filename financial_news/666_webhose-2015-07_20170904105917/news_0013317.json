But when it comes down to it, he only backs a select few.\nOver the past year he has met and interviewed more than 200 portfolio managers, but in that time he's only invested with three of them.\nCollins is responsible for investing on behalf of about 100 rich families within MFCo's client services business. The original Myer family's wealth is ring-fenced within the group's broader $5 billion portfolio.\nAs steward of this significant pool of wealth, his decision to invest or not invest with a particular manager can have enormous implications. MFCo was one of the early backers of star stock picker John Sevior's boutique investment firm, Airlie Funds Management, after Sevior left Perpetual Investments.\nMFCo placed $100 million with the fledgling outfit in 2013. Today it has $230 million invested with the fund. Airlie has been one of the top-performing fund managers in the country, producing an excess return of 9.04 per cent for MFCo since December 2012.\nMore recently, Collins has been looking at overseas managers. Among those to make the grade are: Wellington Management Co, for a last-stage private equity fund called Hadley Harbor; JO Hambro's Global Select Fund, for exposure to the technology and healthcare sectors; and a Metric Capital Partners fund focused on senior bank loans.\nMFCo's investment approach resembles that of a large superannuation fund in that it allocates money to fund managers who can be hired and fired depending on what they bring to the table. When you oversee billions of dollars this is both an efficient and a cost-effective way of doing business.\nBut after hundreds, if not thousands, of meetings with fund managers from the country's biggest investment houses he is unlikely to invest alongside the same household brand names that have traditionally looked after the retirement savings of most Australians.\n It's not that Collins has an aversion to mainstream investment managers; it's just that rigorous analysis of these cookie-cutter funds reveals there is very little to get excited about.\n\"Good stock pickers are actually quite quirky; they're actually quite individually minded. They're not necessarily able to cope very well around committees and group situations. They usually have a fairly firm idea about what's going to happen and you have to back that key person to a large extent,\" Collins says.\nIn the investing game, where it's hard to differentiate skill from luck, and where the average punter has little more to go on than past performance to pick where future returns might come from, Collins fixes on discerning traits he knows are conducive to quality active management.\n\"Bigger is viewed as better, particularly in the super fund world where economies of scale can lead to better opportunities. But actually, based on the research looking at funds managers at ground level, it's clear [that] the bigger funds managers are, the worse the outcome for investors,\" he says.\nIndex hugging To explain this aversion to large funds, or \"asset gatherers\" as he describes them, Collins points to the underlying psychology that leads many of these firms to lose their investing mojo.\n\"Once you've established a track record it's human nature to protect it. The easiest way to protect it is to get closer and closer to the index, whereas in the early stages of a fund's life the intention is to build a good a track a record as possible,\" Collins points out.\nHe also highlights size as a determining factor in whether funds can get in and out of positions efficiently enough – fund managers that have become too big can't go out and look for ideas outside the largest stocks in the market, he adds.\nCollins sympathises with investors seeking out active management. He says their decision making will invariably boil down to an assessment of past performance or fees and \"that's often the worst way to approach it\".\n\"Investing is a test of character. It's how you put a plan together and it's how you stick to it over time. It's also about who's doing the work, whether those people are well aligned in the work they are doing … [and about] how they cope with mistakes and what they've learnt over time,\" Collins describes.\nThe fixation on fund management fees has added to the recent push into low-priced, passive strategies such as index funds, Collins says. He says this passive attraction might be happening at the wrong time.\n\"There's a place for passive. What I wonder, though, is whether passive investments tend to attract most attention towards the back end of bull markets as investors are chasing the equity market run. I'd argue the best time to take on passive investment is when the bear market has really taken hold and everyone is heading for the hills.\"\nCollins describes his preference for managers that have a style-bias towards value over growth and a tendency to focus on companies with strong balance sheets. He likes managers that are unconstrained in terms of where in the market they invest and the amount of cash they hold.\n\"Rather than hold cash, I'd rather trust managers to hold cash because the fact is they know where to allocate capital much quicker and much more efficiently than if we decided to hold cash and release it,\" he says.\nHe points to Lanyon Asset Management as an example of a fund he invests with that has maintained a cash position of more than 45 per cent since its inception in 2011.\nLanyon closed its Australian Value Fund to new investment in August 2014 after reaching capacity of $150 million. However, it is now in the early stages of launching a new Global Value Fund. But will it impress him as much as the first offering?\nEvery fund management firm has its own unique story, Collins says, but there are only a handful of funds at any given time with the right one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T11:11:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
