Use your key for the next article Comment Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \nNine out of ten startups fail and a lack of strategic planning is usually lurking somewhere just beyond the stiffly pointed index finger of a founder. Reddit is the latest company (once a startup) facing that reality, but many startups have paid an even higher price than the “Front Page of the Internet.” \nThe following are heartbreaking warnings from two startups told postmortem, and one from reddit itself. You won’t be sad for long, though, there’s a cookie at the end of these gloomy tales for you. We’ve found a strategic planning specialist to enlighten us with fifteen essential questions to ask before your startup launches in order to increase its chances for success. \nTake heart and read on! \nReddit lacked a long term strategic plan. \nReddit has been under fire, lately, from its users regarding free speech on the site leading to the resignation of former CEO, Ellen Pao. Steve Huffman, reddit’s new CEO is now attempting to find a middle ground and wrote in a post on Tuesday : \n“The overwhelming majority of content on reddit comes from wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities. That is what makes reddit great. There is also a dark side, communities whose purpose is reprehensible, and we don’t have any obligation to support them.” \nReddit was never created with the intent to be “a bastion of free speech… We haven’t had the tools to enforce policy, but now we’re building those tools and reevaluating our policy.” \nHow could this have played out differently if reddit had long ago foreseen free speech as a potential battle ground on their site and created enforcement tools? It could have created an additional initial hurdle for the company to overcome but would have set appropriate expectations from the beginning. \nBricaBox had issues with cash flow. \nFormer BricaBox CEO Nate Westheimer cites “money, traction, team, and vision” as the reasons he closed the doors on his company. \n“ BricaBox was fed-but-anemic and slowly roasting its cash. Do it again and I'll concentrate those costs at the beginning. We would have had twice the product in 2/3 of the time.” \nIf funding and achieving revenue goals had been thoroughly thought through and listed in a strategic planning document, perhaps BricaBox would have had a better overview understanding of how fast production should be going versus spending. \nWesabe didn’t anticipate consumer needs. \nWesabe was “…considered the leader in online personal finance until September 2007, when Mint launched at, and won, the first TechCrunch 40 conference. From that point forward we were considered in second place at best… [and] a year later, Wesabe shut down,” writes co-founder Marc Hedlund on his blog . He points out that one of their biggest mistakes was that Mint automatically edited and categorized data, making it easier on the user than Wesabe. \nHad Wesabe anticipated that their users would want to avoid categorizing every purchase by hand, they could have changed their track before Mint was released. Market research would have alerted them to consumer needs. \nAnd Here’s Your Cookie: 15 Questions to Start Strategic Planning \nWe reached out to Jim Gribble from StratPlanGuy.com to see if we could save startups from pain down the road by pitching questions to entrepreneurs before they open their doors. He replied with a list of fifteen essential questions to ask yourself before you launch a startup. Thank you for the freebee, Jim! Where is the funding coming from for your start-up?
