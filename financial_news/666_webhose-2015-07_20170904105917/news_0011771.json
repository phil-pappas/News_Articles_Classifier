So this is where capital infusion becomes important,” Rajan said.\nBank should have enough capital so that they can clean up their balance sheet, he said.\n“The way to get out of financial stress is to address the problem early… and some of the banks may need some capital to do that. Hopefully this capital infusion will help,” he added.\nOn the issue of high NPA level, Rajan said: “Clearly this is an ongoing issue and we are working with the banks to ensure that they recognise the problems early, including through the database which allows them to identify problems as they start emerging.”\nOnce banks identify the problems to take action, he said, “then the government has to also play a role, which its playing, with dealing with large projects which are stuck.”\nFrom financial side, he said, “We have to make sure that if the project is put on track, it has a healthy capital structure, a capital structure which is not going to bring it back into trouble very quickly. Some of that means a serious restructuring…”\nOn transmission of policy rate by banks, Rajan said, “we have seen some movements in the rates in the past few weeks.”\n“Competition is one of the reasons why transmissions takes place and while you may want to retain profits, competition may not allow you to retain profits,” he added.\n“Banks at some point see the competition from money market, they may want to adjust the rates appropriately because they are not getting credit growth otherwise,” he said.\nFirst Published on July 2, 2015 5:45 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T09:16:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
