That sent its shares down 3 percent on opening, though they later pared losses to 1 percent. \nAfter previously warning that summer fares in the six months to the end of September could fall by up to 2 percent, the airline said it now expected them to be flat, giving it the financial firepower to be aggressive in the winter. \n\"We're going to use some of the slightly better (first-half) performance ... to pass on very aggressive pricing so that we fill 15 percent capacity growth in the second half,\" O'Leary said in a video statement. \nLower fuel prices will also help, providing a reduction of 7 percent in costs per seat, he said. \nThe airline plans to ground 40 planes this winter compared to 50 last year and it expects to fill 90 percent of its seats, up from 88 percent last year, the company said in a statement. \nProfit for the three months to the end of June, the first quarter of the company's financial year, was 245 million euros, up 25 percent year on year, and just short of a 249 million forecast in a Ryanair poll of analysts. \nAncillary revenue in the quarter was up 9 percent, lagging traffic growth of 16 percent in part due to lower charges for checked baggage following a decision to allow a second small bag in the cabin for free, O'Leary said. \nRyanair said it now expected to carry 103 million passengers this year, up 12 million from last year. In May it had forecast an increase of only 9 million.
