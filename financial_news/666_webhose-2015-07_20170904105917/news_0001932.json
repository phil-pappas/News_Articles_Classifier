Amalfitano, Sr., a leader in the corporate aircraft finance industry, has joined the newly formed commercial finance company as Executive Vice President, Senior Managing Director. Michael, who will report to Dave B. Fate, President and CEO of Stonebriar, built and led the global aircraft business for Bank of America Merrill Lynch for over 22 years and has over 33 years of experience in leadership roles within the leasing and financial services industry. Stonebriar plans to add corporate aircraft to its already robust list of industries served, including rail, marine, manufacturing, energy and corporate real property among others. Stonebriar’s business aviation finance platform will serve a broad range of middle market to large businesses, as well as high net worth individuals in the U.S. and select foreign jurisdictions.Michael stated “The strategy is to leverage the unique capabilities of Stonebriar, a well-funded and nimble organization, by providing financial terms and structures not generally offered by regulated institutions, allowing for greater flexibility in advance rates, terms, amortization, aircraft age and usage, while generating premium economic returns. We intend to focus on the now underserved corporate aircraft finance market vacated by many institutions post-2008 crisis including finance companies, such as GE Capital, who recently announced its intent to exit the space. Servicing this market will help promote the growth of business aviation for Stonebriar’s clients while driving asset and income growth for the company.”Fate added “Michael brings remarkable experience and tremendous credibility to this role, adding considerable strength and market presence given his solid reputation within the aviation industry, to broaden our financial services capabilities and product lines.”“I am very excited for Michael to be a part of the Stonebriar management team,” said Paul T. Bossidy, Chairman of Stonebriar. “With his expertise, I am confident that Stonebriar will quickly become a leading source of business aviation finance solutions.” \nReaders may also read the exclusive Equipment Finance Advisor article:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T16:58:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
