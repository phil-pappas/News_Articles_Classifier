Getty Images Share on twitter by James Chessell The International Monetary Fund has opened a fresh rift with Germany by warning Greece requires substantial debt relief far beyond anything its creditors are willing to offer for the debt-laden country to stage an economic recovery.\nIn a leaked report sent to the 19 eurozone members on Monday shortly after a third Greek bailout deal was agreed , the IMF argues Greece's creditors will need to take drastic action including writeoffs of some its €320 billion debt pile if the country is ever to return to sustainable growth.\nThe updated debt sustainability analysis, which includes the damaging impact of capital controls imposed more than two weeks ago, warns the eurozone powers need to give Athens a 30-year grace period on servicing all of its European debt or accept \"deep upfront haircuts\" on their loans.\n\"The dramatic deterioration in debt sustainability points to the need for debt relief on a scale that would need to go well beyond what has been under consideration to date - and what has been proposed by the ESM,\" said the report.\nThe findings of the report will be seized upon by opponents of the bailout agreement who argue it will not achieve the important goal of reducing Greece's borrowings over a reasonable period of time.\nIMF finally says what they think about Greece http://t.co/JWH2Mj9Nrm (via @ForexLive ) pic.twitter.com/NnshywvgG8\n— Fabrizio Goria (@FGoria) July 14, 2015 As Greek parties agonise over Summit Deal, IMF debt sustainability update spells out: it cannot work without partial debt write-off\n— Paul Mason (@paulmasonnews) July 14, 2015 With Greece's debt forecast to peak at 200 per cent of GDP - the ratio currently stands at around 180 per cent - the IMF says the creditors have little choice but to breach eurozone rules by forgiving some of Greece debt.\n The report will not be well received in Berlin, which opposes writing off any Greek debt.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters on Monday that the eurozone was prepared to consider some form of debt relief once the bailout deal was implemented such as extending the maturity on Greek loans but ruled out a \"nominal haircut\".\nThe updated report paints an even more dire picture of the Greek economy than an earlier report leaked days before Greeks voted against eurozone austerity measures in a national referendum.\nThe leaking of the reports will heighten suspicions the US - which is pushing for a more sustainable agreement - is pressuring the IMF to leak the reports.\nThe IMF estimates that the turmoil wrought by capital controls and a frozen banking system has added 28 per cent of GDP to the country's debt mountain. Greece's debt ratio is now set to spiral to 170 per cent of national output, rather than an earlier estimate of 142 per cent by 2022.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/FGoria/status/620924603527995392", "http://t.co/JWH2Mj9Nrm", "https://twitter.com/paulmasonnews/status/620927549712039936", "https://twitter.com/jameschessell", "http://t.co/NnshywvgG8", "https://twitter.com/ForexLive"], "published": "2015-07-15T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:11:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
