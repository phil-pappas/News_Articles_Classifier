More complex blocks such as deep-water oil fields will be auctioned off at a later date. \nEnergy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said earlier this week that the estimate was in line with international experience. \n\"We won't squander the nation's oil resources,\" he said. \nDaniel Sanchez, a Mexico-based energy expert at international law firm White & Case, told AFP that it was not surprising that big oil firms stayed out, as they will prefer to wait for the more lucrative deep-water oil auction a few months from now. \n\"It was expected that these big companies would show very little attention,\" Sanchez said. \"They came in (to the first round) to get to know the process.\" \n\"It doesn't mean that there's not interest. It means that they are well focused somewhere else.\" \nA bad auction would be another blow to Pena Nieto's administration following the embarrassing fallout of the weekend jailbreak of the country's most powerful drug lord, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, his second escape in 14 years. \n- First (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) foothold in Mexico - \nThe sharp drop in global oil prices in the past year have affected the plans of energy companies, according to analysts. \nAhead of the auction, Raymundo Tenorio Aguilar, an energy expert at the Monterrey Institute of Technology, said Tuesday's nuclear deal between Iran and world powers could be a factor. \nThe accord will eventually lift sanctions on Iran's oil exports, adding 1.5 million barrels of crude per day in the market, causing prices to fall further, Tenorio said. \n\"This weakens Mexico's ability to negotiate,\" he told AFP. \"If only half of the bids are awarded, it would be a success given the current environment.\" \n- Revive production - \nThe legislation breaks the monopoly on drilling held by state-run firm Pemex since the industry's 1938 nationalization. \nWhile Pemex qualified for the auction, it was sitting out this time. \nPena Nieto hopes the reform will reverse years of declining production -- from 3.5 million barrels per day in 2004 to 2.3 million now -- and give a boost to the economy. \nOil auctions are a new thing for Mexico and officials wanted to make them the most transparent in the world. The event was shown on a live Internet broadcast. \nAnalysts say the government made an effort to create a transparent system to ease any concerns over the country's poor track record when it comes to corruption.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T21:35:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
