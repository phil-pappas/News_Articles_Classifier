ARPUs will decline as the competition intensifies a trend that BMI believes will continue until the end of the forecast period. To keep a competitive edge operators will have to focus on investing into high-bandwidth infrastructure such as fibre and LTE but this is a capital-intensive undertaking despite the improved margins LTE at 800MHz would provide. Newcomer Ukko Mobile sees an opportunity in the LTE 450MHz market but it will need to rely on innovative service bundles if it is to stand out from the crowd.\nGet More Details on this Report and a Full Table of Contents at \nKey Data\n *  Finnish telecoms operator DNA revealed that approximately 300% more data was transferred via its 4G network in 2014 from 2013 while the volume of data transferred through its 3G network increased by around 40%.The mobile market is forecast to see subscriptions grow from 9.759mn in 2013 to 9.910mn in 2019 with numbers of 3G/4G subscriptions rising from 6.622mn to 8.230mn. This takes into account the phased rollout of 800MHz LTE services over this time.\n *  The wireline voice telephony market will continue to shrink from 750000 subscriptions to 506000 by 2019. However the fragmented nature of the market and a continued reliance on cable and xDSL in more isolated areas means that the rate of decline will slow over time. The number of broadband connections - including mobile - will reach 5.437mn by 2019.\nAbout Fast Market Research\nFast Market Research is a leading distributor of market research and business information.
