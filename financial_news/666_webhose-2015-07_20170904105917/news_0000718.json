if farmers do not have access to financial resources or services that can make them add value to the commodity, which will lead to high productivity,' he said. \nMr Kpebesaan was speaking at a two-day workshop for bank officials from the commercial banks, rural banks, microfinance, and savings and loans institutions, aimed at enhancing their understanding and interest to invest in the sector. \nThe knowledge sharing session was also to build the expertise of the banking professionals as part of efforts to improve the knowledge of finance suppliers to the dynamics in the oil palm sector and to increase investments to the sector. \nOne of the pillars of the Sustainable West Africa Oil Palm Programme (SWAPP), a Dutch Government funded project, is to ensure that oil palm growers and actors in the value chain have access to finance. \nOverall, SWAPP's goal is to improve income and livelihoods from oil-palm through increasing farm productivity and the efficiency of processing mills. \nIt again focuses on working to encourage and enable more risk capital to flow into the oil palm sector by de-risking capital investments, improving expected returns and raising awareness. \nMr Kpebesaan assured the bankers that, investing in the oil palm value chain would help secure their profit margins and a good return on their investments. \n'Those of you, who still have excess liquidity sitting on your balance sheet, go back to the balance sheet and consider diversifying your portfolios and invest into viable ventures like the oil palm sector,' Mr Kpebesaan said. \n'As a programme, we think that not paying attention to the value chain will not help us attain the result we want to achieve, and hence the inclusion of the financial institutions at this time.' \nHe said the platform would enable financial institutions to come together with Solidaridad to dialogue and understand the sector. \n'The financial institutions have resources; they are interested in investible and bankable business plans, and for various reasons these have to be done based on information available,\" he said. \nMr Kpebesaan said Solidaridad would provide farmers and other players in the value chain support to develop good business plans that could attract the banks and other financial institutions to invest in the sector. \nHe said Solidaridad would deepen the relationship with the financial institutions to enhance understanding of the sector. \n'At the level of financial institutions, we are also interested in further deepening their understanding of the sector so in the end we will form a kind of tripartite platform; ourselves, the financial institutions and the smallholders we work with so that on a more regular basis there is always a conversation at the downstream side of the event, the middle-stream side of the event, and the upper-stream side of the event.' \nMrs Rosemary Addico, Oil Palm programme Manager, Solidaridad, said oil palm growers had been relying on their own little finances to expand their plantations but this is not helping to achieve expected growth. \nShe urged the banks to take advantage of opportunities in the area of financing development of smallholder schemes, in collaboration with plantations and also financing the establishment of farm services companies. \nBesides, she said, credit could be given to artisanal mills to purchase efficient processing machines, providing credit to women groups to purchase processing machines, creating financial products to support farm rehabilitation and yield intensification activities. \n'Investors and banks must begin to invest heavily in oil palm value chain as this can allow them to push for best practice via responsible investment standards and limiting their financial services to certified sustainable companies,' Mrs Addico added. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T20:33:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
