Ndhlukula did not respond to any of the constitutional issues raised by the workers, stating merely that they were \"squatters\". \n\"This angered the workers and made them even more determined to fight the case. They filed their answering affidavit on July 13. Conolly believes that \"this is the first time the new constitution is going to be used by farm workers to uphold basic human rights, against a predatory ruling class,\" said the statement. \nDespite taking over the farm, Ndhlukula has reportedly not started any production in the farm, symptomatic of the failure of the land reform programme with vast tracks of productive land lying idle throughout the country. \n\"On July 7, Conolly went to his farm to take photographs as proof of Ndhlukula's continued contempt of the court order. \n\"Ndhlukula's tractors were parked at his house, the priming pump on the irrigation pump had been broken and Ndhlukula's workers complained bitterly that they had hardly had a cup of water to drink,\" said Ben Freeth, Spokesman for SADC Tribunal Rights Watch, Zimbabwe. \nHe added: \"Conolly confirms that no production of any sort is currently taking place, despite the fact that there is more than enough water in the dam,\" said Freeth. \nThe statement quotes Conolly saying, \"It seems that the desired outcome of the fast track land nationalisation programme - which is apparently the cessation of all production and the destruction of formal employment on commercial farms across the country - has been achieved at Centenary farm.\" \nRecently the Lands minister Douglas Mombeshora was quoted in the media saying government suggesting that it may give official permission for some white farmers deemed to be \"strategic national importance\" to stay on their farms. \nSince the onset of the chaotic land reform programme more than 4 000 white farmers have lost their farms while about 300 white farmers who are still remaining have been left with small portions.
