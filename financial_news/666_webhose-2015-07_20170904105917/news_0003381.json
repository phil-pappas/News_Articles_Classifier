Yet one of the great myths about income inequality in the U.S. is that the people who are in the top 20%, or even the top 1%, remain the same from year to year or even generation to generation.\nThe reality is that Americans move out of poverty and fall from wealth because market economies are always churning, rewarding those who deliver value in a free market, and penalizing those who don’t. America continues to be the land of opportunity. Anyone can join the 1%.\nWhat economists call income mobility continues in this country over the course of any individual’s lifetime and across generations. Being poor at any specific point in time, or being the child of poor parents, does not mean people are unable to move up the income ladder. In the same way, there is no guarantee that those at the top will stay there.\nThe usual rhetoric about income inequality focuses on how the share of total income held by the top 20% has grown while that held by the bottom 20% has fallen over the last few decades. That’s true, but it ignores the question of whether the same people are in the top and bottom from year to year.\nWould we worry about those gains and losses if everyone had some decent chance of being in the top or getting out of the bottom?\nStudies show that between 2001 and 2007, about half of the households in the lower 20% of income moved up, while one-third of the households in the top 20% in 2001 were no longer there in 2007. We see similar movement among the Fortune 500 companies. This kind of mobility has been measured for decades, and the longer the period we look at, the more likely it is that poor households will get out of poverty.\nThese results should not surprise us, as we have seen the dynamics of the economy in action over the last few decades. Companies like Facebook FB, +1.21% or eBay EBAY, +3.39% or Amazon AMZN, +3.10% , not to mention brick and mortar stores like Whole Foods WFM, +2.02% , Chipotle CMG, -0.41% , or Walmart WMT, +0.24% , are all companies that we had never heard of or were much smaller 20 years ago.\nOn the other hand, there are at least as many firms that were household names that are now gone or are mere shadows of their former selves: Radio Shack RSHCQ, +1.96% , Netscape, Borders books, Eastman Kodak KODK, +1.61% , and Blockbuster Video BLIAQ, -37.35% are a few examples.\nThis turnover is the dynamism of the market economy and it changes the fortunes of individual workers and owners every single day. It is what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the “creative destruction” of the market. That creativity does come with destruction, and many people who thought they had comfortable, assured incomes have seen those disappear over time as new people have entered the 1%.\nAll of this churning does make life less certain, but it also delivers better and cheaper goods, so that even if our incomes don’t rise a lot, falling prices due to competition make us richer.\nIncome mobility is a byproduct of a healthy economy in which firms and workers are constantly facing pressure to better serve consumers. People who come up with new and better ways to do so see their income rise and those who cannot keep up see their incomes fall.\nOne thing that prevents new people joining the 1% are interventions that attempt to prevent the losses from that churn. Political privileges like bailouts lock in inefficient firms disconnecting incomes from having pleased consumers, and undermining upward mobility and the American dream. Imagine if we had bailed out Radio Shack when their early computers didn’t sell, or Netscape when people stopped using that browser.\nWe would never have had Apple AAPL, +1.33% or Google GOOG, +3.50% and all the benefits they have brought.\nThe only problem with capitalism in America is that some people insist on getting in the way of the free market, thus limiting its power. If we leave capitalism alone and don’t tinker with it as California just did in the Uber case, it will do just fine.\nSteven Horwitz is the Charles A.
