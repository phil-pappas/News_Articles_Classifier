Freeman , July 2, 2015 Regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice will scrutinize any potential mega mergers among health insurance companies for signs of market dominance and the attendant risk of higher costs. \nAmid the merger frenzy going on now with healthcare insurers, the mere mention of one word can give healthcare leaders pause: antitrust. \nThe recent Supreme Court ruling upholding subsidies for Obamacare was like a starting gun for healthcare leaders eager to acquire competitors, but afraid to move until they knew the future of the government health plan. The 6â€“3 ruling in King v. Burwell reassured healthcare companies that 6 million Americans will be able to keep their health insurance subsidies and not suddenly fall off the rolls of paying customers. \nNow that health insurers and hospitals are haggling like floor traders on Wall Street, government regulators are preparing to play the spoiler. In the biggest potential merger of insurers, Aetna appears on the verge of buying Humana, according to a recent report from Bloomberg . Humana has been using its best feature, a large share of Medicare Advantage enrollees, to woo potential buyers. \nAnthem also made overtures recently to Cigna, which turned down the offer after speculation became public, according to the Wall Street Journal . United HealthGroup has also made takeover signals toward Aetna. \nIt is conceivable that as few as three companies could control most of the U.S. healthcare insurance market. \nHospitals also have been in a marrying mood, with 95 hospital transactions announced in 2014, according to an analysis by Kaufman, Hall & Associates . The number of transactions in 2014 is a 44% increase compared with the 66 transactions in 2010, and 2015 seems to be following the same pattern. \nHold On But all this conjoining of rival insurers and hospitals could be slowed, and some deals vetoed entirely, if the Federal Trade Commission doesn't like the idea of already dominant companies becoming even bigger. Regulators at the FTC and the Department of Justice are watching the potential mergers carefully, one official told the Wall Street Journal . If several deals happened at once, the official said, regulators would assess the collective antitrust effect rather than looking only at the merits of each individual merger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T15:47:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
