We are definitely looking to increase exports from here as we want to make it a global export hub,” Honda Cars India President and CEO Katsushi Inoue told PTI.\nHonda’s exports of auto components from India has been gradually increasing. In 2013-14, its component exports had a turnover of Rs 420 crore.\nIt ships different engine parts, forgings and transmissions along with others, which are produced at its Tapukara plant in Rajasthan to a host of global operations.\nThese include Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, UK, Brazil and Mexico. Soon, it will start exporting components to its operations in US, China and Canada.\nInoue said Honda was very much in consonance with Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s Make in India initiative.\n“Honda’s expectations from India is very high. There is a huge potential ahead…Currently it’s the fourth biggest market for us after the US, China and Japan,” he added.\nOn exports of cars from India, he said Honda will look to increase the volumes but “it will be to right hand drive countries”.\nHonda Cars India exported 8,403 units last fiscal while in 2013-14 it had shipped out 5,798 units across various markets. In the first quarter of the current fiscal, the company has already exported a total of 1,858 units.\nKeeping with its focus on exports, the company, which had recently re-launched its premium hatchback Jazz in India had started exporting the model ahead of its launch here.\nThe company also exports models like hatchback Brio, compact sedan Amaze, mid-sized sedan City and multi-purpose vehicle Mobilio.\nHonda Cars India Ltd (HCIL) exports mostly to South Africa and neighbouring countries Nepal and Bangladesh. It is exploring other options to increase the export market.\nWhile Amaze, Jazz and City are manufactured at the Tapukara facility, other models like Brio and Mobilio are rolled from its Greater Noida factory.\nCommenting on the Indian market, Inoue said: “Indian market is growing, the young generation is entering car market. It is an important market for us.”\nHCIL has set a target of selling three lakh units annually in India by 2017. Last fiscal, it had sold 1.89 lakh units in the domestic market, up 41 per cent from the previous year.\n“We are increasing Tapukara production capacity after which our total production capacity will increase from 2.4 lakh to three lakh units per annum. The enhanced capacity will be there by middle of next year,” Inoue said.\nThe company is currently investing Rs 380 crore to enhance the production capacity of its Tapukara plant from 1.2 lakh units per annum to 1.8 lakh units per annum.\nThe other facility at Greater Noida has an annual production capacity of 1.2 lakh units.\nCommenting on the 2020 plans for the company, he said: “We have already started acquiring land in Gujarat for another plant but we have not started work on it as we can still enhance production capacity of our Tapukara plant. However, Indian market is growing and the idea to set up another plant is to cater to the expected enhanced demand.”\nOn the challenges in the Indian market, Inoue said: “India is a discount market and the competition in tough. Our main focus will be to enhance customers satisfaction.”\nHe said the company will not chase volume ahead of customer satisfaction.\n“For us customer is most important. If we try to increase production very rapidly we may hurt customers …that’s not what we want, customer satisfaction is very important for us,” Inoue said.\nFirst Published on July 12, 2015 12:55 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T13:54:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
