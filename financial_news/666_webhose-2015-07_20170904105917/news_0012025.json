Those include finding the right product mix, product pricing, coping with a strong U.S. dollar, and matching production capacity to what so far this year has been rather disappointing demand.\nIn early April Alcoa AA, +0.27% predicted global aluminum demand would grow 6.5% this year, down from 9% growth in 2014.\nTo meet these challenges, Alcoa has been trimming high-cost commodity operations, selling off lower-value assets, and focusing on low-cost production facilities to more closely match shifting marketplace demand for light metals. This comes at a cost, however. The company warned earlier this week it will book a one-time charge of 8 to 9 cents a share against its second-quarter earnings to cover expenses tied to shutting down its Pocos de Caldas aluminum smelter in Brazil.\nAs for the dollar dilemma, Barclays Capital analyst Jonathan Glionna wrote last week “Given the strength of the dollar, we believe the translation adjustment required in 2Q15 could be the largest ever.” His comment took aim at all U.S. companies active overseas, not just Alcoa.\nGlionna added: “One year ago, the start of second quarter earnings season was a cause for optimism. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.03% was already up 6% on the year and EPS was poised to grow 10%. Now, the S&P 500 is up just 1% in 2015 and EPS is not growing. Still, we believe 2Q15 earnings season will be important, as it focuses attention away from macro developments and toward fundamentals.”\nAs for the fundamentals of Alcoa’s stock performance, Sterne Agee CRT analyst Josh Sullivan, in a note released last week, painted a bleak near-term picture for the aluminum industry and cut his target share price on Alcoa to $12 from $17 on concerns its stock might be fully valued. Alcoa shares promptly fell even further. On Wednesday they hit a 52-week intraday low of $10.94 a share.\nHere are some things to watch for:\nEarnings: Analysts polled by FactSet expect Alcoa to post a second-quarter profit of 23 cents a share, down from 28 cents a share in the previous quarter but up from 18 cents a share a year earlier.\nRevenue: Those same analysts are looking for $5.81 billion in second-quarter sales, down slightly from the $5.82 billion Alcoa reported in the first quarter and $5.84 billion it reported a year ago.\nShare price: After a stellar 49% advance in 2014, Alcoa’s AA, +0.27% share price got hammered. It’s down 30% since Jan. 1 and down 25% from where it was trading a year ago. That’s a poor showing when compared with a 5.3% rise in the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.03% over the past 12 months.\nOther issues: Alcoa’s struggles have attracted the bears. According to FactSet, short interest in Alcoa stands at 5.9% of shares outstanding, more than twice as many as at the start of the year.\nNonetheless, analysts have not given up on the stock. Fifty percent of those polled by FactSet still have a buy rating on the stock. And while their average price target has slipped over the past five months, it still stands at $16.34 a share. That’s a 48% premium to the shares’ $11.07 closing price on Wednesday, and an indication many on Wall Street still have confidence Alcoa can overcome short-term setbacks and make a successful transition to a leaner, more profitable competitor in the global aluminum market.\nAnalysts don’t expect much support from the underlying commodities market. Typical is a June 29 research note from J.P. Morgan Metals and Mining Analyst Michael Gambardella, in which he cut his full-year earnings estimate for Alcoa to 83 cents a share from 93 cents, citing lower 2015 aluminum price forecasts (down to 81 cents a pound from 84 cents previously) and lower than expected realized premiums in the second quarter. (FactSet data show the average full-year earnings forecast on Wall Street remains at 92 cents a share.)\nAt the same time, Gambardella said Alcoa is better positioned now to weather lower aluminum prices than it was several years ago.\n“The company has considerably grown its downstream businesses and is therefore simply less exposed to swings in the underlying commodity prices. Additionally, Alcoa has taken significant steps to meaningfully reduce its cost structure in its upstream segments so that it can now better weather weaker commodity price environments. However, we think a Neutral rating is warranted given the current valuation,” he said.\nAs for recent results, FactSet data show Alcoa topped analysts’ per-share earnings expectations in each of its past four quarterly reports. That didn’t always help the share price, however. Alcoa’s share price dropped immediately after release of the company’s last three quarterly results, reflecting primarily disappointment with either revenue, management’s market outlook, or both.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T14:15:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
