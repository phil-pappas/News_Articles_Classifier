A daily close below the 38.2% Fibonacci expansion at 1.0888 exposes the 1.0814-18 area (50% level, May 27 low). Alternatively, a move above the 23.6% Fib at 1.0980 opens the door for a challenge of the 14.6% expansion at 1. 1036. Prices are too close to support to justify entering short in line with our long-term outlook from a risk/reward perspective. With that in mind, we will continue to stand aside until a more attractive opportunity presents itself.
