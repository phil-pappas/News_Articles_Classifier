It can happen in markets where banks are taking on less risk than in the past,\" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, a strategist with Commerzbank in Frankfurt.\n\"In general, we expect the euro to fall but only in a slow manner. We will see some gains for the dollar as the Fed raises rates, but it will not happen in a big, front-loaded way as we have seen in previous cycles, the moves will be slower.\"\nTraders said there were option expiries at $1.10 and resistance at $1.1050 which would contain the euro's move.\n\"There is a bit of short-covering going on,\" said a London based trader.\nAfter a resolution, for now, of Greece's immediate problems, currency investors are easing into a summer lull with eyes chiefly on a shifting landscape for global central banks.\nThe pound and the dollar have been driven higher by growing expectations the UK and United states will raise interest rates soon. Others are still cutting, and the trend for several other currencies is lower as a result.\nNew Zealand was the only developed economy to raise rates since the 2008 financial crisis but has since returned to easing rates and a campaign to weaken its dollar. However, there have been signs of that official rhetoric softening as the currency hit six-year lows.\nDealers said the scale of \"short\" bets for further weakening helped prompt the turnaround when the Reserve Bank cut by only a quarter point on Thursday and tweaked its view on the dollar.\n\"Everyone was short, and it only took a couple of hints in the statement that they are not quite as gung ho as some people might have imagined to provoke this move,\" said a dealer with one international bank in London.\nBy 0743 GMT, the kiwi was up 1.5 percent at $0.6671 compared with the six-year low of $0.6498 on July 14.\nThe dollar was also down 0.2 percent against the yen at 123.76 yen, holding just above a one-week low of 123.57 yen touched in the previous session.\nThe dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major currencies, stood at 96.979, down about 0.5 percent on the day to its lowest in just over a week.
