Near-term trend line resistance is at 1.1100, with a break above that on a daily closing basis exposing the June 29 high at 1. 1277. Alternatively, move below the 1.0968-1.10 area (horizontal pivot, 23.6% Fibonacci expansion) opens the door for a challenge of the May 27 low at 1.0818. An actionable trade setup is absent at this point, arguing against taking a trade in line with our long-term outlook . With that in mind, we will remain on the sidelines for the time being until a n attractive opportunity presents itself.
