Such a move had not previously been expected until May or later. \n\"Carney hasn't been particularly vocal when it comes to deciding on interest rates, whereas in this instance he has, so that was always going to give sterling a boost,\" said Angus Campbell, senior analyst at forex broker FxPro. \n\"And when you consider the euro, it's still fundamentally quite a weak currency - that's going to shift sterling to the upside.\" \nThe single currency traded at as low as 69.64 pence on Thursday, its weakest in over 7-1/2 years. That help the BoE's trade-weighted sterling index to reach 94.2 , its strongest since March 2008. \nAgainst the dollar, the pound was 0.3 percent down at $1.5599. \nCarney's comments earlier in the week followed an uncharacteristically hawkish message from BoE monetary policy committee (MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) ) member David Miles, who said the idea the BoE had to wait for the Fed to raise rates was \"daft\". \nBut some strategists reckon that whatever is said in public, the BoE will not risk tightening policy, and potentially stifling growth, before U.S. rates have started to increase. \n\"If the market firms up expectations of a 2015 Fed lift-off, it can also bring forward expectations of the first UK MPC hike,\" wrote Societe Generale (Paris: FR0000130809 - news ) strategists in a research note. \n\"MPC members are sending a clear message that the time for hikes is approaching and there's less in the UK rate curve than the U.S. one.\" (Editing by Ros Russell) ))", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T02:24:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
