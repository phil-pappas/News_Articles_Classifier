Volumes on the latter more than tripled to 225 million tonnes in the first half of 2015, while swaps volumes almost halved to 88 million tonnes. \nSwap options volumes are still growing. They totalled 78 million tonnes in the first half of the year. But futures options are growing faster. Launched only in August 2014, they notched up 43 million tonnes in the first six months of this year. \nIron ore futures and option contracts on the CME are also growing exponentially, albeit not to the same volume extent as those on the SGX. \nFor a producer such as Atlas, in other words, there is an increasingly deep marketplace to find options hedging solutions to its short-term headaches. \nIt remains to be seen to what extent others follow in its tracks, although don't expect similar announcements from the big three - Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) , BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) and Vale . \nThey have the lowest costs of all, which is why they still plan to bring on more capacity to force others out. \nSURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST \nMuch will depend on whether Atlas' determination to fight on proves successful. \nAs the company noted, \"while Atlas' sales strategies provide greater certainty of price over the current quarter (and some sales in the December quarter), pricing outcomes beyond this period cannot be guaranteed and are uncertain\". \nWell, quite. \nIndeed, there is an irony here. If Atlas' hedging strategy allows it to ramp up to full production by the end of December, it will be part of the problem of oversupply and lower pricing. \nThe \"dominate and saturate\" stance of the big three means higher-cost production must be forced out of the supply chain if the market is to rebalance. \nA lot of it has left, although pinpointing how much is difficult, particularly in the opaque small-scale mining sector in China. \nBut not enough to stop prices grinding steadily lower, barring that brief June correction. \nCost displacement, so attractive in theory, has turned out to be a messy affair in reality. \nAnd Atlas will make it messier, if it escapes the abyss. \nBut this market is now all about survival of the fittest. If, like Atlas, you don't have the lowest costs, speed of opportunistic reaction is how you survive. \nIt wouldn't have been possible under the old producer-set pricing system. That it is now says a lot about how fast the iron ore market is growing up. \n(Editing by Dale Hudson)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T17:34:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
