The first half of the year saw worldwide deals worth a total of $2.3trn, the second biggest half-year total since records began. \nThere were 31 megadeals worth more than $10bn, accounting for more than a third of the total, which was the most since the dotcom frenzy in the second half of 1999, according to analysis by AP . \nSeven of the 10 largest deals since the financial crisis have been announced in the last 16 months, recent research by S&P Capital IQ has also showed. \nBiggest of all has been Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) 's £47bn acquisition of gas company BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) is the biggest deal announced so far this year, and also the largest UK-to-UK deal of all time. \nThe $80bn bid by Charter Communications (NasdaqGS: CHTR - news ) for Time Warner Cable (Xetra: T3W1.DE - news ) was the largest in the US this year. \nMajor mergers also include March's $45bn deal between Heinz , the canned goods specialist owned by Warren Buffett and Brazil's 3G Capital (Other OTC: CGHC - news ) , and rival Kraft Foods (Sao Paolo: KFGI34.SA - news ) . \nM&A volumes are being influenced by factors such as super-low interest rates, the decline in oil prices, appreciation of the dollar and shareholder pressure on boardrooms to focus on top-line growth. \nAccording to other recent research by PricewaterhouseCoopers , the M&A market is just getting warmed up. A survey by the firm found 54% of CEOs in the US plan to complete an acquisition in 2015 and, with M&A up 9% over deal value this time last year, PwC has predicted that the second half of 2015 could see even more merger activity in the back half of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T19:24:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
