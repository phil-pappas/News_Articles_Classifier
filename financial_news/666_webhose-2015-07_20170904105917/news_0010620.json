I said, ‘How do you do it? You’re a mom. You’re the best at what you do’ She said, ‘You just do. Stressing about it doesn’t help’,” Natalie Portman said.\nAnd she has discovered that parenting problems she faces as a working mother is shared by so many of her peers – male and female.\n“Most men I know are dealing with the same issues. They say they feel like if they work too hard they won’t have enough time with their families. Maybe those questions need to be asked of men, too. Maybe the men need better questions,” explained Natalie Portman.\nFirst Published on July 11, 2015 11:55 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T13:33:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
