Westpac's global head of currency and commodity strategy. Chris Hopkins by Mark Mulligan The Australian dollar dropped to new six-year lows on Monday after a decisive \"no\" vote in the Greek referendum threw the country's future into doubt.\nIn early Asia-Pacific trade, the local unit was buying US74.78¢, down 2 per cent on the same time on Friday, and its lowest level since May 2009.\nThe sell-off is part of a fresh flight to safe haven assets by investors, who fear Greeks' rejection of fiscal and structural reforms in return for European Union bailout funds could lead to financial chaos and ultimately undermine the eurozone project.\nThe Australia dollar was already under pressure late last week after a surprise 6 per cent drop in the price of iron ore, the country's biggest single export.\nThe Australian dollar has weakened 8.8 per cent this year. Greece, meanwhile, has already missed a €1.5 billion interest payment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and has billions more in bond redemptions due to the European Central Bank (ECB) in coming weeks.\nEuropean leaders appear split on whether negotiations between Greece and its EU and IMF creditors can resume after the country's resounding rejection on the latest package of austerity measures, which included higher taxes and changes to pension payments.\nThe euro dropped 1.3 per cent in early Asian trade, to $US1.09, and analysts were also expected heavy buying of Swiss francs and Japanese yen.\n\"The 'no' vote is the worst possible outcome from an uncertainty perspective,\" wrote National Australia Bank's global co-head of foreign exchange strategy Ray Attrill on Monday.\n \"It is hard to challenge the appropriateness of the euro-US dollar continuing to trade sub-$US1.10, the Aussie south of US75¢, and the Aussie-yen [trading] sub-¥92 on sharply higher market risk aversion,\" he said.\nMonday's focus in Greece will be the banks, which have been shuttered for a week against panic withdrawals after gradual depletion of their deposit bases this year.\nFurther capital controls are inevitable, despite their devastating impact on economic activity.\nHowever, it was unknown on Monday morning whether the ECB would continue to extend emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) to the banks in return for collateral.\nThe ECB's governing council was expected to meet on Monday to decide on how to deal with the unfolding crisis.\n\"We would expect the ECB's governing council to shut down ELA at the latest by 20 July,\" wrote Barclays' London-based economics team.\n\"Assuming that all of the pledged collateral at the ECB is recorded at close to par on Greek banks' balance sheets, and that the current average haircut on collateral is 50 per cent, then retention of the collateral by the Eurosystem would translate into a more than €30bn loss for the banks,\" it wrote.\n\"This alone would wipe out shareholders' equity.\n\"The Greek central bank will eventually need to print its own currency in order to inject new liquidity and capital,\" Barclays said.\nNow read why the battle over Greek debt is far from over.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T04:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T04:05:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
