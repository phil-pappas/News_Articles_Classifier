Courtesy of NewSouth Books There's a skull in a bowler hat on the cover of activist artist Ron English's latest book. Inside, his first sentence reads: \"I was once kidnapped by a deranged, knife-wielding artist who demanded I look at his work.\"\nNeither image nor sentence is any less or more astounding than anything else in the life and work of this subversive American painter who, here, faces the final question – is death what gives all art meaning?\nEnglish is your go-to man if you want to see Western culture, corporations and icons sent up rotten. Marilyn Monroe? Why not apply Mickey Mouse heads to her breasts? The Simpsons? Give them skeletal jaws.\nThen there are the billboards that have brought English fame and infamy as he has appropriated the massive posters and used them to lampoon brands such as McDonald's, Coke and Camel cigarettes. His lurid work has featured in films, magazines, books, television and galleries.\nAmerican artist Ron English: \"I'm more interested in promoting people who are marginal.\" Courtesy of NewSouth Books But English, for all his counter-culture mien, studied photography at university and is a skilled painter. This latest collection of work, Death and the Eternal Forever , features several of his skilfully rendered reworkings of Picasso's Guernica, the Spanish artist's 1937 protest against war. English writes that for him, Guernica \"is a modern template, just as the Madonna and Child is an ancient template\".\nThere is also a series of opulent canvases with winged cherubs and creamy-fleshed lovers – all wearing black and white Kiss-style make-up.\nIn an interview from his New York state studio with AFR Weekend 's multimedia reporter Jessica Sier, Illinois-born English says: \"There have been some who are suspicious of my sincerity because of my prowess; they thought if it were cruder it would be more sincere.\"\nHe also says, \"You probably get more from my work if you have an art history degree but I'm always aware of the classist nature of our society. A lot of people only produce art for the blue bloods but I'm more interested in promoting people who are marginal. I'll have a drink with a homeless wino and then put him on a billboard, make him into a kind of celebrity.\"\n Death and the Eternal Forever , by Ron English, Korero Press, distributed here by NewSouth Books, $49.99.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T20:39:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
