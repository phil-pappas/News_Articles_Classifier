This way, TDS deducted against your income is linked to your PAN and can be viewed and verified from your Form 26AS.But what happens if the deductor fails to deposit TDS or has deposited it against an incorrect PAN?The income tax department will only allow you to claim TDS in your income tax return which is mapped to your PAN and is reflected in your Form 26AS.Several tax payers have been aggrieved with this situation where the employer or another deductor deducted TDS but did not deposit with the govt which leads to disallowance of TDS in the tax payer's return and a subsequent demand for paying tax received by the tax payer.The CBDT has recently released a circular directing its assessing officers to check the facts of the case and not put tax payers at an inconvenience where there is default in depositing tax by the deductor.In case TDS has been deducted from your income and has not been deposited -* Maintain proofs of your TDS deductions from sources such as payslips, Form 16, Form 16A* You can write a clarification to the AO with the details of the matter* If you have received a demand you can raise a rectification requestTDS & PANIts important to understand how TDS is linked to your PAN. TDS deductions are linked to PAN numbers for both the deductor and deductee. If TDS has been deducted from any of your income you must go through the Tax Credit Form 26AS. This form is a consolidated tax statement which is available to all PAN holders. Since all TDS is linked to your PAN, this form lists out the details of TDS deducted on your income by each deductor for all kinds of payments made to you - whether those are salaries or interest income - all TDS linked to your PAN is reported here. This form also has income tax directly paid by you - as advance tax or self assessment tax. Therefore, it becomes important for you to mention your PAN correctly, wherever TDS may be applicable on your income.
