We believe these moves will also undermine competition in the industry by making it harder for smaller players to break through and challenge larger banks.” \nMr Osborne introduced the bank levy in 2010. Since then, he has raised it nine times , from the original level of 0.05pc to its current 0.21pc. \nUnder the latest plans, the levy will be cut to 0.18pc next year, before falling gradually to 0.1pc in 2020, at which point it will be restricted to UK assets. \nHSBC and Standard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) have major global units affected by the bank levy, which has made it harder for them to compete with foreign-based banks operating in the same countries. As a result, both lenders have discussed moving their headquarters out of the UK . \nThe levy changes offer some reprieve to those big international banks, but will not be as big a help for those with a focus on the UK. \nAnalyst Chirantan Barua, from Bernstein Research, expects Barclays to be the hardest hit of the big banks. And he does not expect HSBC to be satisfied by the changes. \n“For HSBC, there was no positive news to be had from this budget. 2021 is too long a duration for a political promise to base your strategic domicile on. The pressure to relocate has actually increased today,” Mr Barua said. \nMoreover, the new 8pc tax will be levied on banks with profits above £25m and is expected to affect roughly 200 lenders. By contrast, the bank levy applied to around 30 banks. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in challenger banks fell sharply on Mr Osborne's announcement. Virgin Money’s shares tumbled 10pc, Aldermore’s dived 12.2pc and Shawbrook Bank’s stock slid 9.6pc. \nThe 8pc tax will also be a headache for banks which have made big losses in recent years, because it will not allow them to bring forward those losses to offset the tax burden. \nHistorically, if a bank made a loss one year, but a profit of the same size the following year, it would pay no corporation tax over the two-year period. In March, the Chancellor cut that relief in half. \n“Eight months ago a bank which made losses last year may have thought it had no tax to pay in 2016. Since then they’ve seen that rate go up to 10pc and now 18pc,” said Deloitte’s Wayne Weaver.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T22:02:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
