PUBLISHED: 10:53, Sun, Jul 19, 2015 | UPDATED: 11:07, Sun, Jul 19, 2015 GETTY Tread carefully when it comes to your money One levy that is often overlooked is capital gains tax, which Osborne barely mentioned in his emergency Budget two weeks ago. HM Revenue & Customs actually raises more money from CGT than inheritance tax. It collected a hefty £3.9billion from CGT in 2013-14, against £3.4billion from IHT. If you do not tread carefully, you could end up handing 28 per cent of your capital gains to the taxman. Could your family’s wealth be at risk from Britain’s forgotten tax? Hidden danger: If you hold shares or investment funds outside of a pension plan or tax-free Individual Savings Account, you may be liable on your gains when you sell. You could also face a demand if you sell expensive belongings such as jewellery, paintings or antiques for £6,000 or more. The growing number of Britons who own buy-to-let properties or second homes could suffer a major CGT shock. Jeremy Edwards, associate partner at advisers Martin-Redman Partners, says: “The big danger comes when you sell several assets in the same tax year, as all your gains are added together.” CGT is charged at 18 per cent if you are a basic-rate taxpayer, rising to a whopping 28 per cent for higher-rate taxpayers. Remember, this is only charged on the profits after the cost has been deducted. If a capital gain lifts you into the 40 per cent tax band for that year, you will pay 28 per cent on the proportion of your profit that falls above that threshold. Fortunately, everybody can make profits of £11,100 in the current tax year before paying CGT, £22,200 for couples. But the bills can still be severe for large capital gains. Financial planner Graeme McColgan of MillionPlus Financial Planning says: “A higher rate taxpayer who makes a gain of £100,000 would pay CGT at 28 per cent on £88,900, giving a liability of £24,892.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T12:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T08:29:55.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
