ADVERTISEMENT “In our four years, this is the 10th action we’ve taken against companies in this space for deceiving consumers,” Cordray continued.\n“We will remain on the lookout for similar conduct and will address it as we find it.” \nCitibank must provide $479 million in consumer relief to about 4.8 million consumer accounts for deceptive marketing or retention practices. \nThe bank also must pay approximately $196 million to nearly 2.2 million consumers who enrolled and were charged for credit monitoring products even though Citibank didn’t provide all of the promised services. \nIn addition, Department Stores National Bank, a Citibank subsidiary, must provide about $23.8 million in consumer relief to about 1.8 million consumers for charging expedited payment fees on delinquent accounts. \nCitibank and its subsidiaries will pay $35 million in civil money penalties to the CFPB. \nFrom at least 2003 through 2012, Citibank actively marketed and enrolled consumers in five debt protection add-on products, which promised to cancel a consumer’s payment or balance or defer payments if the consumer experienced certain hardships, such as job loss, disability and hospitalization. \nCitibank also marketed and sold other add-on products that offered credit-monitoring or credit report-retrieval services as well as a service that notified credit and debit card issuers if consumers reported a card lost or stolen. \nThe announcement comes on the fifth anniversary of the Dodd-Frank financial law that created the CFPB, which many Republicans want to overhaul.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:33:18.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
