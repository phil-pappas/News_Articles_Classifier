While Sir Howard's report is not binding to the government, it's a huge blow for Gatwick. \nThe government is not expected to respond to the report until later this year and the BBC reports that the Prime Minister's office is saying it won't make a \"snap judgement.\" \nLocal residents at both airports have opposed expansion plans by the Airport Commission's report recommends several measures to lessen the impact of a new runway at Heathrow, such as banning night flights and an aviation noise fine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T10:38:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
