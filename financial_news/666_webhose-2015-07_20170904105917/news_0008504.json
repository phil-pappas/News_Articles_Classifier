Peter Braig Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jenny Wiggins\nFormer competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel has called on governments to consider privatising water assets as well as power assets to reduce the costs of owning capital-intensive infrastructure.\nMr Samuel, who chaired the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission between 2003 and 2011, will on Monday tell a symposium in Sydney hosted by industry group Infrastructure Partnerships Australia that water services and infrastructure such as pipes, desalination plants and dams do not need to be owned by governments.\n\"There is no logical reason why governments need to own the maintenance companies that maintain the supply of water to customers,\" Mr Samuel told The Australian Financial Review ahead of the symposium.\n\"They don't need to own the companies that install the pipes, they don't need to own the pipes, they don't need to own the dams â€“ they can all be owned by the private sector under carefully constructed contracts which properly allocate the risks between the government and the private sector.\"\nMr Samuel acknowledged the potential sale of water companies remained a \"very, very sensitive issue politically\" but claimed consumer concerns could be overcome, pointing to the Kennett government's privatisation of electricity assets in Victoria in the 1980s and the current Baird government's privatisation of electricity networks in NSW.\n\"It requires leadership and communication to explain to the public at large what it is that's being done and what the outcomes will be. The outcomes in terms of electricity in Victoria have been as promised and have been to the benefit of consumers, particularly with competition between retailers,\" Mr Samuel said.\n\"There is no reason why [water] retailers can't be privately-owned and can't have the unforgiving disciplines of competition imposed upon them.\"\nActive shareholders won't tolerate inadequate management or boards of directors, Mr Samuel added. \"If that means that some water retailers languish and potentially fail, then they'll be taken over by those that are efficient and successful.\"\n Brendan Lyon, Infrastructure Partnerships Australia's chief executive, said water policy tended to be ignored until there was a crisis such as a drought, but argued that it was \"inevitable\" that governments would sell some $100 billion in urban water assets over the next two decades.\n\"There's a growing acceptance in the community that change needs to happen, because states don't have the money they need for major mass transit and broader infrastructure investment,\" Mr Lyon said.\n\"These are valuable assets and exactly the kind of businesses that lend themselves to super fund investment, because of the long-term stable returns.\"\n\"After electricity assets are leased, water should be the next cab off the rank but that means we have to get going now on the right structures and incentives in place\"\nPrivatisation of water assets is more complicated that the privatisation of electricity assets because structures have not yet been established to introduce competition or price regulation under either public or private ownership.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennywiggins", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/117166018980952797102"], "published": "2015-07-26T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:06:32.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
