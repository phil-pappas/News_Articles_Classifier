Wide differences exist in the quality of both issuers and lenders, the report contends, with issuer due diligence, verification of collateral, and creative transaction structures being the linchpins on which prudent asset backed lending relies.\"Above all else, consistent success in this business requires a sound, disciplined and repeatable investment process anchored on risk mitigation,\" writes Howe.\"It's a philosophy ingrained in Old Hill Partners since our founding in 1996.\" Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T14:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T10:22:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
