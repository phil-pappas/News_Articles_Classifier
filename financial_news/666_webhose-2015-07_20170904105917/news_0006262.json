There was some risk aversion overnight.”\nThe dollar index that gauges the greenback against a basket of currencies was up 0.2 percent at 97.569. It fell 0.71 percent on Tuesday, its biggest single-day fall since June 17, partly on poor U.S. company results.\nWeaker commodity prices supported a mild rebound in the dollar.

On Tuesday, BoJ Governor Kuroda suggested no more quantitative easing would be needed given his view on inflation rising due to a tight labor market.\nThe yen was little changed versus the dollar at 123.95 yen , while the euro fell 0.3 percent at 135.03 yen.\nCommodity currencies, including the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollar, which have been hit by the dollar’s rally in the past month, were still on the back foot.\nThe kiwi fell 0.8 percent to $0.6576, a shade above six-year lows set last week, with focus turning to a Thursday meeting of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand that is expected to cut interest rates at least a quarter point.\n 22, 2015 7:37 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T14:19:04.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
