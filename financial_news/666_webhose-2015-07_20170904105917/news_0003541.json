The satellite provider has been unwilling to strike a reasonable deal with the local content provider. On Wednesday, July 22 at 7 p.m. subscribers will no longer be able to watch programs like Local 4 News, NBC's Today, NBC Nightly News, The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon, Saturday Night Live, The Voice, The Blacklist, Sunday Night Football and more. \n\"We've been trying to negotiate a deal so our loyal viewers will be able to continue watching their favorite programs,\" said Local 4 vice-president and general manager Marla Drutz. \"WDIV has made fair agreements with many other providers over the years and has never been taken off the air. In good faith, we've done everything we possibly can, on our end, to try and work this out with DISH.\" \nDISH charges its subscribers a monthly fee to get these programs, so essentially their estimated 127,000 Detroit area customers will not be getting what they pay for. That includes important local news and weather information in emergency situations from the Local 4 News team. \nWDIV and its parent organization, Graham Media Group, has launched the website www.savemychannel.com , to make it easy for DISH customers to learn more and to tell the satellite provider that they wish to continue receiving Local 4 and NBC. The site includes shareable social media posts, as well as alternative ways to continue watching the station's content while the negotiations continue. \nAbout WDIV-TV Local 4 WDIV-TV Local 4 is honored to be recognized as Station of the Year by the Michigan Association of Broadcasters.
