Everything from quick calls, set-up, your dialing, good data experience, fast download, your YouTube and WhatsApp work. All of these work together for a great customer experience.” \nAt the Labadi-Beach-1 site, efforts are being made to build more cells sites to help reduce the pressure on existing cell sites. \nThis is crucial in ensuring that subscribers in densely-populated areas have the best connectivity possible. \nThe telecoms company however continues to bemoan the high rate of battery theft in the sector. The current energy crisis the country is experiencing has led to increased demand for batteries as an alternate source of power. According to Tigo some 900 batteries amounting to about 1 million dollars have been lost to theft in this year alone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T02:15:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
