More Gasfield fight exposes Israel faultlines \nSouthern fighters, backed by Saudi air strikes, continued to push against Iran-allied Houthi lines in the northern suburbs of the city on Tuesday, according to city residents. \nThe confrontations came after Houthi shelling in the strategic city killed at least 47 people on Sunday, according to Yemen’s Riyadh-based government in exile. More than 3,600 people have died during almost four months of air raids and civil war in the country, the UN said on Tuesday. \nThe government, led by ousted president Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, had claimed that Aden had been “liberated” from the Houthi fighters and military units loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who have gradually consolidated control of the city since arriving in March. \n“From Aden we will retake all of Yemen ,” Mr Hadi vowed in a speech broadcast to coincide with Eid celebrations late last week. \nMembers of the exiled government arrived in Aden last week, accompanied by cohort of Saudi special forces operatives, the first time Riyadh has put boots on the ground in its campaign to oust the Houthis and restore Mr Hadi to power. \nThe UAE, which has also deployed special forces to assist local resistance against Houthi forces, last week confirmed that an army lieutenant had been killed while serving with the Saudi-led coalition, its first tacit acknowledgment that its servicemen were on the ground in Yemen. On Tuesday, it said another non-commissioned officer had been killed during operations there. \nDespite the celebratory language coming out of Riyadh — local media in Saudi Arabia presented the initial victory Aden as a sign that the Houthi-Saleh alliance would soon collapse — residents of Aden told Reuters fighting continued to rage, while the Houthis have vowed to retake the city. More video \nOn Sunday, they fired mortars into the city while battling to retain control of the northern Dar el Saad and Sabr districts of Aden, residents said. Fighting was also reported in the central Crater district, where Houthi cells continue to operate. \n“There is still a lot of fighting,” said a resident of Aden who fought with the irregular Southern Resistance militias that prevented Houthi and Saleh loyalist fighters from completely seizing the city. \nReinforcements trained in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Gulf arrived in mid-July, along with weapons supplies and armoured vehicles, helping to turn the momentum of the battle against the Houthis. \n“They will not take Aden again but we will need to do more to push them out finally, and to get them out of the south,” the resident added. \nWith the ambitions of most of the anti-Houthi fighters limited to the south, Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners from other Sunni states face a challenge in achieving a nationwide victory. \nMany of those fighting in Aden, including Saudi-trained forces largely drawn from southern regions, are calling for the dissolution of the 1990 merger between north and south Yemen. Q&A \nWho are Yemen’s Houthis? \nThe rapid rise of the militia group has unnerved many in the region. \nContinue reading \nSeveral people who have fought in Aden and are in close contact with those co-ordinating the campaign told the Financial Times their primary aim was to secure territory up to the 1990 boundary line before calling for independence, rather than continuing to Sana’a, the capital, as Mr Hadi and the Saudis say they plan on doing. \nRiyadh sees the Houthis as an Iranian proxy akin to the Lebanese group Hezbollah. \nKing Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud and his son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the defence minister, have staked their reputations on ousting the Houthis in a destructive war that aid agencies say is bringing the Arab world’s poorest country to the brink of famine. \nBut it has taken them more than three months to produce results on the ground, and then in the southern part of the country, where opposition to the Houthis — and, more broadly, northern Yemeni power — is at its highest. \nAnalysts say the coalition will struggle to produce similar victories in central Yemen, where the Houthis and Mr Saleh enjoy the support of some of the population, and in the northern highlands, the source of their main base of support.
