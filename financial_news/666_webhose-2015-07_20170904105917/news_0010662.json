It is also hiring vessels for five years now compared to three years earlier to benefit from the lower rates, he added. \nEven with these discounts, the oil services firms are flooding in. Singapore's Swiber, which bagged three contracts from ONGC worth a total of nearly $800 million this year, says profit is its main driver. \n\"In the short term, I strongly believe that India will be one of our anchor regions for us to focus on,\" said Darren Yeo, deputy group chief executive officer of Swiber. \n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in SINGAPORE and Rafael Nam in MUMBAI; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Miral Fahmy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T00:19:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
