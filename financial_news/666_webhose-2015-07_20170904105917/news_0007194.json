We hope this will spur other companies to join in and do the same.\" \nJapan's government issued a formal apology to American POWs in 2009 and again in 2010. But the dwindling ranks of POWs used as slaves at mines and industrial plants have so far had little luck in getting apologies from the corporations who used them, sometimes under brutal conditions. \nSome 12,000 American prisoners were shipped to Japan and forced to work at more than 50 sites to support imperial Japan's war effort, and about 10 percent died, according to Kinue Tokudome, director of the U.S.-Japan Dialogue on POWs, who has spearheaded the lobbying effort for companies to apologize.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T01:49:13.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
