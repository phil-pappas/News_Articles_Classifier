We will continue to resist unreasonable increases in utility and fuel prices and other such policies and measures that undermine our efforts to improve the living standards of the working people of Ghana and their families.' \nWages Mr. Asamoah said the Union would not accept any reduction in real wages. \nThe IMF called for a 'front-loaded fiscal consolidation,' including a reduction in real wages. \n'We would like to reiterate our position that the TUC will not accept any reduction in real wages. \nGiven the overall economic hardship prevailing in the country, the TUC Council finds it unacceptable that government would agree to reduce real wages despite the sacrifices public sector workers are making, he indicated. \nBy Cephas Larbi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T14:07:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
