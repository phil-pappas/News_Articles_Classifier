Lisa Wiltse by Claire Stewart This content was generated in commercial partnership with Westpac Group as part of the 100 Women of Influence Awards.\nWhose fault is it that fewer people of different cultures , genders , skin colours or religions are getting into senior ranks in businesses than are white, middle-class, middle-aged men?\nIt's an unsettlingly stereotypical picture, but diversity remains a \"catch phrase\" for many company bosses who aren't sure how to combat unconscious bias or implement inclusive practices to push marginalised high achievers up the ladder.\nLawyer and former British army negotiator, Rabia Siddique, says part of the responsibility lies with the individual, to get to the top without forsaking what makes them unique.\n\"Sometimes it's about saying, 'well this is the culture that I have to operate in, but I'm not going to change or be apologetic for that, I'm actually going to be who I am, but I'm going to be excellent at who I am',\" she said.\nMs Siddique, a non-practising Muslim, says people need to be comfortable in their own shoes, be clear about their values and what drives them and make sure their actions are in harmony with that, which brings the confidence to be different.\n\"People smell artificiality and fakeness a mile away … [But] it's also about recognising the reality of the environment we're operating in, so it becomes about tempering our need to be true to ourselves and not denying the qualities that make us who we are.\"\n'Honest, open, upfront' When talking to Muslim aspiring leaders, she tells them the responsibility \"rests with us\" to ensure they are included at the table.\n\"We need to be honest and open and upfront. People have got questions, concerns … people are nervous. There is a lack of understanding and it's up to us to start the conversation.\n\"But that also takes more of us to be involved, to step up and to have a voice. How is a white middle-class man to know that you don't shake the hand of a practising Muslim woman?\n\"By getting it out and on the table, it means people can relax, get beyond the religion, the cultural differences, and move on,\" she says.\nEqually, Westpac's director of women's markets, inclusion and diversity, Ainslie van Onselen, says it is the responsibility of management to consciously include individuals who might otherwise be marginalised, in meetings and decision-making.\n\"The latest research shows you can hit employee engagement out of the park by focusing on both inclusiveness and diversity,\" Ms van Onselen says.\nCombined focus delivers best engagement \"A Deloitte study found while people can feel very engaged in a workplace with high inclusion but a low commitment to diversity, compared with those in a workplace with high diversity and low levels of inclusion, it is the combined focus on both that will deliver the highest levels of engagement.\"\nInclusive environments can be anything from a sporting team to a business, where members share an affinity with those around them. But without diversity, where individuals feel valued for the uniqueness they bring to the table, the most innovative ideas won't materialise.\n\"If you can achieve the magical combination of inclusion and diversity you get productivity benefits, longer retention of employees and better chances at attracting the best talent,\" Ms van Onselen says.\nWestpac is rolling out an Inclusive Leadership and Behaviours program to its senior leaders.\nSo can employees make it to the top without becoming a mirror image of the people who promote them? Yes, Ms van Onselen says, if leaders are taught to actively include them.\n\"We encourage chairpeople to adopt a round-robin approach, to ensure inclusivity in the meeting, so everyone has a voice, and encourage respectful divergent opinions.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:05:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
