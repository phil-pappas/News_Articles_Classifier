For the longer term, we need to check our perspective to reacquaint ourselves with the role that fixed income plays in our portfolios. It may be a source of stability or liquidity.” More Headlines Mobile Banking Still Harbors Some Dangers, But Is It Safe Overall? \nRising interest rates would cause the value of long- and intermediate-term bond funds to plummet, says Thomas Walsh, an investment analyst in Palisades Hudson Financial Group’s Atlanta office. However, there's still plenty of opportunity for income in shorter-term, floating rate, and inflation indexed bonds. \n“With most of your fixed-income portfolio, KISS -- Keep It Short and Simple,” he says. \nWalsh advises that investors place at least 60% of their fixed-income portfolio in short-term certificates of deposits, money market funds and high-quality short-term bond funds with an average maturity of about two years or less. If you're in one of the higher tax brackets, you can use short-term tax-free funds. \n“Asset allocation remains a driving factor in overall return,” Diehl says. “You and your advisor may choose to make opportunistic shifts in various fixed income sectors, but timing the fixed income markets is as inadvisable as timing equity markets. A better approach may be to make sure that you are adequately diversified within the fixed income allocation in your portfolio.\" \nIn Walsh's view, that involves investing in alternatives to basic short-term funds. If you can take a bit more risk -- and that's the most important caveat -- Walsh advises investing up to 40% of your fixed-income portfolio in “non-vanilla” income funds. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T09:14:46.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
