The lenders, which own Walter’s first-lien bonds and loans, want to take ownership of the company as part of the reorganization, two people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg on Wednesday.\nThe steering committee representing Walter’s creditors has shifted in the last three months. It now comprises at least six investment firms: Ares Management, Apollo, Caspian Capital Management, Fidelity, GSO and KKR, the people said.\nGSO’s influence over the group has grown as it’s bought more of the loan, and Franklin Resources Inc., which had been part of the steering committee, cut its stake, said the three people with knowledge of the matter. KKR, meanwhile, replaced Cyrus Capital Partners after the distressed-debt investment firm sold most of its first-lien position, said the people.\nDraft Agreement Walter, which last generated an annual profit in 2011, has been discussing a reorganization since April as it struggles with a $3.1 billion debt load amid the worst downturn for coal in decades. Prices of metallurgical coal have been undermined by excess supply and slowing demand from China.\nWilliam Stanhouse, a spokesman for Birmingham, Alabama-based Walter, declined to comment. Representatives for Ares, Caspian, Cyrus, Fidelity, Franklin, GSO and KKR declined to comment. A spokesman for Apollo didn’t respond to telephone and e-mail messages. A spokesman for Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, the group’s restructuring counsel, and a spokeswoman for Lazard Ltd., its financial adviser, also declined to comment.\nThe creditors, who’d become owners of a reorganized Walter, are set to submit a draft restructuring agreement to the company that sets out cost-savings targets, said the people. It proposes to cut mine workers’ hourly pay and limit their overtime, temporarily idle at least part of one coal mine in Alabama, and reduce pension contributions, the people said. The company would need to negotiate those proposals with representatives of the mine workers unions before they could be approved.\nFunding Operations The lender group owns a majority of Walter’s $1.95 billion of first-lien debt, said two of the people.\nThe senior lenders want Walter to file for bankruptcy by July 15, when the grace period on a $19 million interest payment due to junior bondholders ends, people with knowledge told Bloomberg on Wednesday. The company elected to miss the June 15 interest payment as it negotiated with creditors, it said last month.\nIn exchange for approving their plan, the creditors are offering to back a loan that would fund the company’s operations during the bankruptcy proceedings, the people said Wednesday.\nEach of Walter’s three bond obligations ranking below its first-lien debt trades at less than 10 cents on the dollar. Its $450 million of 8.5 percent unsecured notes due April 2021 fell nearly 0.8 of a cent to 3 cents on Tuesday, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\nThe company’s $970 million of 9.5 percent first-lien notes due October 2019 traded at 55 cents on Wednesday, Trace data show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T22:04:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
