The decline could be an ominous sign of what's to come when the Fed starts raising rates later this year. \nThe MBA's Weekly Mortgage Applications survey shows its Market Composite Index, which measures mortgage loan volume, declined 4.7% on a seasonally adjusted basis. The volume of refinancings fell off more sharply than new home purchases: The Refinance Index, which measures refinancing volume, declined 5% to its lowest level since December 2014 while the Purchase Index dropped 4%. \nAll of this came as budding homebuyers grappled with higher mortgage rates: The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.2% - its highest level since October 2014.
