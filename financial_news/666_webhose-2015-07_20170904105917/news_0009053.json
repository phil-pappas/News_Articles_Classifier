It came despite recent unprecedented efforts by the Chinese government to prop up equities that have slumped since mid-June. \nMcGillian said that demand fears had pressured the oil market. \n\"The plunge in Chinese stocks revved up concerns economic growth might be slowing down,\" he said. Traders were anticipating a decline in energy demand \"particularly in China\" and worried about \"the record production levels you see across the world.\" \nJoseph George, an analyst at Schneider Electric (Swiss: SNE.SW - news ) , noted that the US oil rig count increased last week for the third time this month, by 21 to 659. \n\"US producers continue to drill at the fastest rate in three decades despite lower prices,\" he said. \"US production has yet to show signs of a substantial fall and oil markets remain oversupplied.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T22:57:55.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
