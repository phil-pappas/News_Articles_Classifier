The CBA allows contract extensions to most contracts up to one year before the current contract expires.\nThe Jets, in that mode, are in negotiations with captain Andrew Ladd on an extension. Progress has been made on a contract but there is some work to be done. Expect a six or seven-year deal for Ladd.\nAgent Ben Hankinson says he and the Jets have discussed veteran Dustin Byfuglien -- like Ladd, entering the last year of his contract -- but negotiations have not yet begun.\nThe Jets are also now free to discuss extensions for Jacob Trouba, Mark Scheifele and Adam Lowry, whose entry-level deals will expire next summer.\nAgent Pat Morris told the Free Press this morning he doesn’t expect Stempniak to return to Winnipeg.\nRick Curran, agent for Tlusty, said he has spoken with the Jets and the two sides will talk again in the coming days if Tlusty is still on the market and the Jets still have a need for him.\ntim.campbell@freepress.mb.ca\ngary.lawless@freepress.mb.ca\nLive Blog NHL free agency Report Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund History Updated on Wednesday, July 1, 2015 at 11:42 AM CDT: Updates with full writethru", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T19:44:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
