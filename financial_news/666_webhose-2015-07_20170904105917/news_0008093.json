In contrast, big summer discounts failed to lift spend on clothing.\" \nVisa Europe said spending fell by a monthly 0.8 percent in June, after a similar-sized decline in May, although the survey compilers said the monthly measure tended to be volatile. \nConsumer morale surged to a more than 15-year high in June as shoppers said they were ready to spend, according to market research company GfK. \nMost economists and the Bank of England expect British economic growth will quicken from the 0.4 percent quarterly expansion seen in the first three months of the year.
