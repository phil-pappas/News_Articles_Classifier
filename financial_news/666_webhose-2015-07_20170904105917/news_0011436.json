The agreement split the country's ruling party, with the prime minister warning that the stringent measures would unleash new pain on a population already suffering from the worst downturn in any developed nation since World War II.\nEuclid Tsakalotos, Greece's finance minister, leaves the finance ministry building in Athens on Thursday.

Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas told state television: \"All bank branches will be open\".\nThe reopening would ease but not eliminate the hardship that Greeks have endured for weeks as their banking system flirted with ruin. Greeks would still be limited to withdrawing 60 euros ($88) a day from their accounts but they would not need to line up at ATMs every day to do so. Instead, the daily limit would be cumulative, meaning savers could wait a week and withdraw seven days' worth of cash in one go.\nA pedestrian look at newspaper front pages hanging outside a magazine kiosk in central Athens on Thursday.

That process could take several weeks.\nAlexis Tsipras, Greece's prime minister.

Only days ago, Greece was confronted with the threat of a euro-zone exit if it missed that crucial deadline. But in a midday news conference, Mr Draghi suggested that Greece's membership in the currency club was no longer in doubt.\n\"Our mandate is to act based on the assumption that Greece is and will be a member of the euro area,\" Mr Draghi said.\nNot everyone was so bullish. In Finland, the government gave its backing to fresh loans for Greece, defying predictions that it could emerge as a hard-line holdout. But finance minister Alexander Stubb said creditors will be watching carefully to see if Greece actually implements the belt-tightening measures it has promised.\n\"We need the political will of the Greek government, which still seems to be a little bit lacking,\" Mr Stubb said. \"The prime minister says that he doesn't actually believe in the program that we've been working on for so long.\"\nGreece's leaders say there's good reason for that, accusing Europe's political heavyweights of using economic blackmail to try to force the country's radical leftist government from office.\nEven with the bailout deal solidifying, the Greek government's position remains highly precarious. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras won parliamentary support for the agreement in the wee hours of Thursday morning. But it came at a heavy cost to his own party, Syriza, with dozens of members bucking his will. Mr Tsipras had to rely on his political opponents to ram the measure through Parliament.\nThe mutiny confronted Mr Tsipras with hard choices over how to handle his one-time allies. He huddled with top advisers for hours on Thursday evening amid reports that he was preparing to purge the dissidents. That didn't happen, but it still could in the coming days.\nMr Tsipras will ultimately have to decide whether to try to muddle along with a fractured government, reach out to his opponents to forge a broader coalition or resign and call new elections.\nIn the strongest signal yet that that last option is a real prospect, Greece's interior minister, Nikos Voutsis, predicted in a radio interview that a new vote could be held as early as September - just nine months after Syriza came to power.\nGovernment spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis played down expectations that new elections could come even sooner. While acknowledging a \"notable breach\" in party unity, he said Mr Tsipras would not step down before he finalises the bailout deal with creditors.\n\"The main priority of the prime minister and the government is to successfully conclude the agreement,\" he said.\nWashington Post", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/greece_updated_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-17T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:20:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
