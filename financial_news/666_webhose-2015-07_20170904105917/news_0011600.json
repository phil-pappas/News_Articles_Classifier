David? \n\nDavid Reis, Stratasys Ltd. - CEO [3] \n\nThank you, Shane, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call to discuss our second quarter results. The second quarter represented a continuation of a challenging market environment we began to observe in the first quarter. We believe that during 2013 and 2014, our Company and the industry experienced an extraordinary period of growth, driven by the positive synergies that result from the merger between Stratasys and Objet in 2012, as well as by heightened level of mainstream media attention that the industry enjoyed during that period. \nWe believe that our industry is now transforming through a period of slower growth, as usual to digest the recent investment in 3-D printing and expense capacity utilization. Despite these headwinds, we are encouraged by areas of sequential improvement in our business, and remain confident -- sorry -- remain convinced of our long-term potential over our industry. \nSupporting our view, we recently completed two events, including one with our channel partners in Europe and one with our Stratasys direct manufacturing customers in North America, where excitement around the industry future and the potential of our revolutionary products remain high. Additionally, sales within the channel remain strong and several of our high-end production systems have shown signs of improvement after a slow first quarter. \nWe are beginning to see tangible results, which reaffirm our strategy of developing target solutions within key market verticals, and recently announced a major collaboration for our Solidscape product line in China, which presents significant potential for our future expansion. Short-term, we'll continue to make adjustments to align expenses with current market conditions. However, we remain committed to our long-term growth initiative that includes enhancing vertical solutions capabilities, expanding customer support services, accelerating product development, and enhancing our sales and marketing infrastructure. \nLater in the call, I will return to provide more detail on these developments and our strategy moving forward. But first, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO and COO, Erez Simha, who will review the detail of our financial results. Erez? \n\nErez Simha, Stratasys Ltd. - COO and CFO [4] \n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. The growth experienced during the second quarter compared to Stratasys' historical growth rates is a reflection of the overall market weakness and a slowdown in sales across most regions and business units when compared to last year. \nAfter analyzing the results from the first half of this year, we believe we are moving through a period of market stabilization that is marked by slower growth as user expense capacity and utilization. Total revenue in the second quarter increased by 2% to $182.3 million when compared to $178.5 million for the same period last year, and was up approximately 6% sequentially. \nOn an organic basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, revenue growth was down 10% when compared to the same period last year or down approximately 5% on a constant currency basis. Our core business, excluding MakerBot and Stratasys direct manufacturing, was up 1.3% in the second quarter of the last year, and up approximately 8% when compared to the first quarter of this year, as we have begun to observe some recovery in our high-end production system sales. \nThe lower growth experienced in the second quarter was primarily due to the slowdown in hardware sales as well as negative growth in Asia-Pacific region and for MakerBot. MakerBot product and service revenue declined by 57% in the second quarter of last year, driven by the overall market weakness, as well as by ongoing challenges associated with the restructuring of this business. \nNon-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $8 million or $0.15 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net income of $28 million or $0.55 per diluted share reported for the same period last year. Product revenue in the second quarter decreased by 13% to $134.5 million as compared to the same period last year. \nWithin product revenue, system revenue decreased by 21% in the second quarter over the same period last year, with the decline driven primarily by weaker MakerBot system sales as well as overall market weakness, as discussed previously. Consumables revenue grew by 6% over the same period last year, [up] 13% on a constant currency basis, in line with our revised expectation for the year. \nServices revenue in the second quarter increased by 96% to $47.8 million, as compared to the same period last year. The increase in services revenue was driven primarily by the revenue contribution of Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies, which were acquired during the third quarter of 2014 and not included in the previous year's results. Within service revenue, customer support revenue, which includes the revenue generated mainly by maintenance contracts on our systems, increased by 17% compared to the same period last year. \nThe Company sold 6,731 3-D printing and additive manufacturing systems during the second quarter, and on a pro forma combined basis, has sold a total of approximately 136,000 systems worldwide as of June 30, 2015. Unit sales in the second quarter relative to prior periods were impacted by lower MakerBot unit sales, as well as the overall impact of the market factors we have outlined previously. \nWe are observing signs of recovery in our high-end production systems, led by sequential sales improvement in our Fortus line. This includes positive market reception for the new Fortus 450 MC, which performed ahead of plan in the second quarter. Additionally, we have seen sequential improvement for our recently introduced Connex line of column multi-material 3-D printing. Most notably sales of our Solidscape line of 3-D printers grew significantly during the quarter, driven by the initial orders of our recently announced collaboration in China, which David will discuss in more detail later in the call. \nNon-GAAP gross margins declined to 54.7% for the second quarter compared to 59.8% in the same period last year. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded sequentially when compared to the first quarter gross margin of 54.1%. The decrease in gross margin over last year resulted primarily from the impact of inclusion of Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies. \nGross margins for product revenue was flat in the second quarter compared to last year, and improved sequentially over the first quarter of this year, driven by a sales mix that favored our high-end systems. Operating expenses increased by 23% to $96.1 million as compared to the same period last year. Net R&D expenses increased by 28% to $22.5 million in the second quarter over last year's, driven by the inclusion of crowd card expenses, increased headcount, and an overall acceleration in system and material product development. \nCompared to the first quarter of 2015, net R&D expenses declined 8%. SG&A expenses increased by 22% to $73.6 million in the second quarter over last year, primarily due to the inclusion of Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies operating expenses. Sequentially, SG&A expenses increased 5% compared to the first quarter of 2015. \nWe will [save] the tax benefit of $4.8 million in the second quarter compared to effective tax rate of 3.8% for the same period last year. Our tax expenses were impacted by losses incurred in high tax jurisdictions that were offset by taxable income in low tax jurisdictions. \nThe following slides provide you a breakdown of our geographical sales for the quarter, which reflects an emerging new [travel returns] in North America. The outlook for the remainder of the third quarter of 2015 is for continued improvement in North America and Europe, with an expectation of continued market headwinds in Asia-Pacific/Japan region. driven by tough macroeconomic conditions. \nNon-GAAP EBITDA for the second quarter amounted for $12.1 million. Company used $15.6 million in cash from operations during the second quarter and currently holds approximately $502.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits. Our cash balance includes cash from $175 million drawdown on the Company's revolving credit facility. \nWe incurred significant one-time cash and non-cash charges during the second quarter related to post-merger integration activities and Company reorganizations. Capital expenditures amounted to approximately $30.4 million in facility and equipment investment, primarily driven by new office facility in Israel. \nInventory increased to $137.4 million as compared to $131 million at the end of the first quarter of 2015, representing a 5% increase over the first quarter. [Account] a favorable decrease to $137 million, representing a 4% decrease as compared to $142.4 million at the end of the first quarter, while DSO and 12 months trailing revenue was $65 million compared to $67 million at the end of the first quarter. \nIn summary, we observed some sign of sequential improvements versus the first quarter of 2015, although our second-quarter results were lower than expected across most geographies and industries, compared to growth level experienced historically. We are observing signs of recovery in certain regions and are cautiously optimistic about sustained improvement in North America and Europe. However, we expect the Asia-Pacific region as well as sales at MakerBot to remain a headwind for the duration of the third quarter. \nWe will continue to make adjustment to our operating expense and to align with changes in current market environment. Longer-term, however, we remain committed to our growth initiative and investment plan. \nWe remain well-positioned to respond to an acceleration in demand while improvements in overall market conditions. We believe that we have a strong balance sheet and are making the appropriate investments in strategic initiatives, and building infrastructure to help accelerate our growth moving forward, and that we are on the leading edge of our exciting industry. \nI would now like to turn the call over to our VP of Investor Relations, Shane Glenn, who will provide you greater details on our updated 2015 financial guidance. Shane? \n\nShane Glenn, Stratasys Ltd. - VP of IR [5] \n\nThank you, Erez. Due to the Company's limited visibility regarding the timing of improvements in growth, the company Has withdrawn its previously delivered financial guidance and, instead, is providing financial guidance for the third quarter of 2015 as follows. \nTotal revenue in the range of $175 million to $190 million, with non-GAAP net income in the range of $1.5 million to $7 million or $0.03 to $0.13 per diluted share; GAAP net loss of $27 million to $22.5 million or $0.52 to $0.43 per share. Non-GAAP earnings guidance excludes $18 million of projected amortization of intangible assets, $9.5 million to $10 million of share-based compensation expense, $7 million to $8 million in nonrecurring expenses related to acquisitions, and includes $6 million to $6.5 million in tax expenses related to non-GAAP adjustments. \nFinally, at this time, we are not modifying the following long-term goals for the Company's operating model, which include annual organic revenue growth of at least 25%, non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of sales at 18% to 23%, non-GAAP effective tax rate of 10% to 15%, non-GAAP net income as a percentage of sales of 16% to 21%. Appropriate reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are provided in a table at the end of our press release, providing an itemized detail of the non-GAAP financial measures. \nNow I'd like to turn the call back over to David Reis. David? \n\nDavid Reis, Stratasys Ltd. - CEO [6] \n\nThank you, Shane. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we believe that the extraordinary growth that Stratasys and our industry enjoyed during 2015 and 2014 was driven in part by the synergies that result from the Stratasys and Objet merger in 2012, as well as from heightened level of media attention observed during the period. During this period, our customers' capacity went through a dramatic expansion. \nNow, the industry near-term growth is likely being impacted as end markets digest capacity and increase their utilization. Despite these near-term challenges, we see no indication of fundamental change in the attractive market opportunity within our industry, and we are encouraged by the sequential improvement we are observing in the areas of our business. We continue to believe that our industry is poised to transform manufacturing, engineering, and design processes across a wide range of spectrums, and will be driven by vertical solution development and further penetration into advanced manufacturing applications. \nWith our strong pipeline of potential future opportunities and our position of leadership within the industry, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities as they will develop. As mentioned earlier, we are committed to our strategic investment plans that we unveiled early this year, which is designed to support the future growth of our business and sustain our leadership position. \nThe multiyear investment plan, focused on enhanced vertical industry solutions, extended customer support services, building enhanced sales and marketing infrastructure, and accelerated product development. all designed to support potential annual revenue of $3 billion in 2020. To reiterate, we see no change in the long-term opportunity for our industry, and observing enthusiasm and interest from both our channel partners and customers. \nWe recently host 239 of our Stratasys direct manufacturing customers in Nashville, Tennessee at the first SDN Summit to introduce the combined SDN organization as a total solution provider that focuses on application from prototyping to production. At the event, strategy manufacturing experts from our SDN group conducted seminars, workshops and one-on-one meetings with key accounts. Additionally, a recent EM channel partner event -- sorry, channel partner event -- was attended by CEOs and sales executives from 41 Stratasys European resellers. \nThe event was the first channel partner meeting at our new Stratasys EMEA headquarters in Germany that features workshops sharing best practice for vertical market marketing and growing the material and service businesses. Most of those events were well-attended, and the feedback from customers and channel partners was positive, reinforcing our optimistic long-term outlook. \nWe made multiple enhancement to our overall channel and go-to-market strategy during the quarter -- strengthening our presence in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria through the acquisition of the key German channel partner, RTC Rapid Technologies; making enhancement to our North America channel for Stratasys product line with addition of W.D. Distributing and with WYNIT. \nFor MakerBot, we announced the expansion of the central breaker presence to over 600 stores following the successful pilot program; recognized the MakerBot channel in Europe -- sorry, reorganized the MakerBot channel in Europe and Asia to better leverage the existing Stratasys go-to-market infrastructure within those regions. And finally, recently FISHER/UNITECH, a top Stratasys reseller, announced it is now carrying our MakerBot brands of products. \nIn addition to those go-to-market developments we are beginning to see tangible results with new customers and applications. The Chinese government has a multi-decade plan for growing and employing high skilled workforce, and has committed publicly to promoting 3-D printing as a driver force in China future manufacturing development. \nThis initiative represents a significant opportunity for Stratasys. And we are pleased to have recently announced the collaboration for our Solidscape product line with the Kangshuo Group in China to provide Solidscape 3-D printers for application relating primarily to custom jewelry manufacturing. This agreement provides Stratasys with opportunity to play a major role in creating the largest network of service bureaus and innovative center in China that would target application from custom jewelry manufacturing using our Solidscape brand of products. \nOur Solidscape line of high precision 3-D printers product produce wax patterns that are ideal for those wax investment casting and mold-making applications. These patents meet high standards in surface finish, accuracy, and material castability, while eliminating the need for significant postprocessing. The multiyear collaboration includes providing up to 1,000 Solidscape high precision 3-D printers to equip multiple new service bureaus and innovate expenses within China, as well as opening of manufacturing facility by Kangshuo for the family of Solidscape 3-D printers for the domestic Chinese market. \nAlso included in the agreement is a plan to supply China 3-D printing education initiative with significant quantities of Solidscape 3-D printers. We believe this marks the most comprehensive 3-D printing collaboration to date in China, and will help drive significant (technical difficulty) education utilizing our Solidscape product lines. \nAnother area of recent success within -- is within the dental market, where we are observing growing adoption that we believe validates our strategy to focus on this exciting vertical. Our customer, a leading manufacturer of clear orthodontic liners, recently announced a 30% expansion of its fleet of Objet Eden500V 3-D printers, and now prints 100% of its custom-made orthodontic aligners utilizing Stratasys PolyJet 3-D printers in several dental fields. \nOur PolyJet technology provides our customers with the ability to efficiently manufacture custom aligners on that scale with optimized workflow, faster production and shorter lead-times. We believe that our customer adoption of 3-D printing technology is indicative of potential significant expansion within dental verticals, including the other adoption of our Stratasys PolyJet-based solution for reduction of custom-made orthodontic products. \nOur vertical business unit strategy is designed to capture these opportunities. And we made significant operational enhancement, including key personnel additions, during the second quarter, as we believe we further enhance our ability to address dental application and provide solutions to this vertical moving forward. \nIn summary, while we are disappointed with our second-quarter results, at this time, we see no indication of a change in the fundamental growth drivers for additive manufacturing, and we believe the long-term opportunities remain very promising. We are encouraged by areas of sequential improvement in our business and remain optimistic about our long-term growth prospects. \nWe believe our industry is transitioning through a period of slower growth as users digest their investment in 3-D printers and expand the utilization of recently acquired capacity. While we remain confident in our long-term market perspective in light of the current growth environment, we're making adjustments to better align expenses with current market conditions. \nFinally, we are confident that our investment plan and our growth strategy will enable us to put greater focus on long-term vertical and manufacturing related applications, such as dental and the recently announced Solidscape collaboration, which further positions the Company to capitalize on future growth opportunities, and helps solidify our leading position in additive manufacturing and 3-D printing. \nOperator, please open the call for questions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T08:36:32.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
