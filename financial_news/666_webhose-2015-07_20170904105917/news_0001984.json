The government doesn't allow them to open shorts in stocks... So they're shorting everything they can,\" added the trader.\nThe euro zone's uncertain future following the Greek referendum has also weighed on sentiment, spurring businesses exposed to product demand from Europe to dial down demand expectations over the near to medium term.\nChina's own declining economic growth rate has also played a role, with steel makers and heavy industry needing less raw materials, leaving industrial metals vulnerable to short-term pressure.\nAnd some questioned Beijing's ability to pull off any major stimulus programme akin to that in 2008 which helped engineer a broad recovery in commodity demand in the wake of the global financial crisis.\n\"I don't think the government currently has the capability again to spend too much after 2008. It's heavily in debt,\" said Wang Li, a consultant at CRU Group in Beijing.\n(Additional reporting by Manolo Serapio Jr in MANILA and Melanie Burton in MELBOURNE; Writing by Gavin Maguire.
