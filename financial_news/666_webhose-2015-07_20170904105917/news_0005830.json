Those practices are at the heart of Japan's worst accounting scandal in five years. \nThe executives - including Tanaka, Vice Chairman and former president Norio Sasaki and adviser and former president Atsutoshi Nishida - strongly pressured Toshiba divisions in emails and meetings to meet budget targets, worsening the accounting improprieties, the source said. \nA company spokesman said he could not comment as the panel's report has not been released. \nThe company said on Friday the independent panel, hired by Toshiba after the irregularities emerged in April, will report its findings to the company on Monday, and Toshiba would announce them on Tuesday. \nAs one measure to prevent a recurrence of the problems, Toshiba is considering naming an outsider to head its Audit Committee, said a Toshiba official familiar with the matter. \n(Additional reporting by Yoshiyasu Shida; Writing by William Mallard; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T10:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T11:37:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
