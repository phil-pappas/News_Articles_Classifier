Jessica Hromas Share on twitter by Joyce Moullakis Securities dealers that traded through the now defunct BBY are feuding with the rebranded Asia Pacific Prudential Group, accusing the firm of failing to release client data and attempting to steal their customers.\nSeveral of the dealers, who cleared and settled trades through BBY up until its collapse, have been unable to secure data up until June 30 so that clients can reconcile their positions and lodge tax returns. The stoush has potential implications for self-managed superannuation funds, investor franking credits and capital gains tax, and those seeking to lodge a portfolio valuation for the fiscal year to determine their ongoing pension payments from superannuation.\nBBY was placed in voluntary administration on May 18 , when it failed to repay a loan to St George Bank after falling short of capital requirements. The firm's big push into options trading and clearing, and an illiquid holding in Firestone Energy were part of its demise. A report by administrator and now liquidator of several BBY entities KPMG, has since found among other shortcomings that BBY may have been trading insolvent since June last year.\nKPMG also executed a sale agreement between AIMS Financial Group and several BBY entities, meaning that some employees and operations were restored. AIMS dropped the BBY name and rebranded the business Asia Pacific Prudential. Where the grey area exists is whether the sale included the client lists of as many as 31 firms who were using BBY to clear and settle trades.\nThe spat indicates that the fallout from the collapse of BBY is ongoing due to a shortfall in client money accounts. Some client funds remain frozen and creditors may receive zero to 24Â¢ in the dollar.\nHead of securities at Advamode Greg Bax said Asia Pacific Prudential had not released requested end of fiscal year client data despite several requests. He also hit out at the fact that several Advamode clients had been offered discounts of 20 per cent on brokerage with Asia Pacific Prudential, even though the firm was now clearing elsewhere.\nRelationship definition \"This is an obvious deliberate attempt to poach clients from former broker dealers of the once BBY,\" he said, noting that BBY was a clearing and settlement partner meaning the client relationship stood with Advamode.\n \"In any case its information clients should have a right to, as they need to consolidate their financial positions for the year . It's clearly the guys at the top that are not releasing the data.\"\nAdvamode has more than 100 clients and first requested the information from Asia Pacific Prudential on July 1, when it confirmed what was required by back-office firm Agility for the release.\nBut Asia Pacific Prudential chief, Craig Mason, said the firm was transferring the data on request from individual clients, not firms, to be mindful of privacy matters.\n\"Legally we would have no issue to act on a client's instruction,\" he said.\n\"We are being extremely diligent about who we share information with.\" In relation to the discounts offered to woo clients Mr Mason said: \"There may have been a potential overlap with a handful of individuals that may have caused a storm in a teacup.\"\nHe said as part of the sale agreement Asia Pacific Prudential received details of 10,000 clients of securities dealers that traded through BBY, some of which had multiple accounts.\nDirector at New York Securities Collin Vost said many clients were in a bind over their reporting requirements.\n\"No one is doing anything about this, the reality is they are stonewalling in the hope it will go away,\" he said.\nAnother securities dealer that declined to be named said: \"That will be a question [tax statements] to be answered for us in coming weeks.\n\"The bigger issue for us is that we still have clients with funds frozen.\"\nThe latest revelations come as the corporate regulator released a statement relating to Firestone.\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission said the Waterberg Coal Company and 45.9 per cent controlled entity Firestone had both paid $33,000 penalties in relation to continuous disclosure obligations.\nBBY was majority owned by executive chairman Glenn Rosewall and his father, former tennis great Ken Rosewall.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/joycemoullakis"], "published": "2015-07-27T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:10:26.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
