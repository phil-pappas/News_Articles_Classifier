These are expected to result in pre-tax profits being between £120m and £150m lower than expected this year. \nThe firm's only profitable and healthy business, the Parsons Brinckerhoff consultancy, was sold in October 2014. While the cash helped to strengthen Balfour's balance sheet, I suspect this sale may seem short-sighted in years to come. \nOf course, it's possible that Balfour will prove to be a successful contrarian buy, outperforming Carillion over the next year. \nIt's possible, but I'm not convinced. Here are three reasons why I'd be inclined to sell Balfour and buy Carillion at today's prices. \n1. Value \nBalfour looks too expensive. In my view the current share price already factors in a successful recovery. \nBalfour currently trades on a 2015 forecast P/E of 25, falling to a P/E of 15.3 for 2016. In contrast, Carillion trades on a forecast P/E of 10.4 for 2015, falling to 10.0 in 2016. \nAlthough this implies that Carillion's growth is likely to be limited next year, I'd rather take this risk than expose my money to Balfour's toxic cauldron of loss-making contracts. \n2. Income \nGrowth may be plodding at Carillion, but the firm's shares offer a well-covered 5.2% dividend yield. \nCarillion's dividend has risen every year since 1999, climbing by 344% from 4p per share, to last year's level of 17.7p per share. \nIn contrast, Balfour's dividend was cut by 60% from 14.1p to just 5.6p in 2014. A further 45% cut to 3.1p is forecast by analysts for 2015. Balfour also cut its payout in both 1999 and 2000. \nCarillion's slow and steady approach may be boring, but it has been very profitable for long-term shareholders. \n3. Profitability \nEven during the good times, Balfour Beatty's operating margin didn't make it much higher than 3%. As we've seen over the last two years, this leaves precious little room for errors or unexpected problems. \nIn contrast, Carillion's mix of infrastructure and support services is more profitable. The firm's operating margin has average 4.3% since 2009 and was 5.4% in 2014. \nIt's a simple choice \nFor me, it's there's no contest. I'd be happy to put my money into Carillion's well-run and stable business, but will continue to avoid Balfour Beatty. \nIf you already own shares in one of these companies and are looking for new income opportunities, you may want to check out \" How To Create Dividends For Life \" before you make any trading decisions. \nThis exclusive Motley Fool report contains details of a simple, 5-step dividend test that could help you spot 'dangerous' dividends which are likely to be cut. \nThis report is FREE and without obligation, but it could save you a lot of money . \nTo receive your copy immediately, click here now . \nRoland Head has no position in any shares mentioned.
