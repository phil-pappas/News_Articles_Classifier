Below are the worst ten in the sector. \nBut sometimes the stocks that have dropped the most are the best busy. So, TheStreet paired each of these tickers with TheStreet Ratings to let you know if you should buy, sell, or hold these best performing stocks.

Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nRating: Buy, B- Year-to-date return: -14.6% \nPitney Bowes Inc. provides technology products and solutions in the United States and internationally. The company operates through Small and Medium Business Solutions, Enterprise Business Solutions, and Digital Commerce Solutions segments. \nTheStreet said: \"We rate PITNEY BOWES INC (PBI) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, notable return on equity and expanding profit margins. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had generally high debt management risk by most measures that we evaluated.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: PITNEY BOWES INC reported significant earnings per share improvement in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past year. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, PITNEY BOWES INC increased its bottom line by earning $1.48 versus $1.41 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($1.90 versus $1.48). The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Commercial Services & Supplies industry. The net income increased by 80.4% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $44.67 million to $80.61 million. The company's current return on equity greatly increased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of significant strength within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Commercial Services & Supplies industry and the overall market, PITNEY BOWES INC's return on equity significantly exceeds that of both the industry average and the S&P 500. The gross profit margin for PITNEY BOWES INC is rather high; currently it is at 63.03%. Regardless of PBI's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, PBI's net profit margin of 9.05% compares favorably to the industry average. PBI, with its decline in revenue, slightly underperformed the industry average of 1.0%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 5.0%. The declining revenue has not hurt the company's bottom line, with increasing earnings per share.
