You’d be surprised to know that companies even hire people who specialize in the traditional file processing systems to make sure that everything is not only put into place, but can be easily accessed in the future.

This doesn’t mean that you would no longer have any use for your dependable printing solutions. Obviously, there are times when it is adamant to print certain files. The term “ paperless office ” has been around for decades, but it’s only now that people are starting to make the transition. In an article by Andrew Reichman, they’ve found out that there’s 74% of cost reduction when files are stored in the cloud. Recommended for You Webcast: Answers to the Top 10 Email Marketing Questions \nA great 85 percent of businesses still document in paper form—which is honestly quite surprising considering the big leaps in technology evolution in recent years, and the popularity of the “green” movement. What companies don’t realize is that adopting a paperless system can save hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. \nExpenses of traditional filing racks up because of the sheer amount of material needed for it to continuously operate. There is a constant need for filing cabinets, a multitude of a variety of paper, ink, toner, postage, folders and storage space to name a few. Looked at individually, you’d think these items would not cost much. But when you put it all together—along with labour costs of filing, it can actually add up to a small fortune. \nTo give you a small idea regarding the costly amount needed to operate traditionally, let me paint a picture of numbers. According to Efficient Technology Inc.’s “ Achieving the Paperless Office ”, “if every person filed just five forms per day, companies can lose roughly $12,000 a year in labour cost; for a company of 50 people, that’s $600,000 a year.” A big hefty price that still doesn’t even include errors in filing like rejected, lost, or misfiled document costs. \nMore than the high cost of traditional filing, there are also discrepancies about its environmental concern. Every year, the world produces a whopping 300 million tons of paper. If people reduced the demand for paper, we’d be able to save more trees. On top of saving trees, we also reduce exposure to the amount of hazardous heavy metals, non-renewable oils and damaging volatile organic compounds that are found in inks and toners. \nIn fact, in a recent study conducted by Fuji Xerox of Australia and IDC, respondents who had begun the process of converting documents into electronic formats rated digitized documents as nearly 14 percent more effective than their counterparts that had no plans to digitize their data. \nCompanies around the world who are going with the “paperless office” are now trying to survive the transition from traditional to digital when it comes to filing. There are so many available digital storages that offer quite a number of advantages that make companies’ data storage safer and easier to input, search and/or access. But just as with anything, having a “paperless office” also garners a number of disadvantages. It’s just up to companies to make the choice on continuing with the more costly traditional filing system, or evolve more towards the digital age.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T08:13:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
