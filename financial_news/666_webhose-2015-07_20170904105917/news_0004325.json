Share on twitter by Ruth Liew Australia's biggest independent fund manager, Perpetual, has experienced its worst single quarter of outflows in at least three years, but chief executive Geoff Lloyd denied any loss of funds under management was to do with the imminent departure of head of equities, Matt Williams.\nInstead Mr Lloyd said the poor performance of markets during that time was the biggest factor behind the drop.\nThe quarter coincided with a torrid period for Australian shares. Perpetual on Wednesday revealed that funds under management up to June 30, shrank to $30.2 billion from $34.7 billion in March.\nOf that, $1.7 billion was lost to falling markets. Net outflows for the period were recorded as $1.6 billion and of that, $1.4 billion came out of equities. The rest was from cash and fixed income funds.\nPerpetual suffered extensive outflows the last time leadership of its investment team changed hands when former head of equities John Sevior resigned in 2011 after 17 years at the group. Mr Williams' departure was announced in February. At the same time, Paul Skamvougeras was named as his successor. Its funds have been growing in the interim.\nMr Williams leaves in September.\n\"I'm completely confident that it has nothing to do with the handover of the head of equities,\" Mr Lloyd told Fairfax Media. \"Equally, Matt handed over running money in March to Paul and the team, so he hasn't been running money since March.\"\nShares down Shares of Perpetual sunk 6.6 per cent on Wednesday's update, to close at $45.60.\nUp until the June quarter statement, Perpetual had delivered seven consecutive quarters of net inflows into its funds since September 2013, reversing a trend of net outflows since it started quarterly reporting of funds under management in late 2011.\nIn the December 2011 quarter it lost $900 million, coinciding with the confirmed exit of Mr Sevior, who began his own boutique investment manager, Airlie. Mr Sevior was on an extended break from his role ( first reported in May 2011 ) before his departure was officially sealed months later.\n\"It's not because we've lost a client or mandate,\" Mr Lloyd said of the leakage in funds under management. The company ruled out any client losses during the period and hinted at a change in attitudes towards the sharemarket after a rewarding run. \"It could be for anything to do with their view on asset allocation across asset classes.\"\nThe CEO said \"for clients, it's been a second great year of great distributions\". The fund manager released $1.2 billion back to clients.\nThe head of equities role at Perpetual was one of the most coveted and prestigious stockpicker jobs in the Australian market.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Ruth_LiewAFR"], "published": "2015-07-15T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T17:03:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
