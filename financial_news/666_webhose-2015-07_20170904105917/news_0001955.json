To put the dollar amounts in perspective, consider that the Treasury took in a total of $12.7 billion in estate tax revenue in 2013.\nDavidson, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., died at age 86 in 2009. He made his fortune in glass and auto products with Guardian Industries, was a noted philanthropist, but best known as team owner of the Pistons, the W.N.B.A.’s Detroit Shock and the N.H.L.’s Tampa Bay Lightning.\nIt was two years ago that his estate took the IRS to U.S. tax court to challenge the assessment of additional taxes. The agreement is outlined in a stipulated decision in Estate of William M. Davidson released this week. Here is the breakdown of tax deficiencies: $187 million in gift taxes, $152 million in estate taxes, and $49 million in generation-skipping taxes. There’s also a $133,000 gift tax penalty bill. Note: no estate tax penalties were assessed.\nPay attention: the valuation issues that derailed billionaire Davidson’s estate plan could affect yours. (Credit: Dan Lippitt/NBAE via Getty Images)\nThere were two main issues that led to the deficiencies. The IRS said the estate undervalued corporate stock and improperly valued self-cancelling installment notes (SCINs). As to the stock, the IRS said that the estate low-balled the value of privately held Guardian stock held in trust for Davidson’s children and grandchildren. You always need to pay attention to valuations of assets like privately-held stock or real estate or art for gift and estate tax purposes.\nAnd as to the SCINs, they are legitimate tax planning devices, but there’s wiggle-room in how you structure them. The IRS called into question the calculations used and said Davidson was essentially making taxable gifts he should have reported. The IRS takes a tough stance on how you value the notes and what you have to do to establish that it’s a fair exchange of assets for the notes, says Andrew DeMaio, an estate lawyer in Red Bank, N.J. “In a sense, it’s a loss for the estate planning community in that we don’t get a ruling on these SCIN valuation issues,” he says.\nIt’s not just billionaires who face these battles, but multi-million-dollar estates with hard-to-value assets and those that take advantage of legitimate but cutting edge estate planning techniques like SCINs.
