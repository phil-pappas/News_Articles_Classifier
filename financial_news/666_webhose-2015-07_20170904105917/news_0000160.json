Sam Bennett by Pauline Vamos Recent suggestions for a review of the superannuation and retirement incomes system are rightly being resisted by the government. What the superannuation system needs after many years of change is a degree of stability, together with a bedding-down of the many reforms already in train.\nOver the past five years there have been five substantial reviews that have been wholly focused on the superannuation system or have had the potential to affect it significantly.\nThe Cooper review of superannuation, the Henry review of taxation, the Ripoll inquiry into financial advice, the financial system inquiry and the current tax white paper have all had, or will have, significant implications for superannuation. In addition to these, there have been Treasury-led reviews of specific issues such as retirement income regulation and governance, transparency and competition and some changes that have come through the budget process.\nFrom these reviews there have been a substantial number of reforms to the system that have been implemented only recently, are in the process of being implemented, are being legislated or are yet to be fully considered. There is still a lot going on in the regulations and rules and prudential standards that affect superannuation.\nSubstantial changes The changes arising from these reviews have been substantial and accordingly have had a significant impact on superannuation fund members and the industry. The impact on the economy is not known yet.\nFrom the Cooper review came the MySuper default product and SuperStream. MySuper has been in operation for only 12 months and, among other things, required the creation of new low-cost superannuation products. MySuper needs to be given enough time to operate and be tested as a policy that provides the best outcomes for default members of superannuation funds. SuperStream is also a significant reform, changing the way the back office of the system operates, requiring substantial systems changes for all participants in the system, including employers and payroll houses.\nFrom the Ripoll inquiry and future of financial advice came the defining of intra-fund advice end of life commissions in group superannuation and the beginning of the process of higher professional standards in financial advice. The structural impacts of these reforms are still working their way through the industry. The government is still working on its full response to the recommendations in the FSI but we have seen a response to governance.\n The ability to assess the impact of reforms is becoming easier. Improved reporting to the Australian Taxation Office now means that the detail of all superannuation accounts is contained centrally and the increase in reporting to APRA from 300 data bits to more than 3000 also means not only greater transparency but great ability to identify trends and issues. The data quality still needs to be improved before a full analysis can be made.\nImportant factor Changes do not just affect individual superannuation fund members and the industry, but the economy as a whole. MySuper, with its focus on low-cost investment and outcomes for fund members, might have an impact on asset allocation. The tension between returns and low-cost superannuation and how this plays out in MySuper asset allocations is an important factor for investment in the economy and it will take time to see how the changes affect the investment of the $420 billion in MySuper accounts.\nWhile some of these reforms have made the system simpler and better for consumers, it is the constant change that is a killer of confidence. Consumers regularly report changes to the superannuation system as having a negative impact on them making additional contributions. There is also a causal link between speculation about future changes to superannuation and voluntary contributions. The greater the volume of speculation, the lower the contributions. Confidence is affected.\nWe are fortunate that the Australian public are not only accepting of compulsory superannuation but actually embrace it and see it as something to be proud of. Visitors from the United States and Europe are amazed at the widespread acceptance and support for compulsory superannuation in Australia. This is something we must protect and enhance if we are to ensure people contribute more than the minimum to their superannuation.\nWhile the system can always be improved, any changes should be minimal and arise from the extended tax white paper process already in train. Let the reforms and reviews already in place and under way run their course before we consider more wholesale changes to what is still the best private pension system in the world.\nPauline Vamos is chief executive of the Association of Superannuation Funds Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T11:04:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
