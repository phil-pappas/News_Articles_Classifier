But Platinum CIO Andrew Clifford is calm in his resolve that buying China shares is the right move now despite views the Chinese government has lost control of its free-market share market experiment.\nAttempts to stymie the share market rout , firstly with interest-rate cuts by China's central bank at the weekend and recently with stock purchases by state-directed funds, appear to have failed.\n\"I can't disagree there's been a misjudgement here, but I can tell you about the companies and what they're worth and the prices we're paying for them,\" said Clifford, who like many market watchers marvelled at the ill times efforts to bolster the share market by buying shares.\n\"This is like 2000 when technology stocks got sold off and the rest of the market got cheap. This is a time when you need to be buying the rest of the market and not selling it,\" Clifford said.\n Platinum is one of a small handful on investment firms in Australia with a license to buy an allocation of China A Shares. AMP Capital has a listed investment company which invests in the China A shares market â€“ that fund trades at a close to 30 per cent discount to its net tangible assets.\nFar from sifting through the bargain-basement bin, Clifford is focusing on the large market capitalised companies, particularly among insurance, consumer and internet companies.\nCurrently Platinum has around 10 per cent of its Asia fund and 8.5 per cent of its international fund invested directly in China A Shares. In total Platinum had 37 per cent and 23 per cent exposure to China through its Asia and international funds respectively via Hong Kong and NYSE-listed China shares.\nChinese stocks among the top 10 positions in Platinum's Asia fund include PICC Property & Casualty Co, China Mobile, (NYSE-listed) Baidu, China Pacific and Kweichow Moutai.\nFinancial stocks dominate the share register of AMP Capital's China Growth fund with local brokerage businesses accounting for the investment firms most prominent active positions.\nWhile Clifford admitted to harbouring some concerns relating to the timing of share buying of state-directed funds, he noted investing in more established developed markets were not without the same risks.\n\"The world's biggest markets are interest rate markets and I'd put it to you that every one of them is artificially set by a central bank somewhere in the world,\" Clifford said.\nThe issue for investors is in China is how much worse will this will get, he added.\n\"This is an unusual situation but we are very confident of the value and what we own there and we will just ride through,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T13:03:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
