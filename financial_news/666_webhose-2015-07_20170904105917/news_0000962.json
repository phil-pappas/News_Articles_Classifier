Photo: Rob Homer\nThe new financial year has started to get busy with an anticipated $2 billion-plus of asset sales being completed in the next few months, as investors chase higher-yielding bricks and mortar over the volatile sharemarket.\nOne of the latest is by LaSalle Investment Management, which has raised $91.9 million through the sale of the office at 19 Harris Street, known as Nokia House, in Pyrmont.\nThe seven-storey A grade office was sold on behalf of the LaSalle Asia Opportunity Fund IV to a client of UBS Grocon.\nThe LaSalle fund bought the asset in December 2014, as part of a six-asset portfolio transaction from Lend Lease.\nAdvertisement LaSalle regional director of asset management Simon Howard said the fund was pleased to have generated such strong returns on this investment over a relatively short period of time.\nMr Howard said the fund was the fourth in a series of opportunity funds launched by LaSalle for the Asia Pacific region, focused on building a diversified portfolio of assets in Australia, China, Japan and South Korea.\nOverall, LaSalle, which has been active in the Australian market for many years, currently manages US$7 billion in real estate assets in the Asia Pacific region. The sale was brokered by James Quigley of Colliers International.\nThe sale comes as the German property group Union Investment Real Estate, advised by Eureka Funds Management, is said to be the front runner for the former Australian Red Cross building at 155 Clarence Street in Sydney.\nPrice expectations are said to be between $135 million to $140 million.\nAccording to JP Morgan's Richard Jones, aside from the $7 billion Investa Office Fund portfolio, other assets that are potential sales include the Mid City Centre, Sydney retail component and possibly the office, at 420 George Street, jointly owned by Fortius Funds Management and the Lend Lease associate the Australian Prime Property Fund.\nThe retail component is valued at about $325 million, but it is said no agents have been appointed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T05:06:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
