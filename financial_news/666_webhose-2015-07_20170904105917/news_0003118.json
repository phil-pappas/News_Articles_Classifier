Rio Tinto estimates bad weather lowered its June quarter production by about seven million tonnes. Source: News Limited\nMr Saunders said the reduction in Rio’s target for this year did not come as a surprise, given its well known production issues during the first half of the year.\n“Rio is in the middle of a very aggressive ramp up in production and this is really the first hitch they’ve had along the way,” he said.\n“Disruptions are to be expected with all big ramp-ups in any sort of mining.”\nRivals like Fortescue founder Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest have hit out at Rio and BHP Billiton’s moves to increase production in the face of waning demand from China.\nMeanwhile, West Australian Premier Colin Barnett has labelled the company’s expansions plans “dumb”, while Prime Minister Tony Abbott initially appeared to back a parliamentary inquiry into the mining giants actions, before deciding against the move.\nMany have laid the blame for the collapse in the price of the commodity, which has more than halved in the past year, squarely at the feet of Rio, BHP and Brazilian giant Vale.\nBut Mr Saunders says that as the lowest cost producer in the Pilbara, it was not in Rio’s interest to pull back production.\n“Unless you have some kind of meeting of the minds of some of all the big players, it is difficult for someone at the bottom of the cost curve to concede they need to be cutting production.\n“Despite being financially worse off, Rio’s iron ore business is not under stress, the assets still produce reasonable returns on capital even at the lower prices.”\nThe company shipped 81.4 million tonnes of iron ore during the June quarter, which was up 12 per cent compared to the March quarter, while production of the material was up seven per cent at 79.7 million tonnes.\nRio Tinto shares gained 19 cents to $53.31.\n.\nOriginally published as Bad weather hits Rio Tinto production ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/bad-weather-hits-rio-tintos-iron-ore-production-in-was-pilbara/story-fnkgdg1h-1227444690458?sv=58c35dc3ef009177d2bae910d16ca8a2", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/bad-weather-hits-rio-tintos-iron-ore-production-in-was-pilbara/story-fnkgdg1h-1227444690458?sv=58c35dc3ef009177d2bae910d16ca8a2&title=Bad+weather+hits+Rio+Tinto+production", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Bad+weather+hits+Rio+Tinto+production&c=BAD+weather+has+achieved+what+rival+miners+and+senior+politicians+have+failed+to+do+%26%238212%3B+rein+in+Rio+Tinto%26%238217%3Bs+iron+ore+production.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/bad-weather-hits-rio-tintos-iron-ore-production-in-was-pilbara/story-fnkgdg1h-1227444690458?sv=58c35dc3ef009177d2bae910d16ca8a2", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/bad-weather-hits-rio-tintos-iron-ore-production-in-was-pilbara/story-fnkgdg1h-1227444690458?sv=58c35dc3ef009177d2bae910d16ca8a2", "http://www.perthnow.com.au/business/companies/bad-weather-hits-rio-tintos-iron-ore-production-in-was-pilbara/story-fnkjk9ku-1227444690458", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/bad-weather-hits-rio-tintos-iron-ore-production-in-was-pilbara/story-fnkgdg1h-1227444690458?sv=58c35dc3ef009177d2bae910d16ca8a2&h=Bad+weather+hits+Rio+Tinto+production", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/bad-weather-hits-rio-tintos-iron-ore-production-in-was-pilbara/story-fnkgdg1h-1227444690458?sv=58c35dc3ef009177d2bae910d16ca8a2&title=Bad+weather+hits+Rio+Tinto+production"], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T01:27:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
