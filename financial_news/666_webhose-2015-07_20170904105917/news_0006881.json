Chain store-operator Laox Co., which sells about 70 percent of its appliances to Chinese tourists, dropped 4.1 percent. Exporters declined as the yen strengthened the most in nearly three weeks against the dollar. Toyota Motor Corp. dropped 1.7 percent to be the biggest drag on the Topix index. Canon. Inc. gained 0.7 percent after earnings at the camera maker beat estimates.\nThe Topix index lost 1.3 percent to 1,616.77 as of 9:36 a.m. in Tokyo, with all but two of its 33 industry groups falling. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined 1.2 percent to 20,115.04. The Shanghai Composite Index sank 8.5 percent on Monday, triggering a sell-off in global shares and extending a slump in commodity markets.\n“The huge declines in Chinese share prices caused market sentiment to wither and triggered risk-off on a global scale,” said Toshihiko Matsuno, chief strategist at SMBC Friend Securities Co. in Tokyo. “We could see a rebound today if Chinese shares recover, but market sentiment is very wobbly and it’s hard to say we’ll definitely see bottom-fishing.”\nThe biggest crash in Chinese shares in eight years led equities lower worldwide and selling spread to the dollar as the turmoil bolstered speculation that the Federal Reserve will keep U.S. interest rates lower for longer. The yen traded 123.19 per dollar after strengthening Monday by the most against the greenback since July 8, when the previous rout in Chinese markets abated.\nOil Glut The decline in Chinese shares bolstered concern that demand for raw materials will slip in the world’s second-biggest economy. The Bloomberg Commodity Index fell to a 13-year low Monday, while oil extended declines in a bear market. Rising Iraqi exports and a rebound in U.S. drilling also weighed on sentiment.\nFutures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent after the underlying U.S. measure lost 0.6 percent on Monday. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slumped 2.2 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T03:49:55.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
