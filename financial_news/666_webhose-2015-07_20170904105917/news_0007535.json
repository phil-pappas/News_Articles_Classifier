Toronto-Dominion Bank immediately cut its prime rate by 10 basis points to 2.75 percent.\n“While vulnerabilities associated with household imbalances remain elevated and could edge higher, Canada’s economy is undergoing a significant and complex adjustment,” Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said in a statement .\nThe move overrides concerns from real estate executives and some economists that lower rates will lead to increased borrowing, skyrocketing prices and put housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver at risk of a correction.\n“I worry that stoking this engine further could move us from a perfectly manageable major market expansion into a more difficult correction,” Phil Soper, chief executive officer of Royal LePage, Canada’s largest real estate firm, said in a report Tuesday.\nTheir concern is that Canada’s banks, which hold 74 percent of the country’s C$1.3 trillion ($1 trillion) in mortgage debt, will follow the Bank of Canada in slicing mortgage rates, enticing further borrowing in a country where consumers are already carrying near record debt loads. Lenders usually follow the central bank’s moves.\n‘Another Log’ “It’s going to put more fuel on the fire for potentially people who may not really have the ability to buy real estate,” Ross McCredie, CEO of Sotheby’s International Realty Canada said in an interview July 8. “When they’re buying, the baseline is that interest rates are going to stay this low for a very long period of time. It’s a scary place to be a buyer.”\nDouglas Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, said in an interview July 7 that a rate cut would be the “equivalent of throwing another log on an already raging fire.”\nToronto and Vancouver home prices have defied expectations. The average cost of purchasing a condo, townhouse or low-rise property in Toronto, Canada’s largest city, has jumped 38 percent in the five years to June, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association. Toronto sales reached a record in each of the last three months. In Vancouver, single-family home prices rallied 35 percent to C$1.1 million in June from June 2010.\nPrime Rates After the Bank of Canada reduced its lending rate by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent in January , the banks followed a week later with only a 15 basis point cut to their prime rates, which control everything from variable rate mortgages to lines of credit.\nThe prime rate at the banks was 2.85 percent yesterday, the lowest since 2010, while the current rate on a 5-year conventional mortgage is 4.64 percent. Borrowers often get a lower cost than what’s posted because of promotional products and the competition among lenders.\nIn January, the central bank cut surprised economists. For Wednesday’s meeting, 15 of 29 economists predicted a quarter-point reduction to 0.5 percent.", "external_links": ["http://credit.bankofcanada.ca/householdcredit\\"], "published": "2015-07-15T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T18:02:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
