Photo: iStock\nJames Packer's biggest casino rival, Steve Wynn, has seen earnings slump from his Macau operations setting the scene for a fresh battle with Melco Crown as the two prepare to open new resorts in the world's biggest gambling hub.\nUS-listed Wynn Resorts, chaired by Mr Wynn, saw its Macau revenues slip by 36 per cent in the second quarter to $US617 million ($843 million) from $US960 million for the same period in 2014. Some of China's wealthiest gamblers now avoid visiting Macau as the impact of a corruption crackdown slows activity in the former Portuguese colony.\nWynn's earnings numbers could spell trouble for Mr Packer's Crown Resorts, which derives nearly half of its earnings from the Melco Crown joint venture through its 34 per cent stake. Melco Crown reports its second-quarter earnings on August 6.\nMr Wynn said Macau remains a great proposition for the company, but said it is difficult to know how it will play out in the short term.\n\"It's been a wonderful business experience comparable to none that I'm aware of,\" Mr Wynn told investors on an earnings call on Thursday. \"But Macau continues to be more of a question than a certainty as we head through 2015.\"\nBeijing's efforts to rein in fraudulent activity and illegal cash flowing across the border have hammered gambling activities in Macau, the only region in China where its citizens can legally gamble.\nGross gaming revenue in June fell 36.2 per cent to 17.4 billion patacas ($2.8 billion), marking a 13th straight month of declines and the lowest level of revenues since 2010, official data released in early July showed.\nThe figures are a harsh reality check for investors bullish on the ability of Macau casino operators to rebound from a slump in the sector although the recent removal of a year-old transit visa restriction may improve visitor flows.\nWynn created its first Macau casino in 2006 with Encore at Wynn Macau opening in 2010. Its next development, Wynn Palace, is due to open in March 2016.\nMelco Crown has two Macau casinos, Altira and City of Dreams, and plans to open its next casino, Studio City, in October.\nThat will see Wynn and Melco Crown face a fresh battle for supremacy on the Macau strip, which Mr Wynn expects will be competitive.\n\"Our fellow operators in Macau are intelligent, they're extremely well-financed and they're quick to learn and to accommodate the things that they see in other hotels and to accommodate necessitated by their own experience in that market,\" said Mr Wynn.\n\"It's a very, very sharp place. The buildings that are built represent remarkable diversification into non-gaming attractions. And of course that adds to the competitive nature of our situation.\"\nMr Wynn, perhaps best known for developing the vast Bellagio resort in Las Vegas in the late 1990s, will also be watching on with interest as Mr Packer works to develop his Alon casino complex over the next few years.\nAfter announcing plans last year to build a Vegas casino by 2018, Packer has steadily been raiding Wynn's top executives as he looks to challenge the US businessman with an 1100-room integrated resort that could cost the gaming magnate more than $US4 billion.\nAfter snaring the executive who used to run Wynn's Vegas operations, Andrew Pascal, Packer has now reportedly lured the most successful US nightclub operator as part of his team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T08:04:39.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
