City analysts had been hoping for earnings per share of 7.5p, up from the previous year's 5.4p. The microchip designer lifted profits before tax 32% to £123.9m on revenue that rose 22% to £228.5m or 15% in dollar terms to $357.1m. \nProcessor licensing revenue in US$ up 3% year-on-year, with royalty revenue in US$ up 31% year-on-year. \nWith net cash generation in the quarter at £93.3m, the interim dividend was hiked 25% to 3.15p per share. \n\"Q2 2015 has been a strong quarter for ARM with a highly diverse range of leading companies choosing to license ARM's latest processors and physical IP for their future product developments,\" said chief executive Simon Segars. \nHe said that following ARM's investment in improved technology products for mobile devices, the automotive sector and enterprise infrastructure, the company had signed licences for many of these new products. \n\"This licensing activity will help to grow the royalty revenue opportunity for years to come,\" he added. \nOvernight, Apple, thought to be ARM's largest customer, also fell short of analyst's consensus expectations in the third quarter and with its projections for the fourth. The California company revealed it sold 47.5m iPhones in the third quarter, up 35% on the same period last year but short of analysts' expectations of 48.8m. IPad sales fell 18% to 10.9m, the sixth consecutive quarter of declines. \nApple guided towards revenues of between $49bn and $51bn in its fourth quarter, shy of the $51.1bn consensus forecast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T11:08:45.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
