ILLUSTRATION SAM BENNETT by Sam Henderson Borrowing to buy shares in your SMSF can be tricky but there are options, writes Sam Henderson, who answers your questions on superannuation.\nQ: I'm looking to set up a self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) mainly to invest in shares. Could you let me know if you can borrow funds through a margin loan to leverage the super funds you have?\nA: Yes, you can borrow to buy shares. And yes, you can use a margin loan, in theory. Section 67A & 67B of the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act (SIS Act) stipulates that borrowing must take place using a limited recourse borrowing arrangement (LRBA). That means that any lending can only be secured against the asset you are purchasing, with no recourse for you personally or the rest of your super fund. As a result, most banks will only lend up to a certain loan to value ratio (LVR), usually 80 per cent or less for property and 70 per cent or less for shares.\nBut here's the tricky bit; the legislation states that you may only buy a \"single acquirable asset\". While this may include shares in a single company, it will preclude borrowing to buy shares in a portfolio of companies or multiple assets on multiple titles. The same is true for buying multiple properties on different titles. You will need a separate LRBA for each company purchase.\nThe solution is simple. You could consider using instalment warrants. Instalment warrants are the original LRBA structure and have been around for many years. They allow you to put a down payment on a stock and repay the debt over a period of time. There are several providers of installment warrants including Instreet, UBS, CBA, NAB, Westpac and Macquarie. Their websites will give you more information on how much you can borrow, the available LVRs and over which companies they will lend money.\nEssentially, instalment warrants allow you to borrow a fraction of the value of a share, exchange traded fund (ETF) or listed lnvestment company (LIC). My favourite type is a self-funded instalment. These allow you to borrow, for example, 50 per cent of the value of a stock and the dividends repay the debt over a five- or 10-year period.\nBe warned though, share values can fall and dividends can fall, eroding the potential to repay the debt. Read the product disclosure statements carefully and do your research, but these can be great ways to leverage into the market.\nQ: I have a SMSF. I am 64, I just want to know how much of a non-concessional contribution I can put into my super fund and when it needs to be received by the fund?\n A: You are limited to $180,000 a year for non-concessional (or after-tax) contributions. You may also use the three-year bring-forward rule and put $540,000 into your fund (to cover a three-year period) until you are 65, if you haven't previously triggered the three-year rule.\nIf you meet the work test, you will be eligible to extend the time constraints further to \"the financial year in which you turn 65\". For example, if you turn 65 in August 2015, you have until June 30, 2016 to put your contribution into the fund, but you must meet the work test for that financial year to be eligible to contribute to the super system. If you don't meet the work test, the contribution must be received before your 65th birthday. The work test is defined as working 40 hours in 30 consecutive days, or in other words, a week in any month.\nQ: I am over 65 with an SMSF accumulation account that has both taxable and non-taxable balances. Is it possible to cash out (commute) just the taxable component in this account before I turn the account to an account-based pension?\nA: When you cash money out of your fund, it must be proportional to your taxable and non-taxable components. Once you are 60, though, there is no tax payable. So you will therefore be eligible to withdraw your funds tax-free. And attaining age 65 is a condition of release under super laws whether you're working or not. Just be careful on the contribution laws if you plan on putting money back in your fund to ensure you or your partner meet the eligibility requirements mentioned in the previous question (ie, the work test if you're over 65).\nBe careful cashing money out of your fund in accumulation phase if you plan to sell assets because it may trigger capital gains tax. If you start a pension and then sell down your assets, you will avoid capital gains tax. You will also be eligible to take your withdrawal as a pension payment as there is no upper limit on these and thus no requirement to stop a pension and recommence it if you want to make a withdrawal of any size.\nAs a side note to readers, if you're under 60 and retired or have met a condition of release, you are eligible to withdraw up to $195,000 tax-free from your fund. Many people are unaware of this and worry that their pensions will be taxed if they retire before 60 and this may be a \"work around\" solution.\nFinancial planner Sam Henderson, chief executive of Henderson Maxwell, will be answering your questions while veteran AFR DIY super columnist John Wasiliev is on indefinite medical leave.
