The court found prima facie evidence against Koda and others in the case allegedly involving Vini Iron and Steel Udyog Ltd (VISUL). Special Judge Bharat Parashar ordered the framing of charges dealing with criminal conspiracy, cheating and various provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act against former coal secretary H.C. Gupta, Koda, Jharkhand's then chief secretary A.K. Basu and others. The charges will be formally framed on July 30, the court said. The court was hearing the case related to Jharkhand's Rajhara North coal block allocation to VISUL.
