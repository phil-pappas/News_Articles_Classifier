Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: At his office reception, Amit Jain , chief executive of Ratan Tata-backed CarDekho, has put up a giant ancient world map to symbolise the company's next goal â€” to conquer global markets. The Jaipur-based automotive classifieds portal CarDekho is making a start in this direction by scouting for acquisitions in the range of $1-5 million (about Rs 6-30 crore) in Southeast Asia to enter markets such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam, Jain told ET. \"These Southeast Asian markets are nascent and technology-based information access through web is a blue ocean which we want to capture. There are attractive targets in such markets and we are already talking to a few players for potential buyouts,\" said Jain. If successful, CarDekho will join the bandwagon of Indian startups entering other emerging markets where local challenges are similar and technology ecosystem is not mature. Gurgaon-based Zomato has expanded to over 22 nations. Online doctor appointment portal Practo is present in several overseas markets such as Singapore , Indonesia and Philippines. Online ticketing platform Book-MyShow has set up a local office in Indonesia, where CarDekho has also opened an office. Craftsvilla has also been looking at acquisitions to expand into markets in Southeast Asia and Africa. \"Entrepreneurs in India are realising that world-class products can be built from here and there are a lot of English speaking countries with a sizable internet user base but no innovation and investment ecosystem,\" said Tarun Davda, director at Matrix Partners India, which has backed Practo and Stayzilla. CarDekho is flush with $50 million which it raised this January. CarDekho is likely to follow a model similar to that of Zomato, of basing its backend development centre in India while hiring local sales support in international markets. \"Being in a small town has led us to control costs. Our expenses are really low, which has helped us conserve cash for global expansion,\" said Jain. The company recently launched CarBay.co.id in Indonesia to provide local information on new and old cars in Bahasa language. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!
