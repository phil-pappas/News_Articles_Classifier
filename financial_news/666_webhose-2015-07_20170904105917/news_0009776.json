An apex court bench headed by Chief Justice H.L. Dattu on Tuesday said these petitions would be taken up on July 9 along with two others seeking removal of Madhya Pradesh Governor Ram Naresh Yadav so that he could be prosecuted for his alleged involvement in the scam. Digvijaya Singh and the three whistle-blowers - Ashish Chaturvedi, Anand Rai and Prashant Pandey - while demanding for a SC-monitored CBI probe said they have no faith in the Special Task Force that is monitoring the SIT probe into the scam. The petition of the Congress leader and the three whistle-blowers were mentioned by senior counsel Vivek Tankha and Indira Jaising.
