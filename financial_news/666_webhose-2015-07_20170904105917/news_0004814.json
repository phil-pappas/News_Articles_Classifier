Many others do not know the meaning or its impact but live through it as part of their daily lives. \n“The buying and renovation of houses and stores in deteriorated urban neighborhoods by upper- or middle-income families or individuals, thus improving property values but often displacing low-income families and small businesses.” Dictionary.com \nThe word has been around for centuries. It is commonly used by sociologist, urban planning professionals and those dealing with social movements. During the past thirty years many cities have experienced some form of gentrification . The common thread is it takes shape in urban cities throughout the country. Urban is a popular buzz word meaning the core of downtown, but often the meaning is basic investment has left the community and the area is a predominant source for minorities seeking affordable housing. The once well-kept areas are left to devastation resulting in a sharp decrease of property values. The so-called economic decline is the fuel for gentrification. \n“It’s a social dynamic where majority populations or those with money basically replace those who don’t have money, and sadly they are typically lower income producing minorities’ populations. The irony is many of the new residents who are returning are coming back to the very areas their parents fled!” Elena Bell, Licensed Social Worker \nCivil Rights Era \nDuring the civil rights gains of the 1950’s, 1960’s and 1970’s some mainstream or white populations fled cities and relocated to newly developed suburbs. This era was called “white flight.” The result was people, primarily minorities replaced those who had fled. The focus of the civil rights legislation was to create more of an equal playing field. Unfortunately as people fled, the resources of the community went with them. In time thriving communities were transformed into ghettos or undesirable areas where sustainability meant surviving instead of living. \nDefiance \nThe sheer defiance of not obeying civil rights legislation created the manifestation for gentrification to thrive. Neighborhoods started to gradually change. Interestingly, it was also during the early 1960's the Confederate Battle Flag was adopted by South Carolina. Of course last week it was removed and appears headed to a museum. Those against integration launched a protest against adopting civil rights laws as the flag was their symbol of superiority. \nHousing stock also had restrictive covenants which forced certain groups to live in heavily segregated areas. Once the areas became full of blight many properties were condemned or otherwise inhabitable, until the next wave of investment. That investment typically comes from those looking for bargain priced deals which add to the cycle of gentrification. \nThe basic theme of gentrification is many who are more affluent than those in a particular community have the resources to create more attractive communities, including accompanying business districts to support their lifestyle, more than the less affluent or poorer people who remain. Therein lies the big problem of gentrification. Can the two groups exist together? The primary residual affect or negative impact of gentrification is while communities are improved, those who are poor or who are unable to maintain the same type of lifestyle the newcomers possess are forced to relocate or survive based on their economic situation. No doubt, they may love their communities but lack the money to participate in the new economy. \nWhere does your City rank? \nMany cities and communities are grappling on how to deal with this issue. Currently, cities are being gentrified in record numbers. It is quite remarkable to know of areas which at one time were the hub of activity, take on a new life of dilapidation and an eye sore, to morphing into a renaissance of recreating itself. There are points to be made on both sides of the issue, in the meantime many have accepted the reality that gentrification is another form of a land grab. \nMs. Bell an African-American professional recounted how her brother a successful Attorney who heads a non-profit in Oakland, CA once lived in a very toney part of San Francisco known as the Western Edition or Fillmore District. “It was a haven for middle-class African-Americans. Unfortunately as parents or those who owned homes started dying off, their heirs had relocated and the notion of being offered what amounted to a king’s ransom for the property was too much of a temptation to pass up. The sad result is over a twenty year period the neighborhood took on new characteristics and were absent of the cultural icons that it was known for. New owners meant higher cost for rents and other services. In time, my brother decided the Fillmore was no more, however his love for the Bay area motivated him to find housing in the Mission district. He was one of the lucky ones, most have to leave the area altogether!” lamented Ms. Bell. \nA list of the Cities going through gentrification.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T09:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T09:50:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
