In a 2007 study by the journal Injury Prevention it was found that babies in rear facing car seats were 75% less likely to die or be severely injured in a crash than their forward facing counterparts.

When asked why parents are ignoring these crucial safety guidelines a common response is that it is easier to interact with forward facing children. \n\"The safety of our children should always be of utmost importance.
