Many analysts have come forward to provide an estimate of the total sales till now, and today, the well-known research firm, Strategy Analytics has just revealed their estimate of the Apple Watch sales. \nAccording to the research firm, Apple managed to sell around 4 million smart watches in Q2 2015. The company has captured around 75 percent of the total smartwatch market within this short span. This also means that every 3 out of the 4 smartwatches that were sold in the second quarter were Apple Watches. With Apple capturing a majority of the global market share, other smartwatch manufacturers lost a portion of their share. Samsung which had a market share of around 75 percent back in 2014, now has only about 7.5 percent. Other manufacturers too lost some share, from a joint share of 26.4 percent last year to 17 percent this year.

But according to the companyâ€™s financial report released on Tuesday, the revenue has increased by up to $1 billion and Apple Watch could be the major reason for this spike. Other analysts who initially predicted sales to be around 3 to 5 million revised their estimates to 1.5 to 3 million after the earnings report. Unfortunately, Apple declined to provide any official figures for the Apple Watch sales in this quarter. \nBut the company did say that the Apple Watch had a great start. One of the executives further added that the company managed to sell more Apple Watches in the first 9 weeks than either iPhone or iPad. This shows that the wearable has been doing well in the market. \nIn the consumer survey of over 800 Apple Watch owners conducted by a research firm, about 97 percent of the users were either happy or somewhat satisfied with the Apple Watch. It is said that geeks and tech enthusiasts were not quite happy with the watch, but the rest majority of the common public found the overall Apple Watch experience quite satisfactory. \nThe company has already announced a major update to the OS which will reportedly improve the speed of the watch. Also, Apple will open up a number of sensors and other tech on the Apple Watch to developers so that they can come up with interesting apps.
