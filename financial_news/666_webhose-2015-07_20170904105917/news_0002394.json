They’ve swung back and forth in recent weeks on shifts in sentiment toward the region’s most-indebted member.\nItaly’s 10-year yield dropped seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 2.06 percent at 8 a.m. London time. The 1.5 percent security due in June 2025 added 0.605, or 6.05 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,118) face amount, to 95.07.\nPotential Rally The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold Italy’s 10-year bonds instead of benchmark German securities narrowed 13 basis points to 111 basis points. It reached a low for the year of 84 basis points in March and jumped as high as 199 basis points on June 29. The Spain-Germany spread was also at 111 basis points.\n“A good deal is already priced,” Ciaran O’Hagan, head of European rates strategy at Societe Generale SA in Paris, said before the Greek bailout talks. “On a successful Greece conclusion this weekend, there is potential for another 10-to-15-basis-point rally in yield over the coming days” for the spread between Spanish and German bonds.\nItalian bonds gained 0.1 percent this year, outperforming the euro-area average of a 1.4 percent loss, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Greek bonds lost about 18 percent.\nFor the past two weeks, Greece’s banks have been shut and capital controls imposed. The stock market has also been shut and the Bank of Greece halted dealing of government bonds on its electronic trading platform. The nation became the first developed country to miss a payment to the International Monetary Fund when it skipped a $1.7 billion obligation on June 30.\nOn July 14, a Greek yen-denominated bond matures. There are still 11.7 billion yen ($95 million) of notes outstanding.\nThe Greek state is also due to pay 3.5 billion euros in redemptions to the European Central Bank on July 20, as well as making various coupon payments before the end of the month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T10:27:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
