NYSE accounted for about 13.4 percent of U.S. stocks last month.\nChina's securities regulator, in its most drastic step yet to arrest a selloff on Chinese stock markets, banned shareholders with large stakes in listed firms from selling for the next six months.\nAbout 30 percent has been knocked off the value of Chinese shares since mid-June. Some investors fear that the turmoil in the Chinese market could destabilize the global financial system, making it a bigger risk than the Greek crisis.\n\"The Chinese market has shown a nice rebound for a day but it is important to note that many of the owners are restricted from selling their shares and half the companies have suspended trading,\" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.\nAt 9:36 a.m. ET the Dow Jones industrial average was up 249.3 points, or 1.42 percent, at 17,764.72, the S&P 500 was up 27.54 points, or 1.35 percent, at 2,074.22 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 70.30 points, or 1.43 percent, at 4,980.06.\nFed officials need to see more signs of a strengthening U.S. economy before raising interest rates, according to minutes of the central bank's June policy meeting, at which Greece's debt crisis was cited as a serious concern.\nNew applications for U.S. unemployment benefits rose last week to their highest rate since February with initial claims rising 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 297,000 for the week that ended July 4.\nEuropean markets rose on hopes that Greece might be able to win a deal that could keep it in the euro zone.\nGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has until midnight to propose spending-cut plans that will convince the euro zone to give Athens a three-year loan to rescue it from bankruptcy.\nU.S. quarterly earnings season kicked off with Alcoa's quarterly profit missing expectations due to plunging primary aluminum prices.\nCorporate profits are expected to have fallen 3.1 percent in the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters estimates data.\nCoty's shares fell 7.4 percent to $29.18 after Procter & Gamble agreed to sell its beauty business to the company in a deal that values the business at $12.5 billion. P&G shares were up 1 percent at $81.78.\nWalgreens Boots Alliance was up 3.4 percent at $88.93 after the largest U.S. drug store chain raised its full-year profit forecast.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,440 to 200. On the Nasdaq, 2,124 issues rose and 238 fell.\nThe S&P 500 index showed five new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 17 new highs and 8 new lows.
