The government steps in, ploughing billions of dollars into the hands of stockbrokers to bail out customers that borrowed to buy shares. And when that doesn't work, it just halts share trading in almost half the country's listed companies.\nIt is bizarre to contemplate, but that is precisely what is going on in China this week.\nThe government's remedy is not going to the heart of the problem.\nThe Chinese stock market should surely be now be classed as the world's largest casino.\nAt the corporate level, transparency, governance and corruption are still major issues that will plague levels of confidence.

It is attempting to ensure the punters don't lose the shirts of their backs.\nIt's an enormous stimulus/intervention into what is meant to be a free capital market that both smacks of desperation, and one which to date has been largely unsuccessful.\nThe Chinese stock market staged a small recovery on Monday only to be sold off on Tuesday amid massive intra-day gyrations.\nThis market is clearly in bubble territory.\nWednesday's pre-market announcement of bailout 2.0 resulted in another wild-east day of trading with the primary Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index opening down almost 8 per cent but halving the losses by lunch.\nThis market is clearly in bubble territory and just increasing the size of the financial Band-Aid is only serving as further illustration of the severity of the problem.\nThe government's remedy is not going to the heart of the problem, which is that massive speculation by local players has ramped up the price of shares well beyond their fundamental value.\nWild fluctuations in the Chinese stock market have forced the government to intervene. Photo: Bloomberg\nSure there are some large blue chip companies that are trading at more reasonable price earnings multiples. But market wide, the index is trading at more than 50 times, thanks to a plethora of mid range and small stocks priced at ridiculous levels.\n\"The Shanghai market is still expensive,\" Mark McFarland, the chief global economist at Coutts & Co. in Hong Kong, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.\nPolicy measures to support prices are \"unlikely to be successful in the short term. Ultimately it's people's minds that you have to get into, to get confidence up. That's a difficult task.\"\nThere is a strong belief that the government will use more of its massive financial firepower to arrest the declines in the market. Just what arsenal it will use next is anyone's guess.\nThe whole exercise this week, in which the government brings out heavier artillery each day, gives a new meaning to the concept of an uninformed market.\nUnless the market is allowed to operate free from government intervention it won't revert to a level that reflects its real value.\nBut it must also use the opportunity that the equity crisis has created to impose some proper measures on the operations of the market, better controls on the huge growth of margin lending and more stringent prudential regulations on investors.\nAt the corporate level, transparency, governance and corruption are still major issues that will plague levels of confidence in anyone wanting to invest in Chinese listed stocks.\nCorporate governance standards are improving, thanks to the recent government crackdown but China still has a long way to go. The country received a corruption score of 40 from Transparency International in 2013. That makes it slightly less corrupt than Russia but more so than Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Ghana.\nIn November, China opened its main stock exchange to trading by foreign investors, however, there has been plenty of caution from outside investors. Thus, the majority of investors in Chinese stocks are owned by local players that over the past six months (until the market began its almighty slide a few weeks ago) have been ploughing in with little understanding of the risks involved.\nThe Chinese government's attempts to rescue investors is both a face saving exercise and an effort to prevent contagion into the broader economy.\nA major concern is that the market downturn will have a negative \"wealth effect\", dampening consumer sentiment just as Beijing is counting on consumption to make up for declining investment to achieve its stated economic growth target of \"about\" 7 per cent.\nGovernments stepping in to save companies and markets from implosion is of course nothing new. The US government's bailout of banks during the global financial crisis and the propping up of various European economies are obvious examples.\nIn the real world the flow-on effect to the price of commodities that Australia sells to China seems to be getting a taste of contagion. The iron ore price this week has fallen below US$50 – which is packing some heat on all Australian producers – all of which have seen their share prices under pressure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T13:16:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
