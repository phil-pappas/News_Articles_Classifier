It forecast total pay-TV revenues to rise by around 7 percent this year.\nThat compares with a 4 percent increase in German TV advertising revenues in 2014 to 4.29 billion euros, with the vast majority going to private free-to-air broadcasters like ProSiebenSat.1 and RTL.\nGermany has 90 pay-TV channels, offering entertainment, sport, documentaries, music and children's programmes.
