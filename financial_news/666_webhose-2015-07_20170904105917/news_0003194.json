That was up 2 percent from May on a daily basis. The National Bureau of Statistics will provide a breakdown by refined product later this week. \nChina's domestic crude oil production rose 3.2 percent to 18.12 million tonnes (4.41 million bpd) in June and recorded 2.1 percent growth in the first half of the year, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed. \n(Editing by Miral Fahmy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T08:35:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
