The nation was poised to miss a $1.7 billion payment due to the IMF.\nEconomic Stake The U.S. has an economic stake in a successful and prosperous European Union, which bought American goods and services worth $498 billion last year, making it the largest market for American exports after Canada and Mexico.\n“It is in the interest of the United States for Europe to continue to be closely integrated and strong and effective,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday.\nThe danger that Greece’s problems lead to a wider euro-area unraveling and create a failed state between Russia and the Middle East has prompted some unusual -- and largely unsuccessful -- efforts by the U.S. to apply pressure.\nIn February, for example, Obama warned European leaders that “you cannot keep on squeezing countries that are in the midst of depression.”\nMeanwhile, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew has sought to convince German Chancellor Angela Merkel to ease up on her economic austerity policies, and has become more outspoken in urging both sides to compromise.\nAwkward Position “The U.S. is in the rather awkward position with Greece of not being the driver of events,” Lachman said. U.S. officials “have seen this train wreck coming for years, but any policy advice they’ve given seems to have fallen on deaf ears.”\nAdministration officials can more easily influence events in Puerto Rico, and may well have to do so given the island commonwealth’s ties to the U.S.\n“Puerto Rico is caught in an odd in-between status,” said Douglas Rediker, a visiting fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “It’s not a country so it can’t go to the IMF, but it doesn’t have access to Chapter 9 bankruptcy that’s available to municipalities like Detroit. So it’s stuck.”\nTreasury Stance The Treasury Department has insisted there will be no bailout for the island, which is struggling to repay $72 billion of debt. Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said Monday night he will seek to delay payments for “a number of years” as part of a plan to bolster the commonwealth’s finances and revive its economy.\nThe Treasury repeated on Monday that the administration is committed to supporting the people of Puerto Rico and helping its leaders find solutions. The statement appeared to limit the offer to department expertise and ensuring the island receives various federal payments for which it’s already eligible.\nThe administration has already taken steps over the past several years to contain the fallout from Puerto Rico’s problems, such as nudging bond funds to limit their investments in the island’s debt, said Bert Ely, a veteran Washington banking and monetary policy consultant.\nThe White House has urged Congress to consider legislation that would give Puerto Rico’s municipalities and public agencies to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection.\n“There are strong merits to having an orderly mechanism for Puerto Rico to manage the financial challenges of its public corporations if needed,” Earnest said Monday. “That’s something that only Congress can change.”\nResistance in Congress New York Senator Charles Schumer, the third-highest ranking Democrat in the chamber, said on Tuesday that he will team up with Connecticut Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal to sponsor such a bill.\nSimilar legislation in the U.S. House, sponsored by Puerto Rico’s non-voting member of Congress, Pedro Pierluisi, hasn’t moved since a February hearing and Republican leaders, who control both chambers, didn’t get behind the bill.\nEly said he doubts Congress will amend the bankruptcy code to help Puerto Rico’s indebted municipalities and public agencies, citing the objections of holders of Puerto Rican bonds and the reluctance of House members such as Bob Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to change the law.\n“There’d be strong resistance in Congress to any kind of taxpayer bailout,” Ely said. “These are cases where the White House appears to believe it can or should let events play out.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T01:33:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
