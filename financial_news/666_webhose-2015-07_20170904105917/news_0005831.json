The judge in that case disagreed. The company, backed by Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp, has since gone bankrupt. \nBoth Aereo and FilmOn X, founded by Internet entrepreneur Alki David, use similar technology that allows viewers to watch network television captured via remote antennas and sent over the Internet. \nThe case is Fox Television Stations, Inc v. FilmOn X, LLC, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, No. 12-cv-6921. \n(Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Cynthia Osterman) Company Legal & Law Matters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T03:56:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
