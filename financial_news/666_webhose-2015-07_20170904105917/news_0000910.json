Kara Gammell puts down her credit card and explores why \nI've never been a massive spender, always making sure that I got the best deals on everything from food shopping to new frocks. \nBut nothing prepared me for how the exhaustion of new motherhood would make me drop the ball on bargain hunting. \nI look back to the mountains of baby bumpf I bought in the wee hours of the morning, shopping on my iPhone Amazon app while I fed the baby and literally shudder at the unnecessary expense. \nOther female friends tell me they spent a fortune on maternity leave often ‘treating’ themselves to a new outfit as a pick-me-up after a particularly hard night with a teething infant. \nOne admits she \"had to go back to work as all she did was shop\". \nWhen I asked her what it was she bought, she looked at me blankly: \"Gosh, I can't remember, but it all seemed very important at the time.\" \nWe’ve all been there at some point. Whether it’s another red bill landing on your doormat, a credit card balance that never seems to shrink - or simply not quite having enough cash to get you to through to payday. \nFor a growing number of women, the last decade has been spent living in their overdraft. We long to be savers, but manage to justify sneaky purchases to ourselves - and for many the concept of money management involves rummaging behind the sofa for a bit of spare change. \nIf this sounds a bit too familiar, you’re not alone. \nWhy are more women than men going bankrupt? \nAccording to figures published this week, women are now more likely to fall into personal insolvency or bankruptcy than men . The gender split is particularly stark among young adults, with 32.8 per 10,000 women aged between 25 and 34 becoming insolvent, compared to just 24.8 for men of the same age. \nIn fact, R3 the insolvency trade body that conducted the research - has found that a leading factor in 85 per cent of female applications is consumer debt. Yep, they're blaming 'shopping addiction' for our empty coffers. \nWe all know that women are the advertisers’ target market the country’s biggest shoppers. But surely it shouldn’t be running us into financial ruin? \n“It may be that women are less likely to stick their head in the sand about debt problems; or it could be that low value or consumer debts have a bigger impact on women’s finances than men,” explains Phillip Sykes, president of R3. \nPersonally, I know that for many women in their twenties and thirties, the week before payday often struggle after bills, food and forking out for obscene travel expenses. \nBuying lunch at Pret, coupled with a bit of eBay shopping while the boss isn't looking and then a few glasses after work with the girls can soon add up. Before you know it, your monthly spending money is gone, and it’s still three weeks until pay day. \nOne friend, with a decent wage and a considerable amount of debt, tells me that she never has enough money to last her the month, let alone save for the future. \n“Once, I make my credit card payment, there’s my rent which costs a small fortune and my Ocado shop seems to be constantly getting more expensive,” she says. “I know I need to make cut backs, but I need a place to live and food to eat.” \nWhen I suggest she downgrade her groceries to Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) and shift her debt to an interest-free credit card (and cut it up, so she can’t wrack up more debt), she says: “I work hard for my money, I don’t think wanting to live and eat well is unreasonable.” \nI bite my lip to avoid saying: “Only if you can afford it, that is.” \nBut, that said, surely it stands to reason that most men would have the same financial outgoings as women (surely it's not just us buying expensive salads for lunch). So what’s going on? \nThe reality is that for most women, less money is coming in than is going out - and, as everyone knows, cash flow problems are not only horrible, but terribly stressful. \n“With the gender pay gap, increased living costs and maternity benefits often tightened by employers, many women have to resort to loading their credit cards with debt,” says Philippa Gee, a wealth manager. \nMore than 40 years after the Equal Pay Act, women are still getting paid around £5,000 a year less than our male colleagues (we earn 80 pence for every pound a man gets). \nWhat’s more, figures show that a woman will typically reach the height of her earning power at the age of 34 , while a man will see his salary continue to grow until the age of 50. While r esearch released today by Glassdoor shows that just 27 per cent of women are confident of a pay rise in the next year, while 40 per cent of men expect a higher salary in 12 months time. \nDavid Cameron might this week have promised to ‘end the gender pay gap in a generation’ but for women whose credit cards are creaking right now, that can’t come soon enough. \nFewer women than men expect a pay rise in the next year \nIt’s easy to see how credit card debt can soon spiral out of control just look at figures from Moneysavingexpert.com which shows that those who have put £3,000 on plastic and only repay the minimum monthly amount would take 27 years and 4 months to clear the balance costing £4,000 in interest. \n“It has become so much easier for people to get heavily into debt as credit card companies fight for new customers with eye-catching offers and as a result, those taking advantage don’t feel like they’re spending real money,” says Patrick Connolly, a certified financial planner at advisers Chase de Vere. \n“Many of the female bankruptcies, as with male bankruptcies, are simply down to irresponsible spending as they take advantage of easy credit and try to maintain a lifestyle which they cannot afford”. \n= So how can you start to do something about it? = \nCan you pay off your debt without living on the breadline? \nAbsolutely, you just have to know what you are doing. It mightn’t be fun, but it will be far less stressful than worrying about cash. \nIt can be depressing to appreciate the severity of the situation, but facing up to it is the only way you can make a plan to move on. \nAn easy way to get your hands on this information is to obtain a copy of your credit report, online or via a credit agency. This will list everything you owe and to whom. Trust me, it can be a real eye-opener. \nIf your debt situation is a bit more serious than you thought and you are actually struggling to pay your bills, or buy food, the first port of call is to contact the lenders you borrowed the money from. Don’t be embarrassed. These firms are used to it and chances are they have heard way worse than what you are about to tell them. \nThey would much rather be contacted as soon as things become a problem, rather than months down the line when payments have been missed and arrears are mounting up. \nAnd let’s face it, so would you. After all, there’s nothing more likely to dull the thrill of those impulse purchases than a visit from the bailiffs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T12:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T13:27:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
