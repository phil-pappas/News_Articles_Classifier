Photo: Leanne Pickett by Jared Lynch Joyce Moullakis It was shaping as the winter of Murray Goulburn's discontent when it started a bookbuild for its $500 million partial float.\nOn the second-last day of June, the dairy co-operative's managing director Gary Helou and chief financial officer Brad Hingle bunkered down in the offices of their capital markets investment bank, Macquarie Group.\nDespite Helou's public assurances the float would succeed, market forces threatened otherwise. The ASX was down 2.2 per cent that afternoon, extending its losses to 9.4 per cent since the end of April.\nSeveral institutional investors, which had committed to Murray Goulburn's initial public offering, had withdrawn their support, citing the volatility. And earlier in the month insurance reseller Greenstone, and printer and marketing company IVE Group, abandoned their respective $900 million and $100 million initial public offerings.\nThe situation was tense for all involved.\nBut by the end of the week, after tens of hours of phone calls, Murray Goulburn listed on the ASX. It secured $437.7 million from non-farmer investors, and another $62.3 million from two supplier share offers, meeting its $500 million target.\n'Bugger all difference' The final unit price, $2.10, was at the bottom of the range, but as Murray Goulburn shareholder and supplier Craig Dettling said: \"That makes bugger all difference. At least they got the money.\"\n So how did the partial listing of Australia's biggest milk processor succeed?\nEven when the market was shaky, Murray Goulburn's board remained confident the capital raising to fund sweeping upgrades across the co-operative factories, to focus more on high-value dairy goods – such as infant formula and consumer beverages and cheeses – would succeed.\nIt took hope from Macquarie's team, led by bankers David Mustow and Hugh Falcon. They helped to identify two cornerstone investors, while the co-operative found another two. On the retail broking side, Evans and Partners, Morgans Financial, PAC Partners, Macquarie and Bell Potter were called on.\nHelou had maintained Murray Goulburn would get support from international investors, particularly in Asia, saying there was \"pent-up demand\" for agriculture stocks. In the Murray Goulburn camp, company secretary and general counsel Fiona Smith was the project leader.\nThe transaction was dubbed Project Two Rivers, drawing on the company's name and the Murray and Goulburn rivers.\nSimple pitch Two weeks before the bookbuild, Helou flew to Hong Kong, then to Europe and New Zealand to sell the float. The pitch was simple. Helou and Hingle took their trusty sachets of milk powder and some of their UHT milk as a great example of the strategy.\nOne investor who was impressed was Chinese billionaire Richard Liu, who is the chief executive of internet retailing giant JD.com.\nJD, which sells Murray Goulburn's Devondale-branded products for more than double the price to China's wealthy middle class, spent $20 million on a 4.6 per cent stake in the trust , becoming its sixth-biggest unit holder.\nLiu and other JD representatives visited Melbourne and Sydney the week of Murray Goulburn's bookbuild to launch an \"Australian mall\", which aimed to sell more locally made products to China.\n\"Launching Australian mall gave us a tremendous opportunity to engage with local brands and evaluate partnerships and investments,\" a JD.com spokesman said.\n\"Our team was very impressed with MG [Murray Goulburn] and we look forward to continuing to develop a relationship with them.\"\nMelbourne-based fund manager Peter Cooper is the biggest unit holder with 7.4 per cent. US-based Anchorage Capital is the second biggest unit holder with 5.7 per cent.\nPath to listing The path to listing began at the co-operative's 2013 annual general meeting, but it wasn't the main agenda item. Lazard, which had conducted an earlier scoping study, was announced as a joint adviser alongside Macquarie, and Herbert Smith Freehills was the law firm appointed. Lazard's Charles Whiting was the advisory firm's point person.\nAt the AGM, Helou was furious at Treasurer Joe Hockey for \"handicapping\" Murray Goulburn's plans to create a \"super co-operative\" by acquiring Australia's oldest listed milk processor, Warrnambool Cheese and Butter (WCB).\nHockey had given Canadian dairy giant Saputo the green light to pursue WCB, while Murray Goulburn had to wait up to six months for the Australian Competition Tribunal to decide on its bid.\nSaputo eventually won the battle, but Murray Goulburn pushed ahead with its capital raising.\nFarmers understood the co-operative's strategy, particularly how focusing more on value-add products and less on bulk dairy goods would insulate them against volatility on commodity markets and deliver a more stable farm gate milk price.\nBut they did not blindly support the float. After 16 workshops, Murray Goulburn's suppliers rubbished the co-operative's plan for farmers to have a minium shareholding.\nProposed 1 share per kg supplied Instead of farmers buying 500 shares at $1 each, it was proposed that a new farmer must hold one share for every kilogram of milk solids its supplied to Murray Goulburn, potentially saddling young farmers with more debt.\n\"It could be hundreds of dollars you have to fork out for shares before you supply anything,\" said Craig Dettling, who milks about 250 cows with wife Rachael at Macarthur in south-west Victoria.\nAfter more farmer workshops, Murray Goulburn's management agreed to keep the 500 share buy-in, except they would be valued at the market price instead of the static $1.\nIt also won over farmers with tying the dividend yield to the milk price. If the milk price is high, so is the dividend. Under the Fonterra model, it's the opposite, with expectations from farmers and investors at times colliding.\nMurray Goulburn's legal advisers Tim McEwen and James Crowe of Freehills said its plan to flip the New Zealand structure ensures the interests of both unitholders and farmer shareholders were aligned, with each benefiting from increases in the milk price.\nHowever, Ian MacAulay, who was Murray Goulburn's chairman from 1998 to 2009, wrote in The Weekly Times in April this year that the capital raising was risking the co-operative structure, saying it would struggle to balance the expectations of supplier shareholders and non-farmer investors.\nBut judging by its performance since its debut, Murray Goulburn appears to have got it right. Its units have gained 13.8 per cent to $2.39, compared with the broader market sagging 1.6 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:04:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
