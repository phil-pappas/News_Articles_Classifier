Daniel Munoz by Ruth Liew The proliferation of listed investment company public offerings that flooded the market in 2014 is expected to end, as investors wade through the choices and cherry pick where to deploy their funds.\nThat is the view of Tom Millner, chief executive of the $977 million BKI Investment Company, the LIC run by the family that established Washington H Soul Pattinson & Co.\n\"There's more capital in the market, but I think the LIC IPO phase has run its course,\" Mr Millner said.\n\"When you're running an LIC you have to offer something different and it's no good just running another one that someone's already offering in the market,\" he said.\nTraditional fund managers have been tapping into the LIC market amid increasing demand from investors hungry for dividends as record low interest rates hit returns. Bell Potter analysis showed there were 74 LICs in the market in January, compared with 60 products the same time in 2014.\nPerpetual raised $250 million in the biggest raising for an LIC since the global financial crisis for the Perpetual Equity Investment Company.\nPerennial Investment Partners launched a listed investment company version of its wealth defender strategy, while Wilson Asset Management has been busy floating two charity-focused LICs.\nPositive for the sector Mr Millner said the explosion of new LICs was healthy for competition and \"it's been a positive for the sector\".\n\"We think it's great because it gives the sector more exposure,\" he said.\nBKI revealed a 15 per cent rise in net profit to $43 million for the year to June. Shareholders will pocket a 3.65¢ a share dividend, up from 3.5¢ in 2014. The improved result can be traced back to higher dividends from mining giant BHP Billiton, Woodside Petroleum, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Suncorp Group and Wesfarmers Limited.\nBKI's portfolio returned 5.6 per cent for the year, which is in line with the benchmark S&P/ASX300 Index's gains.\nThe group's basic earnings per share, before special dividend income, rose 4 per cent to 7.4¢ a share, compared with 7.15¢ a share in 2014.\nAbout $70 million, or 6 per cent, of BKI's portfolio is held in cash. The company has been raising $150 million from investors in the past two years and is waiting to buy stakes in more companies after the August reporting season.\nBKI spent $96 million on buying stakes in various companies during fiscal 2015. Investments during the year included National Australia Bank, APA Group, Sydney Airports, Transurban Group, Qube Logistics and Wesfarmers.\n\"There's no good holding cash with interest rates so low, so we will probably look to deploy that during reporting season,\" Mr Millner said.\nHe warned that it was becoming increasingly difficult for companies to maintain a high income stream, with revenue growth remaining tepid for a number of years. Managers had been forced to focus on cutting expenses to ensure they delivered increased dividends to their shareholders.\n\"We become concerned when companies are not reinvesting back into their business for future growth or can't afford to service their debt,\" he said.\n\"When companies need to address their lack of investment or high debt levels something has to give and it's usually the dividend that goes first. With this in mind BKI will be taking a cautious approach to the next year.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T12:06:26.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
