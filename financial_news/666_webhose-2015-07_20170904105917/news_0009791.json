David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd Jean-Luc Bohbot is the most powerful sugar trader in the world, but that does not explain why he scares the hell out of Australia's canegrowers.\nBohbot is the man who masterminded the purchase of every sugar contract on the ICE futures exchange on one day in May. That deal, for the delivery of 1.9 million tonnes of sugar, set a record for ICE of $US547 million.\nBohbot followed up that mammoth deal with the purchase this month of another 500,000 tonnes of sugar worth $US125 million on the ICE, according to Reuters.\nAs the head of sugar trading for Wilmar Sugar Trading in Singapore, Bohbot will be in charge of marketing sugar processed by Wilmar's sugar mills in Queensland.\nCanegrowers are trying to kill that plan by convincing the federal government to impose on the sugar millers a mandatory code of conduct that would govern all marketing of sugar.\nThe code would force Wilmar and the other Queensland mills owned by China's COFCO and Thailand's Mitr Phol Sugar Group to provide growers with a choice as to who sells two-thirds of all sugar produced by the mills.\nAll three foreign companies have notified their intention to stop using the former single desk called Queensland Sugar Ltd from 2017.\nThe mandatory code has been recommended by the Coalition's Sugar Industry Code of Conduct Taskforce headed by Liberal National Party MP George Christensen and by a Senate Committee.\n This is re-regulation at its best considered it blithely ignores the $440 million spent in 2006 to pay for deregulation of the industry.\nThe issue is too hot to handle for the federal cabinet. Small Business Minister Bruce Billson has now asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and Treasury to \"look at the issues surrounding the sugar industry and report to him on what they are and potential solutions.\"\nA spokesman for Billson said this advice, which would include industry consultation, \"will help inform the government's consideration of a draft code\".\nBy tossing the issue into the bureaucratic review process, there will be uncertainty in the industry for at least six months and probably nine. One of the bitter ironies of this clash between the powerful canegrowers and the foreign companies is that it is the foreigners who provide the best chance of providing access for Australian sugar in overseas markets.\nIt is well known that Australia's free trade agreements with Japan, China and Korea and the potential deal with the US all do nothing for sugar. It is well protected by those countries. Bohbot is actually someone who could help provide greater access to sugar refining in other countries and lift the prices paid to canegrowers in Australia.\nDuring the recent Senate hearings into the sugar industry, claims were made that Bohbot and Wilmar Sugar Trading were conflicted because as millers and sellers of sugar they were both buyers and sellers of the product. But as part of its concessions to canegrowers, Wilmar is willing to share with canegrowers the profits earned on what is called arbitrage trading in sugar, which is the money earned from meeting the demands of users through international shipping.\nWilmar's representative told the Senate that the profit generated \"because of the synergy between the Australian-origin sugar that is traded in Wilmar's book and the other-origin sugar\" would be shared 50-50 with Australian canegrowers.\nBohbot is well known in commodity markets because he opened up new markets for Brazilian sugar in Asia in 2000, including the first sales to Japan. Bohbot owns about 9 per cent of Wilmar Sugar Trading, which is listed on the Singapore Exchange. Directors of the company, including Bohbot, own 22 per cent of the company.\nSouth32 and dividends Diversified mining company and BHP Billiton spin-off South32 has not had a stellar debut as an independent company. But it is probably too early to make well informed judgements.\nAt $1.81 each, shares in the company are down almost 15 per cent from the $2.13 opening price on listing on May 19. The fall is even greater when compared to the high of $2.22 on the first day of trading.\nThat harsh treatment can be partly attributed to the selling facility provided by BHP Billiton to shareholders who wanted to get out of the stock which was handed to them as part of the demerger.\nThe last thing you want in a market that is already nervous about the five year lows in the prices of commodities produced by South32 is a seller who has no regard for value.\nThere have been big movements in the share register since the demerger but it is not clear who is backing the new leadership led by chief executive, Graham Kerr.\nOne issue that has clouded the perceptions of South32 is the prospect of write downs in the fair value of its Australian and South African manganese operations.\nAnalysts have estimated that the non-cash write downs could be as high as $90 million. That has been taken as a negative.\nBut there is a direct flow on effect to dividend payments from reducing South32's asset base. Lower asset values mean lower depreciation charges. That means higher earnings and dividends.\nSouth32 has committed to paying out 40 per cent of its earnings as dividends. Adding $90 million back to earnings through lower depreciation charges would lift earnings in 2016 by about 20 per cent.\nLeading analysts have taken a positive view of the company based on its cost cutting and productivity improvements, which are a function of moving to a regional operating model.\nGlyn Lawcock at UBS released a 90 page report on South32 on Monday which recommended the stock as a \"buy\" with a price target of $2.35.\nLawcock says the company is in the bottom half of the cost curve for its principal commodity exposures of aluminium/alumina, coal and manganese.\nHe expects the company to provide multi-year guidance on production, capital expenditure and cost savings with the release of its 2015 fiscal full year results on August 15. South32 is one of the few companies listed on three exchanges in the UK, South Africa and Australia. That will be a challenge for chief financial officer Brendan Harris as he tries to counter the idea that the smart money got out of South32 as early as possible.\nNAB starts hard sell Investors in Australian banks will get a shock when they read the latest batch of documents detailing the performance and prospects for National Australia Bank's United Kingdom banking business .\nThose used to the local banking market with its high return on equity numbers, low cost to income ratios, high credit quality and substantial market share across product categories will choke at the sight of the Clydesdale Bank.\nIt has a cost to income ratio of 71 per cent compared to about 45 per cent in Australia and return on tangible equity of about 8 per cent compared to ROE in Australia in the mid to high teens.\nBut the 540 pages worth of material published by NAB on Tuesday, ahead of an institutional briefing in London, contain sufficient positive information to give NAB shareholders confidence they can finally be rid of a long standing problem.\nClydesdale Bank may not reach the high performance benchmarks set by the major banks in Australia but it is lifting its game. Over the past three years, it has reshaped its loan book and pulled out of commercial real estate. That segment was a source of impaired assets.\nIt has restored the quality of its loans. The ratio of non-performing loans has fallen from 2.48 per cent to 1.6 per cent. Also, it has strengthened its capital and restored profitability. There is uncertainty about the final cost of Clydesdale's mistreatment of customers despite NAB providing £1.7 billion in capital support and £700 million of utilised conduct provisions.\nChief financial officer, Craig Drummond, said on Tuesday that conditions for the demerger and initial public offering of Clydesdale were favourable given the liquidity in markets and institutional interest in bank stocks.\nThe most recent example of a successful bank IPO in the UK was the sale last year of TSB. It was soon followed by a successful takeover offer from Spain's Banco de Sabadell for £1.7 billion in March.\nDisclosure: The author's super fund owns shares in NAB.\nTONY BOYD\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\ntony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-07-07T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T18:05:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
