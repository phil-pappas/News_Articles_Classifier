The stock will start trading on the Moscow Exchange at 10 a.m.\nThe sale tested investor appetite for banks as they grapple with official interest rates that have doubled since Russiaâ€™s annexation of Crimea in 2014, which triggered sanctions that blocked companies from global debt markets. The placement was the biggest IPO by a Russian company since Lenta Ltd. raised about $952 million in February 2014.\nThe dollar-denominated RTS Index has risen 19 percent in 2015, compared with a 2 percent gain for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.\nA fragile truce in Ukraine has driven appetite for Russian assets this year, allowing United Wagon Co. to raise 9 billion rubles in an April IPO, while Lenta sold $225 million of shares in a secondary placement a month earlier. A company linked to billionaire Sergei Galitskiy raised 9.8 billion rubles offering stock in his retailer PJSC Magnit in February.\nVTB Capital was the global coordinator and bookrunner for the IPO.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T10:14:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
