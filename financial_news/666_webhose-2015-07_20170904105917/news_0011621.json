This could range from policies that govern nursing practices in wards. They could also help determine the roles of different categories of nurses or how nursing qualifications should be aligned. \nBut there are several challenges that stand in their way. \nOne challenge is that the nursing profession is divided about which groups of nursing stakeholders should legitimately represent nursing issues in the policy arena. There is also a lack of collective action within nursing groups, so nurses do not have a unified voice. \nTensions have arisen because nursing divisions nationally and provincially report to three different entities instead of one. And power relations influence who participates in the policy, how this happens and how much nurses' inputs are considered and incorporated. \nThe appointment of the chief nursing officer in 2014 and the creation of the Nursing Directorate in the National Health Department could be the glue the nursing fraternity needs to bind together its inputs in policies. \nSouth Africa must learn from other countries \nGlobally, there is an increased emphasis for nurses to get involved in health policy and systems development. In countries where it has happened, the contribution from nurses to develop patient care and population health policies has been significant . \nAustralia, Canada, the UK and the US all have professional nursing associations through which individual nurses and the nursing profession can exercise power and influence policy. \nThere are also several examples in low- and middle-income countries where nurses, through professional organisations, have advocated for health policies. \nIn Rwanda, the chief nurse and the national nursing association garnered support for legislation to improve the quality of nursing education and professional standards. In Kenya, the Nursing Council was critical in developing the national electronic database on the nursing workforce . \nAlthough South Africa has a nursing council, it does not fulfil the same roles as councils in other countries. \nHow much South African frontline nurses know about policy \nThat frontline nurses in South Africa do not engage in policymaking enough is reflected in their knowledge about key policies. To gain an understanding of this, our research looked at how much nurses understood four national health workforce policies: \nthe 2008 Nursing Strategy; \nthe revision of the Scope of Practice for nurses; \nthe new Framework for Nursing Qualifications; and \nthe Occupation Specific Dispensation remuneration policy. \nNurses and key informants were interviewed in four South African provinces: the Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng and Western Cape. To assess the impact of nursing policy issues on the ground, frontline nurses and shop stewards were quizzed on the policies. \nWe found the nature of the policy determined their level of awareness. \nAll the enrolled, professional and operational nurses and shop stewards and close to 90% of the nursing assistants knew about the occupation-specific dispensation policy. This may be because it affected them directly and involved money. The policy provides for financial incentives designed to attract and retain health professionals. \nNurse managers and shop stewards were more likely to know about the other policies compared to other nursing categories. This was possibly because managers who attended meetings discussing policies did not provide feedback. \nNurses without voices \nThe research also sought to understand how nurses' viewed their involvement in policy formulation. While democracy created opportunities for nurses to participate in policy development, our respondents felt nurses participation was sub-optimal. \nThe respondents felt that: \nnurse leaders were not assertive; \nthey were reactive rather than proactive; \noften they only participated in policy-making when decisions were concluded; \nthere were too few nurses in leadership positions; and \nthere was a lack of training in policy and networking skills. \nIn addition, frontline nurses were excluded from contributing to the broader health workforce policies. As a result, policymakers were not tapping into their clinical expertise. When frontline nurses were involved, they seldom participated because they were intimidated by the presence of their managers and the dominance of physicians, hospital chief executives and human resource managers. \nChanging the status quo \nSouth African Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has emphasised that nurses will play a critical role in implementing the changes in the run-up to the country's plans for universal health coverage . \nThe health system reforms will create different work demands. Nurses should be provided with opportunities to influence and direct policies that affect them. \nBut to increase nurses' participation in future policy, the chief nursing officer must provide proactive leadership. Strong support will also be needed from the national nursing association.
