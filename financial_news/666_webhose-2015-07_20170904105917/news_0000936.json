David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd When Macquarie banking analyst Mike Wiblin attacked the ANZ Banking Group's Asian strategy he struck a raw nerve at one of the few local companies to have taken regional expansion seriously.\nWiblin's research note published this month pulled no punches . He warned that ANZ's sale of stakes in Asian associates would fill a capital hole but this would erode earnings by up to 10 per cent.\nAlso, he raised doubts about the bank's ability to meet its 2017 Asian revenue target of 25 to 30 per cent of total revenue. Of most concern to shareholders was the claim that ANZ might be forced to cut its dividend because lower Asian earnings would boost the payout ratio to levels that were too high.\nThe negativity was in keeping with Wiblin's year-old \"underperform\" recommendation for ANZ shares.\nIt prompted a scathing response from ANZ deputy chief executive Graham Hodges, who has just returned from an overseas trip involving visits to about 25 equity investors and about a dozen debt investors.\nHe staunchly defended the security of dividend payments and punched holes in the analyst's work.\nIn an exclusive interview with Chanticleer, Hodges intimated that Wiblin had failed to understand critical aspects of ANZ's super regional strategy and had missed important structural differences in the Asian and Australian revenue mix.\nHe also, for the first time, played down the idea that the Asian revenue target was set in stone.\n Wiblin said that if ANZ disposed of its associate interests in Asia it would free up assets with about $4.58 billion in equity value. The main associates are: AmBank in Malaysia, Panin in Indonesia and Shanghai Rural and Bank of Tianjin in China.\nWhile the analyst acknowledged this could help lift the bank's core equity tier one capital by up to 118 basis points, it would not solve ANZ's capital intensity problem.\n\"The problem centres on the self-funding issues that are caused by rapid risk-weighted asset growth in markets with lower return on equity,\" Wiblin said.\nThe return on equity earned by ANZ through its Asian associates ranges from 8.8 per cent to 22.5 per cent and averages 13.7 per cent, according to Wiblin.\nHodges said these calculations were misleading because they included the annualising of first-half earnings and made assumptions about equity positions based on carrying values at the end of the 2014 financial year. ANZ does not disclose the equity in its associates.\nHodges said ANZ's partnerships in Asia were less strategically important now, particularly given the 100 per cent deduction of capital imposed by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.\n\"The partnership businesses were there to learn about the market build,\" Hodges said. \"When we built our stakes in a couple of banks we thought there may well be longer-term paths for control.\"\nBut Hodges said where partnerships did not add value ANZ had sold out. A good example was Vietnam, where it sold out of its interest in a local bank but remains one of the largest foreign banks.\n\"The strategic importance of partnerships is much less significant. We are happy to pursue organic growth where we have local licences,\" he said.\nAll over Asia ANZ owns licences in Indonesia, China and India. It does not have a licence in Malaysia. It has a very successful partnership in the Philippines.\nANZ is expected to announce it has a foreign bank licence in Bangkok next week.\nThe disposal of interests in Asia will have a significant impact on capital at ANZ at a time when APRA is pushed for the big four banks to have about 200 basis points of additional capital.\nAbout half of that additional capital is expected to be needed to cover change in the risk weighting of capital for residential mortgages in Australia. The exact amount of the new risk weighting for Australian mortgages is expected to be released by APRA next week.\nHodges said the sale of the Panin Bank stake would free up about 50 to 60 basis points of capital. Another asset disposal that will free up capital is Esanda. Its sale will release about 20 basis points of capital.\nHodges said Wiblin's comment that the Asian associates are above group average ROE based on 2013 and 2014 levels is not consistent â€“ \"it's not the case. You should be aware that his analysis is pretty thin.\"\nHodges said the real issue for ANZ was not pulling out of associates in Asia, it was where to deploy the capital.\n\"The real issue is what do you do with the money?\" he said.\n\"We could use it elsewhere in the business. As we said in our last half-year results we plan to invest more in NSW which provides a different capital ratio outcome and return.\" Hodges said it would be unlikely for ANZ to distribute the capital to shareholders. But an alternative to investing in loan assets in NSW was to invest in the bank's efficiency by improving straight-through processing which would reduce the cost-to-income ratio.\nEfficiency a hallmark of Smith's tenure That objective of achieving greater efficiency has been one of the hallmarks of the eight-year tenure of Mike Smith as chief executive of ANZ.\nSmith will next week extend the bank's Asian network by opening another branch in India. He will also take the opportunity to open a 2275-seat IT centre in Bengaluru, which was until recently called Bangalore. ANZ has 7200 staff in India working in hubs that support the bank's operations across Asia.\nHodges said Wiblin's questioning of the sustainability of the ANZ dividend was not well informed.\nIn his note to clients Wiblin said: \"Finally the current payout ratio for ANZ is 72 per cent. Divestment of all of the stakes would see earnings hit and the payout ratio rise to 79 per cent.\n\"This would result in the need to 'right size' the dividend in our view. In addition, while the book value of the stakes are a deduction from regulatory capital, the stakes do help with capital generation via the dividends that are paid, something that would be missed by ANZ if the stakes were divested.\"\nHowever, Hodges said: \"I can't see the factual base for that at all. We can either deploy the capital to generate revenue or save costs. Those work towards a dividend payment.\n\"Our dividend policy is 65 to 70 per cent of cash earnings and we are at the higher end of that at the moment.\n\"That's an important ratio for us in today's market place because people focus very much on yield.\n\"In our view, both the board and management take that as an important ratio to support, and the business does support that.\"\nHodges said the bank's revenue mix in Asia was very different from Australia and that helped explain why different growth rates in risk-weighted assets was not an issue. Also, he said it was dangerous to ignore the impact of foreign exchange.\nHe said $16 billion of risk weight growth was driven by growth in business and $15.4 billion by foreign exchange impacts because of the fall in the Australian dollar. Hodges said ANZ was able to get a better return across its businesses because of different levels of fee and non-interest income.\n\"In Australia three-quarters of our revenue comes as net interest income and 25 per cent in fees,\" he said. \"In Asia it's about 55 per cent in fees and 45 per cent in net interest income. That quite higher percentage in fees is deliberate.\" He said 70 per cent of ANZ's balance sheet in Asia was less than one-year maturity.\nMargins in custody Chanticleer mistakenly said in an article earlier in the week that margins in the custody business were 2 to 3 per cent of assets. The real number is 2 to 3 basis points, which means the $65billion TCorp contract would be worth up to $195 million a year in revenue.\nDisclosure: The author's self-managed super fund owns shares in ANZ.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-07-16T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:09:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
