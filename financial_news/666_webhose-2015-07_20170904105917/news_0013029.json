Although ITG didn’t identify anyone involved by name, Mittal is a key figure in that inquiry, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the investigation is private.\nMittal didn’t respond to requests for comment. Mike Geller, a spokesman for Greenwich, Connecticut-based AQR, declined to comment. AQR oversees about $136 billion of assets.\nMittal left ITG by July 2011, when a Traders Magazine article reported that he was one of six managing directors leaving the firm in a cost-cutting measure. Mittal had been a managing director and head of liquidity management and algorithmic trading at the firm, the magazine said.\nITG disclosed Wednesday that a market-making unit run by a subsidiary in 2010 and 2011 traded using information not available to other customers of its dark pool. ITG said it’s in talks with the agency to settle the case for $20.3 million, which would be a record fine for a private stock-trading platform in the U.S.\n‘Ultimately Severed’ ITG Chief Executive Officer Bob Gasser made several references Thursday to a former employee he didn’t identify who was purportedly involved in the case. While apologizing during the conference call with analysts, the CEO highlighted the actions of the former employee, who Gasser said was “ultimately severed from the company.”\nJ.T. Farley, an ITG spokesman, declined to comment, as did the SEC’s Judy Burns.\nThe SEC’s case against ITG is focused on customer disclosures, regulatory filings for the dark pool and customer information controls, the company said in a statement late Wednesday. It is negotiating a settlement with the agency, saying it will probably eclipse the previous record fine paid by a dark-pool operator.\nThe problematic behavior was led by a senior employee who operated in a manner that violated ITG policy, Gasser said Thursday, without identifying the former worker.\nFor several months in 2010, the employee improperly accessed information regarding orders flowing into ITG’s trading algorithms and improperly accessed information about executions by all customers in markets away from its dark pool that was not otherwise available to ITG clients, Gasser said.", "external_links": ["http://www.tradersmagazine.com/news/itg-axes-managers-cutbacks-107854-1.html#Login\\", "http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/920424/000110465915054383/0001104659-15-054383-index.htm\\"], "published": "2015-07-31T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T04:09:23.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
