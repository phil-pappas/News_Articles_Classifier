At 0915, the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 0.1%, Germany's DAX was 0.1% higher and France's CAC 40 was up 0.4%. \n\"European shares are trading little changed this morning as once again solid corporate earnings out of Europe are being neutralised by weaker Chinese markets,\" said Markus Huber, senior analyst at Peregrine & Black . \n\"Concerning China all eyes are on the release of tomorrow's important manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs. Further indications that the economy is still not anywhere close to turning the corner could certainly spook Chinese stocks again which already have been battered substantially over the past few weeks,\" he added. \nChina's Shanghai Composite fell over 1% on Friday. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in French bank BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) made strong gains after it swung to a profit of €2.56bn in the second quarter, compared with a loss of €4.22bn the previous year. \nCarrefour (Paris: FR0000120172 - news ) nudged a touch higher after it reported a rise in first-half profit on the back of stronger sales in its home market, while Airbus rallied after posting a 6% increase in first-half core operating profit. \nBG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) edged higher. Although it posted a 65% slump in second-quarter net income on the back of declining oil prices, the numbers were still ahead of expectations. \nBritish Airways and Iberia owner International Consolidated Airlines Group pushed up after it it beat profit forecasts for the second quarter and said it enjoyed a 5.6% increase in passengers. \nOn the downside, Vallourec (Xetra: VAC.DE - news ) slumped nearly 6% after saying its net loss worsened in the second quarter and cautioning that falling demand in the oil and gas industry will hit the second half. \nIn London, shares in Lloyds Banking Group slipped. The bank reported a 15% increase in underlying first-half profits but its second-quarter disappointed. \nOn the data front, the flash estimate of Eurozone inflation for July is due at 1000 BST, along with the unemployment rate for the bloc. In the US, all eyes will be on the Chicago PMI at 1445 BST and University of Michigan sentiment at 1500 BST.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:38:10.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
