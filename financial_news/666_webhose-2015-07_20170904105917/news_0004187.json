Peter Braig Share on twitter by Jamie Freed Airlines are facing \"close to an asymmetric warfare\" from cyber attackers given the difficulty of defending systems when the threat continually evolves, says International Air Transport Association chief executive Tony Tyler.\n\"No business is immune, but aviation is a specific target for those intent on doing cyber mischief and theft - or worse,\" he said in a speech at the Civil Aviation Cyber Security Conference in Singapore on Thursday. \"Airlines are the highest value target for fraudsters and close to 50 per cent of all phishing attempts are made against airlines and airline passengers, according to one security firm we work with.\"\nIATA's membership includes most of the world's biggest airlines, including Qantas Airways and Virgin Australia Holdings, and the group operates financial systems through which flow $US388 billion of annual air travel related revenues.\nThe potential loss of passenger data including passport numbers and credit card information would be damaging for an airline, but hacking also could compromise the physical security of passengers or force airlines to ground planes.\n\"What we are facing is close to an asymmetric warfare in which it is easier to attack than defend,\" he said.\nThere has been increased scrutiny on the security of airline systems following an apparent cyber-attack on LOT Polish Airlines computers issuing flight plans in Warsaw last month. And this week, United Airlines grounded its US fleet, reportedly after a faulty computer network router disrupted its reservation systems . There was no indication it was a cyber attack, but it showed how vulnerable airlines are to technology failures.\nMr Tyler said the cost of successful cyber attack in any major industry could run into the \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" and leave a company's reputation in tatters. But in aviation, an attack could also paralyse operations or result in thousands of stranded passengers.\nAirlines have increasingly turned to computers and outside contractors for tasks like payload calculations, which used to be done by pilots in the cockpit. Mr Tyler said the outsourcing of the task freed the pilots to focus on other pre-flight activities, and there was little double a computer could do the job faster and with at least as much accuracy. But he warned every automation brought a new challenge of securing the information it relied upon.\n \"The number of entry points into systems is increasing steadily,\" he said. \"The more systems we automate, the more vendors we have and the more interfaces we have that can be targeted for attack.\"\nMr Tyler said it was important that governments, which have resources and access to intelligence that could never be replicated in the private sector, helped support the airline industry's efforts to protect against cyber threats.\n\"Today, constraints of national classification systems and ambiguities around the legal rights and mechanisms for sharing information across borders are particularly challenging,\" he said. \"However, the significant risks of not sharing information demand more progress in this area. It is not acceptable that one airline may have access to information and best practices regarding appropriate cyber measures and potential vulnerabilities while another carrier does not, simply because it is based in a different country.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Jamie_Freed", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/aviation/united-airlines-flights-grounded-after-computer-glitch-20150708-gi86pz.html"], "published": "2015-07-10T07:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T06:05:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
