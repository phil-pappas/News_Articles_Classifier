The company has begun expanding outside of China into India and Southeast Asia, and has plans to sell in Brazil as well. \nLenovo was number five on the list with a market share of 4.8 percent, as the Chinese electronics giant was helped by its acquisition of the Motorola brand from Google (Xetra: A0B7FY - news ) . \n\"Lenovo continued to witness success in many emerging markets such as India with entry-level and mid-range models,\" IDC said. \n\"The Motorola brand within the Americas and Europe continues to thrive with the ultra-affordable second generation Moto E and entry-level to mid-range Moto G devices.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T19:26:38.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
