The annual pace of inflation ticked up to 1.5 percent, from 1.3 percent, but came in below expectations.\nKey measures of underlying inflation favoured by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) rose around 0.6 percent for the quarter to match market forecasts.\nCrucially, the annual pace of core inflation at around 2.3 percent stayed comfortably in the lower half of the RBA's target band of 2 to 3 percent.\nInflation has now been within the target range for no less than five years - a goldilocks scenario that was low enough to allow interest rates to be slashed but high enough to dodge the dangers of deflation.\n\"It's been a very good outcome, because you really don't want inflation going too low these days,\" says David de Garis, a senior economist at National Australia Bank.\n\"It means the RBA has time to judge the impact of past easing, without having an urgent need to do any more.\"\nRates are already at an all-time low of 2.0 percent having been cut twice this year, and the RBA has said that further action is possible given the benign outlook for prices.\nMinutes of its July policy meeting released this week showed the Board was confident there was enough spare capacity in the labour market to keep wages, and thus inflation, in check.\nUnit labour costs have been little changed for around four years now.\nYet neither has inflation slowed to the lows that so plague policymakers in areas such as the euro zone and Japan.\nThis is largely due to costs for goods and services that are not open to international competition, known as non-tradables, which make up 60 percent of the CPI basket.\nIn the year to June non-tradable inflation ran at 2.6 percent, while tradable prices actually fell 0.3 percent.\nMuch of the rise has been in health, education and products such as tobacco where taxes have been lifted.\nOnce, stubbornly high non-tradable costs were considered a major drawback, but in a world where deflation is the danger they are proving unexpectedly helpful.
