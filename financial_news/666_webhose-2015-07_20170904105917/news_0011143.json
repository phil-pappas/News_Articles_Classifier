The planes are uncomfortable as airlines who are looking for ways to increase profits have shrunk the legroom by putting in more seats. Furthermore they offer fewer flights as they used to so every seat is crammed on most flights. \nGoing through security is not only time consuming and annoying, there is inconsistency from one airport to another, especially in different countries, with respect to removing your shoes, or not, the liquids that can or cannot be brought through. \nIn other words, the whole dog and pony show, is one big hassle. \nBut flight delays and the lack of communication of airline staff to passengers, as to the reason and length is the worst part about modern air travel. \nIn most western countries, governments have recently implemented a passenger bill of rights, to prevent airlines form subjecting their passengers to very long flight delays. The only exception is weather delays, but even then, there are limits. \nIt’s one thing to be in the relatively comfortable departure lounge when there is a flight delay versus sitting on the tarmac. You at least can walk around the terminal, buy food and drinks or just chill and wait for boarding. \nThere is nothing worse in a flight delay to have already boarded the plane and yet, the takeoff is very delayed. It gets even worse when communication from the flight staff is spotty and the ultimate pain, occurs when the pilot shuts off the engines. When this happens, there is no ventilation, the bathroom gets stuffy (to put it charitably) and there is no potable water to drink. \nSome flights are delayed on the airport \"tarmac\" before taking off or after landing. DOT rules prohibit most U.S. airlines from allowing a domestic flight to remain on the tarmac for more than three hours unless: the pilot determines that there is a safety or security reason why the aircraft cannot taxi to the gate and deplane its passengers, or Air traffic control advises the pilot that taxiing to the gate (or to another location where passengers can be deplaned) would significantly disrupt airport operations. \nWhile there is recourse in theory for passengers, unfortunately many airlines fail to deliver the required monetary compensation in a timely manner. Fortunately, there are firms who specialize in helping you get what you deserve. \nThere is a particular firm based in the U.K. that even offers a contingency fee, meaning unless you receive a satisfactory monetary award for your trouble, you do not pay them anything for their time. That’s how confident they are in getting you the proper resolution.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T01:39:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
