Getty by James Mackintosh Markets are easier to explain when there are heroes and villains. The traditional story was of widows and orphans seeing their savings filched by the bad boys of Wall Street. The modern version sees pension funds drained by the \"flash boys\" of New Jersey and Chicago, and their high-frequency trading systems.\nThere are few heroes and no villains in this last's report on the so-called flash rally in US Treasury bonds of October 15, produced by five regulators. Investors should pay attention anyway: it contains important lessons about the danger of following the herd.\nOn the day I was sitting by a terminal, awestruck at the disaster unfurling on the screen. That day's moves were of the size that can end careers. The benchmark 10-year bond yield plunged 0.36 percentage points, before recovering, with a round trip of 0.16 points in 12 minutes, what the watchdogs call the \"event window\". There have been only three other daily moves this size since 1998, and all had obvious causes.\nAfter analysing trading on the day in millisecond detail, the regulators were left scratching their heads. There was no algorithm running wild, nor a single massive buyer pushing prices up (and so yields down). Indeed, while it became harder than usual to make large trades, the market worked smoothly even in the \"event window\", and record volumes of bonds and futures were traded.\nOne conclusion is that markets are complex; trying to understand exactly what triggered a move is like asking which snowflake caused an avalanche.\nThere were patterns of snowflakes on October 15, though, which investors need to understand. The same patterns were behind the \"francmaggedon\" when the Swiss franc leapt a fifth against the euro in just hours in January and the German 10-year yield soared 15-fold in 13 days in April. The pattern is one of crowded trades, large numbers of investors buying into the same story, in large part because others are buying into it, too. Since they have only a shaky belief that they are right, once prices move against them they lose confidence, closing out trades and accelerating the price move.\nIn October a crowded trade was in the process of being unwound, as those betting on an imminent rate rise worried about weakness in the US economy. Speculative futures bets on rising rates, as well as on rate-sensitive two-year bond yields rising, were dropping from record levels hit the previous month.\nEarly in the day of the flash rally, bonds had an outsized response to disappointing retail sales figures, perhaps because it eliminated the last hope of those gambling on growth. Bets against the Swiss franc were similarly crowded by those who believed the Swiss National Bank's promise to cap the exchange rate; when the cap was removed, those trades made no sense and had to be closed immediately.\n The Bund bubble, meanwhile, was as crowded as trades can get. Even though everyone knew negative yields as far out as nine-year bonds made no sense for Germany, traders saw the chance to make money in the short term as the European Central Bank was willing to buy at almost any price.\nThe problem for the investor trying to avoid crowded trades is not just spotting them, but managing to resist joining in. The basis for crowding is usually compelling. The US economy seemed to be doing well; the Swiss central bank was stopping the currency strengthening; and the ECB seemed to be offering a guarantee of easy profit on German bonds. The fact everyone agreed seemed not to matter.\nIt is hard to buck the consensus. Investors need to recognise that while the story may be obvious, the risk that it is wrong is not properly discounted. When that risk becomes clear, \"the mass volte face is what causes some of these crowded trades to reverse spectacularly,\" says Altaf Kassam, head of equity applied research at MSCI.\nMSCI has combined common measures such as mutual fund holdings and hedge fund futures positions with valuations and correlations to try to spot crowds. The trade of the moment is the bet on easy money continuing even after the first rate rise from the Fed, with shares in highly-leveraged companies which benefit from low rates having an MSCI \"amber\" crowding warning.\nA similar bet helped the Nasdaq hit a new high yesterday, as investors look for growth from technology and biotech, rather than from the world economy.\nThe popular market villains came out of this week's report with burnished reputations. Far from exiting en masse, computerised traders continued to make markets in the flash rally, albeit in smaller size, as banks pulled back.\nInvestors should be concerned that with little understanding of the cause, such extreme volatility may be repeated. But it is only short-term noise. Those who want to be heroes should focus instead on avoiding the crowds.\nJames Mackintosh is the investment editor for the FT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T08:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T03:45:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
