By Phalguni Soni 17 minutes ago  \n( Continued from Prior Part ) Beauty products companies outperform \nAs we saw in the last article, stock price performance for fast-moving consumer goods (or FMCG) companies and the overall consumer staples sector (XLP) has trailed the broader market (SPY) (IVV) in 2015. \nHowever, beauty products companies L’Oréal (LRLCY), Estée Lauder (EL), Inter Parfums (IPAR), and Coty (COTY) have outperformed returns on the S&P Supercomposite Household & Personal Products Industry Group. The latter posted total returns of -6.6% year-to-date through June 23. In comparison, COTY posted 53.9%, EL returned 15.8%, and L’Oréal had 15.6%. \nCoty’s been the best performer in this peer group, with total returns of 53.9% year-to-date. Inter Parfums (IPAR), which is buying the Rochas fragrance line from Procter & Gamble (PG), posted the next best return at almost 27%. IPAR is up by 15.5% since March 18, a day before the Rochas deal was announced. Rising valuations \nBeauty products companies are also trading at significantly higher valuations. The spate of acquisitions and innovations, particularly at the higher-end of the market, has led to an increase in valuations for some companies in the industry. \nValuations for EL, for instance, have risen more than 21% so far this year, to 27.8x forward earnings. Coty’s (COTY) valuation is up by 58.9% to 34.3x forward earnings. IPAR’s valuation is up 28.5% to 32.9x forward earnings. \nCoty’s valuations spiked following the news report on June 15 that it will purchase some of P&G’s beauty brands. According to the report, Coty won the auction for three of Procter & Gamble’s lines of business for ~$12 billion. The companies haven’t confirmed the report. Category growth \nEstée Lauder (EL) has snapped up several prestigious brands since late last year. The high-end beauty segment is growing at a faster pace than the mass market around the world. The high-end beauty industry grew at a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of ~5% from 2009–2014. The mass market segment grew between 3% and 4%. \nThese companies are hungry and growing, and more acquisitions could follow. \nFor more sector updates, be sure to visit our Consumer & Retail page. \nBrowse this series on Market Realist:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T01:25:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
