San Francisco, by contrast, has an occupancy rate of 87.5%, but its room rates grew by nearly 9% to $219 in the second quarter.\n“It doesn’t make sense that hotel rooms are full in New York and rates are down,” said STR’s senior vice president, Jan Freitag. “The hotels don’t have pricing power.”\n“Tourism is only getting better, but there are a lot of new hotels and Airbnb is a factor … continuing to put pressure on rates,” said hotelier Richard Born, who operates the Maritime, Mercer and Pod hotels, among others.\nThe first quarter (normally a slow time) was worse, however, down 4.1% to $204 per night.\nThere are more than 14,000 hotel rooms under development in New York, mostly budget-oriented properties. In total, the city has about 105,000 hotel rooms.\nThere is no shortage of tourists coming here either. The city attracted a record 54.6 million tourists last year and estimates that 58.1 million will arrive this year.\nThis report first appeared on NYPost.com\nMore on hotels and travel: A tour of the world’s first robot-staffed hotel 10 of best-rated hotels in the world The most baby-friendly travel destinations 5 places in Europe deal hunters should visit right now How to vacation like the 1%", "external_links": ["http://nypost.com/2015/07/29/spending-the-night-in-new-york-city-is-actually-getting-cheaper/"], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:02:59.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
