In addition it's running competitions where winners get currency that they can convert into songs. \nAfter the beta is over, users will have two choices: downloading (N20 per song or N100 per album) or to subscribe, getting access to all the music for N500. The Boom Player service users have access to most genres of Africa music including: Afrobeats, Afro-Juju, Benga, Pop, Afro-Pop, Hip-Hop, RnB and Reggae. The current two most popular artists on the platform are Burna Boy and 2Face. \nThe next phase of content development will be to work with both artists and labels to produce its own own content:\"We want to do some exclusive projects.\" They also have music videos on the platform which cost N30 per download. \nAll the content is acquired legally with a 3 page non-exclusive distribution agreement being put in place with the artist or whoever has rights for the music: \"If an artist wants to get their music on the platform, they can send us their email or come to the office. Once the contract's signed the artist gets access to the CMS back-end. If they have Internet, they can upload the content themselves and if not, they can get us the files and we'll do it.\" \nOne of the big advantages of the system is that the artist and/or his or her management can log into the system to see real time stats on where sales have been made broken down by country. They may not be making a lot of money from online to start with but if one country suddenly gets a lot of downloads, you can think about touring. It will help the whole ecosystem which often operates without any clear data.\" \nThe net revenue split is 60% to the artist and 40% to TECNO which is currently better than the deal on the table from most mobile operators. Artists and labels can choose to give music and videos away for free if they are promoting a particular song or album. \nPayment can be made through one of three ways: by phone credits (which has proved most popular so far), credit and debit cards and gift cards (which are the equivalent of scratch cards). \nOn a reasonable connection it can take as little as ten seconds to download a song. Through its relationship with the mobile operators, it's going to be offering users music specific data bundles to address the inevitable cost of data issues. \n\"The next music phone comes out this month. The numbers will increase with more phone sales. The old Palm Play music service on featurephones had 12 million users before it was scrapped. It's looking very, very promising.\" \nTECNO's Oye Akideinde is one of the new breed of digital strategists.
