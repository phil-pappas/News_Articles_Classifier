Source: CourierMail\nPROPERTY DATA\nThis means looking at things like time on market and vendor discounting.\nMr Lawless said when the number of days it took to sell and the amount sellers had to reduce from their original asking price dropped, that usually meant demand was picking up in a suburb.\n“Essentially what we are looking at here is the balance between buyers and sellers,’’ he said.\n“Those suburbs where sellers are becoming more empowered, you are going to see price growth in those areas.’’\nA three-bedroom townhouse is the only residential property listed at Jannali in New South Wales. Picture: realestate.com.au Source: Supplied\nThe latest CoreLogic RP Data figures reveal Jannali in the Sutherland Shire in Sydney was the suburb which had the shortest average days on market out of all the capital city regions in Australia.\nProperties listed there take on average just 12 days to sell. There is only one residential property listed for sale in Jannali on realestate.com.au\nIt is a three-bedroom townhouse which will be auctioned on July 11.\nKnoxfield in Victoria is the suburb which has the least amount of vendor discounting out of all the capital city regions in Australia.\nOn average sellers don’t have to reduce their asking price to achieve a sale.\nLISTINGS\n“When you see listings numbers starting to move lower that can mean the market place is quite tight in terms of supply,’’ Mr Lawless said.\nThis often resulted in more competition which could drive prices higher.\nRIPPLE AFFECT\nAlso keep an eye out for suburbs which may undergo a ripple affect in price growth. They are the suburbs next to strong performing suburbs, but which haven’t taken off yet.\nMr Lawless said if there was no reason for the current lower values, it was worth looking at because as buyers were priced out of popular areas they often looked to neighbouring suburbs, and as a result prices would start to grow.\nKnoxfield in Victoria is the suburb which has the least amount of vendor discounting. Picture: realestate.com.a u Source: Supplied\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nMr Lawless said major infrastructure projects, anything from new roads, tunnels, train stations, shopping centres and schools, could drive up values. Just make sure you don’t buy right on top of it. And he warned you need to buy at the right time, the chance to take advantage of the price growth usually disappeared once the work was finished.\nHotspotting’s Terry Ryder said he looked at transaction levels to pick areas of future price growth.\nMr Ryder said once transaction levels started to lift in a suburb price growth generally followed.\nBased on that formula he tipped Logan in Brisbane’s south as the next area to take off.\nWagstaffe in Gosford is the suburb within capital city regions which returned the best indicative gross rental yield in the past 12 months. Picture: realestate.com.au Source: Supplied\nIndicative gross rental yields can also be a worthwhile tool for working out whether a suburb is performing strongly and worth investing in.\nWagstaffe in Gosford returned the best indicative gross rental yield of 20.6 per cent out of all the capital city regions in the past 12 months, according to CoreLogic RP Data figures.\nSimon Pressley of Propertyology reckons affordability plays a big role.\n“The biggest influence on demand for a commodity is affordability,’’ he said.\nHe said the best performing locations had lower-entry prices than more desirable locations with bigger price tags.\n“For example, over the last fifteen years the Victorian regional town of Ararat with very affordable housing performed better than the affluent inner-city Melbourne suburb of Richmond,’’ he said.\nHe also looked at industry and how they supported the local economy in terms of employment.\n“Where ever there is demand for a job there is demand for accommodation,’’ he said.\n“A strong jobs trend is the primary reason for Propertyology forecasting Gold Coast to perform well over the next couple of years.’’\nSupply and approvals is also an important consideration when picking future growth suburbs.\n“Property is a long-term asset class so our focus as professional investors is primarily on longer-term economic drivers, affordability, and the supply pipeline.\n ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/experts-give-their-tips-on-how-to-pick-the-suburbs-which-will-have-future-price-growth/story-fncq3era-1227435045686?sv=23b709198e4fddf8693d4c04d2bd55db&title=How+to+pick+suburbs+about+to+take+off", "http://www.realestate.com.au/property-house-vic-knoxfield-120144793", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=How+to+pick+suburbs+about+to+take+off&c=WOULDN%26%238217%3BT+it+be+great+if+you+could+pick+the+next+suburb+where+price+growth+was+going+to+take+off%3F+Our+experts+reveal+their+tips+for+predicting+where+they+are.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/experts-give-their-tips-on-how-to-pick-the-suburbs-which-will-have-future-price-growth/story-fncq3era-1227435045686?sv=23b709198e4fddf8693d4c04d2bd55db", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/experts-give-their-tips-on-how-to-pick-the-suburbs-which-will-have-future-price-growth/story-fncq3era-1227435045686?sv=23b709198e4fddf8693d4c04d2bd55db&title=How+to+pick+suburbs+about+to+take+off", "http://www.propertyology.com.au/", "http://www.realestate.com.au/property-townhouse-nsw-jannali-120034997", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/experts-give-their-tips-on-how-to-pick-the-suburbs-which-will-have-future-price-growth/story-fncq3era-1227435045686?sv=23b709198e4fddf8693d4c04d2bd55db&h=How+to+pick+suburbs+about+to+take+off", "http://www.hotspotting.com.au/", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/experts-give-their-tips-on-how-to-pick-the-suburbs-which-will-have-future-price-growth/story-fncq3era-1227435045686?sv=23b709198e4fddf8693d4c04d2bd55db", "http://www.corelogic.com.au/", "http://www.realestate.com.au/property-house-nsw-wagstaffe-119684363", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/experts-give-their-tips-on-how-to-pick-the-suburbs-which-will-have-future-price-growth/story-fncq3era-1227435045686?sv=23b709198e4fddf8693d4c04d2bd55db"], "published": "2015-07-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T08:30:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
