Now’s the time to take a deep breath and get ready to make an offer on that perfect property. Here’s a few tips on going about it in a productive – and hopefully positive – way. \nMy first piece of advice is to check in with yourself: are you prepared to be a homeowner? Keep in mind that while there is plenty of reward to the endeavor, there is also a lot of work and maintenance involved. Once you’ve decided that you’re game, you need to figure out how much you can afford. Consult with a loan agent or other mortgage professional to crunch the numbers. \nNow it’s time to check out homes for sale in your desired neighborhoods. This will also tell you a lot about what you can and can’t afford, and in turn, this will help you formulate and revise a desired wish list of what you would like to have in a property. Make sure you’re working with an agent who has a strong history of selling in your target neighborhoods so that he or she can properly advise you. \nFinally, you’ve found that perfect home. This is the time to find out as much as you can about the sellers and their individual situation before writing up your offer. If you can work with them, they may be more willing to work with you as well. Always pre-inspect a home – it protects you as well as the other party. \nRemember that it’s crucial to do your due diligence throughout the process. An educated buyer is bound to be a more successful, fulfilled and happy homeowner as the years go on.
