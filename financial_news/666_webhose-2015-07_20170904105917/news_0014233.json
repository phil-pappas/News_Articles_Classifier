What is the point,” he said and asked Congress members if they were ready to move the motion today.\nAnand Sharma (Cong) said while the motions of past are past, the motions moved today were independent motions.\nThe motions seek a response from Prime Minister “to our demand for accountability and action.”\n“We are within our right to move the motion and demand action,” he said, adding the government has not agreed to Congress party’s demand.\nTelecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Leader of the House and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley as well as other ministers have already stated that the government was ready for a discussion and it should start immediately.\n“Please start discussion immediately,” he said, accusing the opposition of “running away from discussion.”\nTo this, Sharma said Prasad was “suffering from selective loss of memory… we want tangible proposition (on the demands).”\nKurien said the motion demands discussion on the Vyapam scam and Prime Minister’s response to it while fixing responsibility. “They (government) are ready for it,” he said.\nBut the Congress members were not satisfied moving into aisle shouting slogans demanding resignations first.\n“Pehle istifa do (first resign),” they shouted. Amid the din, Kurien adjourned the House till 1200 hours.\nFirst Published on July 31, 2015 12:25 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T19:18:11.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
