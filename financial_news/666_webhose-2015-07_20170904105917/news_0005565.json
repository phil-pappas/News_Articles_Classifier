This one came in second with $50.2 million, after racking up $115.7 million last weekend in its debut. \n\"Minions\" tells the story of lozenge-shaped, yellow characters whose goal is to serve the most despicable master they can. \nAnother movie making its debut -- \"Trainwreck\" with comic Amy Schumer -- came in third with $30.2 million in sales. It is about a woman who is wary of steady romantic relationships but falls for a sports doctor. \nIn fourth place was the animated flick \"Inside Out,\" at $11.7 million. \nIt features the voice of comedian Amy Poehler and follows young Riley as her emotions of joy, fear, anger, disgust and sadness battle it out internally as she copes with a move to a new city. \n\"Jurassic World\" dropped from second to fifth place, taking in another $11.4 million, bringing the dinosaur movie's overall total to a huge $611.1 million. \nTaking the sixth spot was action-packed sci-fi fantasy \"Terminator Genisys,\" which brought in $5.4 million in its third weekend. \nIn seventh position was \"Magic Mike XXL,\" a dance-themed drama about a former stripper, starring Channing Tatum. It pulled in $4.5 million in theaters over the weekend. \nDropping to eighth place after debuting at number five was Hollywood producer Jason Blum's latest spine-tingler, \"The Gallows,\" which took in $4 million. \nThe movie, which recalls 1999's \"The Blair Witch Project\" for its hand-held camera technique, gives young actors Reese Mishler, Pfeifer Brown, Ryan Shoos and Cassidy Gifford their first substantial roles. \n\"Ted 2,\" the raunchy sequel to Seth MacFarlane's comedy about a foul-mouthed teddy bear grabbed ninth place, bringing in $2.7 million. \nRounding out the top 10 was \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" at $2.5 million. \nIt is about a speech-impaired girl from Pakistan who gets lost in India and gets help from a kind-hearted man to find her way home to her family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T02:31:21.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
