Restructuring was carried out by managing partners Stefano Simontacchi and Marcello Giustiniani. By bringing in Franco Bonelli, a new era has begun for the firm created with the merger between the firms of Sergio Heir and Aurelio Pappalardo in 1999. At that time, the two lawyers found themselves in the crosshairs of the biggest law firm and decided to challenge the giant by merging their firms, with the goal of creating a similar model and becoming the top Italian law firm in terms of revenue. Today the firm has 350 professionals and 150 employees, with headquarters in Milan and offices in Genoa (50 people), Rome, London and Brussels: their plan includes among other things, their consolidation on a more international scale, defying law firms not only in Italy, but also abroad. The central point to this internationalization is the team’s focus on shipping and transport, where in recent years there has been fierce competition among major global firms, such as Norton Rose Reed Smith, Holman Fenwick Willan, Watson Farley & Williams etc... Marco Arato, manager of the new team, explains: in this context, “Genoa is a city that has developed enormous expertise in terms of maritime law. But the big problem is that the leading names in the industry have created prestigious boutiques, but which now face the risk of extinction when their leading partners retire. We tried to respond to this state of affairs,” acknowledges Arato, “by creating a structure that relies not only on the expertise of Genoese maritime lawyers, but also on the skills of London based financial lawyers, Rome’s administrative lawyers, and tax experts in Milan. We will continue to collaborate with firms overseas, with which we maintain special relations, as called in the field, best-friendship. As for our firm, we have developed our skills by following the privatization of Alitalia, for example, and the shipping industry, where, along with other cases, we have handled the debt restructure of many shipping companies, working on behalf of shipowners as well as banks.”\nThe focus-team consists of 10 professionals including six partners in the firm, but the goal is to grow. Arato does not rule out an expansion of the team, pivoting not only on BonelliErede’s internal resources, but also on external ones. Arato says: “The organization into focus teams is essentially a way of trying to reach out to clients and ensure the continued existence of the firm, and especially of its expertise for the next 100 years.” A new development plan for BonelliErede will be announced in late 2015 and early 2016. At the moment, everything is top secret, although it has been known that in recent days two professionals have travelled to Greece to establish contacts with local shipowners, who own the largest fleet in the world and the have the largest backlog of global orders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:07:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
