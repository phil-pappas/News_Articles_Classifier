Inside the chamber, a humidity of 140 per cent means that visibility is reduced to less than a metre.\nThe alcohol in the mist will be absorbed through the body’s mucus membranes, the lungs and eyeballs.\nAccording to Bompas & Parr, the duo behind the Alcoholic Architecture, visitors will need to consume 40 per cent less alcohol in this way than if they were having a drink to feel the same effect due to the alcohol bypassing the liver.\nThere are also said to be “gustatory (taste) and dietary benefits” to breathing alcohol rather than drinking it.\nBompas & Parr said it worked with respiratory scientists and chemists to calculate safe mist exposure times for visitors.\nAround 40 minutes in the chamber will equate to having a large drink and guests will be limited to a single one hour visit per day.\nIt will cost USD 20 to enter and will remain open for six months.\nFirst Published on July 12, 2015 6:42 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T23:52:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
