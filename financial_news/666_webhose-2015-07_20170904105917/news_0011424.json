Or that the users who were the biggest bullies would be rewarded with attention for their behaviour. Or that young people would come to see this bullying as the norm — as something to emulate in an effort to one-up each other.\n“The trolls are winning.”\nPao, a former lawyer and qualified engineer, took over as interim CEO of Reddit in November, moving to establish strict anti-harassment policies and removing revenge porn from the site.\nShe soon became a hate figure among some users, who called her a threat to free speech and subjected her to vile racist and sexist attacks, including giving her the nickname “Chairman Pao.”\nShe resigned last Friday after an online petition calling for her to go garnered more than 200,000 signatures.\nDefending her tenure, Pao said Reddit had tried to fight internet bullying “from the trenches” in an “incremental and thoughtful fashion”.\n“[But] after making these policy changes to prevent and ban harassment, I, along with several colleagues, was targeted with harassing messages, attempts to post my private information online and death threats. These were attempts to demean, shame and scare us into silence.\n“No one has figured out the best place to draw the line between bad and ugly — or whether that line can support a viable business model.”\nAdding fuel to the firestorm engulfing Pao was a lawsuit she filed against a former Silicon Valley employer, who she accused of failing to promote her because of her gender and race. She also accused the San Francisco venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers of sacking her in retaliation when she complained.\nShe sued for $16 million but lost the case last month and was ordered to pay $US276,000 in legal costs. Detractors seized on the decision, accusing her of a money grab motivated by her husband’s financial problems.\nPao said the threats against her became “really violent”, but then something unexpected happened.\n“Soon, I was receiving hundreds of messages a day, and at one point thousands. These messages were thoughtful, well-written and heartfelt, in stark contrast to the trolling messages, which were usually made up of little more than four-letter words. Many shared their own stories of harassment and thanked us for our stance.\n“Some apologised for their own trollish behaviour and promised they had reformed.\n“In the battle for the internet, the power of humanity to overcome hate gives me hope. I’m rooting for the humans over the trolls. I know we can win.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/i-have-just-endured-one-of-the-largest-trolling-attacks-in-history-ellen-pao-hits-back/story-fnkgbb3b-1227445184420?sv=23512219e2e3ba623397acd83d4566c6&title=Ellen+Pao%26%238217%3Bs+extraordinary+swipe+at+trolls", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-cannot-let-the-internet-trolls-win/2015/07/16/91b1a2d2-2b17-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html?tid=sm_tw", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/i-have-just-endured-one-of-the-largest-trolling-attacks-in-history-ellen-pao-hits-back/story-fnkgbb3b-1227445184420?sv=23512219e2e3ba623397acd83d4566c6&h=Ellen+Pao%26%238217%3Bs+extraordinary+swipe+at+trolls", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Ellen+Pao%26%238217%3Bs+extraordinary+swipe+at+trolls&c=HOUNDED+out+of+her+%24230%2C000+job+by+%26%238220%3Bone+of+the+largest+trolling+attacks+in+history%26%238221%3B%2C+former+Reddit+CEO+Ellen+Pao+has+taken+a+big+swipe.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/i-have-just-endured-one-of-the-largest-trolling-attacks-in-history-ellen-pao-hits-back/story-fnkgbb3b-1227445184420?sv=23512219e2e3ba623397acd83d4566c6", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/i-have-just-endured-one-of-the-largest-trolling-attacks-in-history-ellen-pao-hits-back/story-fnkgbb3b-1227445184420?sv=23512219e2e3ba623397acd83d4566c6", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/i-have-just-endured-one-of-the-largest-trolling-attacks-in-history-ellen-pao-hits-back/story-fnkgbb3b-1227445184420?sv=23512219e2e3ba623397acd83d4566c6", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/i-have-just-endured-one-of-the-largest-trolling-attacks-in-history-ellen-pao-hits-back/story-fnkgbb3b-1227445184420?sv=23512219e2e3ba623397acd83d4566c6&title=Ellen+Pao%26%238217%3Bs+extraordinary+swipe+at+trolls"], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T01:26:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
