This made it the second largest smartphone maker, behind Samsung with a share of around 24 percent. However, according to the latest report from WSJ , Apple took away 92 percent of the operating income from the total of the top 8 manufacturer’s income. On the other hand, the total iPhone shipments in the quarter were less than 20 million. This shows a remarkable imbalance in the number of shipments and the profit, clearly indicating that the Apple’s margins are much higher than rival Android manufacturers. Sponsored Links \nThis data is not really surprising given that in the first quarter Apple managed to take away almost 93 percent of the total operating income. So, this quarter the share of profits is a bit low, but its way higher than the 65 percent share bagged by the company last summer. \nWhen it comes to the total number of smartphones shipped, there’s no denying that Android rules the market. The 20 percent looks trifle as compared to Android shipments, but thanks to the heavy profit margin and increased sales as compared to previous years, Apple has managed to generate a lot of profit this year. After Apple, in second place is Samsung, with a share of operating profit of 15 percent. If you were to add 92 percent and 15 percent, you would see that the total exceeds 100 percent (107 to be exact). This was due to the fact that many smartphone manufacturers either broke even or lost money in the recent quarters. \nApple managed to generate so much profit due to its stellar brand image and pricing policy. The average price of iPhone was $624 in 2014, which was way higher than the average Android price of just $189. This is because, the company has just one smartphone lineup, the iPhone series, which represents the premium market. On the other hand, almost every Android smartphone manufacturer has more than one lineup, targeted from the low end market to the high end premium market. \nIn the second quarter of 2015, Apple managed to sell 43 percent more iPhones. Thanks to the premium prices charged by the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus, the average price also increased to $659. With such premium pricing and increasing sales, it’s not surprising to see Apple doing so well in the market.
