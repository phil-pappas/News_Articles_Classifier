Teva and Allergan representatives did not respond to requests for comment. \nLarge drug makers are trying to realign their operations to focus on a small number of leading businesses, while smaller speciality and generic producers are seeking larger scale. Allergan's branded drugs business makes products such as Botox and Alzheimer's drug Namenda. Its generics business makes up about a third of the company's total revenue. \nA successful deal with Allergan would give Teva, which has a market capitalization of $60 billion, a much bigger footprint in the generic drugs sector. It would also offer opportunities for significant cost synergies and tax savings. \nLast year, Actavis Plc outbid Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc and activist investor William Ackman to merge with Allergan and adopt its name. Allergan now has a market capitalization of $121 billion. \nTeva's bid for Mylan took a hit earlier this week when the latter's independent Dutch foundation exercised a call option allowing it to buy 50 percent of Mylan's total issued and outstanding capital, giving it temporary control of half the company. \nThe foundation, known as Stichting, opposes Teva's bid, arguing that a Teva takeover would likely lead to job losses at Mylan and reduce access to cheap generic medicines in emerging markets. \nMylan for its part is pressing on with a $34 billion hostile bid for Perrigo Co Plc. Were Teva to clinch a deal with Allergan for its generic drug business and drop its bid for Mylan, this would likely strengthen the hand of Mylan's management in its campaign to buy Perrigo. \nThe Wall Street Journal first reported that Teva was in advanced talks to acquire Allergan's generic drug unit. \n(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T04:28:48.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
