Photo: Netflix\nHere is a chilling statistic for Australian media executives - and a potentially juicy one for tax collectors..\n​Netflix added $US7.5 billion ($10.1 billion) to its market value overnight in the US. That's more than the combined value of Australia's three free-to-air television network owners, one of which (Nine Entertainment Co) sank to a fresh low on the sharemarket this week, Fairfax Media (publisher of this website), and local film business Village Roadshow. And after adding those up, there's still nearly $4 billion in change left over!\nShares in the US streaming video company soared 18 per cent overnight as Wall Street cheered its quarterly result. Australia played its part in Netflix's expansion, with international subscriber growth the key driver behind its sharemarket gains - even as start-up costs inflated losses at its international streaming arm.\nNetflix officially launched its Australian service in March, and while estimates on the size of its local subscriber base vary, it is seen as the undisputed leader in the streaming category. On a conference call, CFO David Wells described the Australian launch as \"strong.\"\nRemarkably, Netflix is building its presence in this country with no local employees. It also doesn't pay any tax here, although the government wants to impose GST on the service by 2017 , which could let it tap the streaming service's popularity.\nA decade ago, Netflix was only worth about $US1 billion. Its rise since then has been truly meteoric. Some skeptics about the company's lofty valuation remain but the balance of opinion on Wall Street, as reflected by the soaring share price, is that the company is poised for world domination. In other words, they think it's going to repeat globally what it has done in the US, where more than one third of households use the service.\nAs Nomura analysts put it in a research note: \"If they could make it here (in the US – the most competitive market), they could make it anywhere.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/16/us-netflix-research-idUSKBN0N71LU20150416", "http://www.afr.com/technology/web/joe-hockey-flags-netflix-tax-in-gst-extension-20150413-1mhhed"], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T05:37:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
