Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe Janet Yellen is telling fibs. So thinks the global interest rate market, which is pricing in a notably more gentle path for rate rises than the US Federal Reserve.\n\"A lot of investors don't believe the Fed is going to raise rates early, nor continue with rate hikes over the next 18 months,\" says Thierry Wizman, global interest rate strategist at Macquarie Group in New York.\nBond traders are betting on a slower and shallower interest rate trajectory. The yield on the two-year US Treasury note is an ultra-low 0.68 per cent.\nUnderlining the disconnect, Federal Open Market Committee members in June forecast a median federal funds rate of 0.625 per cent at the end of 2015, 1.625 per cent at the end of 2016 and 2.875 per cent at the end of 2017.\nIf fixed income investors are caught off guard when the Fed tightens, a jolt will hit bonds and the shock could cascade through financial markets. The bond market was pummelled in 1994 when both the Fed and investors underestimated the ratcheting up of rates.\nIf history repeats, international financial market experts worry the carnage could spread globally this time.\n\"I am a little bit concerned about the eventual hiking of US interest rates because the market on Wall Street and other world financial markets are unprepared,\" says David Li, who served on China's Monetary Policy Committee. \"When the hike actually comes, there will be a shock.\"\nLi is less concerned about the direct impact on China because it has a massive hoard of foreign exchange reserves to buffer any blow. But if there is a sharp rise in bond yields and consequent fall in bond prices, he is worried that other emerging economy markets could hit turbulence as investors pull out capital, currencies descend and the cost of debt rises. Li says such volatility could infect China.\n Yellen and other FOMC members have been at pains to signal they are keen to begin normalising monetary policy before the end of the year. Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee this month that she wanted to tighten monetary policy \"in a prudent and gradual manner\", while taking care \"not to tighten too late\".\nThe Fed was too tardy in raising rates in 1994 after the 1990-91 recession, before it suddenly pushed through a series of rate hikes.\n\"When the hikes came they were much more than anticipated and a panic to unwind carry trades caused a bear bond market despite benign inflation,\" says Deutsche Bank strategist David Bianco.\nWith the Fed on track to raise rates in September or December, former Fed vice-chairman Donald Kohn, who sat on the FOMC alongside Yellen, says if the central bank waits too long, the outcome may be \"worse\" than pausing.\n\"Going a little earlier and a more gradual trajectory will be less potentially destabilising than waiting and going at a steeper trajectory,\" Kohn says.\nBond investors appear to be betting that the strong US dollar subduing inflation and restraining the economy, as well as world economic weakness, will force the Fed to string out its plans.\nTraders will be hoping that more sombre forecasts for the US economy and dovish projections for rates from Fed staff economists, revealed in June documents inadvertently leaked on Friday, are more accurate than the outlook from the more senior FOMC officials who vote on rates.\nUltimately, either the FOMC or bond traders calling Yellen's bluff will be wearing egg on their faces.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-07-26T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:09:45.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
