Between the uncomfortable airport chairs and less than appetizing food options, not to mention the noise, exhaustion and boredom - it's an experience ranking somewhere between root canals and filing taxes. Many travelers are unaware, however, that airports around the world offer free layover tours, excursions that whisk you out of the airport to popular tourist attractions, for which all transportation and logistics are conveniently handled by someone other than you. (In other words - a mini vacation and you will be back in time for your connecting flight.) At Singapore's Changi Airport travelers facing a lengthy layover can choose from a City Lights T our or a Heritage Tour , which include visits to the tiny country's Chinatown, Little India, Gardens by the Bay, The Esplanade and Marina Bay Waterfront. \nAt Seoul's Incheon International Airport there are seven free tours offered, ferrying airline passengers with time to kill to temples, palaces and local villages. \nParticipating in such tours is easy. It requires nothing more than having a long enough layover. In Singapore the tour requires your layover be at least five hours for example. In Seoul the layover time needed varies from one to five hours.
