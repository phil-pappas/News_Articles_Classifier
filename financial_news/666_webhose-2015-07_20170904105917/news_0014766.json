China’s two bourses will reduce the fees by 30 percent starting Aug. 1, the Shanghai Stock Exchange said on its microblog the same day.\n“While the reduction in transaction fee is symbolically supportive, easing margin requirements is more significant potentially as it may reduce the level of margin calls and forced selling,” Tony Hann, who manages $350 million as head of emerging markets at Blackfriars Asset Management Ltd. in London, said by e-mail.\nChina’s regulators have made late-night announcements twice since Shanghai entered a bear market this week, after the People’s Bank of China’s weekend interest-rate cut failed to stem the rout. On Monday, the CSRC urged investors to be rational and not believe “shorting China rumors.”\nThe Shanghai Composite Index has been on a roller coaster, taking a new class of stock novices along for the ride. It slid 5.2 percent to 4,053.70 at the close on Wednesday after jumping 5.5 percent on Tuesday. Thirty-day volatility on the measure jumped to the highest level since December 2008.\nThe margin-trading rules came into effect July 1, instead after a public comment period was scheduled to end on July 11, “due to special circumstances,” the CSRC said on Wednesday.\nWider Securitization Brokerages can securitize the right to profit from margin trading and short selling operations, the CSRC said. The regulator also said it will also let all brokerages sell short-term bonds, expanding a pilot program.\nChina Securities Depository & Clearing Co. will trim transaction fees by 33 percent on Aug. 1, it said in a statement on its website.\nThe central bank’s Economic Observer reported this week that authorities are considering a reduction in stamp duties on share transactions, and the finance ministry has said it will allow its basic endowment pension fund to invest in shares.\nFutures on the CSI 300 Index expiring in July, the most active contract, rose 3.3 percent as of 1:27 p.m. New York time, trimming their decline over the past month to 14 percent. Deutsche Bank AG’s exchange traded fund tracking the local shares pared losses in New York trading after the announcements.\nChina’s stock market may fall further, Blackfriars’ Hann said.\n“Ultimately you have to learn that you can’t control markets. But they could encourage the state and controlled funds to buy key index stocks plus more positive media encouragement,” Hann said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T21:22:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
