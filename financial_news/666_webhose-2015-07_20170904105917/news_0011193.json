DIY in India is carried out by hobbyists or people interested in repairing their own homes rather than due to a scarcity of labour. Labour charges for plumbers electricians carpenters and similar home improvement services remained cheaper thus making DIFM (do-it-for-me) services more convenient and reliable. Moreover consumers in metropolitan areas are hard pressed for time due to their hectic work schedules and so prefer hired labour.\nFull Report Details at\n - \nCompetitive Landscape\nAsian Paints Ltd (APL) led home improvement with a 24% value share in 2014. It was followed by Berger Paints India Ltd which retained a value share of 7%. The recovering economy has helped boost growth for these companies as this category is directly associated with real estate growth in India. Asian Paints has relaunched its Apcolite brand and hired Rahul Dravid an Indian cricketer as its new brand ambassador organising dealer meets across the country. It increased its distribution network by adding 70 more Colour Ideas retail stores to its existing 100 stores during 2013-14 helping it to reach consumers better.\nIndustry Prospects\nThe improving Indian economy and the expected revival of residential real estate is expected to help push growth for home improvement products. Increasing consumer influence and involvement in the buying process which was previously not evident in this industry should also boost growth during forecast period.
