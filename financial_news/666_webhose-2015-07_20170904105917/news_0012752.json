Supplied Share on twitter by John Kerin Prime Minister Tony Abbott could receive more support from the public than his cabinet, if he goes ahead with a plan to strip sole Australian citizens involved in terrorism of their citizenship.\nA Fairfax-Ipsos poll found 75 per cent of people would support removing citizenship from citizens involved in terrorism provided that person is eligible to become a citizen of another country. Only 21 per cent of people were opposed.\nThe poll conducted by phone had 1402 respondents and was carried out between July 2 and July 4.\nA person cannot be made stateless because it would breach Australia's obligations under international law.\nCoalition voters are more likely to support the move. The proposal has 89 per cent support of Coalition voters, 69 per cent support of Labor voters and 49 per cent support of Greens voters.\nWhen Mr Abbott proposed legislation to strip both dual nationals and citizens of their citizenship to Federal Cabinet in May it caused a federal Cabinet split .\nCabinet ministers who spoke against the proposal to strip Australians of their citizenship included Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, Defence Minister Kevin Andrews, Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Attorney-General George Brandis, Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce and Education Minster Christopher Pyne.\nMr Abbott has deferred a decision of the sole citizenship policy.\n A provision that would have given the Immigration Minister Peter Dutton the power to strip an Australian of their citizenship was dropped. The recommendation is now made by intelligence agencies, according to set criteria, and the person has a right to a judicial review.\nThe survey findings are consistent with an Essential Poll released on June 10 that found 73 per cent of those polled supported revoking citizenship for sole nationals but an even higher proportion â€“ 81 per cent supported stripping dual nationals.\nThe dual national legislation has been referred to a parliamentary committee and is not expected to pass the parliament until at least August.\nThe bill proposes three primary means that automatically trigger a loss of citizenship. It includes a new provision where a person renounces their citizenship if they act inconsistently with their allegiance to Australia by engaging in certain terrorist conduct; a provision for a person fighting in the armed forces of another country against Australia is to be extended to say that a \"person ceases to be an Australian citizen if they fight for or are in the services of a specified terrorist organisation overseas\", and a new loss of citizenship provision that applies to those who have been convicted of a specified offence in an Australian court.\nIt also says children of dual nationals could lose their citizenship at the same time as their extremist parents.\nA child cannot be made stateless and can be exempted if a responsible guardian is available.\nNew emails emerged on Monday that showed Prime Minister Tony Abbott may have known Parliament was misled about the government's failure to forward a letter from gunman Man Haron Monis to an inquiry into the Sydney siege.\nMan Haron Monis wrote to Attorney-General George Brandis in October 2014 asking if it was legal for him to have contact with Islamic State/Daesh with a routine reply sent back by a government official.\nThe letter was never presented to the federal-NSW inquiry into the siege despite Foreign Minister Julie Bishop telling Parliament, based on mistaken evidence from an official the letter had been sent.\nA briefing note prepared for Mr Abbott on June 1 canvassed possible lines of attack three days before Ms Bishop corrected the record on June 4.\nLabor's shadow trade spokesperson Penny Wong accused the government of a cover-up over the new email.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JohnKerin2"], "published": "2015-07-06T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T13:02:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
