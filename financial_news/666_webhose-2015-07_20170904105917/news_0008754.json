Further studies are now underway to establish this.\nThe competing products target the PCSK9 protein that maintains \"bad\" LDL cholesterol in the blood. Statins, like Pfizer's Lipitor, work very differently, blocking the liver's production of LDL cholesterol, which is linked with heart attacks and strokes.
