I’ve pumped in £200,000 since launching in July last year and it’s not healthy to keep building up debt.” * Welcome to the Dragons' Den of broken dreams * Dragons' Den: Who’s the most cuddly Dragon? Players of Accentuate have to mimic accents from UK regions and around the globe to win the game. \nNew Dragon and founder of online greetings card business Moonpig Nick Jenkins helped to showcase the game’s potential, performing “amazing linguistic aerobics”, Mr Fraser-Bell said. \nAccentuate founders Fiona (43) and Graeme Fraser-Bell (53) \nThe Accentuate inventors originally offered the Dragons 15pc of the business in exchange for the capital, which will be used to increase exports to the US and step up marketing both at home and overseas. \nMr Jones settled on 40pc of the business, reducing to 25pc once the investment is repaid. \nThis new guess-the-accent party game, which Mr Fraser-Bell claims is “awkward but very funny”, is on sale in John Lewis and Firebox.com, as well as through Amazon and Accentuate’s website. \nIt turned over £57,000 in 2014, with 90pc of sales generated during November and December. This year, the company will turn over £285,000 and £540,000 in year three. \nWhile the board games industry has posted flat growth year-on-year overall, the so-called “games for badults” sector has grown by 9pc over the past five years. \nMr Jones said of his investment: “I gave Graeme and Fiona a tough time in the Den but it’s a great party game. Game play that makes people curl their toes in embarrassment is a decent differentiator.” \nAs well as the main game, Accentuate manufactures bolt-on packs to ensure steady revenue in future years. The latest is a “Film Quotes” expansion pack with 90 lines from famous films. \nBoard game inventors have a chequered past in the Den. \nMr Jones launched his own board game in 2007, Peter Jones’ Big Business, which sold 15,000 units. \nBoard game company Pants on Fire secured £50,000 last year when Richard McLuckie and Stuart Mackenzie-Walker wowed Mr Jones and Duncan Bannatyne with a contract to make games for Marmite. \nPants on Fire has an exclusive licensing contract with Marmite to produce three games \nEntrepreneurs Tristan Williams, Ben Drummond and Dean Tempest were turned down for funding in 2013 when they pitched shout-out quiz Linkee. The game is now stocked by John Lewis, Hamleys, Amazon, and Lakeland. \nIn 2004, the Dragons rejected Rachel Lowe’s pitch for board game Destination , which later became one of the top-selling games at Hamleys, outselling Monopoly. She has since signed a deal with animation studio Pixar to create a new version of the game using its most popular characters. \nSpeaking before the show aired, Mr Fraser-Bell forecast that the Accentuate website would receive 30,000 hits in 10 minutes during the Accentuate segment. \n“The exposure will be extremely valuable,” he said. “The Dragons get a bad press because deals fall through after the show and they don’t invest in companies like Trunki, but they treated us with respect and supported us. \n“Within four years, we would love Accentuate to be up there in the top 10 games with Pictionary and Articulate.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T04:47:07.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
