Netflix Inc. is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday.\nHere’s what investors can expect:\nEarnings: Netflix NFLX, +1.91% is expected to report per-share earnings of 28 cents, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. That would be 10 cents below the 38 cents per share posted last quarter and well below the $1.15 posted in the second quarter of 2014. Netflix missed the 63 cents per share FactSet consensus last quarter, which it said was due mainly to its continued expansion into new markets. Netflix has beaten FactSet expectations in seven of the last 10 quarters.\nAlso read: Netflix takes on big Hollywood studios with first original movies\nRevenue: The 41 analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Netflix to report total revenue of $1.65 billion. That breaks down to $1.02 billion in domestic streaming revenue, $457 million in international market revenue and $164 million in revenue from the domestic DVD segment. Netflix matched the FactSet consensus on revenue last quarter. The current consensus is equal to a 4% increase over 2015’s first quarter, and a 23% rise over the year-ago period.\nShare price: Netflix shares have nearly doubled in the year-to-date, up 96% to about $670. And Netflix has far outgained the S&P, which is down 0.4 in the year-to-date. Analysts that cover the stock on FactSet have an average price target of $643 and an average rating of overweight. Analysts from FBR Capital Markets & Co. and BTIG have target prices at or above $900.\nOther issues: On June 23, Netflix announced a 7-for-1 stock split, triggering a rally in the share price to a record $706.10 the following day.\nBut following the surge, some analysts cautioned that the stock was priced to perfection. Société Générale analyst Christopher Cherblanc cut his rating to sell from buy, and assigned the stock a $585 price target that was 17% below its then trading level. Activist investor Carl Icahn cashed in, selling his remaining 1.4 million shares.\nNetflix is well on its way to achieving its target of expanding into 200 countries by the end of 2016, but Chief Executive Reed Hastings has said he expects losses from international markets to grow to $101 million in the second half of 2015.\nNetflix has seen competition spring up in China—likely its most sought-after market—in recent months. Hastings has gone on record saying that the company is unsure of the best approach to take to China, but if it can figure it out, it will provide a strong opportunity.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne wrote in a note Friday that along with India, another market that Netflix is eyeing, the combined household count is nearly 750 million.\n“Near-term, lower broadband penetration rates and the relatively more challenging infrastructure lead us to take a more conservative approach,” Swinburne said, “but improvements in these trends over time could result in significant upside potential.”\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:07:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
