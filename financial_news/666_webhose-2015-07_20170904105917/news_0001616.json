Now that has to stop.”\nJohns’ comments were in response to a report from Aboriginal Housing Victoria which today revealed Aboriginal women were 34 times more likely to suffer domestic violence than non-indigenous women, published by Fairfax .\nHe aimed his comments at Cape York community leader Noel Pearson and his approach to constitutional recognition.\n“I’d like Noel and his team to start thinking about fundamental issues that affect his people and our people at the really lower end of this society,” he said.\n“They should be trying to smash the welfare state, not a liberal democracy and its constitution.”\nThe former MP who served in the Keating government has gained attention on social media for his controversial comments, but he’s no stranger to backlash when it comes to his views on welfare.\nWriting in The Australian last year, Johns suggested welfare should be linked to compulsory contraception , saying there should be “no taxpayer inducement to have children”.\n“Potential parents of poor means, poor skills or bad character will choose to have children. So be it,” he wrote.\n“But no one should enter parenthood while on a benefit.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/former-labor-mp-gary-johns-says-indigenous-women-are-being-kept-pregnant-to-claim-welfare/story-e6frfmci-1227439053934?sv=3607ab09ddb0f8967d910f307cba611c&title=Pregnant+women+%26%238216%3Bcash+cows%26%238217%3B+for+welfare", "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/no-contraception-no-dole/story-fn8v83qk-1227169545069", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/former-labor-mp-gary-johns-says-indigenous-women-are-being-kept-pregnant-to-claim-welfare/story-e6frfmci-1227439053934?sv=3607ab09ddb0f8967d910f307cba611c&title=Pregnant+women+%26%238216%3Bcash+cows%26%238217%3B+for+welfare", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Pregnant+women+%26%238216%3Bcash+cows%26%238217%3B+for+welfare&c=A+FORMER+Labor+MP+has+labelled+some+aboriginal+women+%26%238220%3Bcash+cows%26%238221%3B%2C+claiming+they+are+being+%26%238220%3Bkept+pregnant%26%238221%3B+in+order+to+make+money+from+government+hand+outs.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/former-labor-mp-gary-johns-says-indigenous-women-are-being-kept-pregnant-to-claim-welfare/story-e6frfmci-1227439053934?sv=3607ab09ddb0f8967d910f307c", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/former-labor-mp-gary-johns-says-indigenous-women-are-being-kept-pregnant-to-claim-welfare/story-e6frfmci-1227439053934?sv=3607ab09ddb0f8967d910f307cba611c&h=Pregnant+women+%26%238216%3Bcash+cows%26%238217%3B+for+welfare", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/former-labor-mp-gary-johns-says-indigenous-women-are-being-kept-pregnant-to-claim-welfare/story-e6frfmci-1227439053934?sv=3607ab09ddb0f8967d910f307cba611c", "http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/aboriginal-women-34-per-cent-more-likely-to-suffer-family-violence-but-fear-reporting-it-20150711-gi8iwm", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/former-labor-mp-gary-johns-says-indigenous-women-are-being-kept-pregnant-to-claim-welfare/story-e6frfmci-1227439053934?sv=3607ab09ddb0f8967d910f307cba611c"], "published": "2015-07-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T14:04:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
