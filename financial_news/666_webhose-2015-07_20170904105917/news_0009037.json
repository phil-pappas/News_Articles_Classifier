The SportsTek HeadlampGiveaway", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "(MENAFN Press) As far as I am concerned you can never have too many ways to light your way.\nPerhaps this comes from some forgotten childhood trauma that occurred in the dark but whatever the reason pitch blackness has never been an option in my household.\nIt is for that reason I am always anxious to test out the next great thing when it comes to lighting be it a flashlight solar powered light lantern chemical glow stick or something else.\nThis week it was my pleasure to test one of those “something else” items; namely the SportsTek LED 4 in 1 Headlamp.\nTo be perfectly honest my expectations were modest.  I have used headlamps from Harbor Freight Costco and Amazon with just a modicum of success.\nYes they delivered a spot of light but that is all they did a spot of light.  SportsTek\nImagine my surprise when I donned the SportsTek and in total darkness I could see everything within a 600 square foot area.  And I mean see – not just a bunch of shadows.\nGiven that I have a bias toward all things light-related I decided that in order to objectively review the SportsTek LED Headlamp I needed to turn things over to Shelly aka the Survival Husband.\nWhat follows is his totally unbiased review; a review coming from someone without a flashlight fetish.\nUsing the SportsTek LED Headlamp\nUsing the SportsTek LED HeadlampBefore I begin let me describe how the SportsTek Lightwear 4 in 1 LED Headlamp can be used.\nThis is important because in addition to using it as a traditional headlamp (on your head) it can be used as follows:\nPortable light source attached to your belt pack helmet or other piece of gear\nHeadlight on you bicycle (using the included special mounting bracket)\nStationary Lamp\nBefore using the SportsTek Headlamp for the first time I carefully read all of the instructions.\nThey are very descriptive and show you how to configure the headlamp for its various functions.\nThe nice thing is that there were photos; something I really appreciated because I hate to read manuals even though Gaye makes me do it.\nThat said I really did not need to read the instructions since using it was quite intuitive.\nI used 4 alkaline AA batteries but according to SportsTek rechargeables can also be used.I felt that the only thing tricky was removing the battery pack and lens from the headlamp straps but once I did that for the first time it was easy.\nFor my testing I used 4 alkaline AA batteries but according to SportsTek rechargeables can also be used.\nThe SportsTek Note headlamp is 220 lumens and Cree certified; if you are interested in other specs you can read about them here.  Me?  I just want to know that it works.\nThe SportsTek headlamp is very comfortable and does not slip around on your head like the el cheapo headlamps I have used in the past.\nLHB-1000-1024x768Not only that it was very easy to operate while I was wearing it.\nIn other words if I wanted to adjust the beam or make some other adjustment I could do so while it was on my head.\nI did not have to take it off make an adjustment and put it back on again.\nThe lens itself has three functions:\nThere are three different adjustments for the angle\nThe lens slides in and out to make the beam narrow or wide\nThe lens turns so that you can adjust the brightness\nIn addition the power  button has 3 modes: full power 50% power and strobe mode (great for signaling!)\nHow Does It Work in Total Darkness?\nSportsTek-ShellyOne of the reasons Gaye asked me to do the testing is that she hates total darkness.\nEven in our bedroom the blinds are semi-transparent to let some light in at night.\nIn order to test how well the headlamp worked in total darkness I went down into our pitch black crawlspace and could see as clear as day from one end to the other approximately 60 feet.\nWe store old junk and used boxes in the crawlspace and I could definitely see everything.\nI saw so much that I made a mental note to myself to clean up the messy junk pile – a project for another day.\nMy guess is that my vision would have been just as clear for another 60 feet especially if I took advantage of the adjustment capabilities I described above.\nThe specs actually indicate a range of 688 feet but I did not test it myself.\nThe construction of the SportsTek Headlamp is top grade.  It is well made and not cheap or flimsy.\nIf I had four hands I would give it 4 thumbs up.  One other thing.  Since I did the testing I told Gaye that this was now MY headlamp.\nThe Giveaway – Enter to Win!\nLightwear-01-HWMKThe nice folks at SportsTek have reserved a 4 in 1 LED Headlamp for one lucky Backdoor Survival reader.

As much as I tried to coax a response he could not come up with a thing so I suppose I will just leave it at that.\nI too have tried on the SportsTek headlamp and found it to be comfortable.\nI walked outside at night and confirmed that it casts a long beam.\nI can see where this would be good to have when hiking or when walking down a busy road at night.\nCurrently priced under 38 you get more than your money’s worth given its features and functionality.\nSource : http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/sportstek-headlamp/\n\n\nAbout PRBuzz.com \nPRBuzz.com is a press release distribution service that distributes press releases to online news sites and blogs to help customers with search engine optimization and create buzz about their web site, news or business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T09:47:10.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
