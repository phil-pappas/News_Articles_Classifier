With the Bloomberg Commodity Index down 10 percent this month, Treasuries are beating the gauge by the most in three years.\nCrude oil has fallen more than 50 percent in the past 12 months, driving concern inflation will disappear in the world’s biggest economy. The difference between yields on one-year debt and similar-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer prices, was minus 0.24 percentage point, the lowest level since January.\nAdd a decline in stocks as reason to seek the relative safety of U.S. government securities. The MSCI All-Country World Index has fallen almost 1 percent in July including reinvested dividends, as the Shanghai Composite Index slumped more than 10 percent this week.\n“Money is going to the government bond market,” said Yoshiyuki Suzuki, head of fixed income at Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Tokyo. “I fear that commodity prices may go down more. There is disinflation because of the decline in oil prices.”\nThe benchmark U.S. 10-year note yield was little changed at 2.22 percent as of 10:47 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2.125 percent security due in May 2025 was 99 3/32.\nDeflation is a general drop in prices. Disinflation is a slowing of inflation. Both are positive for bonds as they enhance the attraction of their fixed payments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T05:49:00.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
