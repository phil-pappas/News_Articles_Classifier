Its shareholders will receive a stake in the beauty businesses, and that stake will be simultaneously combined with Coty to form a new company. This is beneficial for P&G as well — it will not owe any taxes on its gains. \nThis is not a conventional “spin-off”, where all P&G shareholders would get a stake in the beauty business and keep their P&G stake. Instead it is a “split-off”: shareholders will have to choose if they want to keep their interest in what remains of P&G or go along into the new, bigger Coty. \nCoty has been around for decades but did not list its shares until 2013 (the controlling stake is owned by JAB Holdings, a European investment firm). Its sales growth since going public has been modest. Its weak nail polish business (with brands including Rimmel) is dragging down its strength in perfumes (with brands including Calvin Klein and David Beckham). But on the strength of cost cutting, its shares were up 30 per cent before the rumours of the P&G deal a month ago. \nThe June P&G rumours drove up Coty’s shares by another quarter. The new Coty will now be the third-largest beauty products company in the world. It says the deal will boost earnings per share by a third and it is confident enough in that prediction to raise its dividend by 250 per cent. \nDespite its divestments, P&G’s growth remains sluggish, as reflected in returns in recent years. But for shareholders looking to join Coty, the easy money seems to have been made already. \nEmail the Lex team at lex@ft.com Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
