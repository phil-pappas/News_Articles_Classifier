Greece's far-left ruling Syriza are the party of the people — but are they standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Greek citizens during these tough financial times? Not quite.\nGreece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis told Bloomberg TV in an interview that he and his wife haven't used any Greek ATMs since capital controls were introduced over the weekend limiting people to daily withdrawals of €60 euros . \nHe said: \" I haven’t done it. My wife and I must be the only Greeks who haven’t done it. I feel it would be inappropriate for me to queue up at the ATM.\" \"Wouldn’t it be solidarity?,\" asks the interviewer. Varoufakis replies: \"It would be in a sense, yes. I will consider it.\" Varoufakis wouldn't say how he and his wife are getting by, saying: \"Let's not personalize this too much. Let's just say my wife and I are living a very frugal life at the moment simply because we’re inundated, moving from one political meeting to the other.\" Varoufakis' wife Danae Stratou has a less than frugal reputation — she's reportedly the inspiration behind the hugely successful Britpop song Common People by Pulp , the lyrics of which mock a rich Greek student that wants to live \"like the common people.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T15:48:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
