AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. is scheduled to present their proposal to serve alcohol at their Boston Common location before the Boston Licensing Board.If the proposal is approved the theater’s cafe which is located on the second floor will be turned into a MacGuffins Bar & Lounge according to George Patterson AMC Senior Vice President for Food and Beverage.MacGuffins serves beer wine and cocktails which will be allowed to be consumed before the movie or brought into the movie theater. However AMC will not pause their screenings when patrons have to leave the theater to use the bathroom; Patterson says this will help deter patrons from consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. “There’s no intermissions no half-times so you can’t get out of your seat and get a second or third drink unless you want to miss part of the movie” said Patterson. “We offer alcohol in Universal Studios and downtown Disney some of the most family friendly locations and we’ve never had an issue with it.”\nAccording to Patterson out of the 347 AMC theater locations across the United States only about one-third currently have a MacGuffins bar including four Massachusetts locations.\nThe name MacGuffins was inspired by a term coined by Alfred Hitchcock in 1939 which means a plot device which motivates the characters and advances the story.\nIt has been reported that local businesses have been supportive of the decision to include alcohol services in the downtown movie theater location. However some may worry about the theaters proximity to the nearby universities but Patterson said that this also will not be an issue.\nA medical associate from Drug and Alcohol comments “I won’t say that I disagree with serving alcohol at the movie theaters. I don’t believe the goal of AMC is to push alcohol sales. I think it’s quite admirable that they’re aware of people who drink of excessively and their efforts to prevent excessive alcohol consumption at their theaters. “\n is a leading  MA which specializes in providing comprehensive addiction treatment services.
