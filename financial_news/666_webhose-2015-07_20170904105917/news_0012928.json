David Cameron 'won't support' energy price cap that would cut bills By Emily Gosden | Telegraph – 1 hour 14 minutes ago 19.615 -0.050 \nPrime Minister's spokesman indicates he will not support proposal that competition watchdog says would result in cheaper bills for 70 per cent of households \nDavid Cameron does not support proposals for a temporary price cap on energy tariffs, his spokesman has said, after the competition watchdog said the plan would lead to cheaper bills for 70 per cent of households. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority on Tuesday said it may be necessary to introduce \"transitional\" regulated tariffs, in place of energy suppliers' standard tariffs, while measures to improve customer engagement are implemented. \nThe maximum price would be set by either the CMA or regulator Ofgem, and would be cheaper than the Big Six suppliers' current standard variable tariffs, Roger Witcomb, chairman of the CMA's energy market investigation said. \nAsked if it would therefore mean price cuts for the 70 per cent of households currently on the standard tariffs, he said: \"Yep.\" \nThe CMA put forward the proposal after concluding that average bills had been £50 to £60 a year too high in recent years due to the Big Six - British Gas, SSE (LSE: SSE.L - news ) , ScottishPower, E.On, EDF (Paris: FR0010242511 - news ) and npower - exploiting disengaged customers. \nAsked whether the Prime Minister agreed with the proposal, David Cameron's official spokesman said: \"The PM’s view on a price cap hasn’t changed; he doesn’t think that price regulation across the market is the right approach.\" \nThe issue is politically difficult for Mr Cameron because he condemned Ed Miliband's proposal for an energy price freeze. \nYet the Conservatives also pledged in their manifesto pledge that they would be \"implementing the recommendations of the Competition and Markets Authority investigation that we triggered\". \nAndrea Leadsom, the energy minister, said last month: \"The CMA has the necessary expertise to determine what problems exist in the energy market and identify appropriate solutions. This Government has committed to implement all relevant recommendations of the CMA.\" \nThe CMA or Ofgem could set a temporary price cap on default tariffs, the CMA said \nJohn Fedderson, chief executive of consultacy Aurora Energy Research, said: \"Safeguard tariffs are not going to happen with the current government.\" \nThe CMA itself has said the proposed price cap is subject to consultation, with a series of crucial details yet to be worked out. \n\"We wouldn’t introduce such a move lightly and would need to consider its effect on competition but it is something we feel is right to look at closely,\" Mr Witcomb said. \nUnlike the Labour price freeze plan, the CMA tariff cap would vary with wholesale and other costs. \nIt would remain in place for as long as necessary until the market was deemed to be working properly, Mr Witcomb said. \nThe Government also came in for criticism from the CMA over \"unhelpful\" regulatory interventions. The watchdog singled out an Ofgem rule, backed by David Cameron, that limited suppliers to four tariffs, which it said had left consumers worse off. \nCaroline Flint, Labour’s shadow energy secretary, said: “This report from the CMA makes clear that the energy market is broken and ordinary families are paying the price. The Big Six have been overcharging households by more than a billion pounds every year. \n\"Wholesale costs are now at a five-year low but this is still not being reflected in household bills. Rather than writing a letter to the Big Six begging them to cut prices David Cameron needs to take proper action to protect consumers by improving transparency and competition, and by giving the regulator the power to cut prices.” \nEnergy Price Comparison Tool - Find the best gas and electricity deal for you with our handy tariff comparison tool.
