We have and will take action where we see vulnerable consumers at risk of inappropriate lending,\" said deputy commissioner Peter Kell.\nAdvertisement Assistant treasurer Josh Frydenberg is considering whether to include consumer leasing in an imminent review of payday lending laws.\nThe government has recently restricted access to CentreLink's CentrePay facility to lease companies with credit licences. This means they have to be subject to the national responsible lending obligations. CentrePay allows welfare recipients to schedule payments for essential goods and services like fridges and utilities without paying bank fees.\nTransparent The move excluded some small lease companies. But the biggest lease company serving poorer customers, Thorn, has a credit licence and so can continue to be paid via CentrePay. Labor Senator Doug Cameron is seeking to ban it as well, arguing the poor should be using NGOs like Good Shepherd Finance that offer interest free loans up to $1800.\nA March Credit Suisse note on the sector estimated 50 per cent of Radio Rentals revenue is sourced from CentrePay, although Thorn chief executive James Marshall rejected the claim.\n\"Thorn is entirely transparent in communicating the overall price to consumers who are signing up to a lease,\" he said. \"We are entirely in favour of providing consumers with the tools and support to make informed decisions.\"\nA new 420 litre Westinghouse top mount fridge is offered for $13.99 a week over 48 months on Radio Rental's site. This equates to around $2680, while it retails for between $800 and $1000. Mr Marshall said the Radio Rental's price includes delivery, in home set-up and installation, in-home servicing.\nFlexiGroup's FlexiRent business offers leases of products via retail stores such as Harvey Norman. It displays the full cost of the lease along with product examples on its website. Like Radio Rentals, the full costs are around double the original price.\nFlexiGroup did not return requests for comment.\nSince reaching a high of $3.11 in late December, Thorn Group's share price has fallen 16 per cent to $2.61 on Tuesday. FlexiGroup's stock has dropped by a quarter since September 2014 to around $3.\nGood Shepherd chief Adam Mooney has been lobbying for consumer leases to be treated the same as payday loans, which have caps on the total finance cost, because he argues they are targeting the same low income demographic.\n\"Their should be a cap on the total finance cost, whether it is a payday loan or a lease,\" he said. \"I don't want to stop companies making a profit, but a customer should not pay more than 1.5 times the purchase price. Where it gets to be exploitative is where people who can't afford these payments are paying two to three times the original price of the product.\"\nzipMoney, an online version of FlexiGroup and GE Capital, offers an interest free line of credit for up to six months rather than leases. It said incumbents in the sector are earning exorbitant margins.\n\"It is positive for the industry and we should all be championing transparency in consumer credit,\" said chief executive Larry Diamond.\n\"We believe that the higher effective interest rates that incumbents are charging provides an opportunity for zipMoney to be successful by offering a more consumer friendly product.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T16:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T17:35:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
