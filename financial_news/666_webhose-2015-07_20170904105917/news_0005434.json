Higher borrowing costs curb bullion’s allure because it doesn’t pay interest or give returns like other assets such as bonds and equities.\nBullion declined on Monday as Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras surrendered to European demands for immediate action to qualify for as much as 86 billion euros ($95 billion) of aid needed to keep his country in the currency union.\n“The two biggest drivers for gold remain Greece and the Fed,” Thorsten Proettel, a commodity analyst at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg in Stuttgart, Germany said by phone. “We still expect the Fed to raise rates in September, so any positive economic news out of the U.S. will be worse for gold, and any negative news will be supportive.”\nGold futures for delivery in August fell 0.2 percent to $1,152.60 an ounce at 7:43 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Metal for immediate delivery lost 0.3 percent to $1,154 in London, according to Bloomberg generic pricing. The metal last week reached the lowest level since March.\nAttention is shifting to the parliamentary hurdles before Greece can even begin negotiations with creditors to access a third international bailout in five years. Tsipras has until Wednesday to pass into law the demands, with two factions in his government already saying they won’t support the deal.\nInvestors increased holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded products for the first time in four sessions, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Assets rose 1.7 metric tons to 1,586.9 tons as of Monday. They’re near the lowest since 2009.\nSilver for September delivery fell 1.1 percent to $15.29 an ounce in New York. Platinum for October delivery slipped 0.8 percent to $1,027.80. Palladium for September declined 0.1 percent to $658.10 an ounce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T07:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T16:03:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
