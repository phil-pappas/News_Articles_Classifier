She added that such challenges have seen some clients failing to honour their tax obligations, resulting in the authority missing the set target for the first half. \nBonyongwe said individual tax collections of $379.5m were 12% lower than the $429.5m collected for the same period last year. She blamed the decline on retrenchments and company closures. \nCorporate income tax was 15% lower than the prior year on the back of the depressed economic environment, which has negatively affected the profitability of companies. \nValue added tax was 33% short of target, with Zimra attributing the subdued performance to low disposable income in the hands of consumers. \nThere was also a 65% decline in mining royalties to $39.8m as a result of depressed international prices and lower sales. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T20:14:57.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
