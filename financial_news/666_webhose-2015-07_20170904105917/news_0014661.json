Tesla sets a new record for car deliveries in second quarter Jul. 2, 2015, 8:10 AM 44 Tesla's battery-swapping plan has a mere shadow of the promise it once showed \nIn its ongoing quest to behave slightly more like a normal car company, Tesla has been reporting how many vehicles it delivered each quarter. \nIn the second quarter, the company delivered 11,507 vehicles. \" This was a new company record for the most cars delivered in a quarter and represents an approximate 52% increase over Q2 last year,\" Tesla said in a statement . \nTesla added that \"[t]here may be small changes to this delivery count (usually well under 1%), as Tesla only counts a delivery if it is transferred to the end customer and all paperwork is correct.\" \nIn the first quarter, Tesla delivered 10,030 cars, a 55% increase, year-over-year. \nTesla has predicted that it will deliver 55,000 cars in 2015. The count now stands at 21,537, meaning that the company is less than halfway to that goal. However, Tesla has consistently argued that demand for its cars isn't a problem â€” the company is instead constrained by its limited production capacity. \nAlso, in the third quarter, the company will roll out its Model X SUV, which is anticipated to add several thousands deliveries to the 2015 total.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T15:48:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
