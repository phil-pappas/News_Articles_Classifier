Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Dominic White Neil Lawrence, the advertising executive who achieved what many thought impossible by getting Kevin Rudd into office, was remembered on Wednesday as one of Australia's great creative minds, a larrikin, and \"a deep thinker in an industry often accused of shallowness\".\nPoliticians and business people paid tribute to the 61-year-old architect of the \"Kevin 07\" campaign, after he died in a diving accident in the Maldives where he was on holiday with his son.\nFormer Queensland premier Anna Bligh said she was in shock, after dining with Mr Lawrence only last week. There \"was absolutely no doubt\" his marketing campaign had played \"a very big part\" in her own election to premiership in 2009.\n\"People will talk about 'Kevin 07' but in some ways the Queensland election in 2009 was a much tougher gig,\" said Ms Bligh, referring to the long series of Peter Beattie Labor governments that preceded her. \"A fifth term is a very rare thing in Australian politics – it took brilliance and focus and no small measure of genius from Neil.\"\nFormer prime minister, and Labor leader, Kevin Rudd said Mr Lawrence had a unique creativity.\n\"I will always be indebted to him for his creativity in the 2007 election campaign where he was one of the few who was truly at the core of that campaign,\" he said.\nLabor leader Bill Shorten tweeted: \"Neil made a tremendous contribution to Labor and the 2007 election victory, for which we will always be grateful.\"\nMr Lawrence turned against Labor's resources super tax in 2010, creating the successful \"Keep Mining Strong\" for the mining industry. He said he was personally against the policy.\n Buttock tattoo But last year he and pollster Tony Mitchelmore helped Labor's Jay Weatherill to an unlikely victory in the South Australian election. Mr Lawrence later fulfilled a bet that he would tattoo his buttocks with the time of victory.\n\"It's that kind of larrikin humour that counts for a lot when you are in a high stakes, intense election campaign,\" Ms Bligh said.\nMr Lawrence's many corporate credits include last year's successful \"Feels Like Home\" campaign for Qantas and and positioning and merger and acquisition campaigns for companies such as Wesfarmers, AGL, and BHP Billiton.\n\"It is a dark day for the industry,\" said former Qantas marketing chief Tim McColl Jones. \"You don't have many people that come along and create the work Neil has been involved with over his lifetime.\"\nMr Lawrence's agency Lawrence Creative Strategy is part owned by STW, of which was executive creative director.\nTanya Jones, managing director of Lawrence Creative Strategy, said, \"My thoughts are with Neil's family right now. He was a man of great integrity and brilliant strategically and creatively with enormous passion for many important issues, most notably of late for recognition of Indigenous Australians in our constitution and serious poker machine reform. He was a great friend and amazing mentor. He will be deeply, deeply missed.\"\nKaChing! – a documentary Mr Lawrence produced on the impact of the poker machine industry – was due to premiere on Wednesday night in Sydney. The event was due to go ahead in celebration of Mr Lawrence.\nInquiring mind Communications consultant John Connolly, who worked with Mr Lawrence over 20 years, said, \"He was one in a million. Incredibly creative with a deep social conscience. He spent hours of his own time and money on social issues\".", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/16RhgfA662k", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/DomWhiteAFR"], "published": "2015-07-15T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:05:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
