Its appearance in an earlier draft marked the first time the idea of a euro member leaving the currency had appeared in black and white. \nThe eurozone must now unite to tackle the immediate problem of finding funds to keep Greece afloat, as the bailout could take months to finalise. \nEurozone finance ministers at a meeting on Monday considered bridge funding to get Greece through coming weeks when it faces several huge debt payments to the ECB and other creditors. \n\"We have not yet found the 'golden key' to solve this issue,\" said Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who was renamed to a second term at the minister talks on Monday. \nDespite the deal, Greece missed a second debt payment to the IMF in two weeks on Monday, bringing its total arrears to the Fund to about 2.0 billion euros. \nThe ECB meanwhile has kept Greek banks afloat with emergency liquidity, but has refused to provide extra funds. \nThe ECB's governing council on Monday held its emergency liquidity assistance for Greece unchanged at around 89 billion euros ($99 billion). \nBanks will stay closed in Greece until Wednesday, the country's finance ministry said in a statement. \nMany cash machines already are running dry despite a 60-euros-a-day ATM limit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T07:42:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
