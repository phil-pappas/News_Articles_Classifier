Photo: Michele Mossop\nMajor bank shareholders face the prospect of lower returns and potentially softer dividend growth as the lenders are forced to bolster their balance sheets by $12 billion in less than a year.\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority on Monday said Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank and Macquarie Group would need to set aside more loss-absorbing capital for every dollar lent in home loans, a move that would cut profitability.\nWhile the changes have been well flagged, and banks are expected to pass some of the cost on to customers, the authority is moving faster than many predicted by requiring that banks meet the target by July next year.\nAnalysts and fund managers said shareholders in the big four, which generate most of their profits from mortgages, would inevitably absorb some of the extra cost.\nAdvertisement Perpetual portfolio manager Vince Pezzullo​ said the changes amounted to a \"material\" increase in how much capital banks would need to set aside against mortgages.\nIn an environment where lending to the fast-growing housing investment segment was being restricted, and banks' earnings were unlikely to continue receiving a free kick from falling bad debts, this would make it harder for banks to lift profits and dividends.\n\"It's becoming a lot harder to see how the banks will grow their dividends,\" Mr Pezzullo said. \"Balance sheet growth is now a lot more capital intensive.\"\nWatermark Funds Management investment analyst Omkar Joshi​ said banks would likely retain a higher share of their profits over the next year to meet APRA targets.\nFor shareholders, this would mean softer or no growth in banks' highly prized dividends.\n\"Dividends will not go backwards in absolute terms, but banks will keep them flat or increase them more slowly than in the past,\" Mr Joshi said.\nAfter clear signals from the authority that the changes were coming, and some predictions of tougher action, investors responded by lifting bank share prices higher.\nAside from dividends, other ways for banks to lift their capital levels are through equity raisings or issuing shares through a partially underwritten dividend reinvestment plan, both of which dilute shareholders.\nMonday's changes are intended to have two main benefits: better capitalised banks and a more level playing field in the $1.3 trillion mortgage market.\nUnder the new rules, banks must be more cautious in how they use financial models, known as \"risk weights\", to determine how much capital is set aside in case loans are not repaid.\nAt present, the big banks use average risk weights of 16 per cent – assuming only $16 in every $100 lent is at risk – but this is being pushed up to a minimum 25 per cent.\nSmaller lenders use average risk weights of 39 per cent, so analysts believe the change should give them a better chance to compete on price.\nThe two largest mortgage lenders, Westpac and Commonwealth Bank, will have to raise the most, while ANZ also faces pressure to act because its capital levels are lower than rivals.\nCBA said it would need to raise 95 basis points of capital.\nIt said it had been \"working on a number of options for managing our capital\" and it would provide further details at its full-year results next month.\nWestpac said the change would require an extra $3 billion to lift its capital ratio to the top end of its range, and the cost would be shared by customers and shareholders.\nANZ Bank said it would need an extra $2.3 billion.\nNAB, which pre-emptively raised $5.5 billion in May, said its capital would drift lower to about 9 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T21:04:52.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
