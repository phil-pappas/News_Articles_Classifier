When times were hard, people blamed Brussels.\nNow, things are changing. Negative developments away from home can dent the 28-nation bloc&apos;s reputation too, according to a recent study by Demosthenes Ioannou, Jean-François Jamet and Johannes Kleibl, and published by the European Central Bank.\nThat&apos;s playing into the hands of euroskeptics in countries like France, where dissatisfaction with the economy is already sapping support for the EU.\nThe drawn-out negotiations between Greece and its creditors, the deepening of the country&apos;s economic slump, widespread disbelief that the agreement will secure a stable recovery after 5 years of economic misery: all this is helping distant politicians like National Front leader Marine Le Pen who want to curtail European integration and favor a retrenchment behind national borders.\nThe authors&apos; argument is bolstered by evidence in countries like Germany, where trust in the common European project has dwindled even as things at home got better.\nAs the researchers put it, \"higher unemployment rates and government debt levels in other member states are systematically related to higher levels of euroskepticism domestically.\"\nThis suggests that \"economic and fiscal outcomes in other EU member states can play an important role in shaping domestic support for the EU.\"\nIt might explain why German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been so bent on keeping Greece in the euro, even in the face of rising unrest in the ranks of her own lawmakers.\nFor ECB President Mario Draghi, a failure to hold on to Athens may mean there won&apos;t be common European project, and a single European currency, to oversee: \"Future political support for the EU may critically depend on the ability of EU institutions to prevent hikes in unemployment and debt across the EU,\" the study says.\nThere&apos;s a silver lining. The study shows that there is a sense of shared destiny in the continent, even if it’s a negative one.", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i3inoQzekYeU/v3/460x260.jpg\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iAEZbmvsFh3U/v3/460x260.jpg\\", "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp1815.en.pdf\\"], "published": "2015-07-31T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T17:34:12.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
