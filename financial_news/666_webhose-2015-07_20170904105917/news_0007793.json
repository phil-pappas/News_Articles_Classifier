The contract had added more than $1 billion to Spirit's operational costs.\nGetting rid of the contract has freed up Spirit to take advantage of booming worldwide demand for commercial aircraft.\nBoeing, Spirit's largest customer, reported a record 9 percent rise in commercial aircraft deliveries last week and said it expects to crank up production.\nSpirit said in March that share buy backs were \"top of the list\" for returning cash to shareholders.\n\"With a cash balance approaching $1 billion and our expectation that Spirit will generate at least $400 million of free cash flow, this repurchase authorization should be only one part of the company's cash deployment agenda,\" J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Seth Seifman said.\nSpirit said total expenses fell 7.5 percent in the second quarter ended July 2.\nNet income rose 8 percent to $154.9 million, or $1.11 per share.\nExcluding items, Spirit earned $1.09 per share, handily beating the average analyst estimate of 97 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nRevenue fell 5.8 percent to $1.70 billion, just below the average estimate of $1.72 billion.\nSpirit's shares were up 2.8 percent at $54.36 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nUp to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen 22.8 percent this year, compared with a 1.08 percent drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index.
