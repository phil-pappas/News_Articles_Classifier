Source: Supplied\nWhile the AMA accepts refusal to pay for mistakes such as surgery on the wrong body part, Prof Owler says there are many areas where complications occur despite full preventive measures. He fears the government’s sale of Medibank last year has put Australia on a path toward a US-style managed care system, in which insurers can dictate what doctor you see or what treatment you receive.\nHe said Medibank was now mainly concerned about increasing profits for its shareholders and he called for regulation of the private health insurance sector.\nMedibank says there needs to be a link between healthcare standards and payments “otherwise the healthcare system has limited incentive to focus on reducing waste and addressing improvements”. “Medibank doesn’t want to see our members — or any patients for that matter — come to harm while receiving health care, nor do our members want to go on being asked to foot the bill through higher premiums for avoidable mistakes or waste in the hospital setting.” Private Healthcare Australia chief executive Michael Armitage said insurers had a responsibility to their members to demand better quality and safety measures.\nHe said premiums increased by an average of 6.18 per cent this year but payments to doctors by health funds increased by 6.9 per cent and payments to hospitals were up 7.7 per cent.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/medibank-private-slammed-by-ama-boss-over-offensive-policy-on-dying-mothers/story-fnu2q2e9-1227452958716?sv=4b654d22cd41298b5a7853439f453d62", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/medibank-private-slammed-by-ama-boss-over-offensive-policy-on-dying-mothers/story-fnu2q2e9-1227452958716?sv=4b654d22cd41298b5a7853439f453d62&h=%26%238216%3BThey+have+no+understanding+of+medicine%26%238217%3B", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/medibank-private-slammed-by-ama-boss-over-offensive-policy-on-dying-mothers/story-fnu2q2e9-1227452958716?sv=4b654d22cd41298b5a7853439f453d62&title=%26%238216%3BThey+have+no+understanding+of+medicine%26%238217%3B", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=%26%238216%3BThey+have+no+understanding+of+medicine%26%238217%3B&c=THIS+is+the+policy+on+mums+who+die+giving+birth+that+has+seen+Medibank+Private+slammed+by+the+Australian+Medical+Association+president.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/medibank-private-slammed-by-ama-boss-over-offensive-policy-on-dying-mothers/story-fnu2q2e9-1227452958716?sv=4b654d22cd41298b5a7853439f453d62", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/medibank-private-slammed-by-ama-boss-over-offensive-policy-on-dying-mothers/story-fnu2q2e9-1227452958716?sv=4b654d22cd41298b5a7853439f453d62&title=%26%238216%3BThey+have+no+understanding+of+medicine%26%238217%3B", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/medibank-private-slammed-by-ama-boss-over-offensive-policy-on-dying-mothers/story-fnu2q2e9-1227452958716?sv=4b654d22cd41298b5a7853439f453d62"], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T13:23:32.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
