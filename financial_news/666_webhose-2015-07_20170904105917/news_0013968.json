Unfortunately with wireless data there is always the threat of a security breach and digital theft.  Known as \"digital pickpocketing\" or \"skimming\" important data associated with credit cards is stolen digitally through the use of cell phones and digital readers all while the cards remain in the victim's wallet.\n   EMV (Europay MasterCard Visa) is the term that refers to the technology standard of smart cards.  They can be contact cards that must be swiped to be read or cards that can be read over a short distance using radio-frequency technology.  It is the latter that poses a more substantial threat for data theft.  \n\nIt is estimated that close to one-third of all existing Visa MasterCard and American Express cards have the RFID technology embedded in them.  This chip holds financial and personal data and while it makes credit and banking processes more efficient it is also possible for thieves to purchase similar data-grabbing digital readers for less than 100 and lift the same important information.  \n\nIn an effort to combat this growing threat  Blockit RFID Products Inc. a family-owned security business specializing in RFID-blocking has developed an impenetrable sleeve for credit cards.  Engineered with three layers of protection including aluminum and copper interiors they are able to block the 13.56 MHz and 125 kHz signals that allow data breaches. The product was designed to fit in the same space that holds credit cards alone in wallets and purses so as to impede as little upon the user's everyday lives. \n \nAbout BLOCKIT Group LLC\nBlockit Group LLC is a family owned Security business based out of Temecula California. The company is selling genuine  online and in the local area of this business location.\nContact\nTed Repic\n(949) 697-9111\nTed@myblockit.com\n \n\n\nAbout PRBuzz.com \nPRBuzz.com is a press release distribution service that distributes press releases to online news sites and blogs to help customers with search engine optimization and create buzz about their web site, news or business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T22:54:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
