Thank you Carol.\" \nThe brief interaction appeared to only agitate vocal protesters who began shouting \"shame\". \n\"I hope you're upstairs reading them,\" Aunty Carol said later. \n\"Because all of those pledges come from the heart and from everybody here who's got the guts and the bloody balls to stand up and fight you all the way.\" \nThe infrastructure would cut through four different tribal lands, Aunty Carol told AAP. \n\"In some areas, it goes right through sacred sites, sacred waterholes,\" she said. \n\"And in my country it's going through 30m away from a rock art that's thousands of years old. \n\"Our concern is the dust will destroy that rock art.\" \nThe project has been the subject of several legal challenges and has been criticised after revelations Queensland treasury officials expressed serious concerns about the approval. \nAdani was committed to fostering good working relationships and had negotiated cultural heritage management programs with all four impacted groups, a spokeswoman said. \n\"We have also altered aspects of the rail and port project footprints in agreement with the Juru people including relocating over 30km of rail,\" she said in a statement. \nAn archaeologist nominated by the Juru people had endorsed all works, the company said. \n\"The rock art site referred to by Carol Prior is identified in the approved management plans and Adani has relocated the rail alignment and committed to provide protective fencing to stop damage currently being caused by cattle using the area as a shelter.\" @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T11:58:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
