Her post received 210 \"likes\" but appeared to have been removed by Monday.\nACTU shelf where a bust of Martin Ferguson once sat. Supplied Mr Ferguson, who was facing a push to expel him from the ALP for alleged disloyalty and publicly attacking the party, said he had never seen the bust nor had he supported union members' funds being spent to build the memento.\n\"It could be said I have joined an elite club,\" Mr Ferguson told The Australian Financial Review on Monday.\n\"I can recall when Bob Hawke's bust was stolen some years ago because he had a falling out with some people in the union movement.\"\nMr Ferguson was unimpressed by Ms McManus' comments.\n \"If that's the attitude of the ACTU, so be it,\" he said.\n\"I would have thought given the low level of union membership in Australia, her priority would be focusing on making the union movement more relevant in the 21st century rather than making childish, inane comments.\"\n\"My values and commitment to the less well-paid of this country have never changed.\"\nThe ACTU declined to comment on Monday about the theft of the bust. It is understood the bust was stolen on a weekend last month.\nUnion officials have pushed to expel Mr Ferguson after the NSW Liberal Party used footage during the state election campaign of him criticising state Labor leader Luke Foley's approach to power privatisation.\nALP national secretary George Wright said on Monday the explusion motion was before the party's Victorian disputes tribunal\". \"No decision has yet been handed down,\" he said.\nKeith Orchison, a long-time energy industry consultant, backed Mr Ferguson's defence that he did not willingly aid the Liberal Party during the NSW campaign.\nMr Orchison gave the Liberals the footage of Mr Ferguson criticising Mr Foley's approach and did so without asking him.\nMr Ferguson had denied breaching any party rules, arguing Canberra had supported attempts by former premiers Morris Iemma in NSW and Anna Bligh in Queensland to privatise electricity. He has said his views on electricity privatisation had long been known.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T12:05:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
