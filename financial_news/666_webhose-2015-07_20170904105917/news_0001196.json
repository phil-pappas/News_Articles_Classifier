At 11:32am on July 8th, at a time when market turmoil in China and fiscal turmoil in Greece were already causing concerns, trading was halted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), once the epicentre of America’s financial markets, on which almost all other trading hinged.\nFor a moment, the stoppage seemed like grounds for panic. It did not help that a mysterious computer glitch had caused United, one of America’s biggest airlines, to ground all its flights shortly beforehand. The excitable speculated that a co-ordinated cyber-attack was under way. The president was being briefed, the White House solemnly declared. Happily, it soon became clear that the problem was an internal failure, not an external assault. United’s troubles were unrelated, it turned out. At 3:10pm trading resumed.\nIn this section Uncle Xi's bear market The debt trap The trials of Saint Antony Aiming for the net Glitch perfect Tax them and they will grow Costly comparison United States Business American markets New York Stock Exchange Financial markets\nSome bemoaned the computerisation of a business that had once relied chiefly on men shouting at one another. But technology had also helped turn the outage into a non-event. All trading in shares listed on the NYSE used to occur at the NYSE. But liberalising regulation and the proliferation of alternative electronic platforms mean that trading is now consummated in numerous venues. The NYSE handles less than 14% of the trading in American shares.\nThat meant for all but the most finicky, who tried expressly to feed their orders through the NYSE (only to see them immediately rejected), the process of buying and selling shares carried on as normal. The NYSE itself said little, other than to release a brief statement explaining it was suffering from a technical fault it hoped to resolve quickly.\nThe NYSE, like all American exchanges, was already under strict orders from the Securities and Exchange Commission, America’s main market regulator, to improve its technology to ensure glitches are avoided. Such admonitions will presumably become louder now. But the episode shows how the fragmentation of the market has helped protect share-trading against technical problems at any given venue (whether it is impeding efficient pricing is another, more fraught debate).\nThat is no bad thing, since technical problems are also quite common. A flaw in 2012 that led to massive unintended share purchases almost put Knight Capital Group, one of the biggest market-makers in America at the time, out of business. A less dramatic stumble put most of NASDAQ out of action for three hours in 2013. Last year it was the turn of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world’s biggest futures market, to shut up shop briefly. Although people at the NYSE will not be thrilled by the glitch or its consequences, they are doubtless relieved about how little it mattered.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2015/07/articles/main/20150711_FNP005_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T04:48:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
