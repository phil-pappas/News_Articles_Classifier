For New Zealand businesses to make the most of this opportunity, they need hi-tech professionals working in their businesses.\" \nThe three schools are expected to train around 350 students every year once established. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T04:40:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
