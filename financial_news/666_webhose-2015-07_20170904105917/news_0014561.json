Shipments mainly go through the southern ports of Santos and Paranagua, far from the main center-west grain belt.\nRegulatory changes in the past few years, however, have made room for private investments in new export terminals, notably in the north and northeast regions, which are closer to major grain growing areas.\nLast year, Bunge Ltd and ADM Co started new soy export routes from terminals in the municipality of Barcarena in the northern state of Para.\nLast week, a trading company controlled by Japan's Mitsui shipped non-transgenic soybeans from a new site in the northeastern state of Sergipe.\nThe Maranhao grains terminal on Wednesday also received a cargo train loaded with soybeans, the first time grains have arrived by rail at the site following the construction of a branch to allow for the use of a rail line that should cut operating costs in the exporting corridor.\n\"The rail line will account for around 80 percent of total volume transported to the terminal,\" said Santos.\nSilva said total volumes this year at Maranhao's Tegram should reach 2.5 million tonnes, mostly coming from farms in Tocantins and Mato Grosso.
