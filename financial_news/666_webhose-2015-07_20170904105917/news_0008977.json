In China, stocks, which had been plunging on panic selling, found some stable ground after support measures from Beijing appeared to be working.\n\"Everything's settled down at least for one day. We're in this 'two steps forward, one step backwards'. Today, I guess, we're going two steps forward,\" said John Kinsey, portfolio manager at Caldwell Securities.\nValeant Pharmaceuticals International, always influential in index moves, rose 2.52 percent to C$290.56, to lead the gainers, while financial names filled the rest of the top five biggest index boosters.\nRoyal Bank of Canada advanced 1.2 percent to C$76.38, followed by Toronto-Dominion Bank, which added 1.13 percent to C$52.39.\nThe overall financial group, which has been under some pressure recently, climbed 1.1 percent. Health care stocks rose 1.4 percent.\nAt 10:54 a.m. EDT (1454 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was up 95.85 points, or 0.67 percent, at 14,374.34.\nOf the index's 10 main groups, eight advanced.\nEnergy stocks were among the main decliners, falling 0.6 percent as crude prices dipped on demand worries, offsetting the upbeat tone out of Greece and China.\nU.S. crude prices were down 1.1 percent at $52.21 a barrel, while Brent crude lost 0.8 percent to $58.14.\nSix of the 10 biggest drags on the TSX were oil and gas-related names, with Crescent Point Energy topping the list. Its shares fell 2.8 percent to C$24.30.\n\"Commodities are still hurting the Canadian market,\" Kinsey said.\nThe mining-heavy materials group also dragged on the sector as gold miners Goldcorp Inc and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd both fell. Goldcorp was off 1.5 percent at C$20.87, while Agnico was down 2.1 percent at C$35.58.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the TSX by 153 to 82, for a 1.87-to-1 ratio on the upside.
