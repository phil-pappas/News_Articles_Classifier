\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive and Greek creditor, also approved Greece's delivery of key reform demands. \n\"The Greek parliament took an important step toward rebuilding trust with Greece's international partners,\" said commission spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt. \nThe Eurogroup statement did not mention whether ministers had discussed a three-month 7.0 billion euro bridging loan for Greece through an EU-wide crisis fund to hold Athens over until its new bailout is ratified. \nNon-euro Britain and the Czech Republic have resisted the use of this fund, but European officials told AFP that a compromise was in the works and could be finalised on Friday. \nIn Frankfurt, the ECB played its part by boosting the ELA facility which, strictly speaking, it is only available for banks that are solvent -- a questionable assumption in Greece. \nBut Draghi said, with the bailout talks now moving forward, the conditions were \"in place\" to raise the ELA ceiling. \nAthens has failed to make a key debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund, and its next debt deadline is a 4.2-billion-euro payment to the ECB itself on July 20. \nBut Draghi was adamant that Athens would repay its debts to both the ECB and the IMF, declaring confidently that \"on 20 July, we will be repaid\". \nDraghi insisted that the capital controls introduced by Athens had protected savers, even if they may have put a temporary drag on recovery. \nThe ECB chief conceded that doubts remain about the \"willingness and capacity\" of the Greek government to push through the economic reforms demanded by its creditors. \n- 'Debt relief needed' - \nDraghi also said that Greece -- whose debts amount to 180 percent of economic output -- would need some sort of debt relief. \nThe key was what form such relief could take, he said. \nThe IMF, one of Greece's creditors alongside the EU and the ECB, caused a stir with a bombshell report criticising the deal and warning that lenders would have to go \"far beyond\" existing estimates for debt relief. \nBut for the biggest creditor, Germany -- whose parliament must vote on resuming talks on the new bailout package -- a pure and simple writeoff is seen as a no-go. \n\"A real debt haircut is irreconcilable with membership in a monetary union,\" hardline Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble insisted on Deutschlandfunk public radio. \nIn Athens, many of Syriza's hardline leftists Wednesday voted against the measures, including former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, after a tempestuous debate. \nAnd even the new finance chief Euclid Tsakalotos said his decision to back the bailout terms \"will burden me my whole life\". \nSeveral other eurozone parliaments are now due to vote on the bailout package. \nFrance gave its green light on Wednesday, and Finland's parliament on Thursday gave its approval for the bridge financing plan and for talks on a third bailout deal for Greece. \nOn Friday, German lawmakers will interrupt their summer holiday to vote on granting the government a mandate to negotiate the modalities of the new aid package.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T02:24:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
