An alternative route is available via Saddle Rd. \nThe New Zealand Transport Agency says engineers are at the site checking the material above the slip to make sure it's safe for crews to clear the road. \nUnstable material has already been identified which needs to be removed. \nToday's closure is the latest in at least two nature-related closures this year, with another rock slip in April and flooding closing the road in June. \nA truck carrying animal blood which left the road and teetered over the edge also reduced the highway to one lane last week, then closed it briefly while a crane removed the vehicle. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T04:41:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
