Montanaro \nQ: I am receiv­ing a per­cent­age of my ex-husband’s mil­i­tary retire­ment pay. I am 56 years old at this time, but I would like to know if I am enti­tled to social secu­rity ben­e­fits when I reach the age of enti­tle­ment? We did not take the Sur­vivor Ben­e­fit Plan, instead I am the ben­e­fi­ciary on his life insur­ance pol­icy. –Kathryn, Nebraska \nA: Thanks for the ques­tion, Kathryn. It actu­ally brings up inter­est­ing points in a few dif­fer­ent areas. First, I’ll address the spe­cific ques­tion you raised: Social Secu­rity. As a divorced spouse, you could be enti­tled to Social Secu­rity retire­ment (as early as age 62) or sur­vivor ben­e­fits (as early as 60, if some­thing hap­pens to your ex-husband) based on your for­mer spouse’s record–provided that your mar­riage lasted 10 years or more. Get­ting remar­ried can impact ben­e­fits based on your for­mer spouse’s record. Here’s some infor­ma­tion from the Social Secu­rity Web­site related to your question. \nYou men­tioned life insur­ance and that can cer­tainly be a good way to pro­tect you in the event some­thing hap­pens to your ex-husband. I’m not sure what type of arrange­ment exists on that front, but I’d be con­cerned if it’s a vol­un­tary arrange­ment where your ex owns the life insur­ance pol­icy. I have no idea of the sit­u­a­tion, but the owner of a life insur­ance pol­icy has the power to change the ben­e­fi­ciary if they so choose. The owner could also stop pay­ing the pre­mium and the cov­er­age could lapse. This obvi­ously has the poten­tial to leave you in a lurch. When life insur­ance is being used in this way it can make a lot of sense for the pol­icy to be owned by the ben­e­fi­ciary. Any­way, it may be some­thing to look into. Good luck.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T23:39:52.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
