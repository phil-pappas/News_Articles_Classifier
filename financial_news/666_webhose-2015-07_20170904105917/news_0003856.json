Now the social media tsunami has changed his life again, as he explains over lunch at Beppi's. Dominic Lorrimer by Andrew Clark Greg Daniel may not be a boy scout, but he came prepared.\nI arrive at Beppi's, the classic Sydney Italian restaurant still going strong after almost 60 years, 10 minutes early. But there he is, seated in a discreet alcove fondling a glass. A folder with background material is strategically parked beside his knife, and next to it, in neat military style, is a notebook with fresh entries.\nPleasantries are given summary despatch and, gulping down fizzy mineral water, we get straight down to it.\nA youthful 65, fit and trim, and dressed in a well-fitting suit, Daniel heads SR7, a firm which is not just riding on, but has pioneered the monitoring of, the social media tsunami. It has a growing list of big-end-of-town clients, and, testimony to the often sensitive nature of its work, has attracted the attention of intelligence and police agencies like ASIO and the FBI at a closed door conference.\nAn experienced advertising executive, who has run two major advertising agencies, Daniel is also a seasoned back room election campaign strategist for the Liberal and National Parties, dating back to the 1970s era of Queensland National Party premier Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, and including such figures as NSW Liberal premier Nick Greiner, and long-time Liberal prime minister John Howard.\nSpotting the opening in social media, Greg Daniel started SR7 seven years ago, and early last year it was taken over by KPMG, one of the big four accountancy firms.\nDaniel's mission now is to help business, government and NGOs deal with a social media – that is, Facebook, Twitter, blogs, platforms etc – which gives new meaning to the term \"people power\". He rates social media as the most powerful medium in the world. From agitation against coal seam gas mining to outrage over the institutional sexual abuse of minors, companies, NGOs and governments can be like petrified rabbits caught in the social media headlights.\nWhen PRs become 'internals' For activists the \"primary tool of communication, for fund raising, for getting the message out, is social media,\" Daniel says, taking another swig of mineral water.\n\"So unless you really understand how those groups are using social media, how many followers they have, what kinds of things they're really saying - unfiltered by a focus group or interpretation by some professional party - then you really are flying blind.\"\nHe calls SR7 a \"social media intelligence firm\", one that \"deals with risks emanating from social media, and how to manage and mitigate those risks.\" The firm is not into public relations, he avers, although \"we usually work hand in glove with the internals\" - an interesting term for company PRs.\n\"What we're giving them is strategic advice,\" he expands.\" We're saying 'these conversations are taking place. You should know about them. This is what we think they mean. This is the trouble it can lead you into. It's really your call as an organisation how you manage that'.\"\nIt's time to order. Greg Daniel opts for flounder and spinach and I follow suit.\nNestled on the corner of a dog-leg street in Darlinghurst, on the eastern fringe of the Sydney CBD, Beppi's is filling up. A series of private rooms and alcoves, separated by short corridors lined with wine bottles and frescoes on the walls, and located behind the main dining room, generate a sense of comforting privacy.\nThe layout and olde-worlde politesse of the waiters echo the early days of restaurants in mid-19th century Europe. Restaurants then broke out from their working class cafe roots by providing a discreet, pleasurable hang-out for well-off members of an expanding bourgeoisie and their mistresses.\nOver the years, Beppi's has performed the same discreet function with éclat. During the 1970s and 1980s it was also a favoured venue for media figures like Kerry Packer, Sam Chisholm and Mike Willesee. I recall one 80s lunch at Beppi's with Larry Lamb, the legendary, pioneering editor of Rupert Murdoch's London Sun . It was Lamb who inaugurated the page three girls, with pictures featuring women where, as the French would say, \" tout le monde est sur le balcon \" (the whole world is on the balcony).\nThey were also the days when newspaper lunches were newspaper lunches. As we launched into the third bottle of red, Larry Lamb announced \"I'm a jangly man and so are you.\"\nA more accurate description for Greg Daniel would be driven, although he resists stereotyping. He may seem buttoned up, but he is urbane, witty and irreverent.\nBorn into a well to do Brisbane family - his father was a dentist – Daniel was educated at a private school. Intriguingly, he is unwilling to provide the name because \"I hate it. They have used me a couple of times as an exemplar of old boy blah blah blah and I have told them to f*** off. 'You have done nothing for me. I have done it all on my own'.\"\nAfter graduating in Arts at the University of Queensland, he began working in advertising in Brisbane, and was also involved in election strategy development for the National Party, then at the apex of its uninterrupted 32-year rule in Queensland.\nGreg Daniel moved to Sydney where his career took off. He accepted a job offer with a PR firm in Washington owned by New York-based agency, Doyle Dane Bernbach. However, the late Keith Cousins, then chairman of George Patterson, Australia's biggest advertising agency, and \"the best advertising leader I met during those years\", changed his life.\n\"I went for a run and a surf on Palm Beach and met Keith. He had just had a heart operation and was stepping down as chairman of George Patterson and handing over to [his half-brother] Geoffrey.\nLanding the perfect job \"He read the riot act to me. I said 'Keith, I don't think there's anything here that I want to do and he said 'go and talk to Geoffrey'. I went to George Patts in George Street and Geoff asked: 'What's your perfect job?' and I described this job and he said 'well that's my f***ing job'.\"\nThe result was that Greg Daniel became head of the George Patterson-affiliated Campaign Palace, a local advertising hot shop troubled by high executive turnover and financial problems. Daniel turned it around, and was later head-hunted to run John Clemenger, then Australia's second biggest advertising agency, in Sydney.\nSeveral PR and lobbying ventures followed, leading up to the formation of SR7 with his business partner, James Griffin.\nAlong the way he married prominent tax barrister Louise McBride. They have two children, Unity and Hunter, and are now divorced. Greg Daniel's long-time partner is English-born Sharon Williams, chief executive of Taurus, a marketing, PR, and social media agency who, for a time, penned the Twitterati column in the media section of The Australian.\nSo the two form a sort of media power couple, although they would shy away from the term, preferring to lead a quiet social life with friends like former Coalition Government Communications Minister Helen Coonan, and her husband, retired NSW Supreme Court Justice Andrew Rogers.\nBut media fascinates Greg Daniel. We swap industry gossip as we eat the delicious flounder, a flat, bottom-feeding, fish, complemented by generous servings of spinach.\nWhen Daniel talks of what SR7 does for its clients as it deals with the power of social media, it's important to remember he is speaking in a media landscape where the percentage of PRs to newspaper journalists has more than quadrupled. PR is also an industry unable to fully shrug off British author and commentator Malcolm Muggeridge's description of \"organised lying\".\nThe picture of an exploding social media intelligence and monitoring industry feeding into an also exploding PR sector to ward off or neutralise social media campaigns has Orwellian, Big Brother overtones. But Greg Daniel swats these away with references to promoting \"debate\".\nA growing group of clients Engaged in this \"debate\", SR7 clients range from chief risk officers, corporate affairs executives, investor relations managers, company boards and chief executives to the heads of NGOs, and government.\nAccording to Daniel, as social media campaigns accelerate, becoming more sophisticated and influential, SR7 is growing apace. He does not provide a precise breakdown but says revenue is increasing 75 per cent a year, and clients are expanding by 50 per cent over the same period.\nA recent example of SR7 involvement is the Royal Commission into institutional sexual abuse. The NGO client called before the Royal Commission sought SR7's help 18 months before hearings began.\n\"They realised certain things had occurred in the past that could put the organisation in a very bad light, so they tasked us with looking closely at social media to see if there were any more things out there about them they should know more about.\n\"A lot of what we found enabled them to start having a dialogue with some of those individuals and groups.\n\"That proved very fortuitous because, by the time the Royal Commission came along, they were legitimately able to say that these are things that have happened in the past and they had put certain benchmarks in place to make sure they minimised the potential for these things to happen going forwards.\n\"So our best work is in a sense pre-emptive and predictive because a lot of the conversations that happen on social media from a risk perspective start small and bubble away.\"\nOur conversation also keeps bubbling away.\nAs the plates are removed, I recall one key element missing from his brief career chronology. Greg Daniel went to Tehran in 1974 on an international scholarship for promising young figures in the advertising industry. He travelled widely in the region - north to the Caspian Sea and Qom, the Iranian religious centre, and to Syria - now a blood-soaked base for the ISIS death cult.\nHow ISIS does its real wooing What can the West do about ISIS' brilliant, deathly campaigns on social media?\nGreg Daniel ponders the question for a while, and just as coffee arrives, he says: \"In the western media we are obviously horrified and to a degree preoccupied by the violent images ISIS disseminates through social media. [But] we seem to be unaware of all the other messaging that ISIS puts out on social media about its utopian vision for the caliphate and the appeal that has for a large number of people who are going out there as doctors and engineers.\n\"So I think any objective analysis of the very sophisticated way ISIS uses social media [would show that] we're not really appreciating the full picture. The first thing we've got to truly understand is how they do what they do and why it is so effective. Until we do that, we can't come up with a coherent strategy about how to counteract [ISIS].\"\nThe competing Al Qaeda terrorist group, responsible for the Twin Towers bombing in New York on September 11, 2001, was composed of \"revolutionaries\" who \"went out there and perpetrated terrorist acts,\" but failed to generate a general uprising, Daniel said.\n\"ISIS has taken a completely different tack. It's gone populist. It uses pop culture to promote terrorism and to promote its reason for terrorism which is the caliphate. There are lots of dots there to be joined and the link between them is social media.\"\nThere was a lot more to talk about. We finally emerge from Beppi's into the brilliant Sydney winter sunshine. Greg Daniel heads back to the CBD; I take a bus, heading east.\nBeppi's\n21 Yurong Street, Sydney\n3 mineral waters, $22.50\n2 grilled flounder, $76\n2 spinach, $20\n1 gelato, $17\n3 coffees, $16.50\nTotal, $152\n​", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:16:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
