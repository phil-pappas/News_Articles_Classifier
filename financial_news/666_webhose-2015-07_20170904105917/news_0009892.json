They had higher obesity rates and lower income than the typical American household, and the percentage of adults with a college degree was universally lower than the national rate of 29.1%, and in four instances, it was below 20%.\nTo determine the well-being of Americans, Gallup-Healthways surveyed hundreds of thousands of Americans in 189 metropolitan areas in the U.S. in 2012 and 2013. The survey recorded the physical and emotional health of the residents, as well as financial, employment, and social indicators, among others.\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 189 metropolitan areas assessed by the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index. Scores range from 0 to 100, with 100 representing ideal well-being. The index is composed of six subindexes that measure access to basic needs, healthy behaviors, work environment, physical health, life evaluation and emotional health. 24/7 Wall St. also considered income, poverty and educational attainment figures from the U.S. Census Bureau, all from 2012, plus local unemployment rates and violent crime rates. These are America’s most miserable cities:\nKentuckiana/Wikipedia Slide 2 of 12 10. Evansville, Ind.-Ky. Well-Being Index score: 62.9\nPct. adults with college degree: 22.2%\nPct. smokers: 29.4%\nMedian household income: $44,887\nHalf of Evansville residents said they were suffering last year, one of the highest proportions nationwide. Like most metro areas fairing poorly on the Well-Being Index, Evansville residents earned less than the average American. The median household income in the area was $44,887 in 2012, considerably less than the national median of $51,371. Respondents’ unhealthy habits contributed to their low well-being. Residents in only two other cities were less likely to engage in behaviors leading to good physical health. Nearly 29.4% of Evansville respondents said they smoked last year, and less than 60% ate healthily all day, both among the worst rates nationwide.\nWikipedia Slide 3 of 12 9. Mobile, Ala. Well-Being Index score: 62.9\nPct. adults with college degree: 21.5%\nPct. smokers: 22.8%\nMedian household income: $39,691\nMobile, Alabama, had among the highest percentages of residents who said they were angry within the past 24 hours. Exceptionally high rates of violent crimes may be one cause for unhappiness. There were 552 violent crimes and about 11 murders per 100,000 residents in 2012, both among the most in the nation. Residents did not particularly enjoy their work either. Only a little more than half said they felt their bosses treated them as partners. In terms of health, the area also did not fare especially well. One in 20 residents said they had previously been diagnosed with cancer, one of the highest rates in the country. The area was also in the top 10% for the percentage of residents who suffered from high blood pressure.\nShutterstock Slide 4 of 12 8. Shreveport-Bossier City, La. Well-Being Index score: 62.9\nPct. adults with college degree: 23.4%\nPct. smokers: 24.7%\nMedian household income: $44,118\nThe Shreveport economy has performed exceptionally poorly in recent years. According to IHS Global Insight, the area’s economy shrank by 11% in 2012, and again by more than 5% last year. The weak economy has likely impacted the well-being of residents. Shreveport was one of only a few metro areas where the unemployment rate worsened between December 2012 and December of last year, rising from 6.0% to 6.3%. In addition to enduring poor economic conditions, Shreveport residents also had some of the nation’s least healthy behaviors. Just 46% said they exercised for 30 minutes on a regular basis last year, less than residents of all but one other area.\nDeutschlandreform/Wikipedia Slide 5 of 12 7. Columbus, Ga.-Ala. Well-Being Index score: 62.3\nPct. adults with college degree: 21.9%\nPct. smokers: 27.4%\nMedian household income: $42,972\nColumbus area residents were among the most depressed in the country. Roughly 24% said they had been told by a physician or nurse that they suffered from depression, one of the highest percentages in the country. As much as 19% of people surveyed said that they had not experienced enjoyment within the past 24 hours, the seventh-highest percentage among cities surveyed. A large portion of the residents, roughly 23%, did not like the city in which they lived, also one of the highest rates in the Well-Being Index. A lack of access to basic needs, for which Columbus was rated among the worst in the nation, can also explain the residents’ unhappiness. The area ranked last, for example, in having easy access to medicine. And just 67% of respondents said they had enough money to buy food at all times last year, also the least nationwide.\nRegrothenberger at en.wikipedia Slide 6 of 12 6. Beaumont-Port Arthur, Tex. Well-Being Index score: 62.2\nPct. adults with college degree: 17.1%\nPct. smokers: 26.1%\nMedian household income: $43,421\nBeaumont residents gave their work environments some of the lowest ratings in the nation. Less than half of Beaumont residents said they were treated like a partner by their supervisors, much less than the 57% of Americans who said so last year. The area’s unemployment rate has been improving in recent years, but at 9.4% it is still among the highest nationwide. Like residents in a number of other miserable areas, Beaumont residents often did not practice healthy behaviors. Most notably, just 57.3% of respondents stated they had eaten healthy food all of the previous day, among the worst in the nation. According to a recent University of Vermont study reviewing more than 10 million tweets from around the country, Beaumont was rated as America’s saddest city.\nWikipedia Slide 7 of 12 5. Hickory-Lenoir-Morganton, N.C. Well-Being Index score: 62.2\nPct. adults with college degree: 16.7%\nPct. smokers: 30.1%\nMedian household income: $37,364\nRoughly 51% of residents in the Hickory region of North Carolina were considered to be struggling, based on self-evaluations of their current lives and futures, compared with just 44% of Americans. Residents were less optimistic about their futures than respondents in all but seven other cities. About 19% said they did not have enough energy to keep pace with their daily lives within the previous 24 hours, which was close to last nationwide. Additionally, only 77.4% said they had not been sad within the past 24 hours, among the lowest rates in the nation. Possibly adding to the unhappiness of residents was the area’s economy. The median household income was just $37,364 in 2012, among the lowest in the country.\nAnthonyA7/Wikipedia Slide 8 of 12 4. Spartanburg, S.C. Well-Being Index score: 62.2\nPct. adults with college degree: 20.5%\nPct. smokers: 27.5%\nMedian household income: $40,879\nSpartanburg residents were among the poorest and unhappiest in the nation. Only 45.9% of people surveyed said they were especially happy about their current lives or future prospects, which ranks among the lowest in the nation. Few places had worse scores than Spartanburg for overall emotional health. Area residents were among the most likely Americans to report being depressed or angry. A large proportion of the residents were struggling financially. The median household income was $40,879 in 2012, among the lowest in the country. In many cases, residents did not have enough money for basic needs. Only a little more than 73% of respondents said they had enough money for food at all times in the previous 12 months, and 72.5% said they had enough money for health care and medicine. Both were among the worst figures in the nation.\nTony Webster/Wikipedia Slide 9 of 12 3. Redding, Calif. Well-Being Index score: 62.0\nPct. adults with college degree: 18.2%\nPct. smokers: 20.4%\nMedian household income: $45,442\nRedding area residents had exceptionally negative evaluations of their lives, with 6.8% describing themselves as suffering, the highest of any metro area. Limited job opportunities may be one factor. The unemployment rate in the area, which was nearly 14% at the end of 2011, had not fallen below 10% as of the end of last year. Residents were also among the least emotionally healthy. Just 87% of respondents said they were treated with respect in the last 24 hours, less than in every other area reviewed last year. Respondents also reported higher rates of depression than almost anywhere else in the country. One possible explanation for this may be Redding’s violent crime rate of more than 723 per 100,000 people in 2012, one of the highest in the nation.\nSpirit of America/Shutterstock.com Slide 10 of 12 2. Charleston, W.Va. Well-Being Index score: 60.0\nPct. adults with college degree: 23.0%\nPct. smokers: 34.3%\nMedian household income: $47,610\nCharleston area residents were exceptionally unhappy with their jobs, giving their work environments some of the worst marks in the nation. Nearly 19% of respondents were not satisfied with their jobs in 2013, the highest rate in the nation. And roughly 26% believed they did not use their strengths at work, also the highest in the nation. Respondents’ emotional health was also among the poorest in the nation. Only 81.2% said they had not been angry for much of the past 24 hours, the worst rate in the nation. Additionally, 27.2% said they had been told by a medical professional they had depression, the second-highest percentage in the country. Residents’ physical health was similarly poor. The area ranked in the top five for the percentage of people who suffered from both diabetes and high blood pressure. And 7% of those surveyed stated they had previously suffered a heart attack, nearly twice the national rate of 3.8%.\nWV Funnyman/Wikipedia Slide 11 of 12 1. Huntington-Ashland, W.Va.-Ky.-Ohio Well-Being Index score: 59.5\nPct. adults with college degree: 19.0%\nPct. smokers: 29.2%\nMedian household income: $39,160\nThe Huntington metro area was the worst rated in the nation by a number of measures. Respondents were the most likely Americans to report physical health problems, with exceptionally high rates of diabetes, cancer diagnoses, and chronic pain. More than 34.4% reported high cholesterol, and 46.9% reported high blood pressure last year, both the most of any metro area and perhaps leading to the high rate of heart attacks reported. Nearly one in 10 people surveyed stated they had previously suffered a heart attack, more than in any other area. Nearly 40% reported they were obese last year, the highest rate in the nation. Similarly, no metro area scored worse for emotional health than Huntington, where residents were more likely to say they felt worried or depressed than anywhere else in America. Residents also had lower overall evaluations of their current lives and future prospects than respondents in any other metro area.\nSee which cities are America’s most content at 24/7 Wall St.\nPrev Page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Next Page You Might Like", "external_links": ["http://www.healthways.com/solution/default.aspx?id=1125", "http://247wallst.com/special-report/2014/03/25/americas-most-content-and-miserable-cities-2/"], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T02:25:18.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
