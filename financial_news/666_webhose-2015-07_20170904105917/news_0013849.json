These include BHP’s other big earners, petroleum and copper.\nCommodity prices have been battered by ructions in China’s stockmarket that have sparked renewed concern about the health of the world’s second biggest economy.\nNickel has slumped 18.5 per cent, Brent crude oil 10 per cent, copper and zinc 7 per cent, silver 5 per cent and aluminium 4.5 per cent over the past month.\nEven gold, usually a safe haven, is down 1.5 per cent over the month.\nDollars and Sense. Picture: Roy\nThe slide in nickel, zinc and silver means BHP spin-off South32’s earnings for the year to next June will be 56 per cent lower than UBS had previously forecast. South32 has made an underwhelming start to life on the market, with its shares closing at $1.755 on Thursday — about 18 per cent below its May listing price.\nThe UBS report was issued on Wednesday, before the latest iron ore plunge. UBS had pencilled in iron ore to average $US45 a tonne for the rest of the year before rising slightly to $US48 a tonne in 2016.\nUsing Wednesday’s spot price of $US47.08, Rio Tinto would take a 7 per cent hit to earnings while Fortescue’s would rise by 33 per cent.\nThe iron ore crash comes as struggling junior miner Atlas Iron taps investors for $180 million to shore up its balance sheet.\nManaging director David Flanagan on Thursday told BusinessDaily the business was viable as it had locked in forward sales at prices ranging from $US53 to $US59 a tonne. He also revealed he was personally investing $200,000 and that he owned three million shares bought at $1.40 each.\njohn.dagge@news.com.au\n BHP to hurt most if commodities fail to recover", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/905127-9bef5a08-2619-11e5-b2b1-af71b9aa897c.jpg", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/earnings-hit-ahead-if-commodities-fail-to-recover/story-fni0dcne-1227435905757"], "published": "2015-07-10T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T05:23:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
