Activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC, which owned 1.8 percent of Qualcomm’s outstanding shares as of March 31, has called for the company to review opportunities including potentially separating design from Qualcomm’s more profitable licensing business.\nThe company has come under pressure from investors as its grip over the smartphone industry slips and it heads for its first annual sales decline since the financial crisis hurt industrywide demand in 2009. Customers such as Samsung Electronics Co. have started using their own chips. Separately, regulators in the European Union, Korea and the U.S. are investigating Qualcomm’s business practices, raising concern that it may be forced to charge handset makers less for access to its technology.\nIntel, Broadcom Intel Corp.’s $17 billion deal for Altera Corp. and Avago Technologies Ltd.’s $37 billion agreement to buy Broadcom Corp. occurred while Qualcomm was trying to appease Jana by cutting costs and shaking up its board. Jana agreed to some standstill provisions, including that it won’t speak publicly about Qualcomm’s plans, call shareholder meetings or increase its holdings in the chipmaker to more than 4 percent as the company conducts its review.\nMollenkopf declined to identify specific targets. He did say the company is focused on expanding outside of its mobile-phone business, including making chips for the connected car -- automobiles hooked to the Internet -- and health-care services. He said the company is better positioned to take on larger acquisitions now that the licensing business is healthier after settling an antitrust lawsuit with China earlier this year.\n“It’s an interesting time to be a scale player in the semiconductor industry, particularly from a position of strength,” Mollenkopf said. “We’ve had strategic flexibility, but it’s important that you have your home business well structured for the future first.”\nConnected Gadgets Qualcomm, like every other major chip company, is pointing to the increasing use of chips in vehicles and industrial equipment as a potential growth area for its products. While there’s been a proliferation of devices connected to the Internet, there’s no one area, cars included, that comes close to the more than 1 billion smartphones shipped a year as an individual end market.\n“It’s important for us to grow outside of the phone space,” said Mollenkopf. “The phone continues to be a good business but it also provides the springboard to allow us to grow into new areas.”\nFor example, Qualcomm could consider buying Nvidia Corp. or NXP Semiconductors NV to broaden its exposure into automobiles, Sanford C.
