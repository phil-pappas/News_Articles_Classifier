Capital costs are down to C$20.6 billion ($16.18 billion), from C$22.9 billion, on optimized engineering and increased production, the diversified miner said.\nIt extended its estimates of the mine's life to 41 years, from 2026 to 2066, up from 37 years.\nTeck initially applied in 2011 for approval of the mine, which is 110 kilometers (68 miles) north of the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray, Alberta.\nTeck also has a 20 percent stake in Suncor Inc's much-delayed C$13.5 billion Fort Hills, Alberta, oil sands project.\nA final decision to proceed with the Frontier project will be made by Teck's board of directors.\nOil sands mining involves an expensive process of separating tar-like bitumen from sand. It is then blended into heavy oil or upgraded into synthetic oil. U.S. crude prices hit a six-year low in March of this year.\nShares in Teck, which separately announced a revised gold streaming deal on Thursday, were 3 percent higher at C$11.62 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday morning.\n\"We believe that Teck is considering additional streaming deals on the silver output from its interests in the Antamina and Highland Valley mines,\" TD Securities analyst Greg Barnes said in a note to clients.\n\"We believe that Teck could raise proceeds of between $500 million - $1 billion via the silver stream sales. The monies raised could be applied to debt reduction, funding capex for the Fort Hills project or for copper mine acquisitions.\"\n($1=$1.27 Canadian) (Additional reporting by Nia Williams in Calgary, Alberta; Editing by Peter Galloway)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T17:52:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
