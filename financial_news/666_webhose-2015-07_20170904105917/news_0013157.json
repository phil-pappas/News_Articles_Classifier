Christopher Pearce Share on twitter by David Ramli iiNet chief executive David Buckingham says the massive popularity of internet services like Netflix means current broadband plans will not be sustainable under the national broadband network unless the company building it drastically slashes prices.\nNetflix is a video-on-demand service that has seen a surge in popularity among Australians since its launch in March. Internet service providers like Singtel-Optus and iiNet are not charging customers for the data used by Netflix as both a marketing tool and a way to prevent bill shock for users.\nBut the service consumes a huge amount of data because it offers constant streaming of high-definition videos to several devices simultaneously â€“ an issue some claim would make it unaffordable under the NBN's current pricing arrangements.\n\"The whole industry is running around trying to deal with [Netflix],\" Mr Buckingham told Fairfax Media. \"We got 6-to-12 months' worth of [data] growth in six weeks. Nobody can forecast that. This is an unprecedented shift in the market that no one anticipated.\"\nThe sudden surge in usage caused high-profile internet slowdown problems for iiNet in the weeks following Netflix's launch . Mr Buckingham said the telco had since bought the capacity it needed to fix the problem, as shown by its coming second in Netflix's latest ISP speed index .\nBut he warned that all internet customers would face a financial crunch if they wanted to use Netflix once the NBN was complete, unless prices changed. This is despite NBN providing a 12.5 per cent discount to its wholesale charge in February.\nThe main complaint for telcos is a fee charged by NBN called the connectivity virtual circuit charge (CVC), which costs $17.50 per 1 megabit per second. iiNet chief technology officer Mark Dioguardi in April warned that users could be forced to pay a \"Netflix tax\" of $26 a month extra for moderate HD streaming, and $60 a month for the ability to watch occasional 4K streams.\nSuperloop chief executive Bevan Slattery believes it should fall by 70 per cent. \"At the moment customers are getting a great deal on Netflix because you've got Optus, Dodo, TPG and Exetel offering unlimited [download] packages and we're doing unmetered Netflix,\" he said. \"The CVC construct before Netflix turned up in this country was significant multiples higher than the cost-base we're experiencing on our own networks or even under Telstra.\n \"It's a problem that needs to be dealt with, and it's just gotten worse with things like Netflix adding so much more [need for] capacity onto the network.\"\nMr Buckingham added he'd \"like to think that NBN will tackle the problem\" before consumers are slugged with exorbitant fees.\nHowever, lowering the prices by too much could make the NBN unprofitable, which would add billions of dollars in costs to the federal budget.\nBut NBN has been responding to industry concerns and cut its CVC charge by 12.5 per cent in February. It is attempting to work out a range of ways to make high-speed services far more affordable for Australians who previously had little need for super-fast internet speeds.\n\"Our customers are at the heart of everything we do and we are committed to both upgrading Australia's broadband network and building a sustainable wholesale company,\" an NBN spokesman said. \"We will continue to engage with retail service providers on our commercial model as more and more premises connect.\"", "external_links": ["http://ispspeedindex.netflix.com/australia", "https://twitter.com/Davidramli"], "published": "2015-07-05T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:13:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
