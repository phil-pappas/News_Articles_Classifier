With rates presently close to zero, even if they rise “modestly before the next recession strikes, they will clearly have less ammo than in the past”, he said. \nSource: Lombard Street Research, Federal Reserve \nMr Perkins warned that the US may now be “due another recession” the average post-war US expansion has lasted less than five years while lower trend rates of growth meant that technical recessions may in future become more frequent. \nPolicymakers could again turn to quantitative easing, but congressional antagonism could create a political barrier to large-scale interventions, as might concerns about diminishing returns from asset purchases and their uncertain impact. \n“The recovery from the global financial crash has been unusually tepid,” Mr Perkins said, one factor in the Fed’s hesitancy to set interest rates back to their pre-crisis levels. Disappointing jobs data released this week is likely to lead policymakers to keep rates on hold for even longer. \nAs minutes of the Fed’s committee of rate setters are prepared for publication this Wednesday, policymakers’ reactions to some weaker economic data has been unclear.James Bullard, the president of the St Louis Fed, has said that he wants “more evidence that activity is rebounding in the second quarter”. \nSource: Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) , BLS \n“Data might not meet [the Fed’s] desire for decisive evidence that growth will be sustained, especially as market volatility could add noise to otherwise clear economic signals expected in the coming months,” Rob Martin, of Barclays, said. \nThe cautionary tone struck by central bank watchers follows the warnings of the Bank for International Settlements last week , which said that in some places monetary policy had begun “testing its outer limits”. \nThese warnings were this week repeated by Claudio Borio, its head of monetary and economics department. “If I were you, I wouldn’t start from here,” Mr Borio said, reflecting on how low central bank interest rates had become, and the difficulties policymakers will have in returning them to “normal” levels. \nIn a world where central banks may become increasingly reliant on quantitative easing, interventions in the foreign exchange markets, and forward guidance, Mr Borio said that central banks must “try to move back to a situation where they use interest rates as their primary tool”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T23:01:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
