Photo: Bloomberg\nThe Australian dollar plummeted to a fresh six-year low on Friday, falling to US72.68¢ after Chinese manufacturing output data unexpectedly hit a 15-month low.\nThe local currency fell a much as half a cent from US73.47¢ to US72.92¢ just after midday following a surprise fall in the Caixin/Markit China flash manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) from 49.4 in June to 48.2 in July.\nSpeculators will continue push the currency down further as commodity prices, a strong Greenback and Chinese growth concerns all point towards a lower Aussie.\nMatt Simpson, ThinkForex By 1pm AEST, the Aussie had continued to fall to as low as US72.68¢ but in late afternoon trade the currency was back around US73¢.\nThe dollar entered a US72 cent handle on Friday. Photo: Chartbuilder\n\"Today's PMI data was just another blow to the Australian dollar, which was already feeling the pressure from weak commodity prices and a strong US dollar,\" ThinkForex senior market analyst Matt Simpson said.\nAdvertisement Mr Simpson said the fall would put the Australian dollar on the back foot ahead of the open of the US and European markets who have yet to respond to the data.\nChina's manufacturing PMI, a barometer of economic health, has contracted for five consecutive months, and is at its lowest level since April 2014, with analysts blaming the contraction on weak export demand and the recent puncture of China's sharemarket bubble.\nAny number on the index above 50 indicates expansion, while below 50 means a contraction. The number was forecast to come in between 49.1 and 50.1.\nThe Australian resources sector has already been under pressure as demand for Chinese steel slows amid a slowdown in its economy.\nAny weakness from China has a detrimental effect on the economy, Mr Simpson said.\n\"Speculators will continue push the currency down further as commodity prices, a strong Greenback and Chinese growth concerns all point towards a lower Aussie,\" he said.\n\"With no more data from either the US or Australia for the remainder of the week there appears little reason for speculators to be buying Australian dollars for the remainder of the session.\"\nThe data also whacked the Australian sharemarket, with the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index hitting an intraday low of 5551.8 just after 1pm AEST.\nThe embattled New Zealand dollar also extended its day's losses, plumbing its own fresh six-year low of US65.66¢ on the news.\nThe PMI figures bring into question the latest GDP figures from China which hit the Chinese government's target for 7 per cent growth in the second quarter.\nThe GDP figures, released last week, were led by a bounce in industrial production, which rose at an annual rate of 6.8 per cent.\nCapital Economics' Julian Evans-Pritchard said last week the stronger than expected figure would spark renewed questions over the reliability of official Chinese data.\n\"While actual growth is almost certainly a percentage point or two slower than the official figures show, there are good reasons to think the figures are mirroring a genuine stabilisation of conditions on the ground,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/markets/china-outlook-weakens-as-caixinmarkit-flash-pmi-hits-surprise-15month-low-20150724-gijogf"], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:39:27.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
