As an activity index, it should be more resilient than recent sentiment indicators, which have been affected by the volatility in equities,\" Sean Callow, senior strategist at Westpac, said in a note.\nWhile Beijing's support steps appear to have halted this month's stock market rout, some fear that fragile investor sentiment could drag on the financial services sector and weigh down the economy in the coming months.\nChina looks set to further reduce interest rates and the amount of cash its banks must hold as reserves to try to keep its economy growing at 7 percent this year, which would be the slowest pace in a quarter of a century, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.\nOn Wall Street overnight, downbeat corporate earnings reports sent U.S. equities lower, with all three major U.S. indexes logging solid losses.\nBetter-than-expected U.S. jobless claims gave U.S. Treasury yields a boost, adding to the dollar's appeal, though yields came back down as risk appetite evaporated in the face of Wall Street's losses.\nThe benchmark U.S. 10-year yield was at 2.276 percent in Asian trading, compared to its U.S. close of 2.278 percent on Thursday.\nThe weekly employment data showed that initial jobless claims declined 26,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 255,000, the lowest since November 1973.\nUpbeat employment and housing data this week have backed the view that the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates, perhaps as early as September, which has underpinned the greenback.\nThe euro was last up about 0.1 percent on the day at $1.0991 , after gaining in the previous session, as the Greek parliament approved a second set of reforms required to start negotiations with lenders in a bid to avert bankruptcy.\nThe dollar was steady on the day at 123.93 yen. The Japanese currency was briefly on the defensive on Thursday after the International Monetary Fund warned Japan to avoid over-reliance on a weak currency to reflate its economy.\nSpot gold was steady on the day at $1,090.55 an ounce, but on track for a weekly loss of nearly 4 percent, after marking its deepest one-day loss in nearly two years on Monday.\nCrude oil futures rebounded from multi-month lows recorded overnight, with U.S. crude up about 0.7 percent at $48.81 a barrel, after marking its lowest settlement since March 31.\nBrent added 0.4 percent to $55.47, after it settled at its lowest level since April 2 on Thursday, amid persistent fears about a global supply glut.
