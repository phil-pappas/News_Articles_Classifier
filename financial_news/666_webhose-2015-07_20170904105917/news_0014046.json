Xchanging boss to step down as procurement losses worsen By Marion Dakers | Telegraph – 5 minutes ago -28.2500 \nOutsourcing firm says Ken Lever will leave at the end of the year \nXchanging (LSE: XCH.L - news ) , which runs back offices for blue-chip firms, is parting ways with its chief executive after worsening losses in its procurement business sent the company into the red in the first half of the year. \nKen Lever, who became chief executive following a profit warning in 2011 , will leave the firm at the end of 2015. \nThe company has spread its reach from traditional outsourcing jobs, such as payroll and accounts, into software services and analytics. However, new work to manage “tail-end spend” on one client’s long-term contracts has incurred “unacceptable losses”, while the traditional procurement business continued to suffer from customer losses and renegotiations. \n\"Ken's drive and determination has led the transformation of Xchanging, and we now need to build on the strong foundation which has been laid to drive sales growth and generate returns on the investments we have made so as to enhance value to our shareholders,” said Geoff Unwin, chairman of Xchanging. \nXchanging, which was the first sponsor of the Oxford-Cambridge boat race until the contract ended in 2012, posted a 3pc fall in revenues to £199.4m in the first six months of the year, while adjusted profit before tax fell 2.8pc to £17.1m. \nA £47m impairment booked on the procurement business took the group to an overall loss of £41.1m. \nXchanging has also run through some of its cash pile and increased its debts, moving it from a net cash position of £107.5m a year ago to net debts of £31.3m. \n“Results echo the profit warning of 2011, but this setback is not systemic and the company is today operationally stronger,” analysts at Liberum said in a research note. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in the firm slumped by more than a fifth to 97p in morning trading. The firm joined the stock market in 2007 with a share price of 240p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T17:39:37.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
