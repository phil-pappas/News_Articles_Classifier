Louise Kennerley by Robert Harley The surge in house prices is due to low interest rates, not tax concessions, according to ANZ Research.\nThe upcoming federal-state meeting on tax reform and the Reserve Bank's submission to the House of Representatives' inquiry into home ownership have reignited the debate on the impact on house prices of negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions.\nANZ Research, in a paper on housing affordability released on Friday acknowledged that the debate continued about the impact of policy, such as negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions, particularly in response to strong investor housing demand and price growth in Sydney.\nHowever, these factors have existed for around 30 years and 15 years respectively,\" wrote ANZ Research's David Cannington.\n\"What has changed recently, and is more likely to have driven the house price response, has been further cuts to interest rates,\" he wrote.\nThe paper acknowledges that multi-year low interest rates have driven house deposit affordability to an \"all-time low. At the same time, those low mortgage rates have improved affordability for mortgage holders, and, as rents have stabilised, for renters, as well as boosting household wealth for owners\".\nThe paper predicted that new apartment construction in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane would provide more housing supply at a lower price point and \"ease housing affordability across all household types in coming years\".\nOthers have also entered the negative gearing debate in recent days, with David Willis, from the QUT Business School, recommending the federal government \"tread carefully\" before making any changes to negative gearing.\n Dr Willis said that though the paring back of capital gains and negative gearing could make housing more affordable, it could also create a housing glut, house price deflation, slower lending, less renovation and rocketing rents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:12:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
