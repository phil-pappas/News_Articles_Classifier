Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Michael Smith While Echo Entertainment was the underdog the last time it went into battle with James Packer, the odds have long been on the Sydney casino operator to win round two in Brisbane.\nThe Queensland government's decision to allow Echo to retain its two-decade casino monopoly in Brisbane is a crucial win for the company, which is still recovering from the severe beating it took from Packer's Crown Resorts in Sydney two years ago.\nDefeat would have been a huge blow for Echo chief Matt Bekier as he seeks to restore the gaming group's fortunes and attract more high rollers back to his casinos before Crown Sydney opens in 2019.\nEcho managers have been confident for a while they would win, which has been reflected in the 11 per cent increase in the company's share price since the start of July. As the incumbent with an existing casino on site and no need to bring in additional poker machines, it had a level of community and political support that even the well-oiled Crown machine could not rival.\nIt had a lot more to lose from the high-stakes bidding war than Crown. And as anyone who goes up against Packer knows, anything is possible. An 11th-hour push by Crown to get its bid across the line with financial incentives to boost state coffers – a poker machine buyback scheme – meant nothing was certain.\nThe important project will transform Brisbane. Given Labor has shelved the previous government's privatisation plans, the spotlight is on Queen's Wharf as one of the state's few big capital projects.\nIf Crown had won Echo would have been allowed to keep running its existing Treasury casino next door but its future would no longer be viable.\nSmall fry for Crown While a loss for Crown, Brisbane is small fry for Crown's expanding global empire, as it pushes ahead with an estimated $US10 billion ($13.53 billion) in new casinos by 2020. A new casino is opening in Macau soon.\nEcho's victory did not come easily, however, and Crown has again made life difficult for its main Australian competitor.\nThe surprise change of government in Queensland in January did not help either, given the widespread speculation that Echo had it in the bag until politics delayed the decision.\nThe challenge now for Echo will be funding the ambitious proposal. Construction starts in 2016 and will take about five years to complete. Forecasts vary but some analysts predict it will need to raise more than $1 billion in capital from 2017.\nThe Echo proposal includes five new hotels, a theatre and transferring the existing gaming facilities, including 1600 gaming machines from its existing Treasury site to Queens's Wharf. Echo's Hong Kong partners, which will provide 25 per cent of the capital each, will build the residential component of the project.\nThe decision is a win for local retailers, pub and club and hotel owners, who argued it was madness to allow a second casino operator to open in such a small market.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/queens_wharf_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-07-20T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T12:03:07.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
