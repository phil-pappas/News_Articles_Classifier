Paul Harris by Duncan Hughes Still calling Australia home won't help self-managed superannuation fund members with super assets sitting in overseas schemes, particularly in popular destinations such as Greece and the United Kingdom.\nIt's a problem faced by thousands of Australians who return home after years of working abroad, often having built substantial super nest-eggs in foreign systems.\nThe Greek crisis and complex changes to the way British pensions are paid into Australian schemes are encouraging savers to consider a variety of strategies for repatriating assets.\n\"Increased volatility in global markets is causing many with assets in overseas superannuation to explore their options,\" says David Lane, director, Pitcher Partners Wealth Management. \"Our clients are asking whether the gyrations create opportunities for them and what does it mean to the SMSF balances.\"\nThere are lots of similarities between Australians who spend a few years overseas and members of self-managed super funds.\nThey are typically highly skilled, tertiary educated and increasingly mobile, moving between Australia and other countries as career and life changes occur.\nThere are an estimated 1 million Australians living and working overseas, broadly in line with the number of do-it-yourself fund members. New Zealand, Britain and the United States remain the most popular countries, but the focus is shifting towards Asia, particularly Hong Kong.\nAbout four-fifths of expatriates return within two years of their \"permanent\" departure, mostly coming back for significant life events, such as their children beginning school, or parents entering care.\n \"Before repatriating assets you need to answer some important lifestyle questions,\" says Lane.\n\"Where do you plan to retire? If Australia, then it's probably smart to move your assets here,\" he says. After that, advice is needed on switching from a foreign currency into Australian dollars, experts argue.\nA falling euro against the Australian dollar is one of the issues creating interest among Australians with assets in Europe, Lane says.\nDifferent issues arise if transferring defined benefit schemes, or from jurisdictions where there is a departure tax for repatriating assets.\nScheme members also need to check on how it impacts life insurance, particularly for those who might find it difficult to find another insurer because of age or health.\nSuper lump sums transferred into Australia are taxed in Australia at varying rates depending upon how long the member has been back in the country. Contributions to an Australian super scheme made within six months of the saver gaining residency (for tax purposes) are generally tax-free.\nOtherwise, contributions will be considered to be of the after-tax variety, and capped at $180,000 a year. Scheme members can bring forward three years of contributions, or a total of $540,000.\nA fund's trustee will need to assess any earnings when an overseas benefit is deposited into an Australian scheme.\nThis will typically be any overseas benefit that has accrued since the investor became an Australian income tax resident.\nUnfortunately for those returning from the UK, a new glitch has just hit the super transfer process. There are now restrictions on amount of money that can be transferred to an Australian scheme once the member has been back in the country for six months.\nRebecca James, special counsel for DBA Lawyers, which specialises in SMSF issues, says: \"If you were a UK resident who has moved to Australia then ideally you have avoided tax on super asset earings by transferring within six months of residency.\"\nJames recommends that those seeking additional transfers into an SMSF seek advice about administrative and tax consequences both here and in the UK.\nSome law firms, such as DBA, have prepared deeds of variation, covering letters, trustee resolution and member disclosures amending SMSF governing rules.\n\"It provides the basis for a trustee of the SMSF to confirm that the UK regulations are satisfied,\" James says.\nThen there are pension issues to consider. \"You also need to find out what impact transferring lump sums into your SMSF might have on any pension benefits you might still have in the country you have left,\" says Lane.\nFor example, both Britain and – for the time being – Greece have reasonably generous government age-pension schemes.\nTraps for old players Self-managed superannuation fund members considering drawing an income from their scheme when they retire overseas need to carefully plan all arrangements before leaving Australia, retirement specialists say.\nStrict rules and punitive penalties are in place to discourage abuse of the generous tax breaks.For example, any super fund needs to remain an Australian superannuation fund, within the strict definition of the rules. This means that in addition to being established in Australia, it is also must be managed and controlled in Australia.\nExpert advice is recommended for complying with tough technical rules about eligibility for payments from the fund. A fund deemed to be non-complying will be taxed at 45 per cent.\nSMSFs are generally not appropriate for people who spend extended time overseas, according to DBA Lawyers, which specialises in the funds. \"They can easily lose their complying status and suffer significant tax penalties,\" the spokesman said.\nThose considering this strategy should also seek advice on rules and procedures about estate, succession and tax laws, particularly where they have used their schemes to acquire assets in overseas countries or have family members who have moved overseas.\nTax specialists recommend that those with SMSFs intending to reside overseas for an extended period wind up their fund and roll the assets into what's called a public offer super fund regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority.\nIn another development that will affect individuals who are permanently leaving the country, mandatory super contributions made by employers of those departing Australia after working on an eligible temporary-resident visa can be claimed back by the visa holder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T12:27:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
