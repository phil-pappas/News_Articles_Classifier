IBM was accused of providing technology and training to perpetuate racial separation and the \"denationalization\" of black South Africans.\nThe plaintiffs sued 13 years ago under the Alien Tort Statute, a 1789 law that lets non-U.S. citizens seek damages in U.S. courts for human rights abuses abroad.\nBut the U.S. Supreme Court significantly narrowed the reach of that law in April 2013, leading a reluctant U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in August 2014 to dismiss the plaintiffs' case.\nUpholding that dismissal, Circuit Judge Jos√© Cabranes wrote for a 3-0 appeals court panel that Ford could not be held directly responsible for alleged improper actions by its South African unit.\nHe also found no showing that \"by developing hardware and software to collect innocuous population data,\" IBM purposefully contributed to apartheid-era abuses.\n\"Knowledge of or complicity in the perpetration of a crime under the law of nations (customary international law) - absent evidence that a defendant purposefully facilitated the commission of that crime - is insufficient to establish a claim of aiding and abetting liability under the ATS,\" Cabranes wrote.\nDiane Sammons, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said Ford's U.S. conduct justified liability and called it \"astounding\" that IBM's conduct was not deemed purposeful.\n\"We certainly will consider an appeal to the Supreme Court,\" she said.\nIn a statement, Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford said it remains committed to expanding in South Africa, after 91 years of manufacturing there.\nIBM, based in Armonk, New York, did not respond to requests for comment.\nDozens of companies were previously dismissed from the litigation, including most recently Germany's Daimler AG and Rheinmetall AG in December 2013.\nApartheid ended in 1994 when South Africa held its first all-race elections, bringing Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress to power.\nThe case is In re: South African Apartheid Litigation, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-4104.
