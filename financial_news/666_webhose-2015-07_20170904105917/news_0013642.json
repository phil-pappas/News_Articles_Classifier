The passengers went to Chicago on another aircraft, it said.\nIn the other incident at the airport, a landing gear tire caught fire shortly after Spirit Airlines Flight 407 landed from Orlando, Florida, the airport said.\nThe fire was quickly extinguished and all passengers evacuated the plane safely at the gate, according to the airport.
