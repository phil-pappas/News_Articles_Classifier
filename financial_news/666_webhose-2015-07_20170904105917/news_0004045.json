These markets account for about a sixth of the company’s revenue.\nThe dollar has gained about 21 percent against a basket of major currencies in the past 12 months.\nShares of AmEx were down 2 percent at $77.40 in after-market trading.\n“(AmEx did) better than our expectations on earnings, but people might focus on revenue being slightly weaker, though a lot of that is driven by FX,” FBR & Co analyst Sanjay Sakhrani said.\nTotal revenue, net of interest expense, fell 4 percent to $8.28 billion, dragged by a 9.6 percent decline in revenue from card services from markets outside the United States.\nRevenue from the U.S. Card Services business rose 6 percent to $4.7 billion, net of interest expense.\nCosts at this business rose 4 percent to $3 billion, partly driven by expenses from previously renewed co-brand partnerships, AmEx said.\nThere is stiff competition in the industry to bag prominent “co-brand” deals, in which card issuers team up with prominent corporate partners – often supermarkets or airlines – to sell cards.\nAmEx, whose image relies on catering mainly to wealthy corporate clients, lost a couple of lucrative co-brand contracts this year because it charges higher prices than rivals.\nThe company’s exclusive tie-up with Costco in the United States will be given over to Citigroup and MasterCard Inc in March. The deal accounted for 8 percent of spending on AmEx cards in 2014.\nAmEx said in February that the loss of the U.S. Costco contract would hurt earnings for the next two years.\nThe company also ended a deal with JetBlue Airways. The contract was picked up by Barclays Plc and MasterCard.\n 23, 2015 10:15 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T14:22:50.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
