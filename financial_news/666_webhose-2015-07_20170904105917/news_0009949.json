The fund seeks to help alleviate that.\n\"These are the communities our employees live in and we want to respect those communities,\" Tim McIlwain, XTO's head of operations, told a news conference.\nThe donation was the largest since the fund was established in 2011, eclipsing the $3 million Marathon Oil Corp donated in 2012.\nThe fund can accept up to $30 million in donations each year, according to a law passed by the state legislature. The fund, in turn, uses the money to subsidize apartment construction. The apartments must be rented at income-adjusted levels for 15 years.\nWhile housing prices across North Dakota's oil patch have come down recently, they still far eclipse prices before the state's oil boom began in 2008. Prices have slid recently as the region's economy has stabilized. A more-than 50 percent drop in oil prices in the past year has also taken some of the premium off housing.\nA typical one-bedroom apartment in Williston runs about $1,700 per month, but at a facility built with money from the housing incentive fund the cost for a similar apartment costs about $800 per month.\n\"This housing fund is a key component of keeping things moving the way they should be moving in a fast-growing economy,\" Governor Jack Dalrymple, a Republican, said at the press conference.\nExxon Mobil is the only oil company to have donated to the fund since January, state officials said.
