Amazon held its first Prime Day on July 15, touting it as a sales event rival to Black Friday, to attract more customers to the service.\nAmazon declined to disclose Prime membership figures.\n\"It looks like they beat across every major revenue line,\" said Colin Sebastian, analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co. \"That, along with the surprise profit beat, is icing on the cake, so to speak.\"\nThe company forecast net sales would grow 13 percent to 24 percent, to a range of $23.3 billion to $25.5 billion, in the third quarter. This is well above analysts' consensus estimate of $23.89 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nAmazon estimated an operating loss of $480 million to an operating income of $70 million for the third quarter.\nAmazon reported a profit of $92 million, or 19 cents per share, for the second quarter ended June 30, compared with a loss of $126 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier.\nRevenue rose 19.9 percent to $23.19 billion.\nAnalysts on average had expected a loss of 14 cents per share and revenue of $22.39 billion.\nAmazon shares traded at around $565 after closing at $482.18 on Nasdaq.\n(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru and Mari Saito in San Francisco; Editing by Stephen R.
