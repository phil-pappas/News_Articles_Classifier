More I made £2,000 on eBay — and so could you \nIf you have a legacy to leave, like me, you may well have been shocked to discover that regardless of what your last will and testament may contain, your dying wish may not be the last word. The circumstances of this case contain some valuable lessons for will writers, but also throw up questions for those with expectations of inheriting. \nThe appeal, which was made under the 1975 Inheritance Act, is the latest example of the courts finding in favour of adult children who feel they have been unfairly provided for. \nIn this case, after a protracted court battle, Heather Ilott was awarded around a third of her late mother’s £500,000 estate, overriding explicit instructions contained in 70-year-old Melita Jackson’s will that, following a family estrangement, she wanted her daughter to receive nothing, bequeathing her estate to three animal charities instead. \nIn her ruling , Lady Justice Arden noted a previous judge’s finding that by cutting her out of her will, Mrs Jackson had acted in a “unreasonable, capricious and harsh way towards her only child”. Crucially, the appellant was able to show the court she had a low income, was reliant on state benefits and had no pension provision. \nSo, the court awarded Mrs Ilott £143,000 to buy her socially rented home plus a capital sum of £20,000, stating that the nature of this settlement would preserve her future entitlement to state benefits, and give her the option of using equity release in the future to fund her retirement. \nBy contrast, the court reasoned, the three large animal charities named as beneficiaries on the disputed will were already well provided for. \nContinue reading \nMy initial reflection was one that justice had been served. But then I thought of the provisions my husband and I have made for our children in our will, and whether these would end up being overruled by a judge in the far future. I am sure there are many readers who will have been thinking similar thoughts. So have we reason to worry? \nThe grounds for this appeal was the “reasonable financial provision” that the 1975 Act stipulates must be made for the “maintenance” of child in a parent’s will — a definition that is increasingly being applied to adult children. \nLawyers tell me that while it is relatively unusual for a parent to disinherit a child completely, it is much more common for people to tailor their wills to favour one particular child over another. \nThere are numerous examples of wealthy magnates and celebrities who have deliberately disinherited their children, to encourage them to make their own way in the world. \nYou may not have a family fortune, but if you had one child who was an investment banker and another who was a nurse, you might decide to leave more of your estate to the lower earner. \nOr you may have had a second family, or step children, and want to divide your estate between each child as you see fit. Or you might decide to bypass your children, and bestow your legacy on your grandchildren instead. \nIn all of these situations, there is the chance that your will could be disputed. \nGiven the UK’s increasingly unequal intergenerational wealth distribution, lawyers tell me they are already seeing a rise in adult children disputing the wills of their parents. \n“People are become more reliant on inheritance as they find they haven’t made pension provision during their lifetimes, and have an expectation that when their parents pass away, they will inherit the estate,” says Andrew Wilkinson, partner at Shakespeare Martineau, who says his firm has seen a 10 per cent increase in cases of will disputes this year. “When someone leaves their estate to a second wife, or a charity, that expectation is shattered and they fight.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:39:59.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
