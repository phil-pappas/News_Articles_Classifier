The company has been selected by SAUDIA, the national carrier of Saudi Arabia to provide long-term TotalCare engine service support worth $1.3bn for Airbus A330 Regional aircraft. It's also been selected by International AirFinance Corporation to provide Trent (BSE: TRENT.BO - news ) 700 engines worth $930m for 20 Airbus A330 Regional aircraft. \nAdmiral Group (LSE: ADM.L - news ) topped the risers after it announced expansion plans to take on 280 extra staff: 130 in its Newport (NasdaqGS: NEWP - news ) office, 50 in Cardiff and 100 in Swansea. Sector peers Direct Line and RSA Insurance Group were also in favour. \nMiners Fresnillo and Randgold Resources rebounded from Monday's 'flash crash' in China. \nSupermarkets Tesco , Sainsbury and Morrison gained, while real estate stocks Barratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) and Taylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) were in the red.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T19:39:11.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
