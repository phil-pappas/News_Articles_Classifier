His exit from Greenhill, where he oversaw tech, media and communications banking, set off promotions to fill his role at that firm this week. Kamo will run a new sell-side M&A group for Credit Suisse starting in October, according to a separate memo.\nRankin and Weinberger, who joined Credit Suisse in the 1990s, became global co-heads of dealmaking in March and are now making additional changes. Credit Suisse ranks fifth in advising pending and completed deals this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s up from seventh during the same period last year.\n“Financial sponsors is a historically important business for Credit Suisse and one where we have consistently held a leading market position,” the pair wrote in the memo Tuesday. Shah has more than three decades of experience, and while the past two were focused on technology, he also has spent time as a generalist in both New York and London, they said.\nShah joined Greenhill in 2005 after quitting as head of Morgan Stanley’s technology banking team. Greenhill named three people to run its tech, media and telecommunications teams, a person with knowledge of the moves said Monday. Managers there concluded it makes more sense for those industries to each have their own dedicated leader, the person said.\nKamo previously worked at Barclays Capital, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Bank of New York Co. and Lazard, according to the memo sent to Credit Suisse staff July 20. Both executives are joining as managing directors based in New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T22:42:35.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
