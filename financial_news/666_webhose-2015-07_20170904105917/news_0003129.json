The federal government is only contributing $50,000, Julian Castro, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, told reporters on a conference call.\nThe initiative will reach 275,000 households with almost 200,000 children.\n\"While high-speed Internet access is given for millions of Americans, it's out of reach for far too many,\" Obama said at Durant High School to a crowd that included many children in traditional tribal garb.\nThe Choctaw Tribal Nation is working with four local providers to bring the Internet to 425 homes.\nIn Atlanta, Durham, Kansas City and Nashville, Google will provide free Internet connections in some public housing areas.\nIn select markets, Sprint will offer free wireless broadband access to families with kids in public housing. In Seattle, CenturyLink Inc will provide broadband service for public housing residents for $9.95 a month for the first year.\nCox Communications Inc is offering home Internet for $9.95 a month to families with kids in school in four cities in Georgia, Louisiana and Connecticut.\nThe program also includes free training and technical support. Best Buy Co Inc will offer free training to the Choctaw Tribal Nation and in some cities, the White House said.
