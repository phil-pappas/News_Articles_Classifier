She is especially excited about the upcoming marketing material check that will be conducted in August in Kampala by an ITC marketing and sales expert. \n'NFT Consult was initially set up to address the niche in the market for the sourcing and provision of quality employees to businesses in the IT, telecom and banking sectors,' Ntege says. 'We started off by providing recruitment and manpower outsourcing solutions in Uganda, we then got requests from customers in other parts of the region.' \nAs a result, the company broadened its activities both geographically and in terms of services offered. Now with operations in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan and the United Republic of Tanzania, NFT Consult's services include executive search, payroll and benefits management, among others. The company has 70 core staff, including 47 women, as well as more than 1,600 contract workers who together support 63 medium-sized and large corporations in East Africa. \nThat didn't happen overnight, and the road to success wasn't without its pitfalls, some of which remain. NFT Consult still faces unpredictability, as most contracts with clients are for less than a year, as well as an uncertain social and economic environment. Like many SMEs, NFT Consult struggles to obtain affordable financing for business growth without collateral. Interest rates on loans, credit facilities and overdraft facilities are in the double digits, Ntege says. In addition, the capacity of the skilled workforce is limited, with a high attrition rate. \nAlthough being a woman running a business hasn't been a serious problem, Ntege recalls that she and Kiwanuka had difficulty early on accessing executives and growing at a reasonable pace in the ICT sector - even though both are qualified professionals. 'We were only truly able to break through and realize what we had hoped to achieve in this sector after Badru Ntege joined the board as chief executive officer a few years later.' \nRetirement is at least a decade away, but Ntege already has the end in sight. After leaving NFT Consult, she plans to 'concentrate on working with young people in my community and mentoring start-up businesses.' \nShe adds: 'Hopefully I would have built a self-sustaining company that will continue to have a positive impact on the lives of people associated with it.'
