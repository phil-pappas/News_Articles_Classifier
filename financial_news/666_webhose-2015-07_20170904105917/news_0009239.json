And we are absolutely committed. \n\"I mean, the companies that I'm associated with are committed,\" he said. \n\"I have no doubt that the whole of the mining industry is committed to cooperating, working together. And the end product has to be that shareholders, in London, in New York, worldwide, look at the South African mining industry as a competitive and a good industry to invest. Otherwise, there will be lots of challenges for all of us.\" \nMagnay raised the issue of black economic empowerment, a government policy which Motsepe has benefitted from in recent years. She challenges him about what he thinks needs to change, and how it should be reshaped so that both the people of South Africa and big business profit. \nEntrepreneurship at the heart of BEE \nMotsepe tells CNN Marketplace Africa: \"At the heart of black economic empowerment, has to be entrepreneurship, has to be the encouragement of businesses which are built by women entrepreneurs, youth entrepreneurs. And the best partnerships that we've found to be successful is where black and white came together.\" \n\"Black entrepreneurs had a passionate enthusiasm ... [and] often didn't have the experience and the expertise, [so] partnered with established, historically white-owned companies... \n\"When those partnerships were established, which are mutually-beneficial, those were the sort of role model partnerships that we've encouraged, and that laid a foundation for the future.\" \nThe programme, which first aired on Friday, can still be seen on Monday at 18:30 on CNN (DStv Channel 401) or anytime from Monday at www.cnn.com/marketplaceafrica. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T18:57:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
