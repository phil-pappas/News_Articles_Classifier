Both firms have already worked together in parts of Poland.\nPoland is trying to reduce its reliance on imported energy from Russia, but still more than a half of the gas it consumes is imported from its former imperial master. The dependency is even bigger in terms of oil.\nPoland had expected to find huge shale gas deposits but these hopes have faded and major energy firms including Chevron , and Total have pulled out of shale gas exploration concessions.
