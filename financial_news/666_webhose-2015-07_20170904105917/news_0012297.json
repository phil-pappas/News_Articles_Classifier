The strongest correlation with prescription rates for antibiotics was the ratio of people living at a residence and the number of bedrooms. \nThough poverty, a lack of education and smoking are all strongly correlated with illness on their own, the researchers found when overcrowding was removed from the equation, they actually had very little effect on antibiotic prescription rates. \nThe only other significant influence, though much smaller than overcrowding, was being of Māori or Pacific Island descent. \n\"When these factors were accounted for, there was no significant added influence from a range of other factors such as income, smoking or educational qualifications,\" the authors of the study, published today in the New Zealand Medical Journal , explain. \nDespite the analysis, they are however hesitant to pin all the blame for excessive antibiotic prescription on overcrowding, saying it could be that doctors in the area too readily prescribe antibiotics or there are certain types of infectious diseases found in south Auckland that aren't prevalent elsewhere in New Zealand. \n\"An increased ratio of number of people to bedrooms in a dwelling (possibly reflecting crowding in some situations) may serve as a proxy for other as-yet unidentified factors driving antimicrobial prescription,\" they argue. \n\"Such factors may include the types of infectious diseases whose acquisition and spread is associated with crowding; the populations disproportionately affected by crowding and infectious disease (eg. children); the prescribing practices of those working… It is not known from this study who prescribes the majority of antimicrobials, and the indications for these prescriptions.\" \nMore research is needed in other parts of the country before the results of this study can be confirmed, the authors write. \n\"'Crowding' may serve as a useful marker which summarises the effects of the other variables, such as income, access to telecommunications, education level and so forth; once adjustments for crowding were performed, the other variables (apart from Māori ethnicity) did not contribute much extra association.\" \nThe CHDHB area has the highest rate of antimicrobial medicine use in New Zealand. Excessive prescription of such medicines is believed to be driving resistance, reducing their effectiveness over time. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T04:30:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
