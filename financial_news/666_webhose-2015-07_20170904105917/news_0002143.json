There are many ways to help children cover college expenses; such as student loans, part time jobs, scholarships, living at home, etc. \nAnother important step is to start funding a college savings plan as early as possible. \nOne type of college savings account is the 529 plan that is offered by each state and has a flexible tax advantage. \nHow is the account used? \nThe savings account accumulates tax free and can be used for tuition, books, and other education expenses for a two or four year accredited college, university or technical school. The child or student is the beneficiary of the account. \nTaxes \nOne the best features of 529 plans are that they offer a significant tax advantage. All money in the account grows tax-free and all withdrawals that are used for qualified higher education expenses are exempt from federal income tax. \nOwnership The account holder maintains control of the assets regardless of the beneficiaryâ€™s (student's) age. You can even hold an account for your own education purposes and be both the owner and the beneficiary of the account. \nIf the beneficiary (student) decides not to attend college, you can still change the beneficiary to another family member \nInvestment The investment selection within a 529 plan typically offers a choice of mutual funds and an age-based portfolio. The age-based portfolio takes a mix of stocks, bonds and money market mutual funds and adjusts it according to the age of the child. So, as the child gets older, the portfolio mix becomes more conservative to lower the investment risk, as college needs get closer. \nBefore you invest, consult with a financial adviser and do your own research. \nFor the latest business news and local events, click on the subscribe button above and you will receive an email alert when the next article is released.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T05:26:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
