Unlike Friday night.\nOther than Wayne Bennett’s men, who stands a chance of beating the Roosters?\nCanterbury await them next Friday. They’ll have a dig, but the Roosters will be ready.\nEven when they play bad, the Tricolours have a knack of putting sides away by a big score.\nThey did it against the Wests Tigers.\nTheir first half was ordinary. They missed 10 tackles, and completed just 13 of 19 sets, which is normally unheard of from the Bondi boys.\nSomething seemed a little off about their opening 40 minutes.\nCRUISING: Late controversy as Roosters rout Tigers\nLISTEN TO OUR ROUND 20 SUPERCOACH PODCAST\nBut then they put the foot down.\n“We moved the ball around without too much rhythm at the start. The second half I thought our bench forward paved the way ... and with a bit more patience, we ended up getting tries,’’ coach Trent Robinson said.\nThe Roosters are deserved title favourites. If you’ve got a spare $20 in your wallet this morning, hold off on the brunch and plonk it on the Cowboys-Roosters grand final.\nBroncos fans pumped about their own side’s big win on Friday night wouldn’t have felt as great if they tuned into Channel 9 to see the Roosters on the delayed game.\nThat’s now six wins on the trot. They’ve won eight of their past nine.\nThe only thing that could bring the Roosters undone is their mindset.\nRoger Tuivasa-Sheck was in sensational form for the Roosters. Source: AAP\nSo far the Shaun Kenny-Dowall situation hasn’t proven a distraction for the players on the field. Robinson will make sure it stays that way.\nWests Tigers fullback James Tedesco, who was again a star in a beaten side, was well placed to give his opinion on the premiership merits of the Broncos and Roosters, two teams he’s played in the last five days.\n“Personally I thought the Broncos were strong all over the park, and their defence was quite hard to crack. The Roosters have the team to go all the way, it’s just if they can play consistently for the whole 80 minutes, and if they do they’ll be hard to stop,’’ Tedesco said.\nTigers coach Jason Taylor actually believed his side ‘’were good enough to win the game, and I think we should have won it’’.\n“We beat ourselves, I don’t feel the Roosters beat us,’’ Taylor said.\n Classy Roosters prove their credentials", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/24/1227456/120765-e8827bd4-31f9-11e5-84b9-a1a3901352f2.jpg", "https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/216131794&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/roosters-flatten-wests-tigers-to-prove-their-nrl-premiership-credentials/story-fni3gn3s-1227456119466"], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T20:59:28.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
