They will be guaranteed of security in those extra hours they will be working,\" Itoobi said. \nEfforts to salvage Shauri Yako Slum from its desolation have over the years been fronted by local leaders and many well-wishers. \n\"The planning of land in Shauri Yako slum was done in 2008-09, but to date we have not received allotment letters,\" says North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood. \nIn efforts to improve living standards in the slum, Good Shepherd Sisters under the Catholic Diocese of Meru established a day-care centre that started with 47 children. \nA temporary small timber house was rented out to shelter 17 girls, and a feeding programme that could feed approximately 200 children daily was rolled out. \nThe day-care centre was a partnership of the Good Shepherd Training Centre and Kooje/Mbaaria women empowerment project for the slum. \nThe grim picture of life in the slum was elaborated by Diane Lepagne from Canada, who came visiting the Good Shepherd Sisters. She states the life there was an eyesore, full of desperation but engulfed in hope for a better life. \n\"What I saw, felt, smelled and experienced was utterly heart-rending. Upon arrival at the Shauri Yako Slum, I saw hundreds of shacks joined together all made up of old corral type of wood with rusted corrugated tin roofs. Curious eyes, young and old all peered out at us,\" she says. \nDiane speaks of women groups formed to empower and support each other to make a better life for their children and grandchildren. \nIn Shauri Yako slums, there are grandmothers raising their grandchildren because the mothers have died of HIV-Aids related illnesses, or because the children have been abandoned. \nThe women make small beaded items, cards, soap and grow crops to sell at the local market. \n\"We were invited to a few of the homes, which were dark, with no windows, had dirt on floors and permeated with the smell of heavy smoke. The walls were covered with old newspapers, pieces of cardboard and old posters or flyers,\" says Diane. \n\"One of the homes had a large poster with several pictures of Michael Jackson on the wall. Those made me wonder if the woman had any idea who he was. The shacks are one-room dwellings with little to no furniture, others had decrepit wooden bed with an old mattress, a couple of bent cooking pots, a makeshift fire pit, and an assortment of 'found' treasures,\" she adds. \nThe walking alleys are characterised by mangy-looking animals; children stare at visitors wondering who they are. \nNext to the slum which borders the posh Kooje Estate, is the stinking two acres of Gakoromone sewerage treatment site for human and other waste from Meru town and Gakoromone market, which is the second biggest open air markets in East Africa. \nMeru town is home to more than 300,000 residents. While walking in the slum, senses are gagged with the putrid smell of faeces piped down the sewer and mixed up in urine, and other rubbish washed from the town's offices and residential houses. \n\"How in the world do these women and children live? How do they do it? How do they survive? Where do they find the strength to carry on? Such utter despair and poverty surrounds them; it is everywhere you look,\" Diane said. \nDiane, however, says despite the seclusion of the area, the residents are proud of their minimal achievements of having a community garden glowing with farm produce. \nThe produce, mainly vegetables, is food for their children and grandchildren, and also raises part of their income to meet basic needs. \nAmong other income generating activities for the residents of Shauri Yako Slum is making soap for sale in the nearby market. Young men also make household goods such as cooking pans, charcoal burners, among others, from iron and other scrap metal which are displayed and sold in the market. \n\"My heart was filled with sorrow at the living conditions of these families. What can I do to alleviate this suffering and misery?\" Diane asked. \nThe Power Africa Initiative ended Diane's sorrow of seeing dark lit, stuffy and desolate rooms for the poor residents of Shauri Yako slum. And for once, the people here can afford a smile because much of their suffering will come to an end. \nIn Kenya, the connection of electricity to a single household costs at least Sh30,000 ($344). But when the government subsidy programme kicks off in September this year, the connection fee is expected to come down to Sh15,000. \nWith the current connection rates, the 250 households in Shauri Yako Slum cost of connection to the main grid is approximately Sh7.5 million ($86,206), and for all 7,000 connections in Meru county the total comes to Sh210 million ($2.3 million). \nAfrica has vast hydropower potential but uses just eight per cent of this untapped water force. In comparison, Western Europe uses 85 per cent of its available hydropower potential, which has contributed to their economic development and industrialisation. \nIn Machaka slum of Buuri constituency, which is home to the Nazareth Sisters Children's home, the connection to power could not have come at a better time. \n\"Families have saved a lot of money they would have otherwise used to buy paraffin. The smoky tin lamps they used have been discarded, and today children complete their assignments in good time,\" says Ann Nkirote, a resident of Machaka. \nSimilar success stories have been told in Timau whose best part of population is made up of slum dwellers, most who were squatters evicted from Karuri Shamba Systems when the Green Belt was reclaiming forest land for reforestation. \n\"It's like God said, 'let there be light' - and it happened. Electricity in our homes is a turning point in our lives. What's more, as young people we can start small businesses to earn a livelihood,\" says John Kirema, a resident of Timau. Kenya \nUS President Barack Obama has challenged Kenya to empower women and girls to achieve its development dream faster. see more » Copyright © 2015 The Star. All rights reserved.
