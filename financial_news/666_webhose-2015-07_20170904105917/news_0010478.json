But its effect on financial markets is viewed as mixed, with some analysts saying it will have little influence, though they acknowledge it is ultimately unknown.\nGreek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said Thursday the only chance of the country getting back on track was immediate debt relief, something the rest of the euro zone is not prepared to offer.\nMarkets focused at least initially on the U.S. payrolls number on what is the last market day in the United States this week. Markets will close on Friday for the observance of the Independence Day holiday.\nPayrolls increased 223,000 last month, shy of expectations, and 60,000 fewer jobs were created in April and May after revisions. At least 432,000 people dropped out of the labor force.\nThe Federal Reserve has indicated participation and wage growth are key for its assessment of the health of the labor market. Both were soft in Thursday's report.\n\"All that means that this is a market-friendly number,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.\n\"It doesn't warrant the Fed moving any sooner than previously thought, while it is still good enough to suggest that the economy's pattern of growth remains intact.\"\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.21 points, or 0.12 percent, at 17,779.12. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 3.12 points, or 0.15 percent, at 2,080.54. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 2.45 points, or 0.05 percent, at 5,010.67.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index slipped 0.1 percent and MSCI's gauge of equities globally ticked up 0.1 percent. Chinese shares also remained in focus as they suffered another heavy tumble overnight to take their loses over the last six weeks to near 25 percent.\nDATA FOCUS\nU.S. Treasuries prices rose on the jobs data, with the benchmark Treasury note yield hovering near 2.4 percent.\n\"Clearly the report was disappointing,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. \"If we continue get this type of payrolls report again in July and August, the Fed won't move in September.\"\nBenchmark 10-year Treasuries notes were up 11/32 in price, erasing losses before the payrolls data. The 10-year yield was last 2.3787 percent, down 4 basis points from late on Wednesday.\nThe euro rose against the dollar after two days of losses, up 0.3 percent at $1.1090. The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback against major currencies, fell 0.2 percent after earlier having risen to its highest in three weeks.\nIn a surprise move, Sweden's Riksbank cut its main interest rate deeper into negative territory and upped the size of its bond buying program. It was in response to low inflation but also a bid to prevent a jump in the crown as nervousness over Greece drives investors out of the euro.\nThe crown weakened 1.1 percent against the euro after the decision, trading as high as 9.3688 after closing at 9.2606 on Wednesday.\nIn commodities markets, U.S. crude rose 1 percent, helped by the weaker dollar after falling 4 percent the previous session. U.S. crude added 59 cents $57.44 a barrel and Brent crude futures added 1.2 percent, or 75 cents, to $62.76 a barrel.\nTraders were keeping a close eye on nuclear talks between Western powers and Iran, looking for any sign of a deal to lift sanctions on the oil-rich nation.
