Projects exposed to operational or market price volatility greater than those modeled in Fitch's rating cases could be subject to downward rating pressure. \nRenewable energy projects benefit from fixed-price revenue contracts to avoid price risk, but resource risk remains. Early results from recently completed solar projects are consistent with base case expectations, while most wind projects remain more volatile than originally expected but supportive of current ratings. \nLiquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals feature strong contracts to mitigate completion, price and volume risks, while lower oil prices have changed competitive dynamics. Other commodity production facilities under development are often subject to feedstock and commodity price risk and rely on structural enhancements to mitigate volatility. \nThe full report, titled '2015 Outlook: Energy Infrastructure North America,' is available www.fitchratings.com . \nAdditional information is available at ' www.fitchratings.com '. \n2015 Midyear Outlook: Energy Infrastructure North America (Stable Cash Flows Consistent with Expectations) \nhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=868163 \nALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.
