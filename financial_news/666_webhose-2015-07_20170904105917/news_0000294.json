Buenos Aires accounts for about 8 percent of Argentina's national vote.\nIn second place, according to the early results on Sunday, was Martin Lousteau with 26.9 percent of the vote. The former economy minister represents the ECO party, which is also opposed to outgoing President Cristina Fernandez.\nIn third place was Mariano Recalde, who heads state-controlled airline Aerolineas Argentinas and has been endorsed by Fernandez. He got 21.5 percent of the early-counted votes.\nFernandez is constitutionally barred from seeking a third consecutive term in October. For president she has endorsed Buenos Aires Governor Daniel Scioli, who is running ahead of Macri in the opinion polls.
