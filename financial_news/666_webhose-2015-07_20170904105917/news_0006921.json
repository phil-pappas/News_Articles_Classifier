Glenn Hunt \"I ask my staff the same questions,\" says Australia's billionaire apartment developer, Meriton's Harry Triguboff.\n\"At this stage, we don't feel anything has changed. With the dollar coming down, they want our apartments even more.\"\nThe big question for Triguboff is whether the Chinese buyers will be able to settle when the time comes to pay the remaining 90 per cent on his apartments.\nAnother question is the value of apartment sites which have been pursued aggressively by Chinese developers.\n So what is happening to site prices? \"At this stage there is not much going on. The vendors are asking a lot and the purchasers are wary and the banks are wary,\" says Triguboff. \"It is very early.\"\nThe managing director of CBRE's Residential Projects, David Milton, says the sharemarket turmoil will propel investors away from stocks to other asset classes, particularly real estate.\nClassic cyclical view It is a classic cyclical view. The sharemarket surge and fall is followed by a cut in interest rates and property surges. For Chinese investment into Australia, such a move is reinforced by the falling dollar. Sadly, those cycles are always followed by a bust.\nCBRE associate director Mark Wizel says developers are bringing forward projects because they don't know how long the market will last.\nJLL's head of research in Australia, David Rees, also acknowledges that Chinese investors may abandon the sharemarket in the wake of the collapse and look elsewhere, like real estate.\nBut he is sanguine about short-term impacts. Yes, the Chinese sharemarket was clearly a bubble but \"the evidence of these kind of things is that they don't have a lot of reverberations\".\nDr Rees is more focused on the long term: \"Chinese cross-border capital flow is still smaller than Japan. You could expect it to get bigger.\n\"But you should not see China as a wall of money. It is more nuanced than that. You will see different strategies coming out of China.\"\nCBRE director, Rick Butler, takes a similar view to Chinese institutional investment. It's only just started.\n\"They will be, and are interested and the stock exchange is of no moment,\" he says.\n\"Seventeen life companies are now approved to buy offshore. In one month they will be MIT [Managed Investment Trust] compliant.\"\nStandard and Poor's Ratings Services noted \"early signs of stabilisation\" for China's property developers. But it warned that conditions would have to improve further for developers to meet the larger refinancing of bonds with $US24 billion ($32.5 billion) to be refinanced in 2016-18.\nLenders and investors are cautious about the sector following the recent default of Kaisa Group Holdings, suggesting credit conditions for the offshore markets could quickly turn unfavourable.\nMacquarie Wealth Management, in a note issued this week also pointed to way \"better than expected\" first-half sales confirmed a \"bottoming out\" in the market. In response to the question of funding, Macquarie noted that Chinese developers were turning to the local bond market because of the lifting of government restrictions and lower after-tax funding costs than offshore bonds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T16:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:16:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
