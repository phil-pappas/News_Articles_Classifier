Books totaled US$48.5bn in the end, with the 10- and 30-year tenors seeing the heaviest demand. \nThe strength of the order book helped the company tighten spread levels throughout the bookbuilding process. \nAt final pricing, Charter was seen paying about 5bp-35bp in new issue concessions compared with Time Warner (Xetra: AOL1.DE - news ) outstandings - still an impressive result given the recent volatility. \nMany market-watchers were however cautious about reading too much into the deal, especially as so much of the headline risk that has flummoxed the market of late is yet to be resolved. \n\"You price a good quality deal at attractive levels and it's going to find buyers,\" Darren Hughes, a senior portfolio manager in fixed income at Invesco (NYSE: IVZ - news ) , told IFR. \n\"This is not a big statement on the market's health overall.\" \nCharter's senior secured notes are part of what is expected to be a US$31bn M&A funding package that will also include high-yield bonds and bank debt. \nGoldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) acted as a global coordinator while Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS - news ) were active books, and Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) and UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) passive books on the deal. \nThe deal - rated Ba1/BBB-/BBB- by Moody's, S&P and Fitch - will help fund the merger of the fourth- and second-largest cable companies in the United States. \nIt would be the largest cable M&A deal on record, according to Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news ) data, valuing TWC at US$78.7bn including debt and US$56bn without. \nMeanwhile A2/A-rated John Deere Capital priced a US$1bn two-part trade of three-year and five-year bonds that tightened about 12bp through the bookbuild on orders of US$3.65bn. \nVentas Realty also found solid interest for its 10.5-year bond offering, which was increased to US$500m from US$350m and priced at Treasuries plus 192bp - or 18bp tighter than IPTs. \nOrder books totaled US$1.6bn. \nChilean utility AES Gener raised US$425m in 10-year bonds that priced at 275bp, or 25bp inside IPTs, while American Honda Finance was able to take out US$1.25bn in three-year fixed and floating-rate notes that priced about 10bp tighter than IPTs. \nWith investors focused on Charter's deal, high-yield issuers again steered clear of the primary space, with no deals announced or priced. \n(Reporting by the IFR team; Writing by Marc Carnegie; Editing by Shankar Ramakrishnan)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T10:25:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
