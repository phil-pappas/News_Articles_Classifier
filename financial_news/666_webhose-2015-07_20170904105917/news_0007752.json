Jim Rice Share on twitter by Stephen Cauchi Australian shares rode a wave of improved global sentiment on Wednesday, with all sectors finishing in positive territory, as investors ready for next week's earnings season.\nUS stocks ended sharply higher, breaking a five-day losing streak, as attention shifted from trouble in Chinese equities to US corporate earnings and to speculation the first Federal Reserve interest rate hike may not come until December.\nThe Dow Jones and S&P 500 chalked up gains of more than 1 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite lagged slightly.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index lifted 3.4 per cent after the People's Bank of China earlier announced it would inject liquidity into the Chinese sharemarket in response to Monday's 8.5 per cent drop - the biggest in eight years.\nThe Fed's interest rate setting committee was due to end a two-day meeting Wednesday night. Markets weren't expecting a rate move, but hoping for an indication on when the central bank will start tightening monetary policy.\nThe positive leads sent the Australian market higher from the opening bell, with the benchmark ASX200 Index closing 0.7 per cent higher at 5624.2 and the broader All Ordinaries 0.7 per cent higher at 5609.6.\n\"On Tuesday the People's Bank of China said they were going to continue their measures to stop the decline in their market,\" said Credit Suisse analyst Damien Boey. \"They didn't stop the Chinese index from going into the red but overseas markets have taken the intervention as good news.\"\nIn the US, increasing speculation that the Federal Reserve would not raise rates until December pushed the greenback lower and the Australian dollar higher, said Mr Boey. \"The Aussie dollar going up suggests that liquidity is coming back into the system. That's good for higher-beta assets like equities.\"\n Robert Corlett, senior adviser at Atlantic Pacific Securities, noted that despite investor concern over Monday's drop, China's stockmarket was still outperforming Wall Street.\n\"The Shanghai Composite is actually up 13 per cent for the year, compared to the Dow Jones which despite the rally last night is down 1 per cent this year and trading below the 200-day moving average for the fourth consecutive day,\" he said.\nImproving iron ore and copper prices also helped local sentiment. Materials stocks, which include the miners, were the day's best performers, rising 1.75 per cent.\nAmong the blue chips, BHP Billiton lifted 2 per cent to $25.89 and Rio Tinto 1 per cent to $51.78, while South32 surged 2.3 per cent to $1.78.\nA 2 per cent rise in the iron ore price overnight, meanwhile, rocketed Fortescue Metals Group 7.4 per cent higher to $1.88.\nAmong the banks, ANZ firmed 0.1 per cent to $32.25, Commonwealth Bank added 0.3 per cent to $86.60, National Australia Bank climbed0.9 per cent to $34.17 and Westpac put on 09.5 per cent to $34.40.\nFellow blue-chip stock Telstra gained 0.3 per cent to $6.41.\nAmong gold miners, renewed bearish sentiment over the price of bullion pushed Newcrest 1.6 per cent lower to $11.36 although fellow gold miner Regis put on 1.5 per cent to $1.32.\nMyer gained 2.1 per cent to $1.22 after news the retailer had cut 100 brands to make way for new labels as part of a plan to restore sales and earnings growth.\nMyer notified about 100 men's, women's, children's footwear and homewares brands they will no longer be listed in its 67 department stores as it kicked off a \"spring clean\" sale today â€“ less than a week after closing its mid-year clearance.\nVirgin Australia narrowed its full-year underlying pretax loss to $49 million in the year ended June 30 as it cut costs, faced less fierce competition with rival Qantas Airways in the domestic market and improved the performance of low-cost arm Tigerair Australia.
