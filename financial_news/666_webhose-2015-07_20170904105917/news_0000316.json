Next Sunday the final meeting will take place on Greece.\" \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said Athens needed a debt programme that would last for \"several years\". \nGreece is perilously close to leaving the currency after some 61% of voters rejected a new bailout deal that demanded further austerity measures. \nEU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker revealed the union was preparing a plan for a possible Grexit. \n\"The Commission is ready for everything,\" he said. \n\"We have prepared a Grexit scenario in detail ... a humanitarian scenario and the scenario of keeping Greece in the eurozone.\" \nFears are mounting that banks and cash machines in Greece could run dry over the next few days as the country tries to find a solution to its €240bn (£170bn) debt. \nBut European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi insisted his organisation would help keep Greek banks afloat until Sunday's summit. \nAthens has backtracked on promises that banks would reopen on Tuesday. \nThey will now stay shut until at least Thursday, with a €60 (£42) daily limit on ATM withdrawals. \nDespite celebrations on the streets after Sunday's referendum, three-quarters of Greeks say they want to stay in the euro. \nGreece's economy has already shrunk 25% since 2008 and it has been suggested a euro exit could see a further 25% contraction. \nOne in four people in the country is unemployed and among under-25s the figure is nearly 52%. \nFormer prime minister Tony Blair told Sky News a Greek exit would be a \"much bigger catastrophe than we think\" and \"we should do all we can to avoid it\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T02:03:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
