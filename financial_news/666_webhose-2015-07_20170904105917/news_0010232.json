The debt is ranked Ca, the second-lowest rating from the New York-based company.\n“We believe that the probability of default is approaching 100 percent, and that losses given default are substantial,” Moody’s analysts wrote. “Bondholder recoveries will be lowest on securities lacking explicit contractual or other legal protections.”\nInvestors including BlackRock Inc. and Pacific Investment Management Co. have speculated about bondholder losses in Puerto Rico since Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla last month called the island’s $72 billion of debt unpayable. Moody’s said the commonwealth could support 60 percent to 65 percent of its net tax-supported debt, assuming no economic rebound.\nHolders of debt with stronger safeguards, like general obligations and bonds from the commonwealth’s Electric Power Authority and Aqueduct and Sewer Authority would probably fare better than others, with recoveries of 65 percent to 80 percent, Moody’s said.\nThe credit rater said its estimates are based on cuts in principal and interest payments of about 40 percent a year through 2023, as the government decides to reduce debt service payments to avoid budget shortfalls.\nBankruptcy alone wouldn’t be enough to dig Puerto Rico out from under its debt burden, Moody’s said.\nIf Puerto Rico agencies had access to Chapter 9, island officials have said it may apply only to certain public corporations, such as the power utility, water agency and highway authority. Those entities owe about $20 billion combined.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T04:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T00:15:04.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
