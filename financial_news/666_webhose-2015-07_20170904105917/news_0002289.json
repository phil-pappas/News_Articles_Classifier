That compares with analysts’ average projection of $14 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \nWhile Intel has missed out on providing chips to the surging number of smartphones and tablets, its processors are the backbone of data centers needed for the applications that make those mobile devices attractive to consumers. The company may also be winning orders from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. in personal computer chips even as total demand for the devices declines. \n“They had really good PC client revenues, better than expected,” said Ian Ing, an analyst at MKM Partners who recommends buying the stock. “It could be some additional share gains from AMD. Cloud computing is still strong.” \nIntel shares, down 18 percent this year, rose 4.3 percent in extended trading following the announcement. They were little changed at $29.69 at the close of trading in New York. \nGross margin, the only measure of profit that Intel forecasts, will be about 63 percent in the current quarter. Analysts had estimated the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production would be 61.2 percent. Data Centers\nIntel’s data center group has done more than make up for falling demand for PC chips, which provide the majority of its sales. The unit took over in the first quarter of this year as the biggest provider of operating profit for the company. \nThe Santa Clara, California-based company said second-quarter revenue was $13.2 billion. Net income declined to $2.7 billion, or 55 cents a share, from $2.8 billion, or 55 cents. \nIntel’s processors are in more than 80 percent of the world’s PCs sold every year and it has 99 percent of the market for servers built on PC chips, making its earnings and forecasts a key indicator of demand across the electronics industry. Its report kicks off two weeks of earnings announcements by the largest U.S. technology companies. \nUnderlining the difficulties the PC market has faced, computer shipments fell 9.5 percent in the second quarter, hurt by restrained corporate technology spending and the strength of the U.S. dollar, according to market researcher Gartner Inc. Manufacturers shipped 68.4 million units, compared with 75.6 million a year earlier, the steepest quarterly decline since the third quarter of 2013. Mobile Demand\nIntel has offset the drop by participating indirectly in the surging sales of smartphones and tablets. As handheld devices have become the main way of getting online, the need for the mobile data that gives apps their functionality has soared, creating demand for servers based on Intel chips. The company has said it expects the server business to continue to grow by more than 10 percent a year. \nIntel said its client computing group -- which sells chips for PCs -- generated revenue of $7.5 billion, down 14 percent from a year earlier, but up 2 percent from the previous three-month period. Data center group revenue increased 10 percent from a year earlier to $3.9 billion. \nAMD on July 6 said second-quarter sales declined more than originally projected because of weak consumer demand for personal computers. Revenue dropped about 8 percent from the first quarter, compared with an earlier forecast of a decline of about 3 percent. The company will report its full quarterly performance on Thursday.
