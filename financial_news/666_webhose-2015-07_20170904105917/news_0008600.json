The company also agreed to make contingent cash payments of up to $125 million based on the achievement of certain performance milestones.\n“Roxane is highly complementary to our existing U.S. business,” Michael Raya, who heads Hikma in the U.S., said in the statement. “Today we are a market leader in generic injectables. The acquisition of Roxane will significantly strengthen our non-injectables business.”\nClosely held Boehringer Ingelheim said in January that it was exploring strategic options for Roxane Labs, after Bloomberg News reported that the company was working with Morgan Stanley on the process.
