Critics say the city is less relevant as the mainland's economy grows, but its free market and rule of law are enduring strengths By Hong Kong correspondent Wang Duan \n(Hong Kong) â€“ Internet users have been taunting and voicing pessimistic views of Hong Kong's economy. This mostly comes from mainlanders declaring that the city's economy is doddering and unprogressive, and that from both an entrepreneurial and infrastructure point of view, it is lagging behind the world and the mainland. \nOther critics say that Hong Kong is also no longer much of a reference for those seeking reform and more openness on the mainland. Some even use the term \"parasitic economy\" to describe the former British colony. \nThough there is some evidence to support these arguments, it would be a serious mistake to underestimate Hong Kong's economy. It's true that data suggests the city's economic output in a decade will be comparable to a mere medium-sized mainland city. But any smart analysis should include questions beyond just scale. \nIn recent years, Hong Kong's economy has mainly depended on a highly developed modern services industry. Its experiences and the lessons it has learned are a valuable reference for the rest of China, which is undergoing an economic transformation. \nHong Kong's economy once outshone that of the whole of China. In the early 1990s, a city with only one-ten thousandth of the mainland's total area had a GDP equivalent to one-quarter of the mainland's. This has now fallen to 3 percent. The GDP of Shanghai and Beijing surpassed that of Hong Kong in 2009 and 2011, respectively. It is likely that in three to four years, Hong Kong's GDP will be overtaken by major coastal cities, such as Guangzhou, Tianjin and Shenzhen. \nSo compared with 10 or 20 years ago, Hong Kong's position has dramatically changed amid global economic restructuring and the mainland's economy's newfound prominence. With closer connections between the mainland and global market, Hong Kong's role as an intermediary is also weakening. \nBut economic performance is just one facet of Hong Kong. It would be shortsighted to assert that the city can no longer serve as a reform example. \nHong Kong's economic development has undergone several transformations, from manufacturing to trade to a services industry led mainly by the financial sector. It is precisely this arduous journey that can be instructive for the mainland. It is impossible to compare economic volumes, but Hong Kong's resourcefulness and adaptability are still the envy of many places. \nIn the third full session of the Communist Party's 18th Central Committee in November 2013, reform measures targeted improving the administrative approval system, restraining the government's power and building a society ruled by law. The core of these reforms is to enable the market to play a \"decisive\" role in the allocation of resources. \nA free market and the rule of law are precisely what Hong Kong has always painstakingly strived for as a way to guarantee its competitiveness. This public \"software\" is precisely what a lot of mainland cities are lacking. Without these basics, their investment environments will remain unattractive. \nNot only does the mainland's manufacturing need an upgrade, so too does its services sector, which will require more confidence in the rule of law and a service-oriented government. Hong Kong's legal system is the product of a long history and constant improvement. When Chinese companies face litigation with multinationals, they often prefer to go to Hong Kong for arbitration or adjudication. This kind of trust is what can be called an \"intangible asset.\" \nCentral to encouraging competitiveness is Hong Kong's highly competent and professional workforce. Not only does the city welcome talent from all over the world, it also possesses a top education system, with several prestigious colleges, such as the University of Hong Kong, Chinese University and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. \nHong Kong also remains the first stop for many Chinese companies expanding abroad. Hundreds of mainland enterprises have listed on its stock market and successfully obtained funding, illustrating the importance of Hong Kong's stringent listing procedures and information disclosure and accounting standards. \nMany believe that Shanghai will eventually replace Hong Kong as China's main economic hub, but it would be a mistake to see this as a zero-sum game. The sheer size of China's economy offers plenty of space for several financial centers, and they would all have something to learn from Hong Kong. Take Shanghai's efforts to build a free-trade zone, an area in which Hong Kong has long been a world leader. \nUndoubtedly, Hong Kong faces severe challenges ahead, and must find ways to move beyond just being a financial center and get better leadership from its public officials. In the long run, its biggest opportunity is the expansion and transformation of the entire Chinese economy. \nAs China transforms from a destination for capital to a source, Hong Kong should not miss the chance to consolidate and accelerate its role as Asia's top financial center. \n(Rewritten by Han Wei) Closer Look: Is Hong Kong Becoming Marginalized?
