That would be a catastrophe for Europe,\" he added in an advance release of an interview to run in the Sueddeutsche's Monday edition. \n(Writing by Paul Carrel; Editing by Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T14:22:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
