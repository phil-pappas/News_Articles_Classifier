In the United States, the newest Apple Inc handsets can fetch $649, or more, depending on the model.\nBeijing police said their investigation followed a tip-off from U.S. authorities who seized some of the fake devices.\nThe destination of the counterfeit phones, and how many made it there, remains unknown.\nPublic security representatives declined to comment on Monday, telling Reuters they had no additional information.\nApple also declined to comment, saying the investigation was ongoing.\nIt is not the first time China has uncovered plots to exploit the popularity of Apple products.\nIn 2011, bloggers in the southwestern city of Kunming discovered more than a dozen unauthorized brick-and-mortar outlets that carefully replicated the interior decor, and even employee uniforms, used in genuine Apple stores.\nThe viral pictures embarrassed officials, who vowed to do more to protect trademarks.
