Photo: Scott Barbour\nOZ Minerals is being touted by Citi as the Australian miner most likely to make a counter-cyclical acquisition, with South32 and Iluka Resources both possessing the capability of becoming predator or prey.\nWhile depressed commodity prices made a large merger and acquisition spike in the sector unlikely, Citi said a run of smaller scale deals in the gold and base metal space was likely to continue to \"fill the mid-cap void in the market\".\nAustralia's gold miners embarked on a deal-making spree this quarter, after the sliding Australian dollar and significant operational cost reductions made projects more profitable. OceanaGold picked up the Waihi mine in New Zealand while Evolution Mining acquired Barrick Gold's Cowal mine and La Mancha's Australian assets.\nExamining its coverage of Australian mining stocks, Citi ranked the likelihood out of 10 that each company would be a potential target or acquirer, with some ranking highly in both categories.\nAdvertisement OZ Minerals topped the broker's list of companies most likely to acquire after flagging its willingness to explore growth opportunities in base metals such as nickel, lead and zinc. At the copper and gold miner's annual meeting in May, chief executive Andrew Cole said the company was conducting due diligence on four potential acquisitions.\n'Fill a hole' \"[OZ Minerals] is now looking for base metal projects to fill a hole in copper output, between FY19 and the potential start of mining at Carrapateena,\" the Citi analysts, led by Clarke Wilkins, said.\nIndependence Group's interest in upping its gold exposure ranked the diversified miner highly as a potential acquirer, as did Iluka Resources' potential bid for Irish miner Kenmare Resources and Mount Gibson Iron's $324 million cash pile.\n\"Mt Gibson has been reluctant to take the plunge despite having cash and intent, but with mine life dwindling, now could be the time,\" Citi said.\nCiti ranked South32 as a likely acquirer, but also featured the new $9.5 billion company on the targets list amid speculation a lacklustre first month of trade left it open to approaches, including from Mick Davis' X2 Resources.\n\"Private equity has been mooted as a potential buyer, but we believe they lack the firepower,\" Citi said. \"[South32] could be a bulk-up acquisition for Glencore before coming back for Rio Tinto.\"\nBut Citi also said there was potential South32 would run the ruler over long-life base metal assets that would fill the company's growth \"void\" and offset the relatively short life of its Cannington silver, lead and zine mine in Queensland and declining grades at the Cerro Matoso nickel mine in Colombia.\nOther targets Other targets in the sector could include Sandfire Resources, Whitehaven Coal and Western Areas. Iluka and Regis both feature high on the lists of potential targets as well as potential acquirers, with the former flagged as a possible buy for Glencore or South32 due to its unique position in zircon and its relatively open register.\nThe analysis came a fortnight after Citi found the world's biggest miners had written off about 90 per cent of the value of assets acquired since 2007.\n\"There is no hiding from this atrocious industry track record, but not all M&A is bad,\" Citi said.\n\"Buying non-core assets from majors can create significant shareholder value, as can buying the right asset at the right time in cycle. With growing deficits and higher prices expected, we view now as a good time to buy copper and nickel assets, but would steer clear of bulks due to supply growth.\"\nCiti used Rio Tinto's \"mixed\" history of deals to highlight examples of both well and poorly timed acquisitions.\nCiti says Rio's $3.5 billion acquisition of North in 2000, in which it outbid Anglo American, was well-timed and provided significant operational synergies, whereas it's $US38 billion Alcan and $US4 billion Riversdale Mining acquisitions were \"disastrous\".\n\"The mining sector is littered with examples of mining companies that have mistimed acquisitions by buying at the peak of the cycle,\" Citi said.\n\"Rio is not alone in destroying value through M&A with BHP avoiding a number of bullets through not being effectively allowed to acquire either Rio Tinto or Potash Corp at the peak of the cycle, but then mistiming its entry into the US shale business.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/mining/miners-ma-sinks-in-sea-of-dud-deals-20150623-ghurp6", "http://www.afr.com/business/mining/why-south32-might-be-in-the-sights-of-mick-davis-13bn-x2-20150629-ghx4pu", "http://www.afr.com/business/mining/gold/oz-minerals-ceo-andrew-cole-eyes-off-four-takeover-targets-20150525-gh8pxd", "http://www.afr.com/business/mining/iluka-resources-lobs-lowered-bid-for-kenmare-20150430-1mx9p4"], "published": "2015-07-06T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T01:08:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
