These mines produced 163479 tonnes of ilmenite and yielded sales revenues of A310 million during 2013 providing a pathway to value accretion for Broken Hill Prospecting .\nThe Copi North Resource occurs at shallow depths averaging about 23 metres under friable sand silt and clay. It includes an Indicated Resource of 7 million tonnes at 6.9%.\n\nIt has low slime content that may help maximise heavy mineral recovery while the limited groundwater could support lower capital cost dry open-cut mining using a small and mobile plant.\n\nThere is potential to extend deposit strike length to up to 30 kilometres from 10 kilometres increasing resources.\n\nScoping and pre-feasibility studies on Copi North HMS Deposit are expected to be completed in late 2015.\n\nThe deposit could become one of the lowest cost quartile of producers on present trends. \n\nIn addition a maiden resource estimate for the Magic HMS deposit is anticipated in August.\n\n\nProactive Investors Australia is the market leader in producing news articles and research reports on ASX emerging companies with distribution in Australia UK North America and Hong Kong / China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T23:55:41.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
