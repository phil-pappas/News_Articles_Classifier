Often some of the largest, most creditworthy customers take the most time to pay. Eyal Lifshitz, founder of BlueVine , witnessed this problem first-hand during his youth. His father owned a physical therapy practice on the Upper East Side of New York. Medicare would often take three months to pay invoices. To survive the mismatch between his expenses and the expected payment from the government, his father would max out all of his credit cards. Eyal’s father is not alone. For small businesses, credit cards have become the most common way to find working capital.\nFactoring, also known as accounts receivable financing, is one of the oldest forms of financing still in place today, dating back to Babylonian times. It is a relatively simple process. A finance company will buy the accounts receivables from a business at a discount to the face value. For example, imagine a doctor expecting repayment from a health insurance company. He sent the insurance company a $100 invoice. A factoring company knows that the health insurance company is a good credit risk, but a slow payer. So, the factoring company could buy the invoice from the doctor for $95. The doctor receives the cash right away. The factoring company is willing to take the risk that the insurance company will pay. When the invoice is paid, the finance company makes a $5 profit. Factoring is an extremely popular form of financing outside of the United States, especially for small businesses.\nFor the finance company, the real credit risk is with the customer, not the company. In the example above, the financial health of the doctor is not important. Instead, the legitimacy of the invoice and the financial health of the insurance company are what matter. And many companies, especially small businesses, would be more than happy to sell their accounts receivables. Collections can be a painful process, and it could be much more efficient to give those collection activities to a professional who operates at scale. For example, if a lawsuit is required to collect payments from a customer, it is much easier for a factoring firm to use its team of in-house lawyers than for a small business owner to search for a lawyer and start paying for the legal action in the hopes of receiving payments later.\nAlthough factoring has remained popular for small businesses all over the world, it has not been widely used in the United States. But that looks set to change, thanks to Eyal and the memories of his youth. There has been a lot of lending innovation in the last few years, courtesy of Silicon Valley venture capital money. Marketplace lending has been growing rapidly, transforming the personal loan, small business loan and student loan markets. But as Eyal was looking around, he still didn’t see a solution for his father’s invoice problem. So he decided to leave his job at GreyLock Partners to start BlueVine, which has since raised over $20 million.\nBlueVine has a simple business model. In just a few minutes, a small business owner can open an account. And BlueVine will be ready to buy up to $100,000 worth of invoices. Digitally savvy small businesses are best positioned to take advantage of the service. When you create your account, you will be connecting your invoicing and accounting software online. The first time you use the service, you can get your cash within 24 hours. For future advances, you can receive the money in as little at 2 hours.\nBlueVine will give you 85% – 90% of the invoice up front. BlueVine will open a bank account for you, where your customers will make their payments. Once the invoice is paid, you will receive an additional rebate. That rebate will vary depending upon your creditworthiness and the length of time that it takes to repay. Pricing ranges between 0.5% and 1% week, with an average of 0.7% of the invoice per week. A $15,000 invoice that takes 4 weeks for repayment would cost $420, or 2.8% of the invoice.\nThere are some risks to keep in mind. First, BlueVine is a full recourse lender. They are not actually buying the accounts receivables from you. So, BlueVine can come after your company, and you personally, if the invoices are not paid.\nAlso, the effective interest rate on BlueVine remains high. Like other lenders in the emerging small business market, BlueVine emphasizes speed over cost. The interest rate is higher than small business credit cards. For example, Chase Ink offers 13.24% for purchases, and 24.99% on cash advances. Right now, BlueVine makes sense if you can’t get a credit card limit that is big enough for your needs, or if you are unable to qualify for a credit card at all. If you have large cash needs, especially with short deadlines, it will be difficult to beat the convenience and speed of companies like BlueVine.\nFactoring has been around since Babylonian times because it makes sense. Small businesses will always struggle with cash flow and invoice collection. As market competition intensifies, small businesses should look forward to lower interest rates and more access to credit. And it may not be long before BlueVine is cheaper than a credit card.\nNick Clements is the author of the Forbes eBook, How To Crush Credit Card Debt , available on Amazon .
