That process is set to take up to another four weeks. \nThe €7bn EFSM loan will then be paid back using funds from the new programme, according to the Commission. \nMr Cameron has hailed Britain's \"opt-out\" from eurozone rescues as one of his biggest triumphs over Brussels. \nThe Tory party manifesto of May 2015 read: “We took Britain out of eurozone bail-outs, including for Greece the first ever return of powers from Brussels.” \nAll 28 members states are now set to vote on the plans to release the cash. Britain does not have a veto and can be out-voted through the majority weighting system of the European Council. \nSpeaking in the Commons today, Mr Cameron said Britain would be ready to send humanitarian aid to Greece if the country is forced out of the single currency. \n\"Greece is a member of the EU as well as a member of the euro. It is a friend and ally of Britain,\" said Mr Cameron. \n\"As a member of the EU, if Greece were to leave the euro and wanted humanitarian assistance I'm sure the British public would take a generous view.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T19:21:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
