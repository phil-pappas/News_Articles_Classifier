Britain's FTSE futures fell 1.0 percent.\n\"After surprising the market by calling a referendum, the Greek people once again surprised the market by voting 'No'. This puts the Greek government on a collision course with the creditors and the risk of a Grexit has certainly increased,\" Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels, said.\n\"This will make for a traditional \"risk-off\" in line with what we saw last Monday, with more risky assets going down and money floating to safe heavens.

Without more emergency funding from the European Central Bank, Greece's banks could run out of cash within days. That might force the government to issue another currency to pay pensions and wages.\nGreek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis announced his resignation on Monday, saying he had been \"made aware\" that some members of the euro zone considered him unwelcome at meetings of finance ministers.\nCOMPANY NEWS:\nALLIANZ\nAllianz's reinsurance unit Allianz Re is making progress in the consolidation of its legacy problem areas, where it is now benefiting from scale, experience and negotiating power, Allianz Re Chief Executive Amer Ahmed told the weekend Boersen-Zeitung.\nDEUTSCHE POST\nDeutsche Post and trade union Verdi reached a deal late on Sunday to end a four-week old strike, agreeing pay rises and job guarantees for 140,000 workers and allowing the postal operator to press ahead with plans for low-cost parcel units.\nFRESENIUS\nChief Executive Ulf Schneider told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung his company was interested in buying more hospitals and planned to expand abroad.
