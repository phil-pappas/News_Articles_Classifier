Alex Bolton for The Hill: \"Senate and House Republicans are headed to a showdown over transportation spending. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wants to pass a six-year highway deal before Thursday to give the House time to take it up before the August recess, according to a Senate GOP leadership source. ADVERTISEMENT But opposition to the Senate bill is growing on the other side of the Capitol. House Republican leaders want the Senate to instead pass a five-month highway patch and won't say whether they would give the Senate transportation bill a vote in their chamber. McConnell is betting that House GOP leaders will relent once they have the bill in their laps, with the Highway Trust Fund due to expire on Aug. 1.

Rebecca Shabad has the play-by-play: \"The Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday advanced a $20.6 billion bill containing legislation that would impose a sweeping overhaul of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street financial reform law. Appropriators approved the bill, which funds Financial Services and General Government services, in a party-line 16-14 vote.\" http://bit.ly/1gR7Vwh \n-- YOU ALREADY KNOW: Shelby's bill would significantly reform the controversial Dodd-Frank law. And now nobody knows what will happen next. It's a clear sign that Shelby isn't messing around in terms of getting something done while he has the gavel -- and he's slamming down a marker that he's unafraid to go beyond his committee to get the job done. Don't expect for the entirety of the bill to pass, but it's a sign that the seasoned politician has a few more tricks up his sleeves. \nGOP: ADMIT IT, IRS: YOU TARGETED REPUBLICANS. Bernie Becker: \"GOP lawmakers told the IRS commissioner on Thursday to just admit that the tax agency targeted Tea Party groups. John Koskinen's response: Not my call to make.

Bob Cusack and me for the hometown paper: NEW YORK -- Donald Trump says the chances that he will launch a third-party White House run will \"absolutely\" increase if the Republican National Committee is unfair to him during the 2016 primary season. \n\"The RNC has not been supportive. They were always supportive when I was a contributor.

Cruz told Chris Stigall on Talk Radio 1210 WPHT there is one specific portion of the legislation that really bothers the Presidential candidate. 'There's an awful lot happening on the transportation bill. One of the biggest fights is that an awful lot of folks in Washington are trying to use this as a Christmas tree to re-authorize the Export/Import Bank. Now, what is the Export/Import Bank? It's one of the classic examples of corporate welfare and cronyism in Washington. It is a bank that exists that gives hundreds of billions of dollars of loans to giant corporations. It's you and me, the American taxpayer, subsidizing giant corporations.'
