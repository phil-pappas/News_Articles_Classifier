SSYS is set to report second-quarter 2015 results on Jul 30. Last quarter, the company posted a loss per share of 8 cents, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents loss. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors at Play Since the beginning of 2015, Stratasys has been witnessing sluggish demand for its products as can be seen from the lower-than-expected results for first-quarter 2015. The company stated that a decline in capital spending by clients, particularly in North America due to uncertain economic conditions, and unfavorable currency exchange rates negatively impacted its overall results. Furthermore, Stratasys lowered the 2015 revenue forecast to $800–$860 million from $940–$960 million. Similarly, non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected to be between $1.20 and $1.70 as against $2.07 to $2.24. The 3D printing solutions provider’s lackluster guidance reflects an unfavorable currency exchange rate and weak performance at its MakerBot business. Additionally, some customers are delaying their purchases owing to the current economic conditions. In the 3D printer business, the majority of customers have gravitated toward the lower-priced uPrint, which may affect the company’s margins in the to-be-reported quarter and beyond. Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Stratasys is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Zacks ESP : Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss per share of 8 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Zacks Rank: Stratasys has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum. Stocks to Consider Here are a couple of stocks which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: ZAGG Inc. ZAGG, with an Earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #1. PerkinElmer Inc. PKI, with an Earnings ESP of +1.70% and a Zacks Rank #2. Facebook Inc. FB, with an Earnings ESP of +6.45% and a Zacks Rank #3. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.
