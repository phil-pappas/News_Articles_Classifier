Brian Mukherjee had received. While the minimum threshold for option exercise is said to be around 50p, the exercise price is 27.8p. \nThe award has almost quintupled Mr Mukherjee’s total voting rights, bringing them to 2.8pc. \nThe announcement came days after company chairman Anthony Bettencourt resigned, having taken up the role in 2008. Judy Vezmar, non-executive director of the remuneration committee will step down next month, while long-standing auditor Deloitte has also parted ways with the video advertising company. \nAlex DeGroote, of Peel Hunt, noted it was a case of “curious timings”, and pointed to the company’s reference to remuneration in last year’s annual results. “Increasingly, the industry is moving away from options in favour of restricted stock units and Blinkx is likely to follow a similar path”, the company said. \nWith shares plummeting towards all-time lows, Mr DeGroote warned the company was “scarcely above break-even these days and it is seriously overcapitalised”. \nThe share price hit an all-time high of 230p in November 2013, before tumbling to a mere 23.5p after Harvard professor Ben Edelman published a blog post purporting the company used “deceptive tactics” to take fees and referral commissions by making it appear as though their advertisements had attracted customers. The company claimed Mr Edleman’s comments caused up to $15m damage in sales. \nMr DeGroote, described the “crash and burn” equity story as “painful for many investors”. He said the share price performance across the “Ad Tech” sector had been “largely miserable” both in the UK and overseas. \nThe beleaguered group, which will hold its AGM next month, was changing hands at 29p on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T21:41:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
