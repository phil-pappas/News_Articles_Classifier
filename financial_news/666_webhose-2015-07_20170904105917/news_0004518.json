Prime Minister Perry Christie calls the completion of the project a matter of national importance and says it could be finished more quickly through the liquidation process. \nA completed resort would employ more than 5,000 people in the Bahamas, where the unemployment is 16 percent, and boost its gross domestic product by more than 10 percent, according to estimates from the government and the resort's developer, Baha Mar Ltd. \nBut Baha Mar Ltd, run by Sarkis Izmirlian, wants to reorganize under U.S. bankruptcy laws and is trying to get the proceedings in Delaware recognized by Bahamian courts. It filed for bankruptcy protection on June 29. \nIzmirlian, the son of Armenian billionaire Dikran Izmirlian, blames the Chinese construction firm for the delays that forced the resort to miss its opening in late March. CCA says his development team mismanaged the project. \nThe Izmirlian family has invested more than $900 million in the project. \nBaha Mar Ltd is trying to renegotiate with China's export import bank, which bankrolled most of the project with a $2.45 billion loan. \nAfter describing the two sides as \"beating the heck out of each other,\" the U.S. judge on Monday sent them to a mediation room to try to sort out a dispute over seized construction project records. \nCCA has accused Baha Mar Ltd of seizing documents and computer files, while Baha Mar Ltd has accused the Chinese firm of trying to steal documents, court filings show. \n\"To add fuel to the fire and increasing the level of heat doesn't always help,\" Carey said in court.
