We're all for the safety net ... (but) we're picking up a disproportionate, in our view, slug of the levy,\" said Chief Executive David Bellamy, adding that he thought the large increase was due to the company's relative strength and share of the advice market. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in St James's Place were down 1.7 percent at 0812 GMT. \nPretax profit on a headline basis was 72.9 million pounds ($113.69 million), down from 78.3 million pounds last year. \nUnderlying post-tax cash profits were up 8 percent year on year to 84.9 million pounds, 1 percent ahead of forecasts. Net inflows during the six months to end-June were 2.7 billion pounds, to take total assets to 55.5 billion pounds, in line with consensus. \nThe firm posted an interim dividend of 10.72 pence per share, beating forecasts for 10.5 pence a share. \n\"If the regulatory levy charge in SJP's cash accounts had been flat year on year, its underlying cash generation would have been 95.5 million pounds (up 22 percent),\" analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a note to clients. \n\"This 22 percent growth is more illustrative of the company's underlying performance, in our view,\" they said, adding they expected a levy charge of 5 to 10 million pounds would be more likely in future. \n($1 = 0.6411 pounds) (Reporting by Simon Jessop, editing by Louise Heavens)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T11:44:22.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
