Moody's also estimated a decrease in Egypt's budget deficit to 10% of GDP, and a decrease in public debt to less than 90% of GDP in FY 2014/2015.\n\nMoody's explained that the forecast for local and foreign investments increased especially after the recent Economic Summit, where Gulf States declared support. This came in addition to the announcement of the signing of FDI worth approximately 38bn, which reduces the risks of the balance of payments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T19:50:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
