They have certainly underperformed and I sense that could be changing right now.\" Headquartered in Fort Lee, N.J., Palisade has approximately $4.4 billion of assets under management as of March 31, 2015. Veru added that rising interest rates will enhance bank profits going forward. He said the Federal Reserve has all but telegraphed its direction on rates, although he believes the rate hike will be a \"one and done\" event. \"While the economy has been improving, it's been improving at a very slow rate,\" Veru said. \"That's going to be good for bank profits as the yield curve gradually steepens and there is more opportunity.\"He added that the big fines paid by the banks as a result of their mortgage crisis misdeeds have likely crested, which will lift bottom lines as well. One of Veru's favorite financial plays is boutique investment bank Lazard ( LAZ - Get Report ) , which is up over 17% year-to-date primarily due to its lucrative M&A practice . \"Lazard has been an extremely well regarded pure play within the M&A space,\" said Veru. \"They also have an extremely lucrative money management business as well which a lot of people don't think about.\" Veru is less bullish on the healthcare sector, despite its outperformance since the end of the financial crisis in 2009. In his view, the valuations are too high and new ideas are not plentiful after the long run-up in pharma, hospital and biotech stocks. \"The biotech space is very difficult to predict because there is a very broad distribution of stocks that have done extremely well and stocks that have done extremely poorly,\" said Veru. \"But the stocks that do well, do so well that it drags the index up.\" Check Out Our Best Services for Investors \nPortfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.
