By Kevin Cirilli - 07/24/15 05:38 PM EDT \nCongress is likely to decide the fate of the transportation-funding bill this week, with major repercussions for the Export-Import Bank. \nOn Sunday the Senate attached an amendment to a six-year highway bill that would reauthorize the bank. The proposal would renew the charter for the agency, which expired on June 30, through the fall of 2019. ADVERTISEMENT Conservatives in the House criticize the bank as a form of \"corporate welfare\" and are pushing their leaders to take a stand against it.\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has suggested the Senate’s highway bill won’t fly with the GOP conference, so it’s unclear how they will respond. \nLawmakers have little time to work things out, with federal transportation funding set to expire at midnight on Friday. \nAway from the floor action in Congress, The Hill on Tuesday will host an economic forum with Reps. French Hill (R-Ark.) and Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) on the state of regulations. The event will examine the increased regulatory scrutiny on insurers both at home and abroad and how it’s affecting the industry. \nFollowing the conversation with lawmakers, The Hill will have a panel with Cato Institute's Mark A. Calabria; Peterson Institute for International Economics President Adam Posen; National Association of Insurance Commissioners Managing Director Christina Urias; and Drake University Dean Terri Vaughan. The program begins at 8:30 a.m. \nOn Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, & Urban Affairs will have a hearing on crude oil exports. The committee will follow that up on Wednesday with a hearing to discuss whether banks are still \"too big to fail.\" \nThe House Financial Services Committee will have a hearing on Tuesday to examine the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform law, which hit its five-year anniversary last week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T07:19:49.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
