The trading halt is ongoing and has so far lasted at least an hour.\nBut stocks continued to trade on other exchanges, such as those run by Nasdaq OMX Group and BATS Global Markets.\n\"It's under control,\" Mark Otto of market maker J. Streicher & Co in New York said on the NYSE floor. \"We're just waiting for word. There's no sign of panic at all.\"\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security said there were \"no signs\" that the problems at NYSE stemmed from \"malicious activity,\" CNN reported.\nIt came on an already bad day for investors. Even before the glitch halted trades, U.S. markets were in the red as the slide in Chinese markets spurred concerns over its impact on global economic growth.\nWire services", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/NYSE"], "published": "2015-07-08T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T21:22:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
