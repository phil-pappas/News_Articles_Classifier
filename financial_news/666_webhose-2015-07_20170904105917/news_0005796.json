PUBLISHED: 16:23, Sun, Jul 12, 2015 | UPDATED: 16:37, Sun, Jul 12, 2015 PA George Osborne delivers his Budget statement to the House of Commons \nThe changes to the UK’s most hated tax, announced in last week’s emergency Budget, are complicated, will only apply to the main family home and will take several years to come fully into effect. \nAny apparent savings may be offset by sleight of hand elsewhere. \nSo could your family still end up paying death duty? \nLast Wednesday, Osborne claimed that homeowners can now pass on up to £1million to their children or grandchildren, free of IHT, but it is not as simple as that. \nThe new rules will not apply to everybody and rising house prices could still drag more and more families into the net. \nCurrently, IHT is paid at a whopping 40 per cent on all inherited assets worth more than £325,000. \nSo somebody whose estate totalled £425,000 would incur IHT on £100,000, landing their loved ones a huge £40,000 bill. \nMarried couples and civil partners are in a better position because they can inherit each other’s allowance, so £650,000 in total. \nThere will be a new transferable amount of £175,000 on top for each parent leaving their home to their children and grandchildren. \nBut while the Chancellor is giving with one hand, he is taking away with the other. \nOne reason so many ordinary middle-class families now pay IHT is that the £325,000 threshold has been frozen since 2009, while house prices have risen sharply in that time, especially in London and the South-East.

By 2020/21, that is forecast to collect £5.8million. \nRachael Griffin, financial planning expert at Old Mutual Wealth, says: “Increasing the IHT allowance in line with house price inflation would have been a more robust and cleaner solution.” \nScrapping it altogether would have been cleaner still, but that will have to wait for a future Budget. \nUntil then, Britain’s most hated tax lives on.
