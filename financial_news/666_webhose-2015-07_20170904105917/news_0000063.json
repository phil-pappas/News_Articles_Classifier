It said net sales declined 9 percent for its Mexico unit and in northern Europe they fell by 21 percent.\nThe company said net profit jumped 50 percent to $114 million, compared to $76 million in the same period a year earlier. Its United States unit saw operating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization grew 31 percent.\nEarlier this year, Cemex, which has struggled with large debts since the 2007-09 global economic downturn, stepped up its effort to regain an investment-grade debt rating by vowing to cut costs and sell up to $1.5 billion in assets.\nCemex said that it had refinanced approximately $1.937 billion of outstanding debt that matured in 2017, extending the maturity by three years. The lower interest rate on the debt will save it $20 million a year in financial expenses, it said.\nIn March the company said it had earmarked $100 million of assets already for sale.
