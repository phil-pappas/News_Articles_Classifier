From Medpage Today. \nWASHINGTON -- Hospitals welcomed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' proposal to soften its \"two-midnight rule\" for inpatient payments, but are complaining about other aspects of the agency's planned changes to hospital and ambulatory surgical center reimbursements for 2016. \nWhen CMS proposed its annual payment update last week, it also suggested relaxing the controversial rule related to patients' admission status. The proposed update allows physicians more flexibility to decide whether Medicare beneficiaries should be classified as inpatient or outpatient, but the overall cuts to hospital payments disappointed hospitals and insurers. \nUnder the current two-midnight rule, a provider can treat Medicare beneficiaries as inpatients only when the hospital stay is expected to span two nights -- from one midnight to the next -- or longer. The rule is viewed as a simple way for providers and auditors to determine whether admitting a patient is appropriate. The cost implications are substantial. \nWith some exceptions, CMS pays for inpatient visits under the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) established by Medicare Part A. Reimbursements rates are prospectively set based on the severity of a patient's condition and other factors. \nPayments for outpatient visits are set under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) of Medicare Part B, a \"hybrid\" of prospective payment and fee for service, according to a fact sheet released by the agency. \nIn the proposed revision, CMS affirmed that it still believes the two-midnight rule is appropriate and effective. But in giving physicians more discretion to admit patients undergoing certain procedures without expecting that patient to stay two nights or more, it implicitly acknowledged what many physicians had been arguing for years -- that it was too inflexible and burdensome to physicians, hospitals, and patients. \nOutpatient care, while typically less expensive, can also mean payments are charged separately for individual prescriptions and other services, which can add up. Outpatient classification can also limit patients' access to skilled nursing facilities following a hospital visit, because of another rule that requires patients to be admitted for 3 days. \nPriya Bathija, JD, MHSA, senior associate director of Policy (Inpatient Payment) for the American Hospital Association, said the association opposes the two-midnight rule, in part because the 0.2% payment cut to hospitals it imposed in 2014 in order to fund the rule was \"unwarranted and unlawful.\" The association continues to litigate this claim. \n\"In this proposed rule, CMS continues to articulate that this cut is warranted. So we continue to have an issue with that,\" Bathija said. \nHowever, she added that modifying the two-midnight threshold was a \"good first step .... It opens the door to create a new exception that certain hospital inpatient services don't need to cross two midnights in order to be considered inpatient and appropriate for payment under part A.\" \nThe real impact of the rule will depend on how it is finalized and implemented, Bathija said. \nThe updated rule also moves first-look review of Medicare claims from the Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs) to Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), leaving the contractors to manage only the claims from hospitals with \"consistently high denial rates,\" noted the agency's fact sheet. \nSince inappropriate denials from RACs are what initially led to the development of the two-midnight rule, this is also a welcome change, Bathija said. \"RACs are incentivized so that the more that they deny, the larger that their payments become. They're directly linked,\" she said. \nMoving to QIOs, which have a different payment policy, would be a \"step forward to solving the problem that got us to where we are today,\" she said. \nSeparate from concerns around the two-midnight rule, the association's greatest concern is that CMS has recommended a 2% cut to the conversion factor , which the American Medical Association defines as as a means of weighing \"the geographically adjusted number of relative value units (RVUs) for each service in the Medicare physician payment schedule into a dollar payment amount.\" \nRoslyne Schulman, MBA, MHA, director of Outpatient Payment in Emergency Readiness and Public Health Policy for the American Hospital Association, said the group was \"disappointed\" and \"dismayed\" by the reduced conversion factor and believes the CMS actuaries miscalculated. \nSchulman said hospitals had been expecting an increase of 1.9%, not a cut. \nCMS explained that the basis for its reduction was to account for funds that had previously been shifted away from the clinical lab fee schedule into the OPPS payments in 2014 because of a new policy that packaged lab payments into outpatient services. \n\"Now they're saying that the amount they shifted over was too high,\" said Schulman. To account for this error, the agency said it must cut $1 billion in outpatient payments. \nCarrie William Bullock, MHS, a former CMS official who is now with Avalere Health's reimbursement and product commercialization services practice, said she was also surprised to see the reimbursement cut. \nCompared with years past, Bullock said CMS' proposal was \"not as bold\" in its packaging of services -- or rather, \"bold in a different way.\" \n\"A couple years ago ... we saw significantly more types of services having packaged rather than separate payments.\" This time around, Bullock said, CMS is grouping procedures together based on resource use and clinical characteristics. \n\"CMS has really stretched what can be included in the same group across some important clinical areas.\" Over 50 groups of imaging services were boiled down to 25, she said. \nDepending on the service mix of a particular provider, the change could either have a significant positive or negative impact, Bullock noted. \nRegarding this type of consolidation, Schulman said, the association doesn't oppose increased packaging or bundling. \"That's something we actually look for. We just want to make sure it's being done right,\" she said. \nThe hospital association will analyze CMS' rule and the data it provided closely over the next few weeks, she added. CMS will accept feedback on the rule until Aug. 31.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T15:13:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
