They talked for a while, then Rupert said: \"Think about China.\"\nDays later in New York, James caught up with Dad.\n\"Do you like Chinese food,\" he was asked.\n\"And that was kind of it,\" James told Time . \"It had been decided.\"\nIn the tink His billionaire days may be well and truly behind him, but you won't hear Nathan Tinkler complaining that he couldn't get arrested in this town.\nIt appears that a Supreme Court judge in South Australia who issued the arrest warrant is very keen to hear about the collapse of Tinkler's thoroughbred racing empire, Patinack Farm. And he wants it straight from the horse's mouth – so to speak.\nIt is understood that the probe by Patinack's liquidators – which was due to commence on Monday – is expected to centre on a payment of about $5 million allegedly made from Patinack Farm Administration to another Tinkler-group company.\nAt least Tinkler is not facing jail time in his new home of Singapore – Changi Prison is not easily confused with Tinkler's rented pad on Sentosa Island.\nPub brawl It was always going to get ugly as the witching hour hit at listed pub operator Lantern Hotel Group.\nDespite removing most of the previous board last month with a stick of dynamite – and instigating a thorough review of the business – the current directors appear to have been caught unawares when one of its prize Western Sydney assets, the El Toro Motor Inn, was disposed off for the sum of $24 million on Friday.\nGiven that some of the aggro centred on the feeling that the pub assets were being run at sub-optimal levels, the sale of a prize asset at this juncture was obviously a concern.\nNo mention was made of the sale when the company sacked its CEO on Monday with immediate effect.\nCEO Russell Naylor – who had already been removed from the board as part of last month's purge – was sent packing with a six-month payout in lieu of notice.\nThe payment is in line with the new services agreement with Naylor's consultancy, Naylor Partners, that was agreed with the previous board before it was turfed last month.\nNaylor's departure removes the last tentacle of Lantern's largest shareholder from its executive suite and board room.\nNaylor is a director of Kiwi group Pyne Gould, as was Lantern's recent chairman, Bryan Mogridge .\nThe close ties between Lantern and Pyne was the other reason for the ugliness with other major investors.\nIt will be interesting to see if Lantern continues to use Macrossan & Amiet Solicitors if the legal side of things gets ugly. The most recent annual report revealed that Naylor's brother is a partner at the firm.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T21:09:00.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
