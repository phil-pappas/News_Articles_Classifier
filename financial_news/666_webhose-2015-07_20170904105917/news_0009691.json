On the one hand, the outlook for oil companies is rather downbeat, with various industry experts warning that oil prices are unlikely to recover to anything like their 2014 level anytime soon. As such, it seems probable that profits will come under more pressure and that share prices could weaken in the short run. \nHowever, there is also the argument that oil stocks represent a great long term buy. That's precisely because the outlook for the sector seems challenging and, as such, there are keen valuations that investors looking many years down the line can take advantage of. \nFurthermore, in the case of Genel (LSE: GENL), its investors must decide if its operating outlook is too uncertain to maintain a stake in the company. Certainly, Genel's operations in Iraq/Kurdistan are hugely appealing and, were it not for conflict in the region, the company would undoubtedly be trading on a much higher valuation. And, just as the outlook for the oil price is uncertain, the political situation in Iraq is very volatile and fluid, with a quick and peaceful resolution seemingly unlikely. \nDespite this, though, Genel seems to be a stock worth taking a chance on. That's because it trades on a price to earnings growth (PEG) ratio of just 0.3, which indicates that it offers growth at a very reasonable price. Furthermore, Genel's price to book (P/B) ratio is just 0.6, which indicates that even if its net asset base is written down by 40%, it will still be relatively cheap. \nIn fact, it's a similar situation for Nostrum (LSE: NOG). While it does not operate in areas with such a challenging political outlook, its future is also rather uncertain. Part of that is the fact that Nostrum posted a loss last year, and so investors are seemingly unsure about its ability to turn a red bottom line into a black one. That's even though Nostrum is expected to do so this year, with further growth anticipated next year. As such, and while it remains a relatively high risk play, Nostrum's PEG ratio of 0.1 and P/B ratio of 1.9 indicate that there is a sufficient margin of safety to accommodate such risks. \nMeanwhile, the outlook for Roxi Petroleum (LSE: RXP) remains very uncertain, too. Its move to profitability in its most recent results was due to a reversal of a provision rather than a significant improvement in its trading. And, with the price of oil in its main market, Kazakhstan, falling well below the official oil price, even an increase in production capacity may not be enough to produce more sustainable profitability. \nHowever, with it having a sound financial base, strong investor sentiment and a flagship asset (BNG) that has considerable long term potential, it appears to be worth buying on a P/B ratio of 2.1. Clearly, as with Genel and Nostrum, its shares are likely to remain volatile but, for long term investors, all three stocks appear to be worth taking a chance on. \nOf course, there are a number of other stocks that could be worth buying right now and, with that in mind, the analysts at The Motley Fool have written a free and without obligation guide called 1 Top Small-Cap Stock From The Motley Fool. \nThe company in question may have flown under your investment radar until now, but could help you to build a great income from your investments and retire early, pay off the mortgage, or simply enjoy a more abundant lifestyle. \nClick here to find out all about it - it's completely free and comes without any obligation. \nPeter Stephens has no position in any shares mentioned.
