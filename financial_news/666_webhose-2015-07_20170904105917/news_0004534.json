Arsineh Houspian by Lucille Keen The owner of a Canberra plumbing company who refused to sign a workplace agreement says union officials told him they were \"bringing the bulldog\" to \"flex his muscles\" on worksites.\nAdvanced Plumbing and Drains owner Jason Hooper told the Royal Commission on Trade Union Governance and Corruption that officials from the Communications, Plumbing and Electrical Union told him he needed a workplace agreement with the union to work in the ACT.\nHe said he was told that any company that didn't have an agreement would face disruption from the union.\n\"As they put it, so they're going to go onsite and cause problems so they can try and get everybody on board,\" Mr Hooper said.\nMr Hooper said he had heard from the Master Builders Association that if he \"carried on\" the way he had been, Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union official Dean Hall \"would deal with me the old fashioned way and meet me in the paddocks\".\n\"I took this to mean I would receive a physical beating from Dean Hall,\" he said.\n\"I find it unbelievable these unions [the CPEU and the CFMEU] behave like this in this day and age. I would describe them as thugs.\"\nEarlier, WorkSafe ACT inspector Joseph Bartlett told the inquiry he shut down a concrete pour on a construction site after a CFMEU official yelled and pointed at him.\n On Monday, the commission heard from a contractor on the site that he had been told by the union if he did not sign a workplace agreement he would lose work and his sites would be shut down.\nMr Bartlett claimed CFMEU ACT secretary Dean Hall got in his \"personal space and shouted aggressively\".\n\"If you don't f---ing close the site and someone dies, you'll go to jail,\" Mr Hall allegedly said.\n\"I was intimidated and stressed by the whole situation,\" Mr Bartlett said.\nMr Bartlett said he was called to the site after the union members arrived and said the only safety issues he saw were some minor \"housekeeping\" matters such as a rubbish lying around and not enough to stop the pour.\n\"But had I not been yelled at, then I would have allowed the concrete pour to go ahead,\" he said.\nThe CFMEU issued a statement in relation to the hearing and evidence on Tuesday that said â€‹a number of employers view the union's role in safety as interfering in their business.\n\"They're using the royal commission as an opportunity to vent that the union stands in the way of putting profits ahead of people's lives,\" the statement said.\n\"The CFMEU is dedicated to defending workers' rights to a safe working environment and every day we face hostile employers when we insist on the implementation of safety standards.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:50:13.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
