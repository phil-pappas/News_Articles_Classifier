Edwina Pickles His intervention therefore has ramifications well beyond the immediate discussion about whether the GST rate should rise.\nIt marks a major turning point: it seems the days of a tax debate – and politics - framed in terms of \"reform\" and trade-offs bought with widespread compensation – are now behind us.\nThe disappearance of surpluses, the damage done to the personal tax base by too many rounds of too generous tax cuts in the past 10 years, and the erosion of the corporate tax base under international pressure have made a shift in the nature of the tax debate inevitable for some time. It's just that no politician has until now been prepared to really confront it.\nStakeholder groups have known something had to give for some time, a point repeated on Monday when a coalition of welfare and business groups called on political leaders \"to work towards a tax system that raises the revenue governments need to provide services to the community in a way that supports a stronger economy and job creation, and is fair\".\n Jellyfish on the tide Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Treasurer Joe Hockey may well have long planned to force the states to lift the GST to cover the $80 billion cut in federal spending on education and health in the 2014 budget. But they have flounced and drifted around on tax reform like jellyfish on the tide.\nBaird is using not just his own high personal standing and credibility, but his much better political skills to advocate a change which for too long has been obvious but untouchable.\nYes, he is proposing a compensation package for lower-income households. But his main pitch is one that is most likely to resonate with an ageing electorate: we need the money to fund a growing health bill.\nIt's no wonder that the Prime Minister leapt on a bit of leadership like a drowning man. (Can jellyfish drown?)\nWhatever their starting points, and however long it takes, there will be immense financial pressure on the other states to contemplate Baird's proposal. Equally, they must be tempted to hide in Baird's slipstream on the political risks.\nAll sorts of questions arise from the Baird proposal.If South Australia's Jay Weatherill is open to considering a GST change with compensation, it obviously changes the political equation federally\nAnd if GST revenue jumped by $30 billion a year (before compensation) it would dramatically change the financial viability of the states and, inevitably, the argument about which level of government should both fund and control services.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T22:47:37.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
