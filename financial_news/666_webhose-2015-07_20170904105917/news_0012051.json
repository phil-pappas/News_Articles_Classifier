One such popular formula is: \"jeans/chinos + dress shirt + blazer = night out in the city.\" \n\"Although the blazer is a go-to piece in most of my clients' wardrobes it's difficult for them to conceive of wearing a wool (even tropical wool) structured blazer in 80 degree+ weather,\" Cadmus told Business Insider. \"But what to do when they have a big date or their restaurant reservations require a jacket? Turn to the unstructured blazer, that's what.\" \nWe're talking about blazers made with cotton and are only half lined, or completely without lining. The jacket breathes, so you stay cool. So no, you don't have to pick up some seersucker if that's not your style. \n\"Insert into the formula above, and the sum is correct. Other variations include subtracting the dress shirt — or try a linen one — and adding a cotton polo or t-shirt. This revised formula works best in spring, summer, and early fall,\" Cadmus finished. \nAnd now for some examples, we know you need them. A navy blazer from Paul Smith . \nThis one's cotton and twill, but otherwise give you that standard throw-on blazer feel. A lighter colored unstructured blazer from rag & bone. \nThis nylon cotton blend is only half lined. And no, don't be afraid to deviate from navy. It's summer. Try a knit cotton blazer from Vince. \nThis is for a more casual look. Put it on over a tee-shirt. \nVince Check out the blazer that's almost a sweater, from James Perse. \nThe shawl collar almost makes this jacket a sweater, but it's saved by pockets, a single button, and double layered front panels. \nAlright guys, go out and try to get this one right.
