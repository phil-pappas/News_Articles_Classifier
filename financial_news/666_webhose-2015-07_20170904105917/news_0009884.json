More Pension savers hit by ‘confusing’ fees \nThose affected were born between April 6 1951 and April 5 1953, and will miss out on eligibility for the new “single-tier” pension, unlike men of the same age — estimated at about £155 per week when it comes into force on April 6 next year. \nWomen in this band will qualify under the existing system, which provides the basic state pension, currently £115.95 per week, plus any earnings-related top up, known as the second state pension, which has been accrued. \nWhile these women will benefit from receiving their pension earlier than men, as their state pension age is currently several years ahead of men’s, they say that the new pension is more generous for low-earning women. \n“Week to week, many women will be better off under the new state pension,” said Cathe Rikby, 62, a Sussex resident who is campaigning for transitional arrangements for the women affected. \n“We could be looking at an extra £15 to £25 per week. What matters is your weekly income and this amount can make a big difference over a lifetime for someone who is struggling financially.” \nThe women have been backed by Labour MP Andrew Gwynne, who says women born in the 1950s had been “clobbered” by successive legislative changes, including a decision by the previous government to speed up the rise in their state pension age. \n“A combination of changes that were made to the state pension in 1995 and 2011 means that many women who were born in the 1950s will not have the kind of retirement that they had hoped for,” Mr Gwynne said in a statement in the Commons this month. \n“Given that senior civil servants, judges and even members of parliament have their pensions protected within ten years of their normal retirement age, is it not time for the prime minister to look again at ensuring that this group of women have fairness in the system?” \nMr Gwynne said the government make provision for the women within that group to be able to draw down their pensions at what would have been the normal retirement age, “or to financially compensate them with an ex-gratia payment to be able to make some alternative provision.” \nCampaigners concede that not all women born in the affected group will be left with a worse weekly state pension under the existing system, due to differing individual circumstances. But they argue they should be given the choice to opt for either the old or new state pension, depending on their financial circumstances. \n“For many women the state pension will be their only source of income, unlike men of the same age,” said Ms Rikby, who has appealed to the new pension minister, Ros Altmann, to intervene. \n“The new state pension was designed to reduce gender inequality but these changes are failing the test. Women are being treated differently to men of the same age.” \nThe overhaul of the state pension — to create a simpler foundation for state provision — is being rolled out at the same time as the women’s state pension age, currently 62, is rising to equalise with men at 65 by 2018. \nThe government has said that women who took time out of the workforce to take care of family members, for example, are expected to be among the biggest winners of the new single tier. \nThe Department for Work and Pensions said: “These changes were introduced in order to protect public finances and maintain the sustainability of the state pension over the long term. Any further changes or compensation could cost billions of pounds.” \nTo qualify for the full new state pension from 2016, individuals will need 35 qualifying years of national insurance credits or contributions, up from 30 under the current system. \nUnder the new state pension, spouses will also lose the right to inherit their partner’s pension.
