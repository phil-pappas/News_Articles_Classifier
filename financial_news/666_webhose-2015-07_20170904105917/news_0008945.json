And while some positions might be \"just a job\" for the summer, others might be the job you've been dreaming of. So if you think you've found the place you want to work after the summer is over, how do you convert your summer internship into your dream job? We talked to top hiring professionals to find out what it takes to stand out from the pack. \nHave a Mentor \nKathy Harris, managing director of Harris Allied, says that a mentor can be crucial in helping to turn your internship into your dream job. \"My advice is that your mentor work for the company where you're interning, rather than a student advisor at school,\" she says. That might be your direct manager, someone at HR who manages the internship program or someone within your department that you trust. Finding someone who went to your school can be an added bonus -- it gives you something to connect over.
