Will Russell by Matthew Stevens Andrew Harding is the chief executive of Australia's biggest iron ore complex. But that is not what makes Rio Tinto's man in Perth such an interesting study. Home-spun Harding is not your stereotypical mining executive. He is a hard-core mining engineer and defender of free markets who wears his EQ brightly on his PPE sleeve. And Harding appears totally unafraid to illuminate the deeply personal in expressing his business narrative.\n\"It wasn't that long ago that I lost my dad and not long before that when I lost my young son,\" Harding will tell a mining safety conference in Perth on Tuesday morning. \"These are both personal life realities, harsh and very sad, not to mention challenging for me, my wife, my three daughters and others.\n\"But I can talk about it now. I have grown from that hardship. It was a matter of being resilient. Accept what comes our way, the ups and downs, the positives and negatives, and keep going on no matter what.\"\nHarding's point, as it turns out, is that the mining industry and its people need to \"face the harsh realities but never give up\" on the quest to ensure that every employee arrives prepared to work and returns home as fit and healthy as they arrived on the job.\nThe Harding proposition is that a working life in mining is one that embraces the risk of cataclysmic injury and that a critical building block for safe management of that risk is informed, and routinely refreshed, by healthy doses of pessimism.\nIn this approach, Harding advocates the Stockdale Paradox. Harding tells the story of Colonel Jim Stockdale, who is doubtless one of those Vietnam veterans that Donald Trump might deny hero status.\nStockdale was a USA airman who spent more than seven years in the Hanoi Hilton after being shot down in a bombing raid over North Vietnam in 1965. He was one of a group of 11 called the Alcatraz Gang that lived in tortured isolation after leading resistance efforts. Ten of them survived to go home.\nSurvival of the pessimists \"The troops of Colonel Stockdale captured and interned during the Vietnam War had the highest survival rate of any. Why?\" Harding asks in his speech.\n\"Not because they were optimists, quite the opposite. The optimists all died. Because Stockdale got all his troops together each morning and said it is very unlikely that we will ever get out of here; but you know what, we will never give in or give up.\"\nBy many accepted measures Harding's safety record in iron ore is on an impressive, improving trajectory. But Harding is having none of that. This year, he reports, the iron ore division has endured the \"devastation\" of the death of a train driver in Canada along with \"seven potentially fatal incidents\" at sites local and international.\nHarding reasserts Rio's ambition to be the \"best iron ore business in the world\". To achieve that Rio must generate its massive volumes \"at the right cost\". But that is a measure of much, much more than financial returns, Harding says.\n\"While it implies lowest cost production, it is also categorical about the fundamental priority of safety and, in an expanded notion, the overall strength and resilience of our workforce.\"\nRio's \"expanded notion\" of health and safety increasing accounts for psychological health and general human well-being.\n\"Relatively, the personal health and well-being journey is newer and less advanced in our industry, but one of fundamental importance,\" Harding reports. \"And I have no doubt it is frustrating, given its lack of visibility and difficulty to measure.\n\"As an engineer, it was important that our business took a measured approach to business resilience and personal well-being. How do we define each; how do we know if all is well, or not so well; and what can we do about the latter?\n\"And, as a business that prides itself on being leading edge on many things, what expectations should we have on this newer journey?\"\nMassive demographic shift By its nature mining is a business conducted at distance from urbanity and there has been a massive demographic shift in the way over the past decade the industry manages the tyranny of distance. Mining towns have been replaced increasingly by airports populated in shifts by fly-in, fly-out workforces. FIFO workers live a very particular life. Work and family life is divided into two distilled blocks of time.\nOutside of this break to long-standing routines of work, the dulling intensity of a life spent either at work or in mine camps preparing for the next 12-hour shift has caused it own pressures. There is an increasing body of evidence that work camps foster a greater than community background level of illicit drug use and a recent WA inquiry expressed concern over the mental health of FIFO workers generally and with a rising suicide toll specifically.\n\"I acknowledge that, unaddressed, there are things about FIFO that may well impact a person's emotional health and well-being,\" Harding says.\n\"As a business, we have welcomed the release of the final report by the Standing Committee and are pleased to see that many of the recommendations are a good fit with our well-being strategy,\" Harding says.\nRio's well-being strategy has been rolling out since 2012 and it includes the training of \"peer supporters\" who are trained to identify colleagues showing signs of work place stress. Across a workforce of 16,000, Harding's operation has so far rolled out 430 of these \"peer supporters\" who are overseen by 19 \"peer support co-ordinators\".\n\"And we have had a well-being induction process in place since 2012, delivered by experienced psychologists every single week to all our new employees and contractors,\" Harding says. \"It discusses openly the potential mental health challenges, and benefits, of working in the mining industry for Rio Tinto. The session explores ways our people can look after themselves, their work mates, and their families when it comes to mental well-being.\"\nHolistic interest in its people Importantly, Rio's growing holistic interest in its people does not rob them of individual responsibility for themselves and others.\nWith that noted, Harding offers some insights into his own well-being regime. He stays fit though a bung knee means he walks rather than runs these days. He admits to be relatively unburdened by dietary excesses and advocates the power of meditation.\n\"Part of my meditation is for relaxation, but I also use meditation to help me focus. It's called being mindful â€¦ My head is clearer, my thoughts slow down, it's easier to concentrate, I feel relaxed and most importantly, it helps me cope with stress,\" he says. \"I make a martial art out of paying attention.\"\nAs I said, Harding is not your ordinary miner.\nA public service no more\nFinal confirmation of victory at the ballot box for Aurizon's new employment agreement with its Queensland freight train drivers allows the nation's biggest coal transporter to, rather, belatedly enter the 21st century.\nEmployee endorsement leaves Aurizon free to make compulsory redundancies and worker relocations across its business and to run rosters as management might want, rather than as the rail unions might see fit.\nThe fact that this was not already possible reflects only Aurizon's relatively recent state government ownership and forcing reform of this public service legacy stands arguably as the most profound achievement of Lance Hockridge's tenure as chief executive of the now-listed rail giant.\nThis is a deal that had gone the distance in dispute. Management and unions had argued their corners for nearly two years before the Fair Work Commission stunned everyone in April by accepting management's proposition that a collection of long-expired enterprise agreements should be terminated.\nWhat is truly amazing about the deals subsequently forged is that they so closely resemble what was offered to the unions two years ago and that 75 per cent of the train drivers and 82 per cent of Aurizon's construction and maintenance workers have voted to support them. In the end, all the unions have done is delay delivery of the first round of three consecutive 4 per cent pay rises.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:08:44.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
