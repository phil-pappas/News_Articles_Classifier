Photo: Jason Loucas by Jamie Freed Mercedes Ruehl Copenhagen, Denmark-based Noma, which is consistently ranked among the world's top restaurants, will relocate to Sydney's Barangaroo waterfront for 10 weeks from January with a menu focused on showcasing Australia's shoreline produce and culture.\nJudging by the popularity of UK-restaurant The Fat Duck's six-month stay at Crown Melbourne, where bookings were sold out rapidly despite the $525 price-tag, there is likely to be high demand for bookings from locals. But one-quarter of the seats at Noma Sydney will be set aside for international tourists under the initiative sponsored by Tourism Australia, Barangaroo developer Lend Lease and Singapore Airlines.\nNoma, under the direction of chef and co-owner Rene Redzepi, is known for cuisine drawing on regional landscape and culture. This January, the Noma team relocated to the Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo for five weeks, in a move so popular that the waiting list for reservations reportedly contained 60,000 names .\nOn Monday, Mr Redzepi said the booking process and prices for the Sydney restaurant had yet to be determined, but those interested could register for more information on the Noma website . In Copenhagen, a meal at Noma costs $343, with matching wines available for another $222.\nMr Redzepi, who spent the last three weeks touring Australia and tasting unique flavours such as emu eggs, mountain pepper leaves and quandongs, said he was excited about the opportunity to cook with such exotic ingredients.\n\"We are going to cook as we have never cooked before,\" he said. \"It is like going to the moon. As a cook, to taste new things, it is the best thing you can have.\"\nMr Redzepi said the menu would be focused on the ocean, with fire-cooking as a component because Aboriginal people traditionally cooked that way and barbecues were so popular with Australians.\n\"Of course, there are the world-class restaurants [in Australia], but it was my experiences in the bush of Western Australia and South Australia that linger in my memory,\" he said.\n Barangaroo waterfront location The Sydney restaurant will be open for lunch and dinner five days per week. It will be located at the ground level of one of the low-rise apartment complexes.\nBarangaroo will have more restaurants, bars and cafes than Woolloomooloo, Circular Quay, Walsh Bay and the theatre district combined. So far, about 50 food and beverage retailers will open at the precinct, including a new three-storey restaurant by celebrity chef Matt Moran.\n\"We will have the biggest critical mass [of food and beverage outlets] in Australia,\" Lend Lease head of retail development Gary Horwitz said.\nThe Noma move comes as Tourism Australia looks to promote Australian food and wine to international visitors as part of the Restaurant Australia campaign launched last year.\nTourism Australia managing director John O'Sullivan said spending by international visitors on food and wine had risen by 10 per cent to $4.2 billion over the last year, making it on par with total spending from the UK, the second largest inbound market.\n\"We have seen a 22 per cent increase in the perception of Australia as a food and wine destination,\" he said. \"It is very significant.\"\nHeavy promotion to tourists Mr O'Sullivan said Noma's move to Sydney would be promoted heavily in the Japanese market, which has been among the worst performers of Australia's major inbound tourism markets with a 0.1 per cent fall in arrivals in the 12 months to May.\n\"Because Noma was so successful in Japan and we know Japan is quite challenging at the moment from an Australian tourism perspective, this type of new product will be really good to put into that market to create some visitation,\" he said.\n\"Other key markets for food and wine? China is obviously a key one. I think that out of Scandinavia and continental Europe as well this will be very good, as well as North America. We will work with our key distribution partners, our top-level travel agents who really go for that independent traveller who is not so price sensitive to target these types of packages.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/how-noma-took-tokyo-what-happened-when-the-planets-best-restaurant-moved-to-the-gourmet-capital-of-the-world-10042324.html", "http://noma.dk/australia/"], "published": "2015-07-27T10:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T10:07:33.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
