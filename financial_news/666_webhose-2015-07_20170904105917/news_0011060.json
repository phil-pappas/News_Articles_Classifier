Photo: Picasa\nGiving someone their marching orders is, arguably, a boss's toughest job.\nYou've employed someone with best intentions but it is not working out: you've decided to let them go.\nSo how do you do this?\nHow do you end someone's tenure with minimal legal, commercial and/or emotional fallout?\nAdvertisement Follow these expert steps and avoid fuelling workplace friction, ending up in hospital or in court.\nFirst, ask yourself the tough question.\nEdward Mallett, founder and employment barrister of Employsure, advises bosses considering sacking employees to first ask: \"If that person walked into my office today and resigned, would I be disappointed?\"\nMallett's company helps more than 5000 SMEs deal with staffing issues. One of the most common questions he is asked is how to end an employment contract.\n\"Asking that initial question is the emotional litmus test I advise all clients take before terminating an employee,\" Mallett says.\n\"If the answer is 'yes' there may still other options. If the answer is 'no' we move forward to working out the appropriate technical response.\"\nKnow exactly why you want to fire\nThere are three core reasons for ending a staff member's employment.\nThese are:\n▪ Poor performance\n▪ Misconduct\n▪ Redundancy\nIt is super important to know the basis of your desire to fire because this determines the steps you must next take, Mallett says.\nNever fire on the spot\nMany owners of small businesses get themselves in a legal pickle by reacting \"in the moment\" to something a worker does or says.\nThis is the worst thing to do, cautions Harrison Human Resources founder and director Claire Harrison, who has witnessed more than 1000 terminations because of redundancy, misconduct or poor performance.\nTo fire someone in a fit of rage leaves you exposed to unfair, unjust, or unreasonable dismissal claims. It is unsettling for other workers.\n\"Other employees will watch how you handle the situation making it very important to model respectful, calm and measured behaviour,\" Harrison says.\nGather lots of evidence\n\"There are key steps I give clients to help them keep focus when firing and the first step is facts; really gather the facts,\" Harrison says.\n\"I often hear 'Oh, it's poor performance' and I say they really need to first gather the facts of the situation and not just rely on gut feeling as concrete evidence is invaluable in many involuntary dismissals.\"\nGet a basic understanding of workplace law\nUnder the Fair Work Act , and assuming no discriminatory factors exist, small businesses with fewer than 15 employees cannot be sued for unfair dismissal by a worker asked to leave in their first 12 months.\nIf the worker has been employed for more than a year, you must still give the person opportunity to lift poor performance – or explain their actions in misconduct claims – before firing, Mallett says.\nIf you don't do this, the fired worker may take you to court.\nMaking a job redundant because production has dropped off is a common reality in small business.\nYou may avoid a redundancy pay-out if this happens in a worker's first two years with your business – but always check your worker's contract before proceeding, Mallett advises.\n\"If you catch someone with their hands in the till, and while many of our clients find it infuriating, you do still have to meet with them to say you saw them with their hands in the till and ask them if they have anything to say,\" Mallett says.\n\"It may not change your decision to fire but the act of asking can be beneficial to your business in the long run.\n\"It's when businesses don't meet with employees before firing, even in cases of blatant misconduct, that we hear stories of 'X fired after caught stealing but still wins unfair dismissal case'.\"\nMeet face to face\nThe facts stand up and you've decided to bring this to a head. Give the employee notice of a meeting to discuss their employment.\n\"Tell the person what it is about not just 'Oh, let's have a meeting tomorrow' without any clue to the topic,\" Harrison says.\n\"If you want to bring a support person, that is OK, and then at the meeting you need to go through your concerns and explain each, listen to their responses – even if the core issue is someone punching someone – and then pause to consider your response.\"\nMake your decision – and stick to it\nYou've gone away, reviewed the worker's response, contract and relevant federal awards, and decided to push on.\nYou must break the news your employee has lost their job.\nHow do you deliver the final blow?\n▪ If possible, meet face to face to deliver their written notice\n▪ Explain the situation and be honest\n▪ Be a good listener\n▪ Don't shoot from the hip\n▪ Give the employee an opportunity to respond\n▪ Treat your worker with respect\nEmployee Matters founder Natasha Hawker has terminated more than 200 employees in her career.\n\"I used to be known as 'The Angel of Death' after having to make redundant some 50-plus employees in my own business,\" Hawker says.\nShe says: \"You need to be prepared with a script and document everything, be empathetic but strong, professional and unwavering. Communicate effectively with the employee, run a fair process, make it private, know the rights of your employee and communicate with your team as otherwise they might feel this is the start of many terminations.\"\nMallett stresses that SME bosses – who often suffer many sleepless nights before sacking someone – should remember that in business some bosses and workers will break up.\n\"The honest truth is every boss will experience this, there is no need to think of it as a guilty or dirty secret,\" Mallett says.\n\"If you have done the right thing today it will save you a lot of pain and cost tomorrow.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T01:04:28.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
