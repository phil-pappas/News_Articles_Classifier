It also has more than 18 million customers in Latin America. \nIn announcing the deal last year, AT&T said it would use the merger to expand plans to build and enhance high-speed broadband service to 15 million customer locations, mostly in rural areas. \nThe plan comes amid a migration of consumers to Internet-based television services like Netflix (Xetra: 552484 - news ) and Hulu, with some losses in traditional cable and other pay TV subscriptions. \nThough the number of cable \"cord cutters\" has been relatively modest in recent years, analysts expect this trend to accelerate, which could have a major impact on the television industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T04:47:27.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
