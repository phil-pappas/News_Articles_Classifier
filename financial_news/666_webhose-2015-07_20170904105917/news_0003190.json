It has been unable to close its books for the past financial year in the meantime and suspended its year-end dividend. \nSources said previously that investigators' central theory is that executives, worried about the impact of the 2011 Fukushima disaster on its nuclear unit, set overly aggressive targets in new businesses such as smart meters and electronic toll booths, encouraging the understating of costs and overestimating of revenue. \n(Reporting by Reiji Murai and Ritsuko Ando in Tokyo; Additional reporting by Abhirup Roy in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Stephen Coates)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T06:59:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
