UK Mortgages, which targets returns of 7pc-10pc a year, mostly from income, raised £250m from investors, making it the year’s second largest new investment trust after Neil Woodford’s Patient Capital. \nThe issue was oversubscribed, with demand from investors of £325m. \nThe fund, which is managed by TwentyFour Asset Management, a respected bond fund house, will buy existing portfolios of UK residential mortgages with “strong observable performance histories” as well as “new portfolios with robust underwriting standards”. \nTwentyFour said residential mortgages had “displayed remarkable resilience to economic downturns, resulting in profitable lending in all market conditions for high quality mortgage lending”. \nIt said the loans represented “secured lending against important personal asset” with “very low default rates and lower loss rates relative to other forms of debt”. It pointed out that annual default rate peaked at 0.78pc in 1991, when interest rates reached 14pc. \n• This trust will protect you in share price storms – and the market is overlooking its secret weapon \nThe annual loss rate during credit crunch was always below 0.2pc, it added. \nIt said the trust would offer investment performance that was unaffected by factors such as “geopolitical events” and volatility in the bond markets, which often blow stock markets off course. \nIt said the majority of the fund’s income would be distributed as a quarterly dividend, expected to be 3p in the first year. In other words, there would be limited scope for capital growth. \nLike many investment trusts, UK Mortgages will borrow to boost returns, although it said borrowing would be “conservative”. \nAlthough the trust is listed on the London Stock Exchange, it is based in Guernsey. \nThe shares made modest gains after listing on Tuesday, trading on Friday a few pence above the 100p initial price. \nMark Holman, the head of TwentyFour, said: “UK Mortgages provides an opportunity to access an attractive yield supported by a historically robust asset class. The income potential and historically low correlation to other asset classes has clearly appealed to investors.” \nTwentyFour’s partners said they expected to invest significantly in the fund. The management fee is 0.75pc a year. \n• See all our investment stories on your Facebook page – like us at facebook.com/telegraphinvesting \n• Put a question on investment income to our experts: moneyexpert@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T18:59:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
