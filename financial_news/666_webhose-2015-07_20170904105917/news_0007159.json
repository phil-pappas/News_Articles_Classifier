Adhil Shetty Bankbazaar.com Rohan, an apparel businessman, lost his wallet while travelling on a suburban train in Mumbai. He had about six cards in his wallet, including his debit card, credit cards and a loyalty card. By the time Rohan managed to reach home and call the different banks’ helplines to initiate a block request, one of the credit cards was used for a bulk purchase. He soon initiated calls to all banks one by one, to block all the cards. Just like Rohan, every one of us is susceptible to credit or debit card loss. If we have multiple cards, it is indeed a tiring task to call up different help lines one by one to report it and follow the stipulated processes. And today, multiple cards are integral parts of every wallet.Here is where a credit card protection plan comes in handy. Understanding Credit Card Protection Card protection plans, or ‘CPP’ as they are commonly known, act like insurance protection plans. You are supposed to pay a small annual premium to take up a cover for all types of plastic- debit cards, credit cards, retail cards, membership cards and loyalty cards in your wallet. CPP is a very popular concept in the West, but yet to catch the fancy of card holders in India. CPP offers protection against lost, theft or any related frauds on your cards. In India, credit card protection plans are offered by two main service providers, namely Credit Protection Plan (CPP) and OneAssist. You can opt for any of their plans, depending upon your cards and their credit limits. These service providers charge an annual premium which starts as low as Rs.899. If the cards are lost or stolen, all one has to do is to call up at the service provider’s helpline number and lodge a claim, instead of dialing up multiple banks. The service provider then works with all the concerned banks, as per the cards registered with them and initiate cancellation of cards immediately on your behalf. It will also pay the expenses incurred on lost cards against any unauthorized transaction.If you are overseas, CPP services also provide emergency financial assistance for travel and for settling hotel bills, if you are cash strapped after losing your wallet. Raising claims of CPP Claims can be registered by calling at the helpline number of the CPP service provider within 24 hours of the event. Post that, one needs to file a written complaint within 30 days of the event, after filling the due form, submitting original documents like card statements and a copy of the police complaint.CPP usually pays for transactions incurred not only after the loss, but also for those that have taken place happened 7 days prior to the loss too, to avoid complicated disputes that may arise out of the timing of the fraudulent transactions, as it can happen when it is with the banks. So, even if a fraudulent transaction has occurred on your card, hours before intimation, you will be on the safer side. Is it a good idea to opt for CPP? Considering that CPP offers a protection against any loss that arises out of lost or stolen cards, it is well worth the effort and the cost. However, before opting for CPP you must assess your risk factors. For example, if you are an avid traveler, your chances of losing or misplacing cards are automatically higher than an individual who travels minimally or not at all. Things to know before applying for CPP While CPP is a great option for just about anyone, there are certain things that you should know before opting for one.• Know the tie-ups of your provider: All banks may not have tie-ups with all service providers. So before opting, it is imperative to check whether your bank has a tie-up with the shortlisted service provider.• Know the maximum damage loss: Different CPP service providers have different plans. The maximum amount towards a loss varies from plan to plan. So, you may not cover the entire expenses incurred out of a loss as this depends upon the plan you choose. There will also be a maximum cap for reimbursement. \nRELATED NEWS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T10:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T01:58:41.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
