No financial details of the partnership agreement were disclosed in a joint statement on Wednesday.\nAt the launch, the Netflix offering is to include series such as Daredevil and Sense8, documentaries and stand-up comedy specials, plus a selection of programmes for children.\nTelecom Italia, in which French media group Vivendi became the biggest investor last month, previously reached a content deal with Sky Italia and is open to agreements with other players.\nLast month, Netflix unveiled plans to expand into Italy, Spain and Portugal later this year as part of a bid to bring the popular American TV and film streaming service to some 200 countries within two years.
