Louise Kennerley Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jonathan Barrett A creditor in the $1.7 billion Bell Group litigation has employed prominent barrister and former WA governor Malcolm McCusker to fight against state government plans to bypass the courts and control distribution of the funds.\nIn a letter sent to state politicians, Perth-based litigation funder Hugh McLernon said the former governor, who is acting as senior counsel, would lead a challenge if needed.\n\"Indeed, I can advise (as I have his express authority to do so) that the former governor, Mr Malcolm McCusker, QC, has agreed to lead any necessary constitutional challenge to the provisions of this proposed legislation,\" the letter said.\nThe warning follows a controversial decision by the West Australian government, which is a creditor, to introduce laws designed to thwart future legal actions and finalise a payout of the spoils from the Bell Group settlement. The government's bill has passed the legislative assembly and must now pass the legislative council.\nThe Bell Group case dates to the mid 1990s in the aftermath of a refinancing deal in which a consortium of banks refinanced the company with about $265 million. The company soon failed and there were allegations the banks had improperly recovered loans by providing finance in return for security.\nA settlement was finalised last year with the banks, leaving a pool of $1.7 billion to be distributed among four main creditors: the government's Insurance Commission of Western Australia, Australian Taxation Office, European creditors the Plaza Group and a group led by Mr McLernon called WA Glendinning.\nWA Glendinning is the smallest of the four main creditors, with a $183 million claim.\n\"We are the runt of the litter and the others push us around,\" said Mr McLernon, who is also an executive director at litigation funder IMF Bentham.\n In order to prove a claim, creditors must prove they have a debt owed by Bell Group. They can make a claim if they helped fund the litigation.\nDispute brewing There is an emerging dispute over how the $1.7 billion should be distributed and whether funds should flow to the non-government creditors before the Insurance Commission.\nThe West Australian government, which has spent more than $200 million on the case, has introduced a bill designed to end the litigation by giving a government bureaucrat ultimate say over the carve-up.\nThe bill has been widely criticised in legal circles, while the government claims the \"legislative solution\" is necessary to avoid further lengthy legal disputes, and provide certainty and speed over the distribution of monies.\nInsurance Commission chief executive Rod Whithear said the government did not want lawyers to \"duel for another decade\".\n\"We understand that a creditor who has had a free ride on the back of funding by others wants to maximise its share of the pot,\" Mr Whithear said, referring to WA Glendinning.\n\"That is a commercial opportunity they are exploiting. But paying $125 for a once worthless debt and expecting $183 million back once others have created value shows that creditor is trying to push the others around rather than the reverse.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/barrett_ink", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/111791755610985370077"], "published": "2015-07-01T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T11:07:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
