So we're really saying we have to be above most of the pack,\" he said.\nAustralia banks were \"well prepared for any shock\" but the Greek crisis was evidence of the danger of complacency, according to Mr Murray.\n \"No country can [be complacent], because if it's left too late to make adjustments, the social cost just gets too high as has being demonstrated with the closure of the banks in Greece,\" he said.\nThe Greek crisis had critical lessons for Australia's welfare and tax system, Mr Murray said.\n\"The Greek issue demonstrates that we have to stay on the issues of costs of pensions, cost of welfare, the tax structures - whether they are effective or not.\"\nMr Murray said his Financial System Inquiry's recommendation for Australian banks to lift their capital rations would shield taxpayers.\n\"We want to make sure in the unlikely event there is difficulty in the banking system and the taxpayer is drawn in to deal with that problem we want to make sure the taxpayer can get back out either at no cost or a profit,\" he said.\nï»¿", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/apra-says-bank-capital-will-not-be-tied-to-international-benchmarks-20150713-giar62.html"], "published": "2015-07-14T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T05:47:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
