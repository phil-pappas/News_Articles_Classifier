Yet I can have the people next door over and they would be totally relaxed. I love that it fits any type of situation.\" less Related Content \n4 The island's former owners slashed the asking price to $24.5 million last year. Pentecost negotiated … By Sid Lipsey \nWith his recent home purchase, one Florida man not only made it into the record books, he became an inspirational figure to teachers everywhere. \nHigh school maths teacher turned entrepreneur Mark Pentecost just bought Little Bokeelia Island off the southwest coast of Florida. The purchase price was $14.5 million (£9.3m), reportedly a record for a residential sale in southwestern Florida. The 104-acre private island comes with a 6,486-square-foot Spanish-style villa with 4 bedrooms and 5 baths, a mini-village with bungalows for guests, numerous ports and beaches, a tennis court, and a pool with lagoon. \nFor many a teacher who daydreams during class about running away to a private island someday, Pentecost and his wife, Cindy, are living the dream. And they know it. \"We high-five each other a lot and say, 'I don't know how we got here, but we're not giving it back!'\" says Pentecost, founder and CEO of a company called It Works. \"We've been really blessed.\" \nHis rags-to-riches story began with a modest goal when he was teaching maths in the 1990s: He just wanted to make an extra couple hundred bucks a month. But after a couple of years of wild success in direct sales, he left teaching and eventually launched It Works in 2001 to sell slimming body wraps that people can wear under their clothes. Since then, It Works has expanded to skincare and nutrition products. It moved to Florida four years ago, and last year racked up $456 million (£293m) in sales. \nStill, \"who would have thought that we could own an island?\" The idea never entered his mind until he saw Little Bokeelia on an episode of AWE TV's \"Private Islands.\" Former high school math teacher turned entrepreneur Mark Pentecost is having a heck of a summer vacation.
