PUBLISHED: 17:52, Mon, Jul 13, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:56, Mon, Jul 13, 2015 GETTY Fraudsters hope to trick pensioners out of their life savings \nAnd those who wish to take their pension savings and move abroad have become a particular target for unscrupulous con-artists. Eight out of ten requests for overseas pensions transfers now received by Aegon are scams aimed to defraud people out pot their pension, warned the provider.The firm stepped in to stop the transactions that customers had unwittingly authorised to to fake Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme (QROPs).The schemes can be a perfectly legitimate way to receive transfers from UK registered pension schemes abroad. But unregulated companies are now advertising the service while taking a huge cut to cover administration fees, said Aegon. The provider has found that fraudsters are typically targeting smaller pensions of around £30,000 with the promise to carry out a pension review. But the underlying intention is to transfer the money overseas. Once the cash is out of the country it’s possible the victim will lose their entire pensions savings. If it is not lost forever they may face a tax bill of up to 55 per cent and other additional fees when the pension pot is repatriated.The firm is calling on pension savers, pension schemes and providers to be vigilant.Kate Smith, regulatory strategy manager at Aegon UK, said: \"The new pension freedoms have given people far greater choice about how they access their pension, but unfortunately this has opened the door for scammers.\"Fraudsters are not only plausible but are also highly persuasive and it can be all too easy to fall for their polished performance, unless you are on your guard. \"We’re seeing more and more sophisticated ways of unscrupulous people getting their hands on people’s retirement savings and it’s not just the over 55s who are being preyed on, younger customers are being targeted too.\"We’re determined to protect our customers and crack down on the growing cases of fraudulent activity, but we need customers to be more aware and ever vigilant. \"Before signing any paperwork, it’s vital to question whether you fully understand what you’re signing for and bear in mind it might not be what you’ve been led to believe. If in doubt don’t sign.” How to protect your savings from scammers 1. Be wary. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is \n2. Ignore/delete emails and texts - don’t unsubscribe \n3. Never give out personal information to a cold caller – just hang up \n4. Never be rushed into making a quick decision \n5. Don’t let anyone in to your home unless you’re sure they are genuine \n6. Use a regulated adviser to make sure you’re protected. Most cold callers aren’t regulated \n7. Read the documents carefully. Don’t sign anything unless you fully understand what you’re getting into. You may inadvertently sign your pension away \n8. Carry out research. Check out the company or named individuals online \n9. Beware of the tax implications. For example, if you transfer your pensions overseas and you live in the UK, you may need to pay a 55 per cent tax charge, in addition to any other fees \n10. Talk to your pension provider or adviser if you have any concerns.
