The polling industry's professional body, the Marketing Research and Intelligence Association, says online surveys cannot be assigned a margin of error because they do not randomly sample the population.\nThe poll says nearly half — 45 per cent — of respondents have tried to save for summer festivities but expect they'll have to put extra costs on their credit cards.\nAnother 29 per cent said they tend to stick to their budgets over the summer, while seven per cent said their budgets go out the window during the warm weather months and 19 per cent said they have no household budget.\nChristina Kramer, executive vice-president of retail and business banking at CIBC, says many Canadians tend to underestimate how much they will spend on holidays and other seasonal events.\n\"Expense creep,\" which occurs when you spend a little more than planned over a period of time, can leave consumers with massive credit card bills at the end of the summer, says Kramer.\n\"Having a budget and sticking to it is the best way to enjoy the holidays worry free,\" Kramer said in a statement.\n\"Canadians should treat these expenses the same as all others and make them part of your overall annual financial plan.\"\n— Follow @alexposadzki on Twitter.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T12:59:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
