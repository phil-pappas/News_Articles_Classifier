The carrier operated two ATR 72-200 turboprops, although local media reports have said that one has been grounded in Germany for some time due to the airline’s financial problems.\nLocal media have reported debts of BAM23 million ($12.9 million), owed mainly to the carrier’s aircraft lessor. Lalović said the regulator was not familiar with the exact nature of the airline’s debts.\nATW’s calls to the airline’s offices went unanswered.\nBH Airlines now has “to deliver analyses of the company’s situation in all segments, including [its] financial situation and a plan of compliance with BH regulations,” he said.\nFailure to deliver a satisfactory report “may cause the final suspension [of the AOC] according to national regulations.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T12:31:51.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
