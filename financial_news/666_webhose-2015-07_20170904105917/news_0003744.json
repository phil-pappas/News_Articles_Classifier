Photo: Michele Mossop\nANZ Banking Group is raising interest rates on home loans held by property investors 0.27 percentage points, so far the most dramatic step by a bank to comply with a clampdown on lending to landlords.\nAt the same time, it is predicting a \"heightened focus\" on borrowers paying off a mortgage on the house they live in, after cutting fixed rates for owner-occupied borrowers.\nIn a move that may be followed by other banks, ANZ on Thursday announced it was putting the brakes on lending to landlords by raising its index rate for investor property loans to 5.65 per cent.\nThe change will add $48 to the monthly repayments on a $300,000 mortgage.\nAdvertisement ANZ's changes come after the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority forced banks to slow their loan growth among housing investors to less than 10 per cent a year, which has already led to banks tightening their lending criteria for landlord borrowers.\nWhile other banks have reduced discounts for new investors in recent months, it is the first time in this cycle of official interest rate changes that a bank has raised interest rates on existing loans.\nANZ Australian operations chief executive Mark Whelan said the bank was trying to reach an \"appropriate\" mix between investor and owner-occupied loans.\n\"The primary reason here is to really ensure that we're getting, as the flows into our book, the appropriate mix between investor lending and owner-occupied,\" Mr Whelan said.\nANZ's move is the latest and most far-reaching change by a bank to rein in investor lending â€“ an area of concern because of the surge in house prices.\nANZ and its rivals have previously pushed up interest rates for new investor borrowers and tightened their lending criteria, such as by requiring larger deposits.\nMr Whelan said these changes had mixed effects, and its move to raise investor rates across the board was \"probably the most pragmatic way\" to achieve the mix of loans it wants.\n\"For us to get to the level that we want for our mix, we felt that we need to do this,\" he said.\nBell Potter analyst TS Lim said he believed other banks would probably raise some home loan interest rates soon, noting Westpac's comment this week that the cost of recent rule changes would \"inevitably be borne by customers and shareholders\".\n\"I think they will probably start with investor property because that is the area where APRA is targeting slower growth. But at the end of the day, I would not be surprised if it is extended across other home loans in due course,\" Mr Lim said.\nIn recent days there have been predictions that banks may increase their mortgage rates to comply with rules announced on Monday that will dent the profitability of mortgage lending. However, Mr Whelan said the move had \"nothing to do\" with these changes, which will require the big four and Macquarie to set aside more capital against mortgages.\nAs well as raising investor interest rates, ANZ cut various fixed rates for owner-occupiers 0.1 to 0.4 percentage points, and predicted banks would continue to target this part of the market more aggressively.\n\"You're going to see, I think, a heightened focus on owner-occupier and first-home-owner buyers in the country,\" Mr Whelan said.\nBanks charged owner-occupiers and investors different rates of interest for the two decades until 1998, Mr Whelan said.\nWith new rules clamping down on lending to investors, other bank executives have in recent months predicted customers paying off the home they live in may get lower interest rates than investor borrowers.\nANZ has about $65 billion of housing investor loans on its books, the smallest of the big four banks.\nMr Whelan said the rate rise would have a \"positive impact\" on the bank's division but was countered by other moves to slow down in investor lending.\nWhen the Reserve Bank previously cut official interest rates in May, ANZ was the only major bank to pass on the full 0.25 percentage points to borrowers.\nMr Whelan said Thursday's move was in effect \"equalising\" that decision, but argued it would not deter investors from taking out loans.\n\"The high-quality properties that are attracting good yield in different parts of the country I think will always be in demand,\" he said. \"I think this will be just another one factor that they will consider.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/owneroccupiers-may-get-cheaper-loans-than-investors-due-to-apra-cap-20150518-gh4f28.html"], "published": "2015-07-23T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T23:25:59.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
