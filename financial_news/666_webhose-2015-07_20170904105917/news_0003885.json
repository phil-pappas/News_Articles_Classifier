Accordingly, qualifying entries for the past two years are eligible for duty reimbursement. \nAs part of the CNL review, importers may petition to waive the CNL for specific products (if below the de minimis level) and to re-designate items that are ineligible because they exceed the CNL’s in past years. Those products include certain fish, vegetables, fruits, grains, sugar, tobacco, chemicals, plastic bags, rubber tires, hides and skins, wood flooring panels, building stone, metal products, engines and engine parts, electronics, and auto parts. For more details, please see the list of products under review by USTR for one of four CNL-related determinations. \nThose products include three types of uncarded, uncombed cotton of specified staple lengths, certain cotton card strips from cotton waste and certain carded and combed cotton fibers. The comment period on the reviews closes July 31, 2015. \nThis review will follow USTR’s normal procedure, which can take up to a year, and will provide importers with an opportunity to petition to add products and countries to the GSP program. In particular, importers of travel goods, such as handbags, backpacks, suitcases, and similar items, which have duty rates up to 20% and which had previously been statutorily exempted from the program will have the opportunity to submit petitions.
