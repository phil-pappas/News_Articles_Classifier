The metal used in power and construction ended at $US5,188, down from $US5,260 on Friday.\nChinese shares sank more than eight per cent on Monday. Major indexes suffered their largest one-day drop since 2007, shattering a period of relative calm. \"The drop in Chinese equities and the negative growth backdrop in China are clearly going to leave you very concerned about Chinese demand in the months ahead,\" said Nic Brown, head of commodities research at Natixis. \"People are expecting China to do something to stimulate growth, but there is a structural change taking place in China. The emphasis is moving away from heavy industry towards a consumer-oriented economy, towards innovation and technology.\" Adding to the bearish news was a report showing hedge funds and money managers increased their net short positions in Comex copper in the week ended July 21. \"There's been a steady flow of sell orders this morning, reinforced by the start of New York trading,\" a trader said. \"There's no reason to buy copper, not yet, not until we see some improvement in China.\" Traders forecast weaker prices for base metals but also expect some support from a lower US dollar, which makes dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies. A major focus this week will be a monetary policy meeting of US Federal Reserve officials. Three-month aluminium closed at $US1,639 from $US1,642.5. Nickel fell 3.5 per cent to a two-week low of $US10,905 a tonne and ended at $US11,000, from $US11,310 on Friday. Chinese stainless steel mills buying nickel are expected to keep prices underpinned at current levels, but higher values are unlikely until inventories drop significantly. At 453,414 tonnes, stocks of nickel in LME-approved warehouses account for about three months of global consumption. Zinc earlier fell to $US1,924, its lowest since July 8, and closed at $US1,933, down from $US1,955. Lead slid to $US1,696 from $US1,719. \"Although we believe that the slide in base metal prices is now exaggerated, the negative momentum and pessimistic mood suggest that prices will fall further in the short term,\" Commerzbank said in a note. Tin rose to $US15,650 from $US15,450 on expectations of tighter supplies from top exporter Indonesia.
