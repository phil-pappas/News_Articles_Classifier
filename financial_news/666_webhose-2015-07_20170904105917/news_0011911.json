Daniel Munoz by Joanna Mather The influential Group of 100 says it would support changes to the tax regime, including the capital gains discount, as a trade-off for increasing and broadening the GST.\nThe Group of 100 is urging the government to come up with a 10-year tax plan and chairman Neville Mitchell said both business and the community needed to bring something to the tax reform table.\nHe cited a modification of the 50 per cent discount on capital gains as something the business community could support, if brought as part of a package of reforms, including a higher GST rate and broader base.\n\"There will have to be compromise on both sides in order to get some long-term settings in place,\" said Mr Mitchell, who is Cochlear's finance boss.\n\"The capital gains tax discount is one area that should definitely be reviewed.\"\nThe government's Rethink tax discussion paper says CGT concessions for business were worth about $1.4 billion in 2013-14, which went to small businesses.\nThe G100 is comprised of the chief finance officers of the nation's 100 biggest companies.\nThe 50 per cent CGT discount is blamed by some for increasing the investor appetite for housing, thereby locking first home purchasers out of the market .\n A tax white paper is being developed by the Abbott government ahead of the next federal election.\nAlong with the role that capital gains tax and negative gearing play in the housing market, other hot button issues are superannuation tax concessions and dividend imputation.\nMany submissions to the review from the business community urge an increase to the 10 per cent GST and point to New Zealand's hike to 15 per cent in 2010.\nAt the same time it is widely accepted that increasing the GST will be felt disproportionately by the poor.\nIn September, The Australian Financial Review is hosting a tax summit with KPMG that will bring together business and civil leaders to debate reform options.\n\"Most business leaders acknowledge that to build broader support for changes to the GST, a number of items such as the capital gains discount, negative gearing and superannuation changes will need to be put on the table,\" KPMG partner Grant Wardell-Johnson said.\nDebate called for \"This requires an urgent debate both within the business and wider community on the main options for reform of our tax system.\"\nOn the matter of capital gains, the discount needed to be considered in terms of the present inconsistency between the taxation of returns of capital for individuals.\n\"For instance, the true effective tax rate of interest income is well beyond the marginal tax rate of an individual when you take into account inflation,\" he said.\n\"What we need is to consider tax reform broadly and not just focus on particular elements of the system.\"\nLike many business leaders, Mr Mitchell insists Australia's corporate tax rate was uncompetitive internationally and that a proposed 1.5 percentage point cut to the research and development tax concession are short-sighted.\nHe said Australia needed to view itself as competing not just with Singapore, but with countries like the United Kingdom, where generous tax incentives have been introduced for businesses that develop and exploit intellectual property.\n\"You'll see no difference in the first few years, nobody is going to pick up their R&D spend and take it to London,\" he said.\n\"But incrementally we will see this loss over a long period – 10 years or so – and suddenly you end up with a sizeable portion of your R&D going overseas.\n\"You then have to attribute IP to that and so that impacts on your transfer pricing and you just don't get the flow back to Australia that you ought to. Things are being put into place now that have very long tails.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T00:56:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
