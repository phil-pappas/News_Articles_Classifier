As per company plans, the plant is scheduled to commence operations before February or March next year. \nAdani has approached the department of industrial policy and promotion for clearance through three different companies, including Ramnad Renewable Energy, Kamuthi Solar Power Ltd and Ramnad Solar Power Ltd. \nChief minister J Jayalalithaa was present during the signing of the MoU by the two sides here on Saturday. “I am very happy to be here. I hope the project is successful and I hope your partnership with Tamil Nadu will continue,” she told Adani group managing director Rajesh Adani. \nA government press statement said Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Ltd (Tangedco) would purchase the entire power from the project at Rs 7.01 a unit. \nIn 2012, the Tamil Nadu government had launched the solar energy policy, which called for the development of 1,000 MW of utility-scale, rooftop and renewable energy certificate (REC) projects annually through 2015. Taking into account the agreement with the Adani group, Tamil Nadu has signed deals to procure 1,084 MW of solar power.
