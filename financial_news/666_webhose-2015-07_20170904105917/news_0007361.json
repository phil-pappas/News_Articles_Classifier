Seemingly out of nowhere, a \"wash-and-rinse day\" emerged that provided a positive test of the May low. This day, and the following one, had the effect of clearing the decks of so-called weak hands.\nThe chart below shows this wash-and-rinse day, and how the session's open and close are nearly equal at the top of the day's range. Volume was well above average, which lends credence to the idea of this being a reversal day of note.\nFor a larger chart, please click here .\nChart created using TradeStation . ©TradeStation Technologies, 2001-2015. All rights reserved.\nMonday's (yesterday) gap up, decisive break of the 50-day moving average, and strong close merely confirmed that the worst is behind the market for the time being.\nA week ago, it was noted here that \" the so-called line of least resistance is down.\" Since then, the action of the leading stocks, always the most critical part of general market analysis, has improved markedly. This, combined with the behavior of the Nasdaq as discussed above and in the above chart, has turned the line of least resistance up.\nSome speculators would have a hard time adjusting their line of thinking as was done in the preceding paragraph. Pride and ego get in the way of simply letting the market tell its own story. But staying in tune with the market is the easiest way to be successful as a speculator. And staying in tune means embracing an open-minded approach that is flexible to new technical developments.\nAmong the names, Amazon.com AMZN, +2.20% was discussed here on June 23 as a potential aggressive entrance above the June 19 high of 444.99. The stock cleared this level and then retreated to the 50-day moving average (a suggested stop-loss area) before breaking out yesterday (Monday) on volume 56% above average.\nAMZN is still buyable around Monday's closing level of 455.57 and up to a maximum of 5% past this level. Any farther than 5% would be considered \"extended\" and higher-risk.\nAs a caveat, earnings are expected to be announced after the close of July 23. There are a few ways of handling earnings risk. Assuming the technicals support such a speculation – and one is not just gambling on the earnings announcement itself – one way is to simply take a junior-sized position ahead of earnings. One would also factor in a worst-case downside scenario, a real earnings blowup.\nAs an example, if a normal position is 10% of an account, a 5% position might be contemplated. Then one would assign a risk amount that might possibly get hit in an extreme downdraft, e.g. 33%. This would mean total account risk of about 1.66% if a 33% decline occurred. Of course, a speculator would have to be comfortable with this type of potential account drawdown, or it could be adjusted.\nLiquid glamours like AMZN, while perhaps less prone to a severe blow-up than a smaller title, can nevertheless come off a large amount when the stars align. Some years ago, Crocs CROX, +0.07% a large, institutional favorite, plummeted about 33%.\nFor larger chart, please click here .\nChart created using MarketSmith . ©2015 MarketSmith Incorporated.
