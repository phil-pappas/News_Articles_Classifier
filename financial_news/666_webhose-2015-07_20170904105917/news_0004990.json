Wal-Mart Stores inc. is edging out of the 24-hour supercenter business. The retail giant next week will end 24-hour service at 40 supercenters, including nine in Maryland. The affected stores will start closing at midnight and opening at 6 a.m. The change includes Wal-Mart's supercenters at the Golden Ring Mall in eastern Baltimore County; on Washington Boulevard in Arbutus; on Liberty Road in Randallstown; on George Claus Boulevard in Severn; and on Chesapeake Center Drive in Glen Burnie. Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) also will end overnight hours at supercenters in Frederick, Germantown and Laurel. Other markets affected are Philadelphia and New Jersey. Brian Nick , a spokesman for Wal-Mart, said it's common for the chain to change hours based on shopping data. “We are constantly reviewing our business to determine operations decisions at our stores,\" Nick said in a statement. \"Based on a recent review of our customers’ shopping patterns we have made the decision to adjust hours at some of our stores. This is the kind of decision we make on a store-by-store basis and will allow us the ability to reallocate resources to serve our customers during peak shopping hours.” Wal-Mart is the midst of broader corporate changes. CEO Doug McMillon , who took over in February 2014, has announced an increased minimum wage for hourly workers, major expansion plans for its Neighborhood Market grocery spinoff and has begun experimenting with services such as grocery pickup to compete against online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. Shares of Wal-Mart, which were trading at $72.77 at noon, have taken a beating this year , tumbling from a one-year high of $90.47 in January. Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart has more than 4,500 stores across the U.S. \nWant Baltimore Retailing & Restaurants news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
