JTS has also accused Sahara and UBS of having “aided and abetted” the UAE firm in breaching its “fiduciary duties” under their agreement.\nLooking into the suit, the court had last month passed an ‘order to show cause’, asking Sahara India Pariwar to show cause in the court why “an order should not be made” for attaching the group’s interest in the Plaza and Dream Downtown hotels in New York.\nIn its submissions made before the court through its counsel here, Sahara has now said that JTS was seeking “to attach property owned by entities over which this court has no jurisdiction, and property owned by non-parties that are not accused of any wrongdoing, in the context of claims that are tenuous at best”.\n“The complaint and affidavits underlying the Order to Show Cause paint a picture of a dispute between JTS and Trinity White City Ventures Limited over a potential business relationship gone sour,” it further said.\nSahara said it was true that A group entity Aamby Valley Mauritius had intermittent discussions in recent months with Trinity for a possible loan transaction, but there was no basis for JTS’ allegations that Aamby Mauritius was aware of the nature of the relationship between JTS and Trinity, or of any alleged breach of fiduciary duty by Trinity owed to JTS.\nJTS has also engaged a law firm in India “to carry out research, review and analysis” in relation to actions or proceedings being faced by Sahara Group under various laws, specifically Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Foreign Exchange Management Act as well as other legislations concerning regulation of financial markets in India.\nSahara also rejected the allegations that it was trying to “strip away the assets” of the two hotels.\nIt further said that Sahara entities will suffer harm if an order for attachment is issued, while adding that JTS was trying to block the group from engaging in any financial transaction in relation to the hotel properties by way of refinancing the existing loans or a sale of the properties.\nReacting to the lawsuit, Sahara Group had earlier said in a statement that “the lawsuit is brought against Trinity White City Ventures Ltd, which was apparently a potential joint venture partner of JTS Trading in a potential bid by Trinity to refinance our two hotels in New York and one in London.”\n“Sahara was at one time in discussions with Trinity but had no knowledge of the dealings between Trinity and JTS,” the statement said.\n“This is a private dispute between two parties who have had a falling out,” Sandeep Wadhwa, Head of Corporate Finance at Sahara Group, had said in the statement.\n“JTS’ attempt to drag Sahara into this dispute is based on false allegations and we are confident that JTS’s claim will not survive the preliminary stages of the proceedings. Sahara intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously,” he added.\nAs per the documents filed with the court by JTS, it had formed a venture with Trinity earlier this year to buy the three hotels from Sahara, which has been seeking to arrange funds to ensure release of its chief Subrata Roy and two other top executives from Tihar Jail in New Delhi.\nSahara sources said this lawsuit will have no bearing on its fund-raising exercise as a deal is already in final stages with another investor.\nJTS was to invest 850 million US Dollars for a 70 per cent stake in a private equity fund for the acquisition, while Trinity was to contribute 250 million US Dollars for a 30 per cent stake. UBS was to provide senior debt facilities for the transaction.\nJTS, which also claimed having been appointed ‘exclusive arranger of fund’, further said that the proposed ‘Sahara portfolio’ transaction was earlier pegged at 1.1 billion US Dollars, but later it was revised upwards to 1.5 billion US Dollars .\nInterestingly, Sahara group last month announced that it has reached a deal with another party, Reuben Brothers, for transfer of its existing debt from Bank of China on the three hotels — thus averting a ‘default-triggered’ sale of the iconic Grosvenor House hotel in London.\nThe Grosvenor House hotel was put on sale by its lender Bank of China earlier this year after a ‘technical default’.\nSahara Group has been trying to raise funds to secure release of its Chairman Subrata Roy, who has been lodged in Tihar Jail for over a year, through monetisation of its various assets, including the three overseas hotels that it had purchased between 2010 and 2012 for 1.55 billion US Dollars.\nThe group has been engaged in a legal battle with markets regulator Sebi for a long time over a case involving raising of funds from investors to the tune of over Rs 24,000 crore.\nSahara, however, claims it has already repaid 95 per cent of the investors money directly.\nFor Updates Check Company News ; follow us on Facebook and Twitter\nFirst Published on July 12, 2015 3:37 pm", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress", "http://twitter.com/financialxpress"], "published": "2015-07-12T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T23:36:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
