Not only are the countries both archipelagos with storied histories, but they also seem to share a high and growing appetite for debt.\nLooking at Greece&apos;s debt on a per-capita basis, however, paints a slightly less bleak picture. At the end of 2014 there was more than $35,000 of debt for every Greek citizen, according Eurostat, whereas in Japan it was about $79,000, Bloomberg calculations show. In the U.S., it reached about $56,600, based on data from the Treasury Department. With reference to the European countries, Greek citizens bear a public debt lower than their counterparts in Ireland, Belgium, Italy, Austria, the U.K. and France.\nThe IMF bent its own rules on debt sustainability in 2010 by approving a bailout of $38 billion for Greece. At the time, it was the biggest loan program in the history of the fund relative to a country&apos;s shares in the institution.\n Greece secured a second bailout of $36 billion in 2012. The country owes the IMF $26 billion from the funds it has drawn. The 2012 bailout expires in March.\nâ€” With Andrew Mayeda.", "external_links": ["http://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/z/luigi-zingales\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i5biJQb4FLe0/v1/460x260.png\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i1.wBUUGDmTM/v1/460x260.png\\", "http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2012-11-06/tokyo-sembra-atene-063652.shtml?uuid=AbR71Q0G\\", "http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2015/cr15186.pdf\\"], "published": "2015-07-17T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T10:12:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
