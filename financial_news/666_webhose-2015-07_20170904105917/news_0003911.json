The interim order came on a petition filed by the media group's companies challenging the central government's decision to bar it from participating from the auctions on the grounds they did not secure the security clearance from the union home ministry. The auctions for the FM licences are expected to start next week. The Sun TV group approached the court requesting it to stay the auctioning of airwaves and also allow the group companies to participate in the auction. According to Sun TV Network, the central government's decision is illegal, arbitrary and abuse of power. The petition said the reasons stated for denial of security clearance are relating to cases which are either in FIR stage or in the stage of chargesheet. Only a director of the company is allegedly involved in the case and the company is not a party.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T17:59:05.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
