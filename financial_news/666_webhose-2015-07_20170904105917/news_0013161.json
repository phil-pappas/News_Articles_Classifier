In 2014, this was down to 8.5 per cent, or 613 million people, living in 31 countries,\" Mr Basu said. \nKenya joined countries with annual incomes of $1,046 to $4,125 while its neighbour South Sudan fell out of the lower middle-income classification and back into low-income status, where average per capita incomes are $1,045 or less. \nThe newest independent nation in Africa has been bedevilled by civil wars that disrupted its income from the oil sector. \nRebasing factor \nEconomic Analyst Robert Shaw attributes the change to last year's rebasing and the stability experienced since then. \n\"We have been going through a much stable environment and with inflation surges not as big and, with a fairly good state of rainfall. This could explain the increased GNI but as you know with rebasing, Kenyans may hardy feel any impact immediately,\" Mr Shaw said. \nMalawi has the world's lowest reported GNI per capita at $250, while Monaco has the highest, at more than $100,000 - more than 400 times more per person on average than Malawi. \nNorway, one of the world's wealthiest countries, has seen its per capita income increase from $26,010 in 1990 to $103,050, an increase of $77,040 in 2014. \nOther countries who jumped the class ladder include Argentina, Hungary, Seychelles, and Venezuela who have now moved from the upper middle income category to high income, with average per capita income levels now of $12,736 or more. \nGross National Income (GNI) is a broad-based measure of income generated by a nation's residents from international and domestic activity. GNI per capita measures the average amount of resources available to persons residing in a given economy, and reflects the average economic well-being of a population.
