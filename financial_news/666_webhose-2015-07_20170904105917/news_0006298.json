But last week's rebellion cut his support to just 123 votes and any further defections may be seen as undermining prospects for reform.\nSome government officials have suggested that if support dropped below 120 MPs - the minimum required to win a confidence vote if parliament voted with the lowest allowable quorum of 240 lawmakers - Tsipras would have to resign.\nBut it is unclear whether he would step down. If a confidence vote were actually held, he would almost certainly win with the backing of the pro-European opposition parties.\nTsipras seen as competent\nDespite angering many Greeks by going on to ignore their 60% No vote at the 5 July referendum, Tsipras is still overwhelmingly regarded as competent. In an opinion poll published by the To Vima newspaper over the weekend, 68% named him the best man to be running the country right now, far ahead of any of his rivals.\nAnd even after the broken promises, many voters believe he acts honestly and with their interests at heart - a break with past leaders, they are perceived as corrupt and beholden to powerful interests.\n\"With the popularity that he enjoys, with his abrupt maturing over the past couple of weeks, Tsipras has the legitimacy to implement reforms as well as the need to prove that his turnaround was justified,\" Nikos Konstandaras, managing editor of Katherimini , wrote in an editorial last week.\n\"He will be under continual fire from his more revolutionary comrades in Syriza. However, if he keeps his head, if he avoids the arrogance of power, if he unites rather than divides, Alexis Tsipras will be in a position to serve his country well.\"\nPensions, tax on farmers\nFollowing last week's vote, European authorities released billions of euros in emergency funding to allow Athens to meet debt payment deadlines and reopen banks closed three weeks ago to prevent a run on deposits collapsing the system.\nOffering some encouragement, ratings agency Standard and Poor's lifted its long-term sovereign credit rating on Greece to 'CCC+' from 'CCC-', saying it believed default was no longer inevitable in the next six to 12 months following the move.\nIt said the chance of Greece leaving the eurozone was now less than 50%.\nWith normality slowly returning after the banks reopened on Monday (20 July), the government submitted the second bailout bill, which will focus on justice reform and banking issues.\nThe bill to be voted on today adopts into Greek law new European Union rules on propping up failed banks, decreed after the 2008 financial crisis and aimed at shielding taxpayers from the risk of having to bail out troubled lenders.\nThe so-called bank recovery and resolution directive (BRRD) imposes losses on shareholders and creditors of ailing lenders, in a process known as \"bail-in\", before any taxpayers' money can be tapped in a \"bail-out\" bank rescue.\nThe bailout bill also includes the adoption of new rules for the country's civil justice system, aimed at accelerating lengthy judicial processes and cutting costs.\nIt also deals with sensitive issues affecting forced home foreclosures, which banks have committed not to proceed with before the end of the year.\nHowever it will not include pension reforms curbing early retirement or increasing tax rates paid by farmers from 13% to a range of 26-33% - an issue strongly opposed by the conservative New Democracy party.\nInstead, they will be dealt with in coming weeks under a full bailout deal with European partners.\nThe fact that the measures were not included in the bill aroused some media speculation that Athens was backtracking on reform commitments.\nHowever, Deputy Agriculture Minister Vangelis Apostolou said legislation would be passed in August or September or even later, depending on discussions with the lenders.\nOfficials from the government and the lenders say neither early retirement reforms or tax increases for farmers were required to be included in the two packages of legislation to be passed by 15 July and 22 July.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/M--gqSWH3cI", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/GaqvbEhjEBQ"], "published": "2015-07-22T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T12:14:27.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
