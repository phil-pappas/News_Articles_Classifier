It's about the tone and the content\". \n\"That's what we need to focus on,\" Dijsselbloem said. \n\"We are going explore if there are any openings (towards a solution) in the time ahead,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T14:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T15:15:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
