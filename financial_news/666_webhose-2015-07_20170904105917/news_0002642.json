It’s true that those small savings can add up and provide a little more wiggle room in your budget. \nBut what about those necessary expenditures – the bills you have to pay each month? Chances are you’re paying a lot more for housing, food, utilities and insurance than occasional (or regular) treats. You’re recurring expenses likely consume the bulk of your budget. \nFortunately, there are plenty of ways to cut these costs. Here are 10 common bills you can reduce by $500 or more a month so you’ll have more cash to stash in a retirement account, save for emergencies or pay for those things you enjoy, like a latte.

Save Big on Groceries \nGrocery spending can take a big bite out of your monthly budget . A family of four spends up to an average of $1,300 a month on food at home, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture . One of the best ways to lower your grocery bill is to stock up on items that are nonperishable or can be frozen when they are on sale rather than buying just what you need for the week. “When shoppers buy only their weekly needs, they are forced to pay full price for 50 percent to 80 percent of what goes in their cart,” said Teri Gault , founder and CEO of TheGroceryGame.com . \nOnce you have a stockpile, you can plan weekly meals around what you have and perishable items that are on sale at the supermarket.

When you compare offers, pay attention to balance-transfer fees that might eliminate some of the savings you’ll get my moving your balance to a lower-rate card. CreditCards.com has a calculator that can help you figure out how much you can save by transferring your balance. 3.

Re-Shop Your Auto Insurance \nLoyalty doesn’t always pay when it comes to auto insurance. The J.D. Power 2015 U.S. Insurance Shopping Study found that consumers who shopped for better auto insurance rates and switched insurers saved an average of $388 on their annual premium. Auto-insurance comparison site The Zebra found that its customers save an average of $614 annually by switching carriers, said The Zebra Chief Operating Officer Joshua Dziabiak. \nBased on those figures, you could save about $32 to $51 a month by switching to a lower-rate auto insurance policy.

Lower Your Homeowners Insurance Premium \nRaising your homeowners insurance deductible from $500 to $1,000 could shave 25 percent off your premium, according to the Insurance Information Institute .

Slash Your Electric Bill \nYou can lower your heating and cooling costs by using a programmable thermostat to automatically adjust the temperature in your house when you’re away from home. In fact, proper use of a programmable thermostat can save about $180 a year — or $15 a month — in energy costs, according to the Environmental Protection Agency’s Energy Star program. Energy Star recommends using a thermostat’s pre-programmed energy-saving setpoints to get the most benefit. \nYou can reduce your bill more by identifying and unplugging energy vampires — devices such as cable TV boxes and DVD players that use electricity even when turned off. They can account for up to 20 percent of your electric bill, according to Duke Energy , the nation’s largest electric company. Since the federal Energy Information Administration figures the average monthly electric bill to be $111, you could save about $22 a month by unplugging all of your energy vampires. 9. Shrink Your Monthly Mortgage Payment by Refinancing \nIf the value of your home has risen since you bought it and interest rates have dropped since you locked in your mortgage rate, you might be able to lower your monthly mortgage payment by refinancing.

Stop Overpaying Uncle Sam \nIf you got a big tax refund this year — the average was about $3,000 — that means you’re letting Uncle Sam withhold too much from your paycheck each month. Sure, it’s nice to get a big check every spring, but you’d have more spending money each month if you adjusted your tax withholding so that you’re not overpaying the IRS. \nFile a new W-4 form with your employer to claim more allowances since the more you claim, the less tax that is withheld. IRS.gov has a withholding calculator you can use to figure out how many allowances to claim. If you received the average refund of $3,000, you should get an extra $250 in your paycheck each month by adjusting your withholding. \nShare This Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T22:21:44.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
