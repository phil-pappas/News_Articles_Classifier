REUTERS/Robert Galbraith Photo: Reuters\nFederal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen and her colleagues on the Fed's rate-setting committee kept the markets guessing on Thursday morning .\nThey didn't raise rates, as expected. They did tweak their language , as expected. But the hints they gave were not strong enough to dismiss either September or December as the launch date for the Fed's first rate hike in more than nine years.\nIt is clear from the fed's latest language however that a rate rise is not far away.\nSeptember and December are the key months because they are months when the Fed will also release new economic forecasts along with the interest rate decision it has taken, with Yellen explaining both the economic analysis and the rate decision in a subsequent press conference.\nIt is clear from the fed's latest language however that a rate rise is not far away. The Fed's description of America is more upbeat about jobs growth than it was following another fall in unemployment in June.\nIts description of what it needs to see before it lifts rates for the first time has also been subtly changed, from \"further improvement\" in the jobs market to \"some further improvement,\" a shift that suggests it thinks that condition is well on the way to being met.\nA comment in June that energy prices had stabilised was ditched in the latest statement - but that too was expected after a 20 per cent fall in the oil price since the Fed's previous meeting.\nFalling oil and commodity prices are pushing down on inflation in the US and keeping inflation so low that it make rate rises more difficult for the Fed to contemplate than they would be if inflation was a bit higher, but still in control.\nJob creation in the US economy has been the Fed's key milestone since unemployment soared to 10 per cent in 2009 during the global financial crisis, however, and progress has undoubtedly been made. Unemployment in June fell from 5.5 per cent to 5.3 per cent. It has averaged 5.8 per cent since 1948.\nThere are arguments for and against both September and December as the launch dates for the fed's interest rate rise programme. Suggestions that the Fed might wait even longer will probably fade after this latest statement, however.\nThe Fed is making it clear that it is preparing to bring the curtain down on the lowest debt costs and fixed interest returns in history.", "external_links": ["http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150729a.htm"], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T01:01:37.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
