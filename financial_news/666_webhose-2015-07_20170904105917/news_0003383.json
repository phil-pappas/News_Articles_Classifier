Paul Rovere by Lucille Keen A new model proposed to deal with overtime will make it easier for employees to take time off in lieu instead of being paid for the extra hours.\nAs part of the four-yearly review of the Modern Award, the full bench of the Fair Work Commission proposes a new model for employees to deal with overtime which will allow workers to receive an hour off for every hour of overtime worked.\nThe proposal will apply to 113 modern awards including the Banking, Finance and Insurance Award 2010, Black Coal Mining Industry Award 2010, Cleaning Services Award 2010, Real Estate Industry Award 2010, Restaurant Industry Award 2010 and the Hospitality Industry (General) Award 2010.\nBusiness groups such as the Australian Industry Group support the proposal and said the decision would allow many thousands of workers who do not currently have access to TOIL to reach agreement with their employer to take time off rather than being paid for overtime.\n\"The decision is a further important step in the right direction of freeing up the award system to remove barriers to employers and employees agreeing on workplace flexibilities of benefit to both parties,\" Australian Industry Group, chief executive, Innes Willox said.\nThe business group had recommended to the commission that a large number of employees value time off more than additional remuneration, particularly those employees with caring responsibilities and that it was up to them whether they opted for TOIL or payment.\n\"The model clause which the FWC has developed provides for one hour of time off for one hour of additional time worked (\"time for time\"),\" Mr Willox said.\nThe unions claim, which was to have the time off in lieu equivalent to the overtime penalty rate, was rejected.\n But the few awards which have existing TOIL clauses that provide \"time for penalty\" will not be varied to reduce employees' current entitlements but under the terms of the FWC's decision, over 90 per cent of awards will contain TOIL provisions with \"time for time\" arrangements.\"\nThe Australian Council of Trades Unions did not comment on the decision.\nâ€‹The Commission recommends an employer must not exert undue influence or undue pressure on an employee in relation to a decision by the employee to make, or not make, an agreement to take time off in lieu of payment for overtime.\nThe proposed model will see the employee and employer, within four weeks of the overtime being worked, agree on when the time off will be taken, otherwise payment for the overtime must be made to the employee at overtime rates in the first pay period after that four weeks.\nThe time off in lieu of overtime must be taken within 12 weeks of the overtime being worked.\nA separate written agreement must be made by the employee and employer for each occasion on which overtime that has been worked is to be taken as time off in lieu.\nParties have until August 28 to make submissions and a hearing will be held on September 4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T08:17:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
