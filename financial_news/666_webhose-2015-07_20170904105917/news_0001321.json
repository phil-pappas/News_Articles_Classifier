Here's what to look out for \n= Economy = \nPhrase to watch out for: Normal times \nIt may be just three months since Mr Osborne delivered his last Budget , but the Chancellor will want to make his mark on Wednesday. \nThe biggest fiscal promise since the election is his pledge to run a budget surplus in \"normal times\" to \"bear down on debt and prepare for an uncertain future\". \nMr Osborne will look to define exactly what this means. But history suggests that running budget surpluses has been the exception rather than the rule. Robert Chote, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog, has described the goal as \"ambitious\", while the OBR's projections suggest the government will post just five years of surpluses from 2018-19 under current plans, and that's assuming the economy doesn't suffer a hiccup over the next decade. \nLast month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revised up its estimate for GDP growth in 2014 to 3pc , from 2.8pc. But this year's growth projection is expected to remain unchanged, at 2.5pc, given the heightened risks from Greece. \nBritain's borrowing bill is also expected to fall faster than the OBR expected in March. Economists think it will revise down its estimate of public borrowing for the year from its current projection of £75.3bn. While consensus estimates suggest the revision will be about £2bn, Michael Saunders, UK economist at Citi, believes stronger tax receipts means borrowing for the year could fall to £60bn. \nGilt rates have risen slightly since March, which will push up Britain's debt interest bill. Under current projections, the UK is expected to spend £46bn on gross debt interest payments this year, climbing above £50bn in 2016-17. \n= Taxes and spending = \nPhrase to watch out for: Tax lock \nMr Osborne has dug himself into a hole with his pledge to introduce a five-year \"tax lock\". \nA manifesto commitment not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT, or even to change which items VAT is levied on, means there's little room for manoeuvre. \nTogether these account for around two thirds of tax revenues. \nWhat's more, Mr Osborne has already outlined a number of giveaways. \nThe Conservative manifesto pledged to raise the personal allowance to £12,500 by 2020 . And the transferrable marriage allowance is likely to rise in line with it. \nThe threshold for paying the 40pc higher rate of income tax is also due to increase from £42,385 to £50,000 by 2020. The Chancellor is expected to speed up the timetable for this on Wednesday. \nAlongside that, the Government has promised to ensure that no one working 30 hours a week for the national minimum wage will pay income tax. \nWhile the Government is expected to cut pension tax relief, this will be used to a fund an inheritance tax break. The Chancellor is set to increase the tax threshold to £1m for couples from 2017. \nFiscal rectitude has been the theme of Mr Osborne's previous Budgets, and the Chancellor will want to continue this message. \nHistorically, the first Budget after an election is when chancellors introduce the biggest tax hikes. Cynics might say that chancellors hope that voters will have forgotten about any tax grabs by the time the next election rolls around, if they're done early enough. \nSome savings will come from a £12bn cut to the welfare bill, mainly from cuts to tax credits, housing benefits and a lower welfare cap, which will be reduced from £26,000 to £20,000 outside London . \nThe BBC will also be required to make cuts to its own budget, and take on board the annual £650m bill for providing the over-75s with free TV licences . \nThere are some areas where Mr Osborne can still hike taxes. David Kilshaw, a partner at EY, said: \"We are likely to see changes to capital gains tax (CGT). \n\"In 2010, George Osborne increased CGT from 18pc to 28pc but not, as many feared, to 40pc.\" \nSome 340,000 local authority and housing association tenants on incomes of £40,000 or more in London and £30,000 in the rest of England will be told that from 2017-18 they will have to pay a market, or near market, rent. \n= Business = \nPhrase to watch out for: Investment \nThe Chancellor made cutting corporation tax a cornerstone of the last Parliament, and he's unlikely to look for revenues by reversing this. \nHe is planning to complete a business rates review by the end of 2015, and increase the annual investment allowance to \"significantly more\" than £25,000. \nThe bank levy remains a thorn in the side of the industry, although its cash cow status means Mr Osborne may not take steps to change it. \nA shake-up of Sunday trading laws is expected to be announced in the Budget. The laws were relaxed for six weeks during the 2012 London Olympics. Mr Osborne wants shops to be able to stay open for longer permanently. Reaction so far to the proposal has been mixed. \nWhile research by Visa (Xetra: A0NC7B - news ) shows face-to-face spending on a Sunday has grown by 35pc in the past five years significantly higher than any other day of the week - there are likely to be winners and losers from the overhaul. \nEvidence from 2012 shows convenience stores saw the most significant negative impact from the temporary relaxation, as large supermarkets took sales away from smaller shops. \nLarge stores enjoyed a 2pc year-on-year rise in sales during the month of July 2012, but sales for smaller stores fell 4.5pc, according to official data.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T02:28:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
