Flight tests resumed this week with Pratt & Whitney engines, following a recent technical halt.\nAirbus plans to decide by end-year whether to further increase production of its A320 medium-haul family, the source of most of its cash for other projects.\n\"The momentum of commercial aircraft is still clearly there,\" Enders told analysts.\nAlso lifting sentiment was an improvement in the company's currency hedging book that has seen it unable to benefit significantly from a strong dollar until about 2018.\nAlexander Hauenstein of DZ Bank said the results supported growing confidence for the rest of the year, but noted that \"a seasonally uptick in H2 earnings is necessary\".\nAirbus Group shrugged off difficulties in the oil and gas sector noted by rival helicopter makers as revenue at the company's helicopter unit rose 5 percent in the first half.\nAirbus Group booked a 748 million euro gain from the sale of an 18.75 percent stake in Dassault Aviation and said it would sell its remaining 23.4 percent by the end of 2016.\n($1 = 0.9136 euros)\n(Editing by James Regan and Jason Neely )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:50:24.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
