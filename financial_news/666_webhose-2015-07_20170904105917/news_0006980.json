While spot gold plunged 16 percent in the past year, the metal’s price in Australian-dollar terms has risen about 8 percent.\nThat’s helped the S&P/ASX All Ordinaries Gold Index of 21 Australian miners gain 12 percent this year, as the benchmark Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold and Silver Index slumped 31 percent.\nSuppliers in Australia, the second-largest producing nation , benefit by selling the metal in U.S. dollars while their costs and profits are mostly denominated in the weaker local currency. The Aussie fell this month to a six-year low.\n“A weak Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar powerfully expands Aussie miner margins,” William Kaye, the Hong Kong-based owner of The Pacific Group Ltd. and chief investment officer of its Greater Asian hedge fund, said in an e-mailed response to questions. This would make Australian miners attractive to investors, he said.\nNewcrest Mining Ltd., Australia’s largest producer, said Thursday its margin increased 13 percent in the year through June as it raised output.\nLooking for Winners Investors looking for winners amid price declines will be noting gains by producers including Northern Star Resources Ltd. and Evolution Mining Ltd., Kaye said.\nBoth producers have made recent acquisitions of mines in Australia, extending their exposure to the falling local currency and adding to their appeal for global investors, RBC Capital Markets said in a July 8 note.\n“We recognize Australian gold stocks as a preferred position amongst the volatility in the global markets,” RBC analysts led by Melbourne-based Paul Hissey said.\nAustralian gold producers are offering “the bright light,” amid the wider rout in commodities, according to Jake Klein, Evolution Mining’s executive chairman. The producer is the best performer this year among 33 Australian energy and raw materials producers, including BHP Billiton Ltd. and Woodside Petroleum Ltd.\nInvestors may remain wary amid weaker bullion prices, according to Justin Smirk, a Sydney-based senior economist at Westpac Banking Corp. “There’s no guarantee that you’ll get a movement in the Aussie dollar that will match the movement of the rise or fall in the gold price.”\nThe Australian dollar was unchanged at 73.56 U.S. cents at 8:24 a.m. in Sydney. The Australian gold index closed 2.6 percent higher at Thursday’s close, as the Philadelphia index fell 4.7 percent.\nFor investors who back the Australian currency to continue to decline, gold producers present an opportunity, Klein said.\n“We are effectively an Australian dollar hedge,” he said. “If you think the Australian dollar is going down, then buying gold stocks in Australia is the thing to do.”", "external_links": ["http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/gold/mcs-2015-gold.pdf\\"], "published": "2015-07-24T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T02:33:54.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
