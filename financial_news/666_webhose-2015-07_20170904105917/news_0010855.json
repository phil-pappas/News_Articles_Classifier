Wayne Taylor by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Redcape Hotel Group is aiming to raise capital for its coming initial public offering this side of reporting season, with analyst research expected to hit fundies' desks as early as this week.\nRedcape, which owns several pubs across NSW and Queensland, has drawn a positive response from investors over the past two weeks during a non-deal roadshow.\nIt means the company and its advisers, UBS and JPMorgan, are expected to launch a bookbuild next month, ahead of August reporting season when fundies are focused on companies' earnings results.\nRedcape, worth about $680 million, is controlled by US hedge funds York Capital and Varde Partners.\nSources said the company is expected to generate earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $62 million in fiscal year 2016. Varde and York could retain as much as 20 per cent each of the listed entity.\nRedcape is one of 41 companies said to be in the IPO pipeline, in a UBS document sent to clients last week. The document said the information was based on \"media speculation.\"\nASIC Registry a potential float Interestingly, the chart nominates ASIC Registry as a potential float.\n The Department of Finance opened its registrations of interest period on Monday for the privatisation, which had widely been seen as a trade sale.\nBut Street Talk understands investment banks have not given up hope of ASIC Registry being the next chunky government IPO. A bank could submit an IPO proposal as a registration of interest.\nThe federal government has a long history of going down the public market route, with examples including Medibank Private, Telstra and Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\nBut ASIC Registry is a different proposition to these companies.\nThe government is seeking a private sector investor to re-process and re-engineer its IT systems and improve website functionality. It could be difficult to price the risk and opportunity associated with these points through an IPO.\nThe first round will be followed by an expressions of interest period, which would kick off a bidding process for trade buyers.\nFinally, as foreshadowed by Street Talk Online , Murray Goulburn's float was priced at the bottom of the range at $2.10 per unit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T00:10:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
