I deeply appreciate my fans who have provided us with pertinent information and continue to do so regarding leaks of my music. Like any citizen, I have the right to privacy,” said Madonna, after court’s verdict.\n“Rebel Heart” was officially released on March 6, 2015.\n 11, 2015 8:38 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T04:19:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
