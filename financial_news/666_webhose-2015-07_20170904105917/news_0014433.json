Certainly. Even a number of economists, including two Nobel Prize winners, who have urged debt relief and a grace period , including greatly improved tax collection and control of corruption, have said as much.\nAs the story of Greece, the EU, the European Central Bank, and the IMF IMF continues to play out, though, there is something familiar. The Greek squeeze sound suspiciously like a long-standing financial mechanism: Those that have money put the screws to those who don’t but find themselves in need.\nA “Evzones” presidential guard marches past a campaign poster reading “NAI” or “yes”, in support of the European Union (EU), in Athens, Greece, on Saturday, July 4, 2015. Greek and European leaders dug into their positions before the country’s referendum on Sunday, as polls showed the outcome is impossible to predict and what happens next even more uncertain.

Or it might be the usurious interest rates charged to those who need credit — like the sub-prime mortgage rates that ensured so many people would default in the housing meltdown. Whatever the variation, driving it is a philosophy of milking the poor.\nThe two-part reasoning is the same that is at work around Greece right now. First, those in trouble were responsible for getting themselves into a jam, so they need to be taught a lesson. Second, the solution has to cover the greater risk for the lenders, even though the high rates help greatly boost those risks. As a result, the poor get put into a position where most will never be able to emerge. They won’t have the money for more education, for making the investments up front that will save them money, for taking proper care of health to avoid major sickness down the road — or for growing their economies, keeping people in work, and taking care of necessary infrastructure.\nIn the case of Greece, even the IMF has had to concede that the current approach is unworkable. The organization that helped put the thumbscrews to the country says that Greece needs an additional 50 million euros in aid over the next three years and also must have debt relief because the years of austerity have left its economy incapable of continuing the debt service demanded by some European countries and their bankers.\nBut, according to Reuters, some EU countries tried to keep the IMF from publishing its report, coming just days before today’s Greek referendum on whether to accept EU demands to extend help. Reuters claimed that an EU source said, “We are not living in an ivory tower here. But the EU has to understand that not everything can be decided based on their own imperatives.”\nYes, the EU had provided help to Greece, but under heavy demands that, according to Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz , were the reason for “25% unemployment, a 22% fall in GDP since 2009, and a 35% increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio.”\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/03/us-eurozone-greece-imf-idUSKCN0PD20120150703", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/37719892/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/greece-eurozone-austerity-reform-by-joseph-e--stiglitz-2015-02", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/639cf9b0-a1a0-11e4-bd03-00144feab7de.html"], "published": "2015-07-05T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T03:38:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
