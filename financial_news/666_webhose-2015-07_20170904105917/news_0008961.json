It is expected to be in operation by 2021. \nThe companies awarded contracts are Italian cable supplier Prysmian, French cable supplier Nexans and power technology company ABB (NYSE: ABB - news ) , which will deliver the convertor stations. \nThe estimated cost of the project is between 1.5 billion euros and 2 billion euros, shared jointly by Norwegian transmission system operator Statnett and National Grid. \nThe link is aimed at providing additional electricity transmission capacity and it could help bring down electricity prices in both countries, National Grid and Statnett have said previously. \n\"The benefits to both UK and Norway are also huge and when completed the link will deliver low carbon electricity for the UK and also add to security of supply for Norwegian consumers,\" Alan Foster, National Grid's director of European business development, said in a statement on Tuesday. \n($1 = 0.9111 euros) (Reporting by Nina Chestney; Editing by Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T10:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T11:10:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
