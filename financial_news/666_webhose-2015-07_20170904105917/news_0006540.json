Luis Ascui by Ewin Hannan Workplace editor Employment Minister Eric Abetz blasted Queensland builders as \"pathetic\" and accused them of selling out by preparing to cave in to pay demands from the \"corrupt\" construction union.\nSenator Abetz reacted with fury on Friday after The Australian Financial Review revealed that members of the Master Builders in Queensland plan to accept a four-year pay deal delivering 20 per cent in pay rises with zero productivity.\nThe proposed agreement contains an extraordinary clause permitting workers to take paid, four-hour stoppages to participate in \"union activities\", increasing the capacity for major disruption of building sites.\nSenator Abetz attacked comments by Grant Galvin, executive director of Master Builders' Queensland division, who said the cost of not agreeing initially to the union demands but then capitulating was too great.\n'Consumer the victim' \"The reported public commentary from the Queensland MBA is quite frankly pathetic,\" Senator Abetz said. \"I am sure MBA members around Australia will view this sell-out to the corrupt CFMEU with horror.\"\nHe said consumers would be the victims if building employers capitulated to the \"excessive and unconscionable demands of the CFMEU in Queensland\".\n\"Every time costs go up the builders charge the owner more, who in turn charges more rent, which finds its way into higher costs for goods and services used by the public. The consumer is the victim, plain and simple,\" he said.\n \"That is why the Queensland building industry has a duty to refuse to co-operate with the excessive demands being made.\n\"If the sector is too weak-kneed to do what they know to be right, they will get little sympathy from the public when they face the inevitable destructive consequences of this failure of fortitude.\"\nNew construction code needed Mr Galvin said on Friday that the failure of the Abbott government to get the Senate to approve a new national construction code and building watchdog left builders vulnerable to union demands.\n\"The failure to have the building legislation passed through the Senate has left contractors completely exposed to unrealistic demands and unlawful conduct of building unions,\" he said.\n\"The complete failure of the rule of law to rein in unlawful conduct has left commercial builders with little choice other than to concede to the union's demands. The costs of disruption are between $20,000 and $30,000 per day and no builder can resist the union's demands under those circumstances.\"\nMaster Builders Australia chief executive Wilhelm Harnisch said on Friday that the reckless tactics of the union in Queensland showed why the crossbench senators needed to pass the laws.\n\"The Queensland pattern agreement is, like all pattern agreements, making a travesty of the current workplace relations system,\" he said.\n\"While the provision that permits paid, two-hour meetings virtually at the whim of the CFMEU may or may not be a permitted matter for inclusion in enterprise agreements under the Fair Work Act, it has appeared in now hundreds of pattern agreements in Queensland and is a central element of the new pattern agreement,\" he said.\nDave Noonan, the national secretary of the union's construction division, said on Friday that the comments by Senator Abetz showed he had an \"extremist ideology\" and was completely out of touch with the construction industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:07:35.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
