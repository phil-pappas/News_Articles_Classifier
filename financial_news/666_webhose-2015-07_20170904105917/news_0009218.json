As of 16:00 BST, the FTSE 250 was trading flat at 17,743. \nAldermore Group (LSE: ALD.L - news ) topped the risers on news that the Bank of England may raise interest rates by the end of the year. \nBwin.party Digital Entertainment was on the up as online gambling group 888 Holdings agreed to buy the stock in a cash and stock deal worth around Â£898.3m, beating a rival offer from GVC. \nBwin shareholders will receive 39.45p and 0.404 new 888 shares for each share they own. \nThe offer represents a value of around 104.9p per Bwin share, which is a premium of approximately 16.4% cent to the closing price of Bwin on 14 May, which is the last business day before Bwin announced talks about a possible tie-up. \nSector peer Betfair was also higher on the news. \nOcado topped the fallers following a downgrade from analysts at UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) . The bank said it was supportive of the online grocery store's business model but the delay in announcing a new partner did not help validate the model. \n\"Deriving fair value on stock like Ocado with little in the way of short-term cash flow, profit or obvious global peers is more art than science,\" analyst Andrew Gwynn said. \nRestaurant Group (LSE: RTN.L - news ) was also hit by negative broker sentiment, with the Frankie & Benny's and Chiquito's owner downgraded to 'hold' from 'buy' by broker Nomura . \nMiners Polymetal International and Acacia Mining (Other OTC: ABGLF - news ) were trading in the red as metal prices continued to decline across the board. \nMeanwhile falling oil prices took their toll of Premier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) and Ophir Energy (Other OTC: OPGYF - news ) . \nRisers Aldermore Group (ALD) 261.30p +5.79% Jimmy Choo (LSE: CHOO.L - news ) (CHOO) 166.00p +3.88% Just Eat (Other OTC: JSTLF - news ) (JE.) 439.50p +2.93% Betfair Group (LSE: BET.L - news ) (BET) 2,580.00p +2.14% Fidelity China Special Situations (FCSS) 143.40p +2.06% Foxtons Group (LSE: FOXT.L - news ) (FOXT) 232.80p +1.88% SSP Group (LSE: SSPG.L - news ) (SSPG) 306.30p +1.86% Tullett Prebon (LSE: TLPR.L - news ) (TLPR) 397.80p +1.74% Britvic (BVIC) 739.50p +1.72% Savills (SVS) 981.50p +1.71% Fallers Ocado Group (Other OTC: OCDGF - news ) (OCDO) 434.70p -6.52% Polymetal International (Other OTC: AUCOY - news ) (POLY) 479.40p -3.93% Acacia Mining (ACA) 275.10p -3.51% Nostrum Oil & Gas (LSE: NOG.L - news ) (NOG) 569.00p -3.40% Restaurant Group (RTN) 667.00p -2.91% Supergroup (Stuttgart: 49S.SG - news ) (SGP) 1,333.00p -2.84% Premier Oil (PMO) 143.40p -2.52% Bovis Homes Group (BVS) 1,107.00p -2.47% Halfords Group (LSE: HFD.L - news ) (HFD) 535.00p -2.46% Bellway (BWY) 2,288.00p -2.22%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:07:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
