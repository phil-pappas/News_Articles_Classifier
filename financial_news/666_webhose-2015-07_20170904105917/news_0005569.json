Steven Siewert Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Prime Minister Tony Abbott is refusing growing calls to sack embattled federal speaker Bronwyn Bishop over an expenses scandal that government ministers complain is overshadowing their own agenda.\nSources said Mr Abbott would not move against Ms Bishop, now under investigation by the finance department for a $5200 helicopter flight and two other charter flights she has admitted could have been for party political events.\nThe refusal to sanction the speaker came as Opposition Leader Bill Shorten declared the expenses scandal a test of the Prime Minister's leadership .\n\"Does Mr Abbott have the character to tell Bronwyn Bishop to stand aside?\" Mr Shorten said. \"He knows – and the world knows – that this arrogant misuse of taxpayer funds needs to be held to account.\n\"He can't dismiss this, as he apparently has, as village gossip ... Mr Abbott's Liberals are addicted to privilege.\"\nMr Abbott's office on Sunday pointed media to the Prime Minister's comments a day earlier in regional Queensland, where he said of the case: \"Obviously there's understandable excitement about it but as I said, Bronwyn, she has done the right thing, she is a good speaker, she has my confidence.\"\nRefusal to apologise However, Mr Abbott made the remarks ahead of a lengthy press conference held by Mrs Bishop, during which she refused to say sorry for the scandal , saying her decision to refund the money was apology enough.\n Many within the government are enraged at Mrs Bishop's failure to show contrition for the helicopter flight, which has badly blunted the Coalition's attempts to justify its own public spending cuts as being about ending the \"age of entitlement\" and of encouraging \"lifters\" rather than \"leaners\".\nTreasurer Joe Hockey, the first government minister to publicly question last week Mrs Bishop's use of taxpayers' money for the flight, declined to respond on Sunday to a barb from the speaker.\nMrs Bishop added fuel to the fire on Saturday when she said the Treasurer \"says funny things sometimes … I think he said poor people don't drive cars or something\".\nAsked to respond, Mr Hockey noted that since questioning Ms Bishop's judgment in a radio interview – during which he described the helicopter flight as failing the \"sniff test\" –the speaker had acknowledged her \"error of judgment, paid the money and is co-operating with the department of finance\".\n\"That's all happened since I had that interview with 2UE,\" he told Channel Ten.\nMr Hockey said he hadn't \"heard of anyone who has taken a helicopter to a fundraising event\".\nMedia focus He also lamented that the issue had \"sucked up too much oxygen over the last few days. We need to get on with the issues that matter to people\".\nThe luxury spending scandal dominated media headlines over the weekend, overshadowing the government's attempts to spruik its proposed northern Australia agriculture reforms, and attacks on Labor's mooted carbon trading scheme.\nFormer Coalition treasurer Peter Costello and Liberal Party leader John Hewson were among those questioning the speaker's actions.\nMr Hewson, who was leader when Ms Bishop was a senator, said she set a pretty tough standard in those days for accountability and transparency, but is \"ducking and weaving\" now that the same standards are being applied to her.\n\"It's amazing how history bites you in the bum,\" he told Sky News on Sunday.\nHe said the Prime Minister needs to \"nip it in the bud, it's just going to run hard against him\".\n\"The fact that she's just obfuscating rather than addressing the substance of the issue, as is he, is unsustainable.\"\nFormer Labor trade minister Craig Emerson asked what other revelation the Prime Minister needed to understand the seriousness of this issue.\n\"Tony Abbott can never again credibly argue ... that people at the lower end should have their benefits cut, when Bronwyn Bishop at the top end is protected,\" he told Sky News.\nCall for resignation NSW opposition leader Luke Foley also said Mrs Bishop should resign, particularly given her history of grilling public servants on wasteful expenditure.\n\"What message does it send to the public if she keeps her job after the revelations?\" Mr Foley said on Sky News on Sunday.\nEarlier, Environment Minister Greg Hunt said criticism by Labor's Pat Conroy of the AFP for not taking on the case was \"bordering on a directive\" to the police.\n\"No member of Parliament should try influence the conduct or course of any inquiry,\" Mr Hunt told the ABC.\nBut Mr Shorten defended Mr Conroy's right to refer the matter to the police, and their independence.\n\"We recognise that the AFP is independent and they will make their own decisions ... and that's as it should be. We should never forget that when Mr Abbott and his team were in opposition they were writing to the AFP on all sorts of matters.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-07-19T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T11:03:41.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
