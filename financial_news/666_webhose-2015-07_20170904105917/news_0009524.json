S&P already cut Chicago’s rating earlier this month to BBB+, or three levels above junk.\nThe Illinois Constitution bars the diminishing of public pensions, state court judge Rita Novak ruled Friday. The Illinois Supreme Court in May killed similar changes to the state’s pension funds.\nRejection of the state plan led within a week to a downgrade of Chicago credit to junk status. Chicago’s pensions will be broke in about 10 years without the plan, city lawyers argued before the ruling.\nThe city’s pension plan and the one covering state workers both envisioned cuts in future cost-of-living increases. Chicago argued that its plan was different from the state’s because it increased city funding of pension funds and the Illinois measure only reduced benefits.\nNovak rejected the city’s arguments.\nThe state constitution “affords the participant protection against” cuts in benefits even if the general assembly changes the pension code, the judge wrote in her 35-page ruling.\nThe city reform was developed in negotiations with 28 of 31 affected unions, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in May. The employees had a “full funding guarantee,” the city said.\nJob Cuts Chicago’s public school system is eliminating 1,400 jobs. Illinois’s retirement fund has a $111 billion shortfall. And the state is operating without a budget because of stalemate between Republican Governor Bruce Rauner and the Legislature’s Democratic leadership.\nThe pension system in Chicago is $20 billion short and is only 36 percent funded, compared with 61 percent in 2005.\nChicago’s measure, signed into law last year, restructured the pensions of laborers and municipal workers, requiring employees and the city to pay more into the plan while benefits are reduced. The pension plans for fire and police retirees weren’t affected.\nUnion-backed beneficiaries sued on behalf of retirees and employees to block the reform.\nThe case is Jones v. Municipal Employees Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago, 2014CH20027, Circuit Court, Cook County, Illinois, Chancery Division (Chicago).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T19:31:14.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
