Louie Douvis by Jonathan Porter Get hazy notions of the relative leadership merits of Gen X versus Gen Y out of your mind.\nThe coming generation of the nation's corporate leadership can either cope with the next tech revolution – or they can't.\nThis revolution – which our top human resources philosophers believe will be as big as the internet and industrial revolutions combined – will be led by artificial intelligence and social media and it will change the way all of our firms are managed and how they interact with the marketplace.\nManaging partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers' People Business Jon Williams says it is generally accepted that AI will make many jobs obsolete over the next half-decade, if not much sooner.\nOne of three receptionist robots at a new hotel, aptly called Henn na Hotel or Weird Hotel, in Sasebo, southwestern Japan. AP It's not just Google cars throwing millions of cabbies and delivery men out of work, although that's coming too. Doctors, lawyers and accountants will also be under threat and leaders will need to be groomed to manage the new corporate landscape.\nWilliams suggests the new leaders will not necessarily have spent decades clawing up the corporate ladder and they will be managing drastically attenuated workforces, consisting mainly of contractors who might or might not live in the same country.\n\"It's not a Gen X and Y thing. I'm less fazed about that than the entire corporate landscape changing,\" Williams says.\nCompletely different \"The world of business in five years' time is going to be completely different. The way people go about leading businesses is going to have to change.\n\"So it might take a new generation of people to come in come in and do it differently to be successful.\"\nThe challenge with the existing leadership is they might value the vanished jobs and they might be too hidebound and wedded to the old ways, he says.\n\"The people who are there now will want to do things the way they always have, the way their mentors taught them, the way they were themselves successful. That's just human nature.\n\"The way people are going to have to go about leading businesses is completely different to how they go about it now. It will be forced by commercial pressure and we need a new generation to come through and lead it.\"\nBusinesses will still need top specialists, he says.\n\"You need the top leaders to make the tough decisions, but you won't need these people at the bottom doing the grunt work.\"\nAnother challenge Which will create another challenge: getting leaders when you haven't got flesh-and-blood people coming up through the ranks.\n\"How do you bring through a new generation and educate them and give them the skills to lead is the real challenge.\"\nAll this is happening at a time when people are going to need to work longer and need second or third careers, he says.\n\"How do we get new leaders who are going to be able to engage with them in an effective way and use their skills?\n\"Right now society is not madly accepting of people stopping midway and starting a new career.\n\"People say, 'Why did you stop when you were on an upward path? Did you fail?'\n\"We need new leaders who can say, 'That's great. We've got you, now we need you to mentor and shape and guide and help to build new things.'\"\nWho are these people who will be stepping into these immeasurably important roles?\n\"Anyone who has grown up with a computer and a mobile phone and access to the internet,\" he says.\n\"There are 50-year-olds who are way more flexible in technology than a lot of 20-year-olds at an individual level.\n\"Generationally, though, there are these people who are between 15 and 35 who are going to need to lead this country as it goes through this massive change and it's going to be interesting to see if they have the skills to do it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:12:27.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
