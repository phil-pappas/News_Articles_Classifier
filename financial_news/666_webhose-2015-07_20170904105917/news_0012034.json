The new debt will be senior to the second-lien term loan, the people said. The group also is considering investing fresh capital into the company, said one of the people.\nThe senior lenders, meanwhile, have been working on an alternative that would hand them control of the company in a court restructuring while leaving little for lower-ranking investors. Under their plan, the lenders would swap debt for equity, which would leave junior creditors without much to recover.\nPreserve Value The competing offers are designed to preserve the most value in each group’s investments. The unsecured holders were the first to start negotiating, but those talks stalled, the people said. Both sides resumed the discussions in recent weeks after the senior lender group made an alternate proposal last month, the people said.\nThe unsecured bondholders signed confidentiality agreements within the last few weeks that allowed them to negotiate directly with the company, the people said.\nJefferies Group LLC and Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz have been hired to advise the unsecured lender group, which holds Samson’s $2.25 billion of 9.75 percent senior unsecured notes that mature in February 2020, said the people.\nRepresentatives of Samson, Blackstone, Oaktree and Jefferies declined to comment. Representatives for Centerbridge and Wachtell Lipton didn’t respond to e-mails and phone calls seeking comment.\nSamson produces oil and natural gas from shale formations. Its ability to service debt has plunged with the slump in energy prices that began a year ago. The company was bought by KKR in 2011 in a $7.2 billion leveraged buyout. It’s being advised by Kirkland & Ellis and Blackstone’s advisory unit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T02:56:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
