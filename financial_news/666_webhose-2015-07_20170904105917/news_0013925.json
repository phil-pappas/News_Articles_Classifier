Photo: AP\nFederal Reserve policy makers said the labour market and housing have improved, moving closer to ending an unprecedented period of near-zero interest rates without providing a clear signal on the timing of liftoff.\n\"The labour market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment,\" the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement Wednesday in Washington. It said that \"underutilisation of labour resources has diminished,\" dropping to modifier \"somewhat\" to describe the change.\nChair Janet Yellen is guiding the Fed toward its first rate increase in almost a decade as the nation approaches full employment. She has said the Fed is likely to tighten this year if the economy continues to improve as she expects, with market speculation focused on a move as soon as September.\n\"The housing sector has shown additional improvement,\" the Fed said. \"Business fixed investment and net exports stayed soft.\" It dropped language saying energy prices appeared to have stabilised.\nIt said that it will tighten policy when it sees \"some further improvement in the labour market\", adding the modifier \"some\", and is \"reasonably confident\" inflation will move back to its 2 per cent goal over the medium term.\nThe committee has kept the benchmark overnight federal funds rate at a record low of zero to 0.25 per cent since December 2008, in the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression.\nThe committee kept its description of the risks to the outlook for the economy and labour market as \"nearly balanced\".\nThe decision was unanimous.\nEconomists surveyed last week said the odds of a rate increase at this meeting were virtually zero, while the chance of move in September was around 50 per cent.\nWith policy makers saying their decisions are \"data dependent\", the focus turns to figures on gross domestic product, jobs and inflation that will help determine whether the Fed raises rates in September or later.\nA report on Thursday is projected to show the economy expanded at a 2.5 per cent annual pace in the second quarter. That would confirm Yellen's view that a first-quarter contraction was largely a result of transitory conditions such as severe winter weather and a labor dispute at West Coast ports.\nThe FOMC is next scheduled to gather on September 16-17, with additional meetings this year set for October and December.\nTraders are pricing in a 40 per cent probability that the Fed raises rates at or before the September meeting, based on the assumption that the effective fed funds rate will average 0.375 per cent after liftoff.\nThe median estimate of the 22 primary dealers surveyed by the New York Fed is that the fed funds rate will average slightly less, or 0.35 per cent, after the first increase.\nBloomberg", "external_links": ["http://links.govdelivery.com/track?type=click&enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTUwNzI5LjQ3NjQzNzMxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE1MDcyOS40NzY0MzczMSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3NTE5Mjk0JmVtYWlsaWQ9dGltb3RoeWpvaG5tb29yZUBnbWFpbC5jb20mdXNlcmlkPXRpbW90aHlqb2hubW9vcmVAZ21haWwuY29tJmZsPSZleHRyYT1NdWx0aXZhcmlhdGVJZD0mJiY=&&&100&&&http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150729a.htm"], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T08:03:22.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
