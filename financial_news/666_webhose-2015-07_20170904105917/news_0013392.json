He released the 600-page report on June 25, after a lengthy battle to have the report released. \nThe report's recommendations included that an inquiry be held on the fitness of National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega and North West Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Zukiswa Mbombo to hold office, and that the killings and assaults be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for further investigation. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T17:52:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
