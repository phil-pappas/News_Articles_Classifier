Near-term support is at 0.7680, the 14.6% Fibonacci retracement, with a break below that on a daily closing basis exposing the 0.7559-97 area (triple bottom, June 1 low). Alternatively, a move above the 23.6% Fib at 0.7731 opens the door for a challenge of the 0.7813-18 area (38.2% retracement, June 3 high). Prices are wedged too closely between near-term support and resistance levels to justify taking a trade on a long or short side from a risk/reward perspective. With that in mind, we will continue to stand aside until a more attractive opportunity presents itself.
