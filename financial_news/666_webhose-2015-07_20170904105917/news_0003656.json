(ESMA has indicated (in separate announcements) that the remaining standards will be delivered in September and December 2015). \nThe Report, which is more than 130 pages, sets out feedback to the consultation, describes any material changes to the technical standards (or confirms that there have been no material changes) and explains the reasons for those changes. \nRTS 5 (information to be provided for the registration of non-EU investment firms with ESMA) and RTS 6 (information exchanged between regulatory authorities) and discussions in the Report in connection with the making of an equivalence decision regarding the regulatory status and supervision of non-EU investment firms by their non-EU regulators will be of interest to many non-EU firms who wish to operate in the European Union. This is because MiFIR offers the possibility for non-EU firms to provide investment services or perform investment activities throughout the European Union upon registration with ESMA––though this will be contingent upon an equivalence decision being made regarding specific non-EU countries and their supervision of investment firms. Some other EU directives and regulations also stipulate that access to the European market may be granted to non-EU firms upon the making of an equivalence decision (notably, the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)), though the equivalence decision-making process has not been smooth and it remains to be seen how possible it will be for non-EU investment firms to be able to register with ESMA. To date, under EMIR, there has not been any decision made regarding the “equivalence” of the United States and this remains very much an open issue. \nThe Report (and the draft ITS and RTS) have also been submitted to the Commission, which now has three months to decide whether or not to endorse ESMA’s technical standards. If the Commission does endorse the technical standards, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union will then have a further three months to scrutinize them. It is anticipated that the ITS and RTS should be finalized in December 2015 or in the first calendar quarter of 2016, giving EU national regulatory authorities either one year or nine months to implement the standards into national law ahead of the January 3, 2017 MiFID II and MiFIR “go live” date when market participants will be required to comply with the new rules and MiFID I is superseded. \nThe Report is available online here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T22:04:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
