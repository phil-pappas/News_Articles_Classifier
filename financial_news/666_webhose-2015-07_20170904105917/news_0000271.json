We started our campaign with the aim of ensuring these savers will be able to use the freedoms without complication or unfair expense. \nThe FCA has asked firms to provide information on five key areas in which it believes there are potential problems. These are the options firms offer to consumers seeking to access their pension savings; advice requirements for consumers transferring out of pensions; how firms treat insistent clients; transfer procedures, and exit charges. \n• Pension freedoms danger: the essential changes you need to make long before you're 55 \n• Pension freedoms scandal: savers blocked from using new rules \nThe FCA said: \"We recognise that the timescale for the delivery of this data is short, but given the interest in these issues we expect firms to comply with this data request to the best of their abilities in the time available.\" \nIf firms fail to provide the required information they could be fined. \n• katie.morley@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T16:45:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
