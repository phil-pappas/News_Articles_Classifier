The stock has fallen 20pc since April highs of 617p, but is now ready for take off. \nJarrod Castle, at UBS, said he expects IAG to be boosted by a recovering Europe,noting the airline’s exposure to Greece is less than 1pc of capacity. The bank also believes there is upside pressure to forecasts in light of a restructuring and the possibility of further declines in oil prices. Mr Castle expects this will be the first year the group pays a dividend. \nThe upgrade comes after UBS conducted a survey on American and European travellers, which revealed travel spend is likely to increase more over the next 12 months than it did in the previous year. Separately, Heathrow says a record 6.68m passengers travelled through the airport last month, an increase of 1.1pc on last year’s figures. \nWider markets rose yesterday as eurozone leaders reached an agreement with Greece that could lead to a third bailout for the country. However, the measures were tough . * Greece news live: 'Crucified' Tsipras capitulates to draconian measures after 17 hours of late night talks Rebecca O’Keefe, at Interactive Investor, hoped “investors can finally put a line under the Greek issue”, which she described as a “millstone around the necks of European equity markets”. \nDavid Buik, of Panmure Gordon, warned for eurozone leaders “to have agreed a tougher deal, with a larger bail-out figure than before, with a country that is stony broke, is ludicrous at best and downright irresponsible”. \nNonetheless, the FTSE 100 closed 56.55 points, or 0.9pc, higher at 6,729.93. Banking stocks also boosted the FTSE 100. Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) climbed 2.1pc to 273.6p and HSBC gained 1.5pc to 573.9p. * What's next for Greece? Timeline of the remaining obstacles Proposed changes to credit laws in Poland, which limit the number of loans a borrower can take out , severely dented shares in International Personal Finance (LSE: IPF.L - news ) . The mid-cap lender plunged 118.4p, or 25.1pc, to 353p following the announcement, which Justin Bates, at Liberum, described as “a real blow” and one which “could well do lasting damage to profitability of its core market”. \nMr Bates noted that Poland delivered about 62pc of the group’s pre-tax profits, and even though management expect the legislation to pass, they are insistent Poland will remain the group’s largest division. \nMeanwhile, Peter Lenardos, at RBC Capital Markets, urged investors to stay clear of shares in the FTSE 250 lender until “further clarity is provided on the impact to International Personal Finance and the potential for other countries to adopt similar legislation”. \nWhile International Personal Finance took its place as the FTSE 250’s laggard, Alent secured the leader’s spot after US chemicals maker Platform Specialty Products said it would buy the company for about £1.35bn - a 49pc premium to Friday’s closing price. \nNick James, at Numis, said the offer “feels like a good price for a decent business, albeit one which was struggling to demonstrate much top line growth of late”. The mid-cap stock hit a record high yesterday - up 149.3p, or 44.2pc, to 487p. \nJust Eat was back on the menu at JPMorgan Cazenove as the bank began covering the stock again with an 'overweight’ rating. Mark O’Donnell, of JPMorgan Cazenove, described the company as their “top pick in the European online space”. \nWhile the debate has rumbled on as to whether Just Eat paid too much for Australian rival Menulog , which it acquired for a price of £445m last month, analysts at JPMorgan (LSE: JPIU.L - news ) believe the acquisition will add revenues of £38m next year. The stock was changing hands at 423p by close - an increase of 20.7p. \nElsewhere, a bullish note from Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS - news ) failed to stop Lonmin’s decline, falling 9.1pc to 74p. The bank believes the long-term demand outlook for platinum remains particularly robust and analysts anticipate platinum price normalisation over the next 12 months. The note comes days after UBS and Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) downgraded the stock amid concerns over depressed platinum prices . \nJoining Lonmin, Drax Group (LSE: DRX.L - news ) slumped 5.2p to 261.8p as Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) slashed its price target to 300p from 450p. Shares in the FTSE 250 company plunged by 28pc last Wednesday after the government announced its decision to remove the climate change levy exemption for renewable electricity . However, the broker maintained their buy rating. \nHarold Hutchinson, of Investec, believes “Drax is an attractive asset given its biomass conversions”. However, Mr Hutchinson acknowledged the even higher political risks that accompany such a viewpoint. \nMeanwhile, after an ugly start to the third quarter with most commodities being knocked by the Chinese stock market crisis and the Greek saga, Numis cut the price target of Randgold Resources from £52 to £50. Cailey Barker, of Numis, reckons there will be little respite for commodities this year, with a “headwind of depressed prices and downward earnings momentum”. However, despite the gloomy outlook, the stock climbed 22p to finish at £41.74. \nAim-listed Anglo Asian Mining (LSE: AAZ.L - news ) jumped 12.5pc to 6.8p on the back of record gold production of almost 36,000 ounces from its Gedabek mine in Azerbaijan for the first-half of the year and the company is now on track to reach its gold production target for the year of between 70,000 and 75,000 ounces. \nFinally, MX Oil (LSE: MXO.L - news ) slumped 6.7pc to 4.2p despite acquiring a 5pc interest in the Aje Field, offshore Nigeria which is expected to produce over 10,000 barrels of oil a day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T23:32:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
