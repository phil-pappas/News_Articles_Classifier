Local officials can decide which roads to repave, patch, or replace, as long as the money's spent on secondary state roads and bridges. \nThat money is in addition to the $71 million counties will receive through their nearly 3-cents share of the state's 16-cent gas tax. Local officials get more leeway with that money, as state law requires only 25 percent go toward state roads. For both sources, counties' share is based on population, land area and road miles. \nFourteen \"donor\" counties with high gas-tax collections split an additional $10 million. \nCounties' collective share through all three sources ranges from $2.2 million for Allendale County to nearly $18 million to Greenville County, according to a spreadsheet provided Wednesday by the Senate Finance Committee. \nResurfacing a two-lane road costs about $250,000 per mile, according to the state Department of Transportation. \nOf the 41,415 miles of roadway in the state highway system, 31,100 are secondary roads. Roughly half of those roadway miles rate in poor condition, according to the DOT. \nFixing South Carolina's deteriorating roads was a priority for the Legislature this year, but the regular session ended last month without a vote in the Senate. A proposal raising roughly $800 million additional yearly for roads will be at the top of the Senate's agenda when lawmakers return in January. \nIn passing the budget, legislative leaders said they realized the $216 million in one-time designations don't represent a long-term fix, but said it will help patch potholes and repair some of the worst roads immediately. \nGov. Nikki Haley thanked legislators Tuesday for using the surplus money to fund roads without increasing the gas tax. \n\"I think there was effort to find a permanent plan for roads. What they deserve credit on is, of the new money, they did try to fund roads and fund it at the local level,\" said Haley, who's pledged to veto any road-funding plan that doesn't also massively cut income taxes and restructure the DOT. \nShe credited legislators with putting $350 million of unexpected, one-time revenues toward roads. That tally includes $70 million that will partially fund infrastructure the Commerce Department promised to secure Volvo Cars' first North American plant, $4 million to partially refund counties' cleanup costs of a 2014 ice storm, and $50 million that will sit in an account for future borrowing for large highway projects. It can't be used until the Legislature passes a long-term fix for roads. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T01:59:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
