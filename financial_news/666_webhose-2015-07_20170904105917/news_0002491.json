Brett Hemmings Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Jamie Pride, the managing director of human resources technology start-up Reffind, had every reason to be nervous on Thursday morning – with the collapse in the Chinese sharemarket and the iron ore price weighing on Australian investors, it was hardly the best time to float a company.\nBut he needn't have worried. Reffind, which sells a workplace app that allows businesses to more effectively communicate and train employees, had an issue price of 20¢ a share, but leapt to 24¢ soon after opening and climbed to 27¢ at 2.30pm – up 35 per cent.\nAt close, Reffind's shares were trading at 26¢, finishing its first day as a public company up 30 per cent.\nMr Pride, former head of realestate.com.au, said he was relieved the stock had performed well on the first day of trade, despite turbulent market conditions.\n\"It's been a bit of a rollercoaster ride, it's possibly the worst time in the world to list. We've had Greece, we've had China and then the New York Stock Exchange had a technical fault,\" he said.\n\"We're just pleased to get it listed. It was just the first step in the journey, and now the real work begins.\"\nThe stock's 30 per cent bounce was a strong performance in contrast to the S&P/ASX 200 index which finished the day flat, after trading down for most of the day.\n\"We believe regardless of financial markets, companies need our product,\" Mr Pride said.\n The $8 million capital raised through the listing will fund Reffind's expansion to the United States, where it intends to set up an office within the next four weeks.\nScouting US office locations \"We've just spent two weeks in the US spending time on the east and west coast and scouted out locations,\" Mr Pride said. \"We've got close to 10 customers on the platform now and we're going to announce some more to the market in the next 24 to 48 hours. Our pipeline has doubled [in the past month] and we have between 100 and 150 organisations evaluating the platform.\"\nReffind already boasts customers such as Coca-Cola, Lion Nathan and Coles.\nThe transition for Reffind from small start-up to a scalable international company has been quick. It launched its product in the market in March this year, in May it announced the IPO and now it is listed.\nMr Pride said this quick transformation has been driven by the need corporations have to reshape employee engagement, and doing an IPO was the best way to access capital.\n\"The speed we're going at allows us to take full advantage of the market opportunity. It will allow us to invest more aggressively in sales and marketing,\" he said.\nThe 20¢ a share listing price gave Reffind a market capitalisation of $20 million.\nSydney-based start-up accelerator Digital4ge, which was founded by Mr Pride and Reffind co-founder Ben McGrath, has maintained a 48 per cent stake in the company. About 30 institutional investors bought Reffind stock, 15 from Australia and another 15 from Hong Kong and Singapore.\nRecruitment expert Geoff Morgan is also a shareholder, while former Westpac NZ chief executive Peter Clare is Reffind's chairman.\nMr Pride said Reffind was \"well-priced\" and good value for investors.\n\"Looking at comparables like 1-Page, which is trading at a market capitalisation of over $240 million, we're sitting around $28 million so we have a fair bit of head room,\" he said. \"We're a home-grown product, we're highly scalable and we have global applicability.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-07-09T13:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:07:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
