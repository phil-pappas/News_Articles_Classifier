A copy of the final prospectus will be available under the REIT's issuer profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . \nThe REIT has been formed as a growth-oriented real estate entity that will focus on owning and acquiring primarily income-producing automotive dealership properties located in Canada . On closing, the REIT's portfolio of 26 income-producing commercial properties (the \"Initial Properties\") will represent approximately 958,000 square feet of gross leasable area in Ontario , Saskatchewan , Alberta and British Columbia . \nThe Units will be issued at a price of $10.00 per Unit (the \"Offering Price\") and are expected to provide Unitholders with an annual yield of 8.0%. Gross proceeds of the Offering will be $75 million . In connection with the closing, the proceeds of the Offering, together with drawdowns under the REIT's credit facilities, will be used by the REIT to indirectly acquire, through Automotive Properties Limited Partnership (the \"Partnership\"), from subsidiaries of 893353 Alberta Inc. (\"Dilawri\") or entities related to Dilawri, the Initial Properties (the \"Acquisition\"). Affiliates of, and entities related to, Dilawri will be the REIT's only tenants as of closing, occupying approximately 87% of the REIT's gross leasable area, and its most significant tenants for the foreseeable future. The closing of the Offering and the Acquisition is expected to occur on or about July 22, 2015 . \nThe Offering is being underwritten by a syndicate of underwriters with TD Securities Inc. and Canaccord Genuity Corp. acting as co-lead underwriters and joint bookrunners. The underwriters have been granted an over-allotment option, exercisable at any one time up to 30 days following closing to purchase up to an additional 1,125,000 Units which, if exercised in full, will increase the total gross proceeds of the Offering to $86,250,000 . The proceeds received by the REIT on the exercise of the over-allotment option, to the extent exercised, will be used by the REIT to repay debt and provide additional working capital for the REIT. \nOn closing, it is expected that Dilawri will indirectly own, control or direct an approximate 57.0% effective interest in the REIT (or an approximate 53.5% effective interest if the over-allotment is exercised in full) on a fully-diluted basis through ownership of all of the Class B limited partnership units of the Partnership, which are economically equivalent to and exchangeable for Units. Dilawri and a subsidiary of Dilawri will administer the REIT following closing, including providing the REIT's President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary. \nThe REIT initially intends to make monthly cash distributions of $0.067 per Unit. The first distribution of the REIT will be in the amount of $0.086 per Unit for the period from closing to August 31, 2015 and will be paid on September 15, 2015 to unitholders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2015 , assuming closing occurs on July 22, 2015 . Declared distributions will thereafter be paid on or about the 15 th day of each month to unitholders of record at the close of business on the last business day of the immediately preceding month. \nThe Toronto Stock Exchange has conditionally approved the listing of the Units under the symbol \"APR.UN\".
