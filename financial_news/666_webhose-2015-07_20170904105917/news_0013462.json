Greeks begin to withdraw large sums of money from cash machines. \nSunday, June 28: The European Central Bank (ECB) says it will continue to extend an emergency cash lifeline to Greece, but not increase the level of its help to banks, raising the risk of a liquidity crunch. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) says it stands ready to \"provide assistance as needed.\" \nThe Greek government enacts capital controls that limits bank machine withdrawals by Greeks to 60 euros ($65) per day and closes banks until July 7. \nPensioners without bank cards are allowed to withdraw money however, and foreign tourists are not subjected to the limit. \nMonday, June 29: Global stock markets slump and European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker says he feels \"betrayed\" by the Greek government's actions. Tsipras says he doubts Juncker's \"sincerity.\" \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel says she is ready for more talks with Greece after the referendum, which initial polls suggest could see Greeks reject the terms of a bailout. \nTuesday, June 30: Juncker floats a \"last-minute\" solution for an accord, while Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis confirms the government will not reimburse the 1.5 billion euros in IMF loans before the deadline. \nTsipras seeks a two-year deal with the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to cover the government's financing needs and restructure the country's crushing debt. \nWednesday, July 1: After Greece misses the IMF deadline, the government sends an \"amended\" proposal to its creditors. \nGerman Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble responds by saying that \"Greece must clarify its position on what it wants\" before bailout talks can resume. \nMerkel warns against reaching a compromise at any price that could weaken the EU, and says it can wait for the results of the referendum, but French President Francois Holland says an \"agreement must come immediately.\" \nSunday, July 5: Scheduled Greek referendum on proposed terms of a hypothetical third bailout by international creditors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T19:39:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
