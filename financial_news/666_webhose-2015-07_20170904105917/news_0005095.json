Only 28% of respondents received a passing grade when asked basic questions about Social Security benefits — while only 8% consider themselves to be very knowledgeable about those benefits. \nAlmost everyone surveyed held at least one misperception about Social Security. Also, more than seven out of ten did not realize full Social Security retirement age varies depending on the year you were born in, and 55% did not understand how continuing to work affected their benefits regardless of age. \n“If you're still working, don't claim benefits before your ‘full’ retirement age if you can avoid it,” said Jack Hillis, president of Hillis Financial Services in San Jose. “While you're employed, you are increasing the underlying benefit upon which your eventual benefit will be determined.” 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T19:22:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
