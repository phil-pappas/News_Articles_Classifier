Today, it’s practically on a fire sale. \nSo whether you’re a broke college kid looking to soak in some sun or a couple planning a glorious honeymoon, look no further. This is one place that can offer it all for an inexpensive vacation, though travelers need to heed a few caveats amid the nation's upheaval. \nTop Costs Baby Boomers and Gen X-ers Think Retirement is More Fairy Tale Than Reality \nGetting Around \nGetting to Greece isn’t cheap. Keep costs down on your flight to Athens by playing the usual airfare games . Fly Tuesday through Thursday, be flexible about travel dates and, if at all possible, bounce the flight through London or Istanbul. These two hubs can often have better fares than flying direct. \nLife gets a lot easier in-country. True budget travelers to the islands should start with the ferries . Expect to pay around $40-$50 for a trip from Athens to the Cyclades and considerably less going from island to island. Fair warning though: they’re slow. The big boats can take upwards of six hours to get to an island, and a trip down to Crete can literally take all night. Bring a windbreaker; it gets cold on the Mediterranean after dark. \nFlying is faster. Check out the two local airlines Aegean and Olympic air. Although they don’t make island-bound trips every day, they can turn that all-day boat ride into a 45 minute hop. They cost more but are still generally quite a bargain especially considering the time saved out of a ten-day vacation. \nFinally, inland travel means trains and, mostly, buses. Prices range widely depending on where you’re headed, whether it’s an overnight trip to Delphi or a long road to the Peloponnese. Choose trains wherever possible, as the buses tend to serve local routes and stop frequently. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T16:52:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
