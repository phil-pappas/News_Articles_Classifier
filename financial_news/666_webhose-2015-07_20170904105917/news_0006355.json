It comes ahead of a conference call on Friday and a meeting next week to sort out whether [and on what basis] they are prepared to roll over and support the company going forward.\nInvestment banks Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, UBS and BNP Paribas were among the lenders who chipped in to Bis' last major debt deal, a $950 million, three-year refinancing package in December 2012, along with three of the Big Four Australian lenders.\nNow KKR has asked the syndicate to push out covenants and amend some of the existing terms in order to gift the company a decent runway to ride out sector volatility.\nDeloitte was called in last month to provide comfort to Bis's senior credit investors on the profit forecasts, commodity price assumptions and reporting systems put together by new Bis head honcho Brad Rogers, and the contracts the business has in place.\nAlthough the firm is in for a tough time in an industry where bean-counters have been heavily pruning costs and slashing capital spending plans, it seems some of the hand-wringing may have been overdone.\nLending sources told Street Talk the report has a consistent theme of \"reasonable\" to describe the assumptions and forecasts. Equally, the management playbook of stripping out costs and overheads is being accelerated by Rogers and so Bis is doing what everyone expects it to do in battening down the hatches.\nBut timing is everything.\n There is universal acknowledgement that Bis is in for a tough time and it will be at least three years before there's a solid turnaround in market conditions.\nOh for those heady days before the mining boom ran out of puff. KKR acquired Bis Cleanaway from Brambles for $1.83 billion in 2006 in what was the United States firm's first big splash in Australia. In the blink of an eye it then sold the Cleanaway part of the business to Transpacific for $1.25 billion in 2007.\nElsewhere, and as noted by Street Talk Online on Wednesday , Westpac's move to sell down its stake in BT Investment Management at $8.20 a share has prompted some to claim the bank sold out too cheaply.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T00:12:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
