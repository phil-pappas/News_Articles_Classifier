Buyers will get access to a “resident’s club” with a library, concierge, gym and spa, business suites and cinema.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Buyers beware … people queued for hours to get into the sale. At the launch, 230 apartments were put up for sale in London and Hong Kong, and 208 sold within hours, at prices ranging from £350,000 for a studio up to £1.25m for three-bedrooms. Despite some signs of a slowdown in the London property market in recent months, £140m of property was bought off-plan by homebuyers and investors – the equivalent of £580,000 of sales a minute.\nJust half of the buyers were UK-based, with the rest from overseas including Greece, France, India and the Middle East. Chinese buyers are expected to turn to overseas property as a safe haven for their money following a slump in the country’s stock market . The developers, Galliard, held events in London and Hong Kong, and 50 of the flats were sold in the Hong Kong sale.\nSome overseas buyers bought more than one property, and there was interest from parents buying for their student offspring, as well as investors.\nUK buyers were a mix of investors and owner-occupiers, with a lot of the studios and smaller one-bedroom flats bought by people who queued for hours to get into the sale.\nThe penthouses and premium flats will be sold at a later date.\nDavid Galman, sales director at Galliard Homes, said: “The volume and speed of sales at the Maine Tower launch was incredible and shows the confidence that buyers from both the UK and overseas currently have in the London market.”\nProperty expert Henry Pryor said developers were selling properties to overseas buyers so they could finance the buildings being sold. “To do this developers will pre-sell some properties, but these can only be bought by people who don’t need a mortgage – a mortgage offer only has a six-month shelf life,” he said.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A bedroom in the development. “The biggest market of cash buyers for these kinds of properties are overseas, so this is where the developers, agents and lawyers go booking hotel lobbies in foreign capitals and selling what is really a sterling currency option dressed up in bricks and mortar.”\nHe added: “Can we tackle this absurd practice of selling scarce new homes in London or Cambridge to investors in China? First we need to agree that we should – perhaps through some sort of residency test as they have in Singapore, but even if we do so it’s worth remembering that 36% of people living in London were born outside the UK, according to the 2011 census.”", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4athp%2Fsfb%23img-1&ref=responsive", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4athp%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Hundreds+of+flats+in+Canary+Wharf+development+sell+in+less+than+five+hours&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmoney%2F2015%2Fjul%2F13%2Fcanary-wharf-flats-maine-tower-overseas-buyers&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F13%2F1436783386599%2F64f9db86-7164-4a1f-986d-d64b661c020f-1020x612.jpeg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Hundreds+of+flats+in+Canary+Wharf+development+sell+in+less+than+five+hours&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4athp%2Fstw%23img-1", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Hundreds+of+flats+in+Canary+Wharf+development+sell+in+less+than+five+hours&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4athp%2Fstw%23img-2", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Hundreds+of+flats+in+Canary+Wharf+development+sell+in+less+than+five+hours&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmoney%2F2015%2Fjul%2F13%2Fcanary-wharf-flats-maine-tower-overseas-buyers&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F13%2F1436783423942%2F5e6a8b95-6d35-4682-b961-1fcd96a79720-1020x612.jpeg"], "published": "2015-07-13T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T14:46:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
