They want to be the indirect beneficiaries of a change in the indirect tax.\n“Australia’s states and territories are responsible for some of the most harmful taxes levied by Australia’s governments,” head of the Australian Industry Group Innes Willox said today.\n“What we’ve got is a tax system that’s designed in the 20th century and we’re operating in a 21st century economy.”\nAnother claimant to extra money is Western Australia which insists its declining minerals industry means it needs a bigger share of the GST pot — and other states deserve less.\nThen there is the question of who should pay in the first place, a matter which is ensuring the federal Opposition and Labor premiers are opposing a GST strategy.\nThe opponents argue low income earners and those on welfare would pay more proportionally than the well off if the tax went up. Even with the GST exemptions, the additional costs would be significant for them.\nThe 20 per cent of households with the lowest income spend about nine per cent of their disposable income on GST- affected goods and services, according to Alan Duncan on Curtin University. The richest households spend just 3.5 per cent of disposable income on these purchases.\nAnd opponents warn it would be difficult to compensate them, particularly if the disadvantaged don’t pay income tax and so could not gain from reductions there.\nOne proposal is for the GST to be extended to financial services which Labor’s South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill calculates could raise an additional $3.6 billion a year and not affect the poor. It is a proposal Mr Weatherill wants discussed.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/debate-over-who-should-pay-more-and-who-should-benefit-from-a-rise/story-e6frflo9-1227452435242?sv=16c78d8528de5fd34c2e8db07f55bc88", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/debate-over-who-should-pay-more-and-who-should-benefit-from-a-rise/story-e6frflo9-1227452435242?sv=16c78d8528de5fd34c2e8db07f55bc88&title=Fight+over+who+gets+GST+cash", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/debate-over-who-should-pay-more-and-who-should-benefit-from-a-rise/story-e6frflo9-1227452435242?sv=16c78d8528de5fd34c2e8db07f55bc88&title=Fight+over+who+gets+GST+cash", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/debate-over-who-should-pay-more-and-who-should-benefit-from-a-rise/story-e6frflo9-1227452435242?sv=16c78d8528de5fd34c2e8db07f55bc88&h=Fight+over+who+gets+GST+cash", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Fight+over+who+gets+GST+cash&c=THE+nation%26%238217%3Bs+leaders+are+in+Sydney+today+discussing+whether+we+should+all+be+slugged+more+money%2C+and+who+would+get+the+cash+at+the+end+of+the+day.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/debate-over-who-should-pay-more-and-who-should-benefit-from-a-rise/story-e6frflo9-1227452435242?sv=16c78d8528de5fd34c2e8db07f55bc88", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/debate-over-who-should-pay-more-and-who-should-benefit-from-a-rise/story-e6frflo9-1227452435242?sv=16c78d8528de5fd34c2e8db07f55bc88"], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T13:24:31.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
