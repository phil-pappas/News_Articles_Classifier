That's well above Commonwealth Bank, ANZ and Macquarie's 27 percentage point increase. \nNational Australia Bank hiked variable rates on interest-only home loans - the predominant structure for investors - by 29 basis points, leaving Westpac as the only major bank not to have raised investment loan rates. \nRatings agency Moody's Investors Service expects Westpac, Australia's largest lender to landlords, to follow its peers in repricing its investment mortgage book. \n\"Increased lending rates are credit positive for the banks because they rebalance their portfolios away from the higher-risk investor and interest-only lending toward safer owner-occupied and principal amortising loans,\" Moody's vice president Ilya Serov said. \n\"They also help preserve net interest margins and profitability amid higher capital requirements and increased competition from smaller lenders.\" @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Many property investors still keen to buy AAP \nA Mortgage Choice survey shows that 54 per cent of potential investors would still go ahead with their plans despite â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T18:23:48.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
