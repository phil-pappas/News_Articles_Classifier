No fracking has taken place since Cuadrilla caused earthquakes attempting the process near Blackpool in 2011. \nThe appeals are highly likely to result in public inquiries and could easily take a year to reach decisions, pushing any prospect of fracking at the Lancashire sites back to 2017 at the earliest. \nFracking plans rejected: Lancashire council throws out Cuadrilla proposal - at it happened \nThe Roseacre site was rejected unanimously after being recommended for refusal by the council planning officer due to concerns about the impact of traffic. \nHowever the officer said there would be no “sustainable” reason to refuse the Preston New Road site. \nProtesters outside Lancashire council during the vote \nLegal advice obtained by the council ahead of the decision on the site warned councillors they were likely to lose at appeal and incur financial penalties, as well as having to represent themselves in person. \nHowever councillors eventually voted by 9 to 3 to reject the plan, with two abstentions, following rival legal advice provided by Friends of the Earth that suggested there were legitimate grounds for refusal. \nFrancis Egan, Cuadrilla chief executive, said: “We have given careful consideration to appeal the planning decisions taken by Lancashire County Council. This is a natural step in the democratic process for deciding any planning application.” \nHe acknowledged that “some people would prefer that we did not appeal” but said he was “confident that we will demonstrate to Lancashire and the UK that shale gas exploration and fracking is not only safe but represents a very real opportunity to create jobs, fuel businesses, heat UK homes and stimulate significant local economic growth”. \nCuadrilla is backed by Centrica (LSE: CNA.L - news ) , which bought a stake in the company’s exploration licences in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T00:24:31.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
