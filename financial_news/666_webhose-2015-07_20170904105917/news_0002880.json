Pound reaches new high against the euro - could it soon reach the golden 1.5 barrier? British holidaymakers to Europe have been handed an extra spending boost as the pound leaps to an eight-year high against the euro. PUBLISHED: 15:14, Thu, Jul 16, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:33, Thu, Jul 16, 2015 GETTY The pound has reached a new high against the euro \nSterling has edged up to €1.43 against the continent's single-currency, the highest level since 2007. The continued Greek debt crisis has steadily helped push the pound up against the euro in recent months. Today £500 will now buy €716, whereas 12 months ago Brits would have received around €596. It provides a welcome bounce to families who are heading abroad this weekend to coincide with the school holidays . But as the crisis in the continent continues to rage, experts say that the pound could keep powering up to €1.5 - a level not seen since January 2007. Nicholas Ebisch, currency analyst at Caxton FX, said: \"The GBP/EUR rate keeps moving through barriers without any end in sight. \n\"The rate could very well move to 1.5 in the next couple of months, depending on what happens in the eurozone.\" \nYesterday the Greek Government gave approval to a controversial third Greek bailout to stop the debt-laden country crashing out of the euro. \nBut the drama is far from over, as German politicians must also give the deal their seal of approval. \nThere are fears that without substantial debt relief for Greece, the economy will not be able to recover. \nMr Ebisch added: \"The euro has continued to weaken, which highlights the underlying problem of European debt. \n\"If there is not real and sustained growth in the coming months in Europe, debt will continue to build, and the euro could very well continue to weaken, especially against the pound and other currencies which are performing relatively well.\" Related articles Air passenger tax: How to get money back for under 12s on plane... \nAdam Chester, head of economic research & market strategy, at Lloyds Bank said: \"The break higher opens the way for a move up towards 1.50 over the coming months, given the diverging policy outlooks and the likelihood that Greek uncertainty continues to impact sentiment. \n\"Further out, however, the prospects of a sustained rise in GBP/EUR are, we believe, limited. \"Assuming there is some lasting resolution to the Greek crisis, supported by an eventual agreement on debt haircuts, the focus is likely to turn to the relative undervaluation of the euro – particularly if, as we expect, euro zone growth continues to post a steady recovery. \n\"In the meantime, Brexit uncertainty, fiscal austerity, and the UK’s substantial external deficit with the euro area are likely to weigh on the pound. \n\"We have revised up our Q3 call to 1.50 but look for a steady move lower thereafter.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T00:30:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
