Paying off the debt restores the enterprise value to the shareholders and that is the number one thing we want to do.” \nMr Hambro said the company may revive its plan to process refractory ore by completing building of processing facilities, which its financial troubles halted. It could also invest in digging deeper into existing mines to access high-quality ore. \nPetropavlovsk may invest up to $50m into work that will allow it to mine existing pits laterally from the side to boost productivity. \nThe company is expected to produce 680,000 ounces of gold this year and sustain production at above 600,000 ounces for the next five years. \nMining companies such as Petropavlovsk were caught out by the gold price crash from a record above $1,930 per ounce a few years ago to around $1,200 now. \nMr Hambro said it remains profitable with a margin of around $500 per ounce, which should generate $300m of revenue this year", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T06:07:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
