Georgia Osland by Mark Latham One of the fascinating aspects of modern Left-wing culture is the creation of false notions of victimhood.\nLeft-feminists in particular spend a lot of time constructing a world of persecution around themselves.\nIn an era in which women are dominating men in higher education attainment and workforce entry into professions such as the law, neo-feminists still believe in outdated theories of patriarchy.\nHaving grown affluent and elite in their social habits and economic profile, feelings of oppression are vital to their political identity.\nAfter all, it's not possible to be Leftist without thinking that powerful tyrants (in this case, men) are out to get you.\nIn filling Sydney's social pages at charity balls and ladies' luncheons, it must be hard, in the joy of the moment, to feel oppressed.\nSo an omnipresent threat has been created: a belief that hiding down every gentrified street, that lurking behind every Mercedes and BMW is a vicious wife basher.\nI know it sounds ridiculous, but this is the argument Left-feminists have propagated throughout Australia's media and political system.\n Patriarchy means that all women are equally at risk of domestic violence.\nAre there any recent examples of this argument – perhaps one that's been published in The Australian Financial Review ?\nExhibit A is an article 12 days ago by Anna Bligh , the former Queensland Labor premier, now prominent at a number of Sydney social events.\nBligh used NSW Crime Bureau data to identify so-called domestic violence \"hotspots\" in the upmarket Sydney suburbs of Mosman, Manly and Randwick.\nYet curiously, in presenting her findings, she didn't Quote: any statistics for domestic assault incidents in these areas.\nIf she had, the inaccuracy of her position would have been immediately apparent to Financial Review readers.\nWomen in Mosman, Manly and Randwick are living in three of Australia's safest communities.\nIn 2014-15, Mosman had a domestic assault incident rate of 141.9 per 100,000 population, Randwick 147.0 and Manly 185.3 – each of them well below the NSW average of 395.4.\nIn listing her \"hotspots\", Bligh wasn't really looking for troubled neighbourhoods.\nMismatched conclusions She was trying to mount a conclusion that matched the patriarchy template: a belief that high-income suburbs also have high levels of family violence.\nIn truth, they don't. The highest rates of domestic assault in NSW are in underclass communities, particularly those with large Indigenous populations.\nIf Bligh had been serious in identifying hotspots close to the centre of Sydney, she would have listed Redfern (791.7 domestic assault incidents per 100,000 population) and Waterloo (1040.3).\nOr in western Sydney, the Mount Druitt/Struggle Street suburbs of Bidwill (1917.5) and Emerton (1584.2).\nOr in western NSW, the domestic violence hell-holes of Walgett (5179.6) and Bourke (3543.9).\nThe wrongness of Bligh's position is self-evident: she made no mention of any of these areas, while writing of DV \"hotspots\" elsewhere.\nYet women in Walgett are 37-times more likely to experience domestic assault than those in Mosman.\nOr expressed differently: whereas in Mosman there's a reported domestic incident for every 705 residents, in Walgett it's one in 19.\nWhy has Bligh been so inaccurate?\nIn effect, she wants us to believe that women like her and her well-heeled luncheon pals (from Sydney's northern and eastern suburbs) face the same risk of domestic violence as social housing tenants in Western Sydney and Western NSW – a false victimhood mentality.\nThis is what ideological dogma does to people. They only believe in things they want to believe in, regardless of evidence.\nWhen this approach is converted into public policy, the results can be dangerous.\nThe last time Leftists gained control of a major issue in Australia, under the border protection policies of the Rudd/Gillard governments, 2000 asylum seekers drowned.\nNow, in dealing with domestic violence, activists such as Bligh want to prioritise hotspots in some of Sydney's safest neighbourhoods.\nMeanwhile, Aboriginal underclass communities that dare not speak their name, such as Walgett and Bourke, are frying alive with the mass tragedy of female bashings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T16:40:28.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
