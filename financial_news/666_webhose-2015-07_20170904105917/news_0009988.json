Louie Douvis by Sue Mitchell Wesfarmers managing director Richard Goyder says the era when chief executive officers are regarded as all-powerful, God-like figures is over.\nDelivering the annual John Monash Oration, Mr Goyder said that in a world where more people were empowered with information and education and the right to vote, CEOs needed more than persuasiveness and eloquence to achieve change.\n\"I would argue that we now live in a world where most of us are so empowered individually, with information, education, and the ballot box, that it is very difficult for leaders to lead just by being persuasive and eloquent – although that can be important,\" Mr Goyder told more than 140 business and community leaders in Sydney on Tuesday.\n\"And so, while sometimes we hanker for 'God' leaders, the reality is that we all have an increased leadership role,\" he said.\n\"More importantly, and to invoke another leader, JFK, I think we should be doing more ourselves to change things for the better. We are all leaders of the future and each of us can make a difference.\"\nMr Goyder, 54, said the 10-year anniversary of his appointment as managing director at Wesfarmers in July 2005 had prompted him to contemplate the meaning of leadership and his own leadership style.\n\"There have been times, post the acquisition of Coles, and during the global financial crisis, where there were many doubters on Wesfarmers – indeed our share price fell to around $14 late in 2008,\" he said.\n\"I was always extremely confident that we were on the right track, and the board backed me – others may not have. Now, 10 years into the role, I can say with confidence that I am a better leader today, because of the experiences I have had, and lessons learned over that time.\"\n Easier in a crisis Mr Goyder said leadership could be easier in a crisis, as it galvanised people into action, and could be much more challenging when things were going well.\n\"In the business world, we can create a burning platform and use incentives to get changes in behaviour, and ultimately, better outcomes,\" he said. \"But how often do we see once successful companies fall into the trap of hubris, and as a consequence performance deteriorates.\"\n\"Leaders need to be aware of this, challenge, look for disruptions, and be honest with themselves.\"\nIn Australia, leaders were often put on a pedestal when things were going well and \"chopped down\" when they were not.\n\"Time is the best judge of the person's leadership,\" Mr Goyder said.\nThe John Monash Oration is organised annually by the General Sir John Monash Foundation, which was established more than 13 years ago with support from governments, business and universities to honour one of Australia's greatest military and civil leaders.\nThe foundation, which is supported by Wesfarmers, awards scholarships to foster leadership, expertise, personal development and international networks. Scholarships of up to $60,000 a year are awarded for up to three years of postgraduate study which may be conducted at any university outside of Australia.\nPast John Monash scholars include the 2004 Young Australian of the Year, Hugh Evans, who completed his Masters in International Relations at Cambridge and went on to become CEO of the Global Poverty Project and Global Citizen, and Dr Rosie Dawkins, who completed a Masters of Public Health at Harvard University in 2009 and went on to work with the World Health Organisation in Switzerland and the Aboriginal Medical Health Service in Alice Springs.\n\"Monash was a wonderful leader – the young people awarded scholarships in his name will have every opportunity to follow in his footsteps,\" Mr Goyder said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:11:36.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
