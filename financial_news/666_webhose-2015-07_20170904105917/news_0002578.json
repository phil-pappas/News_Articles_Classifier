The Chinese give us loans which are concessional; the Chinese give us loans which we take preferential credit and there are commercial loans and the Exim expects that when you apply for a loan for a commercial project the project should be able to pay for itself”, he explained. \nHe said if the Chinese said the ‘Gang of Four’ project is not commercially viable, it is possible a concessional loan – which would have been a good type of loan for the project – was not available at the time. \nHe said although there were plans to toll the roads to make it commercial, it is possible the Chinese did not find them viable enough. \n“Probably their [Chinese] analysis is showing that…the tolls may not be viable yet. This is where you go for mixed credit…or branded credit”, he said to explain that perhaps the type of loan Ghana applied for did not conform to the ‘Gang of Four’ project. \nHe said government was keen on pursuing smart borrowing which involves ensuring that every project for which a loan is taken is viable to repay the loan. \nStory by Ghana | Myjoyonline.com | George Nyavor | [email protected]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T22:44:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
