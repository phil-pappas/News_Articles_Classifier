Wall Street traders are in for a wild ride over the next 24 hours.\nA report on China’s second-quarter economic growth, due at 10 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, threatens to reignite a selloff in the country’s fragile stock market.\nFederal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak Wednesday morning about the central bank’s economic outlook to the House Financial Services committee, one day after a disappointing retail-sales report. That report, combined with a weak reading on employment gains from July 3, have caused investors to second-guess whether the pace of U.S. economic expansion has been strong enough to coax the central bank to raise interest rates in September.\nAnd by the end of the day in Athens, the Greek Parliament must decide whether or not to adopt a raft of unpopular and stringent reform measures demanded by the country’s international creditors.\nThe measures call for more severe spending cuts, market reforms and tax increases than those rejected by Greek voters in a referendum on July 5. Accepting the measures is necessary to begin negotiations on a desperately needed bailout. Rejecting them could possibly lead to a Greek exit from the eurozone — and more intense economic pain in the short term.\nAlso on tap for Wednesday is a meeting of the Bank of Canada. Economists are divided on whether the central bank will cut its benchmark interest rate, as falling oil prices continue to stymie economic growth in Canada. An economists with Capital Economics said there’s “a very strong chance” the central bank will cut its rate benchmark to 0.5% from 0.75%. While another at PNC said it’s more likely the central bank will leave rates unchanged.\n“The next 24 hours are going to be pretty interesting and possibly very volatile for currencies and it’s not going to be about the U.S. dollar DXY, -0.15% but about external event risk as well,” said Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management.\nTom di Galoma, head of rates and credit trading at ED & F Man Capital Markets, said Yellen will be the main event on Wednesday.\n“There’s a lot of hope in the market place that [Yellen] will raise rates in September,” di Galoma said. But disappointing readings on national employment and consumer spending in July would make a rate hike difficult to justify, given that the central bank has repeatedly promised that the course of impending interest rate increases will be data-dependent.\nYellen will address the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.\nRead: There’s limited scope for Yellen to move markets with Hill appearance\nDi Galoma said Yellen might sound like the central bank is on track for a September interest-rate hike because that’s what Congress wants to hear.\nThe outcome of all these events, whatever they may be, will highlight how global economic conditions are diverging, a trend that will have immense impact on interest rates and currency moves.\n“Which currencies under- and outperform [Wednesday] will be very important,” Lien said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:44:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
