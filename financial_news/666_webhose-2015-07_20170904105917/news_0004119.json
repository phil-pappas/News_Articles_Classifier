By Kyle Caldwell | Telegraph – 10 minutes ago 235.50 -2.2500 \nA little known index of shares in micro-chip firms is sliding fast and may be a bad sign for the US stock market \nInvestors are always looking for clues to help them second guess the future direction of stock markets. \nMeasures such as \"Cape (LSE: CIU.L - news ) \", the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio of a market, are taken by some as a guide to whether now is the time to buy or sell. \nAnother technique takes the yield of a stock market and compares this with the yield on the government bonds of that country. Experts say it is normally a buy signal when the stock market is offering the higher level of income. \nBut none of these are infallible and all can be upset by the biggest cause of sharp swings sentiment. Investors have found this to their cost in recent weeks, with global stock markets spooked by events in Greece and China. \nBut for believers in the power of charts, AJ Bell, the broker, says there is a another one to keep an eye on - the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, known as the SOX. \nThe index is home to 30 semiconductor companies, businesses that develop and manufacture micro-chips. The majority are American, with Intel (Swiss: INTC.SW - news ) the most famous name. One British share, ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) , whose chips are used in virtually all smartphones, also features in the index. \nThe firm says investors should keep a close eye on the SOX as it has has a strong correlation with America’s stock market, the S&P 500, which is itself viewed as a benchmark for how other global stock markets perform. The SOX is generally more volatile and has tended to forerun the larger index. \nThe chart below shows has how closely the SOX has matched the S&P 500 over the past decade. \nRuss Mould, of AJ Bell, said: “Whatever the product or service, there will be silicon chips semiconductors - somewhere in the food chain, be it within a computer, handheld device, car, aircraft or smart-meter. Silicon chips are therefore a useful proxy for economic growth and the SOX index has historically been a good guide to where America’s S&P 500 index might go and by implication the world, as the US is the biggest and most influential stock market of all.” \nThe bad news for investors who believe the theory is that the SOX is now on the slide, racking up a 13pc loss since the start of June. \nThe index has been heading lower since hitting its highest ever level of 746 last month, beating its previous peak of 700 achieved in 2000 during the tech boom. At the end of last week the index stood at 667. \nMr Mould said several profit warnings over the past month have knocked the SOX index off course. \nOver this period, however, the S&P 500 has been flat, up 0.5pc.
