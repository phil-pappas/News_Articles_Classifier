Written by: Brian O'Connell 07/06/15 - 3:48 PM EDT More Headlines Cutting Medical Costs Could Rely on Continuity of Care \nNEW YORK (MainStreet) -- U.S. new home sales are at a seven-year high , and it might be a good time to go \"all in\" on a new home purchase. Meanwhile, 90% of U.S. Markets monitored by RealtyTrac remain \"more affordable than historic averages\" in terms of getting down payment help . According to RealtyTrac, the average down payment program benefit for all 370 U.S.counties with 100,000 residents measured $10,443, about 6.84% of the median home sales price recorded in April, 2015. Lower down payments are generally available to new buyers, although geography plays a big role in the deal you get. For example, in RealtyTrac's assessment of these markets, new buyers in \"top five\" low down payment markets include Ashtabula, Ohio; Imperial, Calif.; Hernando, Fla.; Clayton, Ga.; and Lackawanna, Pa. Not surprisingly, Fairfax, Va. and New York City, which are among the most expensive regions for homebuyers, with the lowest affordability rates for homebuyers looking for down payment help. Ideally, if you really want to lock down a deal on a new home, the more cash you bring to the table in the form of a down payment, the better your chances. But in an improving home affordability market, even if you can't muster up that down payment, financing sources are available to help you get one. \"There are a plethora of loan options that help the first time buyer purchase with only a 3% down payment,\" says Mike Pappas, president of the Keyes Company in Miami, Fla. \"Our average income household earner can buy almost two times the average priced house in South Florida. Many of them will look back at this opportunistic time as one of the best times to purchase a home in the area.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T00:19:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
