It’s a win-win.” \nThe Democratic front-runner has hinted at the idea before, saying last month that she hopes to create “new incentives” for companies to share profits with more employees than just their top executives. A Clinton aide said the candidate will offer up changes to the tax code to encourage companies to participate, but did not say what those changes would be. \nClinton's Monday speech, to be delivered at the New School, a progressive university in Greenwich Village, is a big-picture survey of her views on the economy as a whole that will offer an introduction to policy proposals that she will detail in the coming weeks. She'll start on Thursday with a rollout of the profit-sharing plan during a campaign stop in New Hampshire, the aide said.
