We are thrilled to pair such an innovative product with a leading and respected institution as PrimeTrust.”\n###\nSDBIC makes the safest places even safer by providing safe deposit box and private vault storage insurance solutions in more than 350 institutions and facilities across the U.S. states, with policies starting as low as $25 per year for $5,000.00 USD in coverage. Each policy covers all the property in a customers' box against natural and manmade catastrophes as well as theft due to burglary or robbery. No disclosures or appraisals required; and no deductibles upon an event of loss. It is a turnkey product with no system integration, which has been positively received by key regulators, and has proven to enhance customer retention, as well as overall customer acquisition. Coverage is underwritten by an A+ rated insurance carrier.
