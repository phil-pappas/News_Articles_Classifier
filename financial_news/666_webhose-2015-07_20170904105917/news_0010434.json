Along the same lines, there are professionals who believe in their unquestioning value and importance. They are usually mistaken.\nThere is no question that some professionals – financial advisors , accountants , lawyers , business coaches , and so on – are technically superior to their peers. However, if a professional was no longer working, there is no question that his or her clients can readily find a capable replacement.\nIt is only because of ignorance or naivety that some professionals believe they are irreplaceable. Their widely skewed sense of value is usually a function of their technical prowess. Unfortunately, there are no proprietary services, so all high-caliber professionals are on a level playing field when it comes to technical proficiencies.\n“In working with the ultra-wealthy, we are well aware there are other firms that can provide the same high level services we do. Our success is not due to the sleeve of services we provide or even our ability to deliver them extremely well,” explains Rick Flynn, managing partner of Flynn Family Office (FFO) . “What’s critical is our ability to develop highly customized solution sets for our ultra-wealthy clients. This is possible because we take a very systematic approach to developing a deep understanding of them, and we have the expertise to bring together various services in a cohesive and cost-effective manner producing truly customized solutions.”\nAccording to Frank Seneco, president of Sececo & Associates, an advanced planning boutique , “When it comes to providing life insurance, all experienced and knowledgeable agents have – in one way or another – access to the same carriers. They also know how to structure a life insurance portfolio as well as the various strategies that a wealthy client can use. The differences between the ‘better’ and the ‘best’ is a sensitivity and insight into what would work best and is most ‘comfortable’ for a client.”\nBecause all professionals are fungible and competition is intensifying, the service delivery model has become a critical differentiator. “As the saying goes, we’re committed to earning out clients’ business 24/7 everyday,” says Flynn. “To ensure that we are attentive to even the minutest details and that we’re responsive beyond their expectations, we’ve developed a fairly complex methodology for staying absolutely attentive. Combining this approach with the deep understanding we have of our ultra-wealthy clients lets us anticipate many of their needs and preferences, which is far from the norm.”\nAs all professionals are fungible and competition is on the rise, clients reap the benefits. The smart ones are leveraging this scenario to ensure they are receiving the best answers and the best services. And, clients are getting smarter each day . Professionals who fail to honestly comprehend their stature are going to be marginalized, at best.", "external_links": ["http://www.fa-mag.com/book---the-whole-client-model"], "published": "2015-07-08T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T15:25:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
