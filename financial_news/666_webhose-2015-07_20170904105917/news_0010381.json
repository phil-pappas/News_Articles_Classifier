Beer from Germany? Think Again 42647 Olive Oil from Italy? Beer from Germany? Think Again 0 Comments, Be the first to comment Where in the world are these products really from? Who doesn’t want olive oil from Italy and freshly baked bread to bring on, say, a summer picnic? Sounds yummy, right? Don’t forget to pick up some made in the USA spoons to eat your delicious fare. And you can wash it all down with some imported liquor. Well, not so fast. These advertised claims don’t seem to hold up. Italian olive oil : According to the complaint, the companies label various olive oil products as “imported from Italy” when, in reality, the oil is not made from olives that are grown or pressed in Italy. German beer : The company agreed to include the phrase “Brewed in USA” or “Product of USA” on the bottles, cans, packaging, and website for Beck’s Beer for a period of five years Russian vodka : The country of origin is often a selling point on a product label, but a company’s desire to associate a brand with a particular country is really a business decision. And consumers should do their research to find out how much of the product really comes from that country so they can decide for themselves whether, well, it’s Russian vodka or not. Kentucky bourbon : A class-action lawsuit was filed against The Bulleit Distilling Co for allegedly marketing red/orange label Bulleit Bourbon as being distilled, aged, and bottled in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky when, in reality, the company does not “currently” operate a distillery in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky and the bourbon is produced by Kirin Brewing Co. Poland Spring bottled water : Many people drink bottled water assuming that it’s better than the water they can get from the tap. Most of the time, however, that’s not the case. Compared to bottled water, tap is more rigorously tested for safety, better for the environment, and costs up to 2,900 times less. Freshly baked bread: Three class-action lawsuits were transferred to federal court in January 2015 against three different supermarket chains for allegedly falsely marketing bread as freshly made and made in the stores when the bread was actually made somewhere else, delivered to the stores frozen, and re-baked or partially baked at the store", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T09:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T09:38:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
