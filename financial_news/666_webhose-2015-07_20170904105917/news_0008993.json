Reuters Take James Packer's Crown Resorts for example. After being sold off in recent months the stock got a boost last week when visa changes in Macau helped spark hopes that the big drop in gambling turnover seen this year could be somewhat reversed .\nBut with Chinese consumers nursing big losses from the casino that is their sharemarket, will they be forced to trim their gambling stakes accordingly? It's not hard to imagine that there could be a bit less disposable income available to be tossed away in Macau in the coming months.\nCrown shares dropped 4 per cent on Wednesday and Melco Crown shares, which had jumped 7.5 per cent on Tuesday night, fell 6.1 per cent to $US20.15 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday night.\nEmployment classifieds giant Seek might seem far removed from the travails of the Chinese market, but it owns a majority stake in Chinese job ad website Zhaopin.\n The company, which Seek floated on the New York Stock exchange last year, has been a great growth engine for Seek, but its shares fell 6 per cent on Tuesday night and recovered slightly by 1.9 per cent on Wednesday night. Seek shares dropped 3.52 per cent on Wednesday.\nWhether the market crash hit employment remains a question for debate, but it's not inconceivable that employment for professional roles could come under pressure if the economy slows.\nHospital operator Ramsay Health Care has become a true market darling in recent years â€“ well run, great strategy and perfectly placed to ride the ageing population wave.\nBut it too has some exposure to China via the joint venture it formed with Chengdu Jinxin Healthcare Investment Management Group this year to operate private hospitals in the city of Chengdu.\nCould demand for healthcare services be hit by a sharemarket crash? It seems unlikely, but again, a drop in disposable income could flow through to a sector like this.", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/shanghai_short_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-07-09T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:09:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
