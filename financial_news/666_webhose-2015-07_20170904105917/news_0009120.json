That is above the long-term average which they say is 48%. \nIt is early days—the data only account for 32 out of 270 companies— but the results “give grounds for optimism”, strategists at the bank write. \nFund managers are taking notice. \n“We’ve seen almost no sign of earnings growth in Europe for more than five years. Now is the time that we need the earnings to come through – and they are starting to do just that,” said Michael Barakos, chief investment officer for European equities at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, which has around $1.8 trillion in assets under management. \nA weaker euro has been the main driver for the strong performance of European equities over the past quarter, HSBC says. \nA fall in the currency tends to boost demand for goods produced within the eurozone from buyers outside of the eurozone. Despite stabilizing in recent months, the euro remains close to 10% lower against the U.S. dollar so far this year. \nBut it is not all about exchange rates. \nThe HSBC strategists say that economic growth is returning to Europe, which is supporting production and demand. And HSBC isn’t alone in its optimism on European earnings and stock performance. \nEarlier this week, analysts at Goldman Sachs published a note in which they predicted the Stoxx Europe 600—the region’s benchmark index—will rise by 1.9% over the next three months. \nThey wrote that over the last few weeks, the better growth picture in Europe had been overshadowed by risks relating to Greece. \n“With the new bailout deal being finalized, we think the focus will shift back to macro fundamentals, at least in the near-term,” the Goldman analysts wrote. \nStocks in Europe earlier this week capped their longest winning streak since April 2014, largely fueled by Athens striking a deal with creditors to negotiate a new bailout. \nFrom its May high to its July low, the Stoxx Europe 600 slipped more than 9%. So far in July it is up close to 5% and it is within reaching distance of an all-time high hit in April this year. \nBut some investors are growing cautious on European stock markets after the recent rally. \nRussell Investments marginally increased its exposure to European shares on July 14, after Greece clinched a deal to negotiate a fresh bailout with its international creditors. \nInvestment strategists at the company have said that if the Stoxx Europe 600 hits an all-time high shares would look expensive and they would consider selling.
