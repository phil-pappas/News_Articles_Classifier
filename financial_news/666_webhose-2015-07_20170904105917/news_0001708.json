Some expressed their anger on social media, with the Twitter (Swiss: TWTR.SW - news ) hashtag #ThisIsACoup trending. \nGreece's public servants are also to stage a 24-hour strike on Wednesday, the first big stoppage since Tsipras took power. \nHaralambos Rouliskos, a 60-year-old economist, described the deal as \"misery, humiliation and slavery\". \nThe eurozone creditors \"are trying to blackmail us,\" said Katerina Katsaba, a 52-year-old working for a pharmaceutical company. \nFaced with a eurozone deeply distrustful of Athens after five months of tense meetings, 40-year-old Tsipras had to agree to demands that critics say rob Greece of financial independence. \n\"This agreement may pass with (opposition party) votes, but it will never pass the people,\" said the head of a hardline Syriza faction, Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis. \nIf Greece does pass it, Europe's next step would be to push the deal through several national parliaments, many in countries that are loath to afford Athens more help. \nGermany's Bundestag is likely to vote on Friday, provided the Greek parliament rushes through the four new market-oriented laws by Wednesday. \nA new poll said 55 percent of Germans supported their chancellor, Angela Merkel, on the bailout deal, while a third said they would have preferred a so-called Grexit. \nDespite strong opposition, Tsipras yielded to a plan to park assets for privatisation worth up to 50 billion euros in a special fund. \nSome 25 billion euros of the money in that fund will then be used to recapitalise Greece's banks. \n- Payments due - \nThe deal contains little specific mention of relieving a Greek debt mountain worth 180 percent of Gross Domestic Product -- a step recommended by the International Monetary Fund. \nThe eurozone must now unite to tackle the immediate problem of finding funds to keep Greece afloat as Athens faces several huge debt payments to the European Central Bank and other creditors, while the bailout could take weeks if not months to finalise. It is to pay a 4.2-billion-euro instalment to the ECB next Monday. \nEurozone finance ministers were meeting Tuesday to consider bridge funding for Greece, but officials said there was no easy solution. \nThe ECB meanwhile has kept Greek banks afloat -- barely -- with emergency liquidity, but has refused to provide extra funds needed to reopen lenders, which have been closed for over a week. \nBanks will stay closed in Greece until Wednesday, the finance ministry said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T19:45:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
