And while some of the trades listed are rather obvious, others are not. \nTo generate its ranking, CareerCast focuses on two factors -- degree of hazards personally faced and degree of peril faced by others working alongside -- to define on-the-job danger. It has also taken into account injury tracking and work-related distressed statistics gathered from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor and U.S. Census. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the final count of fatal work injuries in the United States in 2013 was 4,585 -- the second-lowest annual total recorded since the census was first conducted in 1992. More Headlines \nCertain groups were affected disproportionately. Men accounted for 4,265 fatal occupational injuries, while women represented 319. Transportation incidents caused 1,865 deaths, violence and injury by people or animal caused 773, and falls, slips and trips led to 724. \nHere is a deeper look at the 10 most dangerous jobs in the U.S. \nAirline Pilot Annual Median Wage: $98,410 Projected Growth by 2022: -1% \nThe perils faced by pilots largely depend on where they're employed. National Transportation Safety Board statistics show that the general aviation accident rate dropped to a 20-year low in 2013; however, on-demand operations including charter, air taxi, air tour and air medical experienced more accidents than the previous year. \nPilots may face another unforeseen risk in their exposure to the sun while flying. According to a report from JAMA Dermatology reported by U.S. News , the windshields used in airplanes are not strong enough to protect the inside of a plane from UV radiation. \nThe BLS lists the annual median pay for airline and commercial pilots at $98,410 per year. The job outlook is rather stagnate, and the field is expected to shrink by 1% from 2012 to 2022. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T15:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:45:34.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
