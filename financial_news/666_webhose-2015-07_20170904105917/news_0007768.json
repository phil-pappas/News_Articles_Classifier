He said he would not accept the Senate's plan, and said it should instead approve a House-passed five-month extension of transportation funding aimed at buying time for a long-term deal in the autumn.\n\"We're not taking up the Senate bill,\" McCarthy told reporters, adding that the House intends to start a five-week summer recess on Thursday and there was too little time to take up the complex, 1,030-page Senate bill, which authorizes spending for six years but only contains specific funding for about three years worth of projects.\nBut Senate pressed ahead with its mult-year approach, clearing another procedural vote Monday night that sets up at least two more days of debate that could end in a tense standoff with the House.\n\"Time is running out to get this bill through Congress,\" Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in remarks on the Senate floor. \"We're up against a deadline at the end of the week. Jobs are on the line.\"\nThe highway fund pays for about half of the country's highway and transit projects and is about to go broke because lawmakers for 22 years have been unwilling to raise the gasoline and diesel taxes that have historically fed it.\nThe highway funding jam-up also made it less likely that the idled Ex-Im Bank will be revived this week as part of a highway funding bill. The trade bank's next chance to resume lending and guarantee operations would not likely come until September.\nThe Senate late on Monday will vote to formally attach a renewal of Ex-Im's expired charter to the transport measure, a move that has strong support. House Speaker John Boehner has pledged to take up any such legislation from the Senate under an open amendment process.
