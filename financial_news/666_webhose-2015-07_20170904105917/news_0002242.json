Written by: William Richards 07/13/15 - 4:08 PM EDT \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — LGBTQ Americans received excellent news after the Supreme Court’s ruling on June 26 that the Constitution, in fact, guarantees a nationwide right to marry regardless of sexual orientation. The wedding industry celebrated, too—overnight, its cake makers, decorators, planners and tailors found an estimated 4.5 million couples who could potentially become customers when they get set to exchange vows. \nSo how much are those nuptials worth? \nAbout $2.6 billion in total spending, according to UCLA’s Williams Institute, which conducts independent research on sexual orientation, gender identity and public policy. It released an infographic this month that offers a stunning snapshot of the business impact of same-sex marriage. The $2.6 billion in spending also reflects $184.7 million revenue for states, too, especially California, Florida, New York, and Texas (with Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Washington in close second).

In total, he says, same-sex marriage will add about 75,000 to 90,000 weddings per year to the total number in the U.S., which he estimates to be 2.1 million . \nOf course, the 75,000 or 90,000 lucky people tying the knot will still have to deal with same things that have long made weddings memorable: meddling aunts, flaky caterers, sloppy bridesmaids, cringe-worthy toasts and uncooperative weather. But, if some analysts are right, and the buying power of the LBGT community is north of $800 billion annually , will it up-the-ante on the average cost of weddings, which The Knot puts at $31,000? \nThere are two reasons why it won’t. \nFirst, as The Atlantic pointed out last year, the “myth of gay affluence” is quite a myth, indeed, based on the assumption that the LGBTQ community's buying power is far greater than that of its heterosexual counterparts. The writer, Nathan McDermott, even called it “a pernicious insinuation.” On the day of the Supreme Court’s decision last month, The Knot released its third annual LGBTQ Weddings Study , which helped dispel this myth: in the LGBTQ community, men spend an average of $15,992 on their weddings, while women, opting for relative frugality, only spend an average of $13,055—half the national average for the straight community. \nSo, no: more same-sex weddings will not necessarily mean that the national average cost per wedding will skyrocket. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T23:57:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
