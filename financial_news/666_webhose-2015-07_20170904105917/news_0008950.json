Peter Braig Share on twitter by Vesna Poljak Fund managers are having their moment as the ranks of Australia's professional investors swell with smaller, more specialised boutiques targeting the small-cap space which has emerged as the new battleground in stockpicking.\nIn Mercer's survey of Australian fund manager performance for 2014-15, released this past week, 149 investment managers contested the local shares category. Many other investors don't participate in the survey, making a firm figure around industry size hard to establish.\nWhat is clear is that a bull market has made every stockpicker's dream of managing money for a living possible. What is less clear is how many will be around if markets reverse sharply.\nThe hyper-competitive nature of stockpicking lures some great talents to the funds management industry. Cracking the large-cap space is hard for a start-up because the institutional fund managers and superannuation funds tend to dominate. Because of their size, these investors often limit themselves to top-100 stocks where there is sufficient liquidity.\nThat leaves the rest as fair game.\n\"If you're out on your own investing, it's your name that's next to those performance numbers rather than an entity's name,\" explains Smallco's portfolio manager Craig Miller about the lure of small-shop investing.\nSmallco has quietly built an enviable performance record, ranking equal second in 2014-15 with a return of 20.1 per cent for its top fund, bettering its fourth spot from the year before.\nIn many ways, Smallco is the modern boutique model. Funds under management are purposely modest, around $550 million, and its top talent are people who left the institutional world behind. Andrew Hokin​, who used to be the banking analyst at Macquarie, was lured to the Sydney-based fund run by Rob Hopkins, who used to work at Macquarie too.\n \"Andrew is a stunningly competitive and driven person and the opportunity to be really tested is very appealing to him,\" says Miller, who likens good fund managers to good chief executives. \"Both need to be able to tell when a business is about to succeed or when it will fail. The best MDs have that ability to calculate whether an opportunity's worth putting money into or not and similarly a good fund manager will be able to tell that as well.\"\nHumble Pie has huge success Another success story, from truly humble origins, is Auckland-based Pie Funds Management run by Mike Taylor. \"For the fund manager, there is a huge feel-good factor when a client writes in to say, 'that money I gave you five years ago, that's helped pay for a deposit on my house, cheers',\" says Taylor.\nThat's because small-cap managers tend to have a closer connection with the retail market, who are just regular people with money to invest.\n\"Funds management is cyclical. Bull markets attract more entrants. Bear markets, they leave in droves,\" Taylor notes.\nThe huge superannuation pool is certainly relevant to the health of the funds management industry, but it is far from a safety net.\n\"I don't think that means that uncompetitive businesses are able to make super profits, there are still market forces that will reward talented managers and we have seen the closure of unprofitable businesses,\" says Mercer's Clare Armstrong.\n\"The disposition of a lot of investment managers is they're ambitious and they're competitive. They're confident, motivated ambitious, talented people and it's always a good time for those people to set up new businesses,\" she says.\nYet even fund managers are not immune to a business cycle.\nThe sharemarket has sputtered into 2015-16 and is up 3.9 per cent so far at the same time as volatility stages a comeback. Investors hate volatility and this makes equities and more so, small caps, a tougher sell. That's when the incredible alpha that can be generated in smalls risks evaporating.\nSmallco's Mr Miller says it's a bad idea to go out alone as a fund manager just because markets are buoyant. Still, \"It's a lot easier to set up boutique now than it was in March 2009. For the 18 month prior to March 2009 we didn't have a lot of inflows,\" he recalls.\nGiven it takes up to two years to get running – though some big names with a track record can move faster – anyone contemplating the break now would have to back themselves given the outlook for investment returns looks shakier.\nYet it is understood that the independent and bank-owned incubators, which are always looking to seed new talent, are still getting lots of calls as the next generation of investors plot their big breaks.\n\"At the moment we are looking at a lot of early movers in boutiques now reaching a stage where they're contemplating retirement, there's still people coming through institutional businesses that would look to start their own business at a point when the time is right and the economic environment is supportive,\" says Mercer's Armstrong.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/@Tim_ber_wolf"], "published": "2015-07-17T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:03:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
