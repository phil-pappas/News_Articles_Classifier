Asia Pacific is again home to the biggest portion with 238,000, or 39 percent. \nThe additional staff will be needed to run a projected 38,000 new aircraft added to the global fleet over the next 20 years, the US aerospace giant said. Boeing has 17 training campuses worldwide. \n\"The challenge of meeting the global demand for airline professionals will not be solved by one company alone,\" said Sherry Carbary, vice president of Boeing Flight Services. \n\"Aircraft manufacturers, airlines, training equipment manufacturers, training delivery organizations, regulatory agencies and educational institutions are all stepping up to meet the increasing need to train and certify pilots and technicians.\" \nCompared with the company's 2014 outlook, pilot demand was up more than four percent and demand for technicians rose about five percent. \nAfter Asia Pacific, North America and Europe were tied for second place in Boeing's latest forecast for pilots, with 95,000 new hires projected over the next 20 years. \nThey were followed by Middle East (60,000 new pilots), Latin America (+47,000), Africa (+18,000) and Russia/CIS (Taiwan OTC: 5864.TWO - news ) (+17,000). \nNorth America was second as far as new technician staff needed with 113,000, followed by Europe (+101,000), Middle East (+66,000), Latin America (+47,000) and Africa and Russia/CIS (both +22,000).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T22:35:55.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
