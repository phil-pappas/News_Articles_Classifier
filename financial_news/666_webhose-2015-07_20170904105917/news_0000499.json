Reuters by Guy Cranswick Late last month, the Minister for Communications, Malcolm Turnbull, introduced a report entitled Australia's future workforce? by CEDA, the Committee for Economic Development of Australia. CEDA is an independent national organisation that works with 700 of Australia's leading businesses. The report analyses various technologies and their effects on the future shape of the workforce. The range of technologies will include cloud, software, and analytics, depicted as engines or levers or catalysts for future productivity.\nAs the report notes, \"Technological change has frequently created losers, but when job losses have been caused by productivity-enhancing technologies, they have tended to create demand via higher incomes and lower prices, which have generated new jobs economy-wide.\"\nThe report treads on fairly safe ground. CEDA has not shaken consensus opinions, here or abroad, on the next wave of technology in the workplace. As with any set of forecasts, elements can be challenged and these reports tend to offer bright futures and easy transitions. Whether automation can be beneficial to the labour market, or if some industries can manage change and disruption, or are even capable of adapting, is not certain, but the main outlook from the report's many authors looks credible enough.\nShould the CEDA analysis prove to be right it means that the focus on technologies will be more acute, to drive productivity and deliver growth to ensure living standards in the future.\nThis does not entail a pipedream about artificial intelligence or big data, which are uncertain now. Greater consideration of technology means capital expenditure, resourcing, integration and interpretation. It means a transition in the process architecture of organisations. It may involve a major change which boards enact and shareholders agree is required for the future direction and vitality of their organisations.\nSuch a perspective over technology and the future of work may seem recent, but 40 years ago BusinessWeek published a long article called The Office of the Future in which the technologies, now taken for granted, were explored. It now seems quaint, but the office of 1995 and beyond was depicted in a rosy light: reducing costs, enhancing productivity and offering degrees of efficiency that seemed idyllic 40 years ago. Well, 1975 was a bleak year in the US economy.\nAdam Smith was similarly moved in The Wealth of Nations (1776) to enthuse about pin manufacturing. Although ostensibly discussing the division of labour, his argument is based and depends on the technology that could increase worker productivity and hence value.\nAt a glance, the office, a pin factory and the cloud seem unconnected. The 1975 office was modelled on the factory; it simply processed various types of information through an organisation. Despite being separated by almost 200 years, both Adam Smith and BusinessWeek focus on the same thing: process.\n For Smith it was the specialisation of labour in conjunction with technologies that increase output. In 1975 the promise was about reducing drag and friction in workflow processes through technologies. Additionally, just like the factory, the process, as steered and managed by people, can add value. Importantly, technology changed jobs. In 1975 secretaries were plentiful but two decades later male managers were expected to type on their own word processors.\nCEDA's predictions for cloud and other technologies raising efficiency and productivity echoes Adam Smith's perspective of the factory tools and their utilisation by labour.\nThere is, however, one difference in the CEDA analysis, and that is that the process won't necessarily require people. The lower-qualified and more routine roles will be automated, and that includes many roles normally seen as the exclusive prerogative of humans. This slightly disturbing view is not unique to Australia, as other institutions around the world agree on the outlook, even if the effects are slightly different between countries.\nThe interesting comparison between the two is that Smith's observation of pin manufacturing was of a genuine innovation; the BusinessWeek perspective is not in the same category, because the technology improves an inherited model of office functions. That model is based on a process about 200 years old at the time, and survives today.\nNo change will happen quickly, but it is still likely to happen because, as in 1776 and 1975, the forces that drive the adoption of new technologies want a greater return on capital. The same forces are going to drive the next wave in working practices and technologies too.\nThe organisational future of the workplace appears very different. It will be less tied to old work routines, will have no more desktops and all the other paraphernalia that old offices have, and will be more mobile and flexible, cutting fixed costs that organisations don't want on their bottom line. These tools, like the designed pin-making tools Smith observed, alter how labour does its job, how it's divided and applied.\nThe one thing that is vague in the 2015 forecasts is how workers will be creators of value. In Smith's and BusinessWeek 's version of work, value increased through productivity efficiency and a share of earnings accrued to workers. But in the future, productivity efficiency will entail the loss of the more routine jobs. They will be taken over by automation, and only very highly skilled, and so-called \"creative\" workers will be rewarded.\nNot everyone can be a skilled and creative worker, a biotech engineer or a composer of TV themes. In other words, technology still defines the division of labour just as Smith observed so many years ago, but in the future there will be robots and software algorithms, not humans, on the other side of the divide.\nThe signs of this are already apparent, but what big data and Google and IBM and other new firms dedicated to this type of information automation are doing to move the divide will grow much faster in the next two to three years\nWhat's needed is a new generation of Adam Smiths, to ponder the new division of labour and the pin factory, and wonder how to make it work as well it as it should.\nThe CEDA forecasts may not turn out exactly; forecasts frequently miss their deadlines though they can be right at a later time. Understanding what's coming and being ready can be halfway to having the right plan.\nGuy Cranswick is a founding analyst of IBRS, a company that provides technology and research advice to businesses.", "external_links": ["http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/1975-06-30/the-office-of-the-futurebusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice", "http://adminpanel.ceda.com.au/FOLDERS/Service/Files/Documents/26792~Futureworkforce_June2015.pdf"], "published": "2015-07-13T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:07:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
