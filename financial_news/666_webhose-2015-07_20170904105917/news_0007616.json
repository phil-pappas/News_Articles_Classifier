2) Be transparent and democratic; 3) Set strong standards and make sure they're followed; 4) Promote sustainable development,\" the signatories added. \nGretchen Gordon, coordinator of Bank on Human Rights, a global network of social movements and grassroots organisations working to hold international financial institutions accountable to human rights obligations, told IPS, \"[Although] the Bank's Articles of Agreement have an article on Transparency and Accountability [... ] thus far we haven't seen any indication of operational policies on transparency or anything relating to accountability mechanisms.\" \n\"And unfortunately,\" she added, \"there is no open engagement with civil society on these questions.\" \n\"In terms of the type of development the bank delivers, we don't have signs yet that the NDB will go in a qualitatively different direction than the Washington Consensus institutions,\" Gordon told IPS in an email. \n\"That is why civil society groups in BRICS countries are calling for a participative and transparent process to identify strategies and policies for the NDB that can set it on a different path and actually deliver development.\" \nA primary concern among NGOs has been that the BRICS bank will replicate the old \"mega-project\" model of development, which has proven to be a failure both in terms of poverty eradication and increased access to basic services. \nA recent international investigation revealed that in the course of a single decade, an estimated 3.4 million poor people - primarily from Asia, Africa and Latin America - were displaced by mega-projects funded by the World Bank and its private sector lending arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC). \nThough these projects were ostensibly aimed at strengthening transportation networks, expanding electric grids and improving water supply systems, they resulted in a worsening of poverty and inequality for millions of already marginalised people. \nFollowing closely on the heels of this damning expose, a major report by the international watchdog Human Rights Watch (HRW) found that the Bank's lax safeguards and protocols resulted in a range of rights violations against those who spoke out against the economic, social and environmental fallout of Bank-funded projects. \nBehind this track record, rights groups and NGOs are concerned that a new development bank operating on within a broken framework will contribute to the spiral of violence and poverty that has marked the age of mega-projects. \nAt a time when one billion people lack access to an all-weather road, 783 million people live without clean water supplies and 1.3 billion people are not connected to an electricity grid, there is no doubt that the developing world stands to gain greatly from a Southern-led financial institution. \nWhat remains to be seen is to what extent the new bank will move away from the old model of financing and truly set a standard for inclusive and pro-poor development. \nEdited by Kitty Stapp", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T18:03:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
