NOTABLE ITEMS FOR THE QUARTER INCLUDE: NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED 9.5% OVER THE COMPARABLE QUARTER OF 2014 LOANS HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT, NET, INCREASED 9.9% TO $2.20 BILLION ORIGINATED $149.7 MILLION LOANS PURCHASED $127.4 MILLION RESIDENTIAL LOANS DEPOSITS INCREASED 11.4% TO $1.98 BILLION ASSET QUALITY REMAINED STRONG WITH NONPERFORMING ASSETS TO TOTAL ASSETS AT 0.48% APPROXIMATELY 1.7 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REPURCHASED CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.07 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK DECLARED PAYABLE AUGUST 19, 2015, TO STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF AUGUST 5, 2015 \nWOODBRIDGE, N.J., July 22,   NORTHFIELD BANCORP, INC. (Nasdaq: NFBK ) , the holding company for Northfield Bank, reported diluted earnings per common share of $0.10 and $0.21 for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to diluted earnings per common share of $0.11 and $0.20 for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2014. Earnings for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2015, reflected a tax charge of $795,000, or $0.02 per share, related to the write-down of deferred tax assets as a result of New York City tax reforms enacted during the current quarter. \nJohn W. Alexander, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"Northfield's strong loan growth and the purchase of a loan pool, helped reduce capital to 17.7% of total assets at quarter end, down from 19.7% at the end of 2014. Our stock repurchase program continued in the quarter with approximately 1.7 million shares being acquired. We also continue to evaluate other opportunities to deploy capital including acquisitions of other banks, branches, or specialty lenders.\" \n\"I also am pleased to announce,\" Mr. Alexander added, \"the declaration of a $0.07 per common share dividend by the Board of Directors. This dividend will be payable August 19, 2015, to stockholders of record on August 5, 2015.\" \nResults of Operations \nComparison of Operating Results for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 \nNet income was $9.3 million and $10.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, and June 30, 2014, respectively. Significant variances from the comparable prior year period are as follows: a $2.6 million increase in net interest income, a $449,000 decrease in non-interest income, a $4.1 million increase in non-interest expense, and a $507,000 decrease in income tax expense. \nNet interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2015, increased $2.6 million, or 7.0%, primarily due to a $348.9 million, or 14.0%, increase in our average interest-earning assets, partially offset by a 19 basis point decrease in our net interest margin to 2.85%. The increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily attributable to an increase in average loans outstanding of $515.8 million, and an increase in interest-earning deposits in financial institutions of $31.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in average mortgage-backed securities of $184.5 million and other securities of $24.0 million. Yields earned on interest-earning assets decreased 10 basis points to 3.53% for the six months ended June 30, 2015, from 3.63% for the comparable prior year period. Interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2015, included loan prepayment income of $1.2 million, compared to $734,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2015, also was affected by an increase in interest expense, driven by a $441.8 million, or 25.4%, increase in our average interest-bearing liabilities. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased four basis points to 0.88% for the current six months as compared to 0.84% for the comparable prior year period, resulting from an increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by lower rates on borrowed funds. \nThe provision for loan losses increased slightly by $1,000 to $272,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015, from $271,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Net charge-offs were $1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to net recoveries of $41,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The increased level of charge-offs is primarily related to five previously impaired loans to one borrower that were restructured during the first quarter of 2015. The loans had existing specific reserves associated with them that adequately covered the charge-offs, resulting in no material effect on the provision for loan losses for the current period. At June 30, 2015, the loan balance of the restructured loan was $6.1 million, with a related specific reserve of $827,000. \nNon-interest income decreased $449,000, or 9.8%, to $4.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, from $4.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014, due to a decrease in fees and service charges for customer services of $158,000, a decrease in gains on securities transactions, net, of $389,000, and a decrease in income on bank owned life insurance of $86,000. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in other income of $184,000, primarily related to a $129,000 realized gain on the sale of an other real estate owned property during the six months ended June 30, 2015. \nNon-interest expense increased $4.1 million, or 16.4%, to $28.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, from $24.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. This was primarily due to a $3.5 million increase in compensation and employee benefits, primarily attributable to increased salary expense, health benefit costs and stock compensation expense, related to stock awards issued in 2014, a $179,000 increase in occupancy costs, a $166,000 increase in FDIC insurance costs and a $249,000 increase in other expenses, primarily attributable to an increase in Directors' stock awards. By comparison, non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2014, was favorably affected by a pre-tax gain of $937,000 related to the settlement of the former Flatbush Federal Savings & Loan Association pension plan. \nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $6.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to $6.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2015, was 39.2% compared to 37.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2015, included a deferred tax asset write-down of $795,000 related to New York City tax reforms enacted in April 2015, whereas the comparable prior year period included a deferred tax asset write-down of $570,000 related to New York State tax reforms enacted in March 2014. \nComparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 \nNet income was $4.3 million and $5.4 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Significant variances from the comparable prior year period are as follows: a $1.8 million increase in net interest income, a $218,000 increase in the provision for loan losses, a $381,000 decrease in non-interest income, a $1.8 million increase in non-interest expense, and a $495,000 increase in income tax expense. \nNet interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, increased $1.8 million, or 9.5%, primarily due to an increase in average interest-earning assets of $356.2 million, or 14.3%, partially offset by a 13 basis point decrease in our net interest margin to 2.85%. The increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily attributable to an increase in average loans outstanding of $562.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in average mortgage-backed securities of $201.1 million. Yields earned on interest-earning assets decreased four basis points to 3.52% for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, from 3.56% for the comparable prior year quarter. Interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, included loan prepayment income of $653,000, as compared to $199,000, for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. Net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, also was affected by an increase in interest expense, driven by a $450.3 million, or 25.8%, increase in our average interest-bearing liabilities. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased four basis points to 0.87% for the current quarter as compared to 0.83% for the comparable prior year period, driven by an increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by lower rates on borrowed funds. \nThe provision for loan losses increased $218,000 to $72,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, from a recovery of $146,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. The increase in the provision for loan losses was due to loan growth, whereas the prior year quarter included the reversal of previously recorded impairments in the Company's purchased credit-impaired (\"PCI\") portfolio. Originated loans grew approximately $83.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared to $63.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. Net charge-offs were $454,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared to net charge-offs of $158,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. \nNon-interest income decreased $381,000, or 16.0%, to $2.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, from $2.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. This decrease was primarily a result of a $326,000 decrease in gains on securities transactions, net, and a decrease in fees and service charges for customer services of $54,000. Securities losses, net, in the second quarter of 2015 included losses of $50,000 related to the Company's trading portfolio, while the second quarter of 2014 included gains of $175,000 related to the Company's trading portfolio. The trading portfolio is utilized to fund the Company's deferred compensation obligation to certain employees and directors of the Company's deferred compensation plan (the Plan). The participants of this Plan, at their election, defer a portion of their compensation. Gains and losses on trading securities have no effect on net income since participants benefit from, and bear the full risk of, changes in the trading securities market values. Therefore, the Company records an equal and offsetting amount in compensation expense, reflecting the change in the Company's obligations under the Plan. \nNon-interest expense increased $1.8 million, or 14.3%, to $14.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, from $12.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. This increase was primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in compensation and employee benefits, largely attributable to increased stock compensation expense, related to stock awards issued in June 2014, a $187,000 increase in occupancy costs, and a $421,000 increase in other expenses, attributable to Directors' stock awards issued in June 2014. \nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $3.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared to $2.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, was 44.3% as a result of the deferred tax asset write-down of $795,000 related to New York City tax law reforms enacted in April 2015, as compared to 34.9% for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. \nComparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2015, and March 31, 2015 \nNet income was $4.3 million and $5.0 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2015, and March 31, 2015, respectively. Significant variances from the prior quarter are as follows: a $301,000 increase in net interest income, a $128,000 decrease in the provision for loan losses, a $98,000 decrease in non-interest income, a $214,000 increase in non-interest expense, and an $824,000 increase in income tax expense. \nNet interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, increased $301,000, or 1.5%, due primarily to an increase in average interest-earning assets of $9.3 million, or 0.3%, while net interest margin remained level at 2.85%. The increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily attributable to an increase in average loans outstanding of $106.3 million, partially offset by decreases in average mortgage-backed securities of $50.4 million, other securities of $23.8 million, and average interest-earning deposits in financial institutions of $19.5 million. The June 2015 quarter included loan prepayment income of $653,000 as compared to $562,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. Yields earned on interest-earning assets decreased by one basis point to 3.52% for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 from 3.53% for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased two basis points to 0.87% for the current quarter, as compared to 0.89% for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, primarily due to lower average borrowings balances and rates paid on broker deposits. \nThe provision for loan losses decreased $128,000 to $72,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, from $200,000 for the quarter ended March 2015. The decrease in the provision for loan losses during the quarter ended June 30, 2015, was primarily the result of continued improvement in asset quality indicators. Net charge-offs were $454,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared to net charge-offs of $594,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. \nNon-interest income decreased by $98,000, or 4.7%, to $2.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, from $2.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, due to losses on securities transactions, net, of $68,000, and a decrease in other income of $81,000, partially offset by an increase in fees and service charges for customer services of $51,000. \nNon-interest expense increased $214,000, or 1.5%, to $14.5 million, for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, from $14.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, primarily due to increases in compensation and employee benefits of $127,000, professional fees of $145,000, and other expense of $88,000, partially offset by a decrease of $146,000 in occupancy costs. \nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $3.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared to $2.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, was 44.3%, as compared to 34.1% for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. The June 2015 quarter included a tax charge of $795,000 related to the write-down of deferred tax assets as a result of the previously mentioned New York City tax reforms enacted in April 2015. \nFinancial Condition \nTotal assets increased $126.4 million, or 4.2%, to $3.15 billion at June 30, 2015, from $3.02 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in loans held-for-investment, net, of $260.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in securities available-for-sale of $131.0 million. \nTotal loans held-for-investment, net, increased $260.6 million to $2.20 billion at June 30, 2015, as compared to $1.94 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in originated loans held-for-investment, net, and loans acquired, partially offset by a decrease in PCI loans held-for-investment. \nOriginated loans held-for-investment, net, totaled $1.79 billion at June 30, 2015, as compared to $1.63 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in multifamily real estate loans of $146.5 million, or 13.7%, to $1.22 billion at June 30, 2015, from $1.07 billion at December 31, 2014.
