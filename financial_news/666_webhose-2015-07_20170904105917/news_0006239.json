A physical therapist, she started at St. Louis Place and Rehab, a Florissant, Mo. facility when it was owned by Missouri-based Benchmark Healthcare. \nAmong the benefits: she could borrow money from her employer. That was particularly appealing when she got into a sticky situation in 2009. \n“I was caught up short on money, just every day things, and I went in to the management and asked if I could have an advance on my salary,” she recalls. “They said, ‘We don’t do advances, but we can let you have a loan.’” More Headlines Retiring in Style: Do You Have Enough Money? \nA payday loan. Whitfield says her employer didn’t call it that, but it had the payday loan earmarks: no credit check, a triple-digit annual percentage rate (APR) and two weeks to pay it off. Her employer deducted what she owed straight from her pay check. Whitfield borrowed not because of an emergency but to meet every day expenses. \nPayday loans come in small amounts, but the $300 loan cost her $355. Based on the payday loan calculator at the Missouri Division of Finance Website, the fees equaled a 425% annual percentage rate (APR). Whitfield was lucky; rather than take back-to-back loans and end up paying thousands of dollars on the few hundred she borrowed, she only renewed her loan once. Borrowers typically find that they're broke as soon as they pay it off--and have to borrow again. \nThe Pew Charitable Trust’s 2012 study, Payday Lending in America , found that the initial loan is routinely renewed. “On average,” Pew said, “a borrower takes out eight loans of $375 each per year and spends $520 on interest.” Pew also found that 69% of borrowers took them for routine expenses; only 16% used them for emergencies, which is what the industry claims they’re used for. Some 12 million Americans take these loans each year. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T19:18:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
