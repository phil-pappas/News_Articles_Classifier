In addition to the continuous trend towards more casual clothing styles in workplaces and for formal occasions rising demand for new styles of jeans with intricate designs made from high-quality materials created growth opportunities. In particular German women were intrigued by modern styles in line with the latest fashion trends and jeans that emphasise their individual feminine features. Positive growth was therefore registered in both value and volume terms in jeans in 2014.\nCompetitive Landscape\nWith an even wider selection of fashionable jeans lines than before H&M managed to increase its value share in jeans in 2014 taking the leading position in the category in the process. Its main competitor C&A saw a slight value sales decline in 2014 resulting in its value share dropping by one percentage point as the company finished the year with slightly lower value sales than H&M. Each of these companies enjoys a rather high level of consumer trust and loyalty while H&M has managed to improve consumer awareness of its brand and bolster its appeal to consumers. The use of large-scale advertising campaigns and celebrity brand ambassadors supported the overall success of the company during 2014 propelling it into the leading position in jeans.\nFull Report Details at\n - \nIndustry Prospects\nDespite the growing levels of saturation in jeans in Germany the category is set to post positive value growth at constant 2014 prices over the forecast period. This positive development is likely to be mostly attributable to the ongoing future demand for well-designed jeans made from high-quality materials as companies seek to promote jeans a suitable attire for more formal functions and situations. Many men and women are expected to substitute their formalwear with more smart-casual attire although this will still need be to maintain a certain level of sophistication and adequate appeal. Thus the average unit price of jeans is expected to rise in constant 2014 terms over the forecast period contributing to the positive overall value growth expected in the category.\nReport Overview\nDiscover the latest market trends and uncover sources of future market growth for the Jeans industry in Germany with research from Euromonitor's team of in-country analysts.\nFind hidden opportunities in the most current research data available understand competitive threats with our detailed market analysis and plan your corporate strategy with our expert qualitative analysis and growth projections.\nIf you're in the Jeans industry in Germany our research will save you time and money while empowering you to make informed profitable decisions.\nThe Jeans in Germany market research report includes:\n * Analysis of key supply-side and demand trends\n * Detailed segmentation of international and local products\n * Historic volumes and values company and brand market shares\n * Five year forecasts of market trends and market growth \n * Robust and transparent market research methodology conducted in-country\nOur market research reports answer questions such as:\n * What is the market size of Jeans in Germany?\n * What are the major brands in Germany?\n * How dynamic is the growth of clothing and footwear internet sales?\n * What is the performance of women’s clothing vs men’s clothing?\n * What % of clothing and footwear sales goes through grocery retailers?\nReasons to Get this Report\n * Gain competitive intelligence about market leaders\n * Track key industry trends opportunities and threats\n * Inform your marketing brand strategy and market development sales and supply functions\nPartial Table of Contents:\nJEANS IN GERMANY\nEuromonitor International\nJune 2015\nLIST OF CONTENTS AND TABLES\nHeadlines\nTrends\nCompetitive Landscape\nProspects\nCategory Data\nTable 1 Sales of Jeans: Volume 2009-2014\nTable 2 Sales of Jeans: Value 2009-2014\nTable 3 Sales of Jeans: % Volume Growth 2009-2014\nTable 4 Sales of Jeans: % Value Growth 2009-2014\nTable 5 Sales of Men's Jeans: Volume 2009-2014\nTable 6 Sales of Men's Jeans: Value 2009-2014\nTable 7 Sales of Men's Jeans: % Volume Growth 2009-2014\nTable 8 Sales of Men's Jeans: % Value Growth 2009-2014\nTable 9 Sales of Women's Jeans: Volume 2009-2014\nTable 10 Sales of Women's Jeans: Value 2009-2014\nTable 11 Sales of Women's Jeans: % Volume Growth 2009-2014\nTable 12 Sales of Women's Jeans: % Value Growth 2009-2014\nTable 13 NBO Company Shares of Jeans: % Value 2010-2014\nTable 14 LBN Brand Shares of Jeans: % Value 2011-2014\nTable 15 Forecast Sales of Jeans: Volume 2014-2019\nTable 16 Forecast Sales of Jeans: Value 2014-2019\nTable 17 Forecast Sales of Jeans: % Volume Growth 2014-2019\nTable 18 Forecast Sales of Jeans: % Value Growth 2014-2019\nTable 19 Forecast Sales of Men's Jeans: Volume 2014-2019\nTable 20 Forecast Sales of Men's Jeans: Value 2014-2019\nTable 21 Forecast Sales of Men's Jeans: % Volume Growth 2014-2019\nTable 22 Forecast Sales of Men's Jeans: % Value Growth 2014-2019\nTable 23 Forecast Sales of Women's Jeans: Volume 2014-2019\nTable 24 Forecast Sales of Women's Jeans: Value 2014-2019\nTable 25 Forecast Sales of Women's Jeans: % Volume Growth 2014-2019\nTable 26 Forecast Sales of Women's Jeans: % Value Growth 2014-2019\nC&a Mode GmbH & Co Kg in Apparel and Footwear (germany)\nStrategic Direction\nKey Facts\nSummary 1 C&A Mode GmbH & Co KG: Key Facts\nSummary 2 C&A Mode GmbH & Co KG: Operational Indicators\nCompetitive Positioning\nSummary 3 C&A Mode GmbH & Co KG: Competitive Position 2014\nRetail Operations\nSummary 4 C&A Mode GmbH & Co KG: Retail Operational Indicators\nInternet Strategy\nChart 1 C&A Mode GmbH & Co KG: C&A in Berlin\nChart 2 C&A Mode GmbH & Co KG: C&A in Berlin - interior\nHugo Boss AG in Apparel and Footwear (germany)\nStrategic Direction\nKey Facts\nSummary 5 Hugo Boss AG: Key Facts\nSummary 6 Hugo Boss AG: Operational Indicators\nCompetitive Positioning\nFull Table of Contents is available at:\n-- \nAbout Fast Market Research\nFast Market Research is a leading distributor of market research and business information.
