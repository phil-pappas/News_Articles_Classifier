Instead, they’re changing the way they do business.\nWestern Asset Management Co., which oversees about $455 billion, has developed a system of ranking securities based on their perceived liquidity to make sure they’ve got plenty of easy-to-sell assets in a pinch. Loomis Sayles & Co. is “comfortable holding higher-than-average reserves, such as cash and high-quality developed market sovereign debt,” according to a report this month.\nFor funds that are loaded up with hard-to-trade bonds, “it could be a challenge under difficult market conditions to meet very large redemptions” without suffering huge losses, according to Michael Buchanan, Western Asset’s deputy chief investment officer, in a July 20 paper. “Overall the trend is that liquidity will continue to decline.”\nSwing Time Investors blame different factors for the falling turnover in an $8 trillion U.S. corporate-debt market. New regulations have forced banks to curb holdings of riskier assets, once used to opportunistically trade big blocks of debt without flooding the market with buy or sell orders, essentially buffering price swings.\nThe size of the market has surged since the end of 2008 on the heels of the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented stimulus effort, which suppressed borrowing costs and encouraged companies to lock in record-low interest rates for decades. And those easy-money policies pushed many investors into the same bonds, leaving many analysts wondering who’ll be left to buy up all those same securities when sentiment sours.\nThe net result: bond prices are swinging more at unpredictable times and it generally takes longer to execute a large trade than before the 2008 financial crisis. Just take U.S. junk bonds of energy companies as an example: average prices on the notes have swung by 9.5 cents this year, compared with just 2.7 cents in comparable period last year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.\nHoarding Cash And that’s before the Fed starts raising benchmark rates from virtually zero for the first time since 2006, as they may do this year.\nThe disappearance of bond-market liquidity was the top concern for investment-grade bond managers in July, and the second-biggest worry for high-yield managers, according to a Bank of America Corp. investor survey.\nJunk-bond funds were holding almost 6 percent of their assets in cash, “close to one of the highest readings ever in our high-yield survey,” Bank of America analysts Barnaby Martin, Ioannis Angelakis and Souheir Asba wrote in a July 29 report.\nThe silver lining is that these measures taken by investors may end up reducing the risk of a market seizure, both because banks are safer and investors are more prepared. Both Western Asset and Loomis Sayles are planning for a dislocation in which they can be on the other side of the trade, buying bonds in the case of a forced sale.\nPerhaps bond-fund managers have found a new buffer against price swings: each other.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T19:21:09.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
