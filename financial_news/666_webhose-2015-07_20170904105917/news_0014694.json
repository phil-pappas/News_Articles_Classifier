It was trading at 13,319 on Friday. \nTaiwan's dollar is expected to reach 32.1 per U.S. dollar in a year from 30.87 now. Singapore's dollar was forecast to fall more than 3 percent in the coming year. \nThe Indian rupee is forecast to weaken to 64.00 per dollar in one month, 64.45 in six months and 64.80 in one year. It was last trading at 63.68. \nSouth Korea's won, Thailand's baht and the Philippine peso are all expected to weaken around 1 percent over the coming year. \n(Polling by Shaloo Srivastava; Editing by Ross Finley and Alan Raybould)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T13:46:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
