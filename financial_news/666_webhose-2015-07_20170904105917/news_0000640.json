Mercantile has been mounting takeovers for distressed firms sitting on cash or other assets, and is currently making a hostile on-market bid for ASX-listed Ask Funding. In May, an attempt to buy Phosphate Australia was knocked back. ASX-listed Mercantile last traded at A12.5 cents. Mr Brierley seized control of Mercantile, then called India Equities Fund, in 2012 when shareholders agreed to a deal giving him 54 per cent of the company and its chair in return for his stakes in Copper Strike, Trinity Group, ING Community Living Group, Australian Pharmaceutical Industries and Trojan Equity. The holding has since been watered down to 46 per cent after Mercantile completed a takeover of Murchison Metals via a scheme of arrangement, which let investors take either cash or shares.
