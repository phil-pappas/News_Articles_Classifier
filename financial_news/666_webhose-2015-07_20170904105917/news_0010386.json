Kit Juckes, of Societe Generale (Paris: FR0000130809 - news ) , said: “The Chinese authorities' attempts to stabilise the equity market are not working.” \nThe Shanghai Composite fell by a further 5.9pc on Wednesday, as stock trading halts and price movement limits prevented investors from pushing the index even lower. \n“The symbiotic relationship between the Chinese economy and global commodity markets is once again highlighted as iron ore, copper, gold and oil prices all fell,” Mr Juckes said. \nAs the market has gained “bear” status, the Chinese government has attempted to reverse the crash in stocks. Jason Ambrose, of Vanda Research, said: “Policymakers have kitchen-sinked it trying to support markets.\" \n• Why Chinese stocks are in turmoil • Jumping back into volatile China is only for the brave \nThe last few days have seen central bank rate cuts, reduced trading fees, relaxed margin-lending rules, and stock purchases by the country’s sovereign wealth fund. China’s leaders “are beginning to worry about the potential for social unrest”, said Mr Ambrose. The country’s stock market has shrunk by around £2.1 trillion in the last month. \nThe Chinese government has attempted to reverse the crash in stocks \nAnalysts fear that halting trading will do little to improve matters, and may in fact dent confidence in the stock market further. \nCompanies are able to apply to the stock exchange to have trading in their stocks suspended. Many of them said that they had an “important project in preparation”. \n• The really worrying financial crisis is happening in China, not Greece • ‘Rats leaving a sinking ship’ as China’s equity bubble implodes \nMr Ambrose continued: “The issue at the heart of it, and more generally the biggest weakness of the central planning model is that it’s easy to get large state-run bodies to spend more on railroads or buy up stocks, but it’s a lot harder to convince a billion people to collectively act in a counter-cyclical way.” \nThe market is now “experiencing a complete breakdown of confidence in the Beijing Put”, he said, a rally in stock markets that has been driven by government policy. “So if you lose confidence in the effectiveness of those policies, you lose the basis for the entire rally.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T15:35:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
