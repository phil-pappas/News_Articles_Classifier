This lack of liquidity in the financial markets should concern investors.\nThat’s because trading is increasingly dependent on just a few large institutions. Reduced supply and increased demand for market-making will ultimately squeeze trading liquidity further, boosting trading costs and lowering investment returns.\nThere are two types of financial liquidity. The first is funding, or the supply of money. The second relates to the ability to buy and sell financial assets readily and without high-transaction costs.\nBarron's buzz: Time to be bullish on Japan?

But only a handful of stocks, along with major currencies and some government securities, trade consistently and in large volume. And while trading activity appears robust, market turnover — trading relative to outstanding securities — in both bonds and stocks has fallen significantly.\nAs Michael Milken, the creator of junk bonds, once remarked: “Liquidity is an illusion It’s always there when you don’t need it, and rarely there when you do”.\nThe problems with liquidity underscore the distorting effects of central bank intervention in financial markets. Official policies in the aftermath of the financial crisis have forced excessive risk taking in search of returns. Yet regulatory changes have contributed to a reduction in trading liquidity. Over time, investors can become increasingly exposed to ever more risky financial assets that in a crisis would be difficult to trade — triggering a major collapse in prices.\nThe absence of trading liquidity may not cause the next financial crisis, but it will inevitably increase market volatility and investor losses. Several factors are creating this situation:\nFirst, central bank policies of low rates and abundant liquidity have driven investors into riskier, less-liquid assets in search of higher return. Investors have been forced to invest in longer-dated securities, corporate bonds, and emerging-market issues. In many cases, the issuer is of low, non-investment grade credit quality. Investors have purchased less-actively traded shares or invested in smaller and often less-developed equity markets.\nBut buyers may not recognize that the additional return received does not compensate for the higher risk of reduced trading liquidity.\nSecond, with markets and prices increasingly driven by changes in official policy, investment horizons have become shorter, making additional claims on market liquidity. Many investors are purchasing lower-quality assets on the assumption that they will be able to sell to a “greater fool” before prices fall. This game of investment musical chairs relies on anticipating when the tune will stop, which history shows most market participants are poor at gauging.\nThird, the nature of investors has changed. A handful of institutional giants dominate the markets. Their similar investment portfolios and strategies exacerbate risk and the problems of illiquidity if many of them attempt to exit positions at once.\nMoreover, these big players are frequently market-following — trading momentum and buying when prices go up and selling when they fall. They are users of liquidity rather than providers. Their buying creates the illusion of active trading when markets are rising, but it sucks liquidity out when prices fall.\nFourth, many investment vehicles promise greater liquidity to their investors than that of the underlying investments which they hold. The problem is that a fund’s investments may be insufficiently liquid to allow redemption requests to be met in a timely manner. For example, the IMF found that a fund investing in U.S. high-yield corporate bonds could take up to 60 days to liquidate holdings, well-beyond the time needed to meet investor redemption requests.\nFifth, there has been a sharp contraction in the market-making capacity of dealers, particularly in bonds but also in other financial assets. In the Treasury bond market, for example, major dealers had around $2.5-$3 trillion of capacity to make markets in 2007. Today that amount has fallen by more than one-third. A similar pattern is discernible in Europe. This reduction in dealer capacity coincides with a major expansion in the size of the underlying markets.\nThe reduction in capacity is driven by risk aversion as banks reduce trading activities. The change also reflects regulatory initiatives. Banks have been required to reduce risk and strengthen capital and balance sheets. These measures have made it more expensive and less attractive for banks to make markets for clients. The Volcker Rule embedded in the Dodd-Frank legislation has restricted banks engaging in proprietary trading, which traditionally has assisted market liquidity .\nA lack of trading liquidity may not cause the next financial crisis, but it will inevitably increase market volatility and investor losses. The inability of dealers to purchase cheap assets and warehouse them will, at a minimum, exaggerate price fluctuations. If the shocks are large enough, markets would become disorderly or even cease to function.\nSatyajit Das is a former banker and author of “Extreme Money” and “Traders, Guns & Money.”\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T15:15:32.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
