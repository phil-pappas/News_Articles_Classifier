ABC by Geoff Winestock The Labor opposition wants to generate 50 per cent of electricity from renewable sources by 2030 but may not rely on a rigid scheme like the Renewable Energy Target, which subsidises wind and solar by guaranteeing their market share.\nMark Butler, the opposition spokesman on climate change, said on Wednesday Labor would take the \"50 per cent by 2030\" goal to the next election. But if Labor wins it will seek advice on the details of the policy. \"We do not have a pre-defined view on the best way to reach that goal,\" he said.\nWith climate policy up for debate at the Labor national conference this weekend, Mr Butler said extending the existing RET scheme was only one option. The RET, which was altered last month by the Senate, will force electricity retailers to source about 23 per cent of power from renewables by 2020 but it sets no target after that.\nMr Butler said that Labor policy would include an emissions trading scheme which sets a limit on emissions in the electricity industry and some other sectors. He said Labor might encourage the closure of coal-fired power stations that are approaching the end of their useful life.\nThe Clean Energy Council, the lobby for the renewable energy industry, welcomed the 2030 target. \"The industry's track record provides confidence that a target of 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030 is entirely achievable,\" it said.\nMr Butler argued that renewable energy was driving down wholesale prices. Environment Minister Greg Hunt said the Labor plan would push up electricity prices and cost jobs and would include a carbon tax.\n\"There is no detail on how Bill Shorten will achieve his renewables plan without adding costs to the electricity sector which will be passed onto households,\" he said.\nGaps on both sides Tony Wood, energy policy director at the Grattan Institute, said that both sides of politics had huge gaps in their climate policies. The Abbott government is the only developed country that has not yet lodged a proposal for the United Nations summit in Paris in December on targets for carbon emissions after 2020 and it has also given no details on a crucial safeguard mechanism under its Direct Action program which will set limits on emissions in the electricity sector.\nMr Wood said Labor's commitment to 50 per cent renewables by 2030 seemed arbitrary considering it had not even decided on an emissions reduction target post-2020. He said it would have been more logical to decide on the emissions target and then work out the role of renewables.\nHe said Labor was trying to tap into popular support for renewable energy and was hemmed in by fear of a repeat of the carbon tax debate of the 2013 election. \"The risk is that this will not result in good policy,\" Mr Wood said.\nMr Butler said he would wait for the government to announce a post-2020 target before setting Labor policy.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten said that the ALP would stress the importance of renewables to counter the opposition's attack on the carbon tax, which contributed its loss of government in 2013.\n\"Labor has learnt some of the lessons of the past,\" Mr Shorten said. \"We are proposing a reasonably soft emissions trading scheme and it will be linked to the rest of the world.\"\nThe commitment to 50 per cent renewables is higher than most other developed economies but not unprecedented. The US state of California has committed to the same target band Germany has an ambition to source 55 per cent of electricity from renewables.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:54:21.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
