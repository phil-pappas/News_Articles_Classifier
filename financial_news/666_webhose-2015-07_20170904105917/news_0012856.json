We don't believe we will be in a recession.\" \nDespite the bleak outlook of the banks, Oliver said he expects growth in the second quarter and beyond to be robust. \n\"We expect solid growth for the year, following a weak first quarter,\" he said. \nA recession could put the Conservative government, in power since 2006, in bad standing ahead of general elections in October. \nSecond quarter GDP estimates are expected after the central bank's next meeting, which takes place on July 15. Final figures are expected to be confirmed in September.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T02:39:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
