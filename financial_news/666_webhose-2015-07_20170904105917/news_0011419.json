Goldcorp Inc., the biggest North American producer by market value, declined as much as 5.6 percent and Newmont Mining Corp., the largest U.S. producer, fell 3.4 percent in New York.\nGold tumbled Friday on strength in the U.S. dollar and signs of improving U.S. economic growth.\n“The market’s focus has turned back to the U.S. dollar, away from the safe-haven bid, and there is simply no support for gold prices at this point,” Jessica Fung, a Toronto-based commodities analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said Friday by phone. The market’s attention has temporarily shifted away from concerns about Greece and the Chinese stock market, she said.\nGold futures for August delivery dropped 1.1 percent to $1,131.40 an ounce at 12:17 p.m. on the Comex in New York, after touching $1,129.60, the lowest since April 2010.\nOther precious-metal miners fell. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold and Silver Index, a gauge of miners, slumped as much as 4.4 percent, reaching the lowest intraday since January 2002. Among Toronto-based gold miners, Kinross Gold Corp. dropped 5.3 percent at 12:09 p.m., Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. was down 5.3 percent and Yamana Gold Inc. fell 3.7 percent.\nUnder Pressure Barrick is under particular pressure as the fall in gold casts doubt on the company’s strategy of shedding assets to pay down its $12.9 billion debt, Ron Stewart, an analyst at Macquarie Capital Markets in Toronto, said Friday in a telephone interview.\n“Barrick was doing OK with this notion of selling assets to reduce the debt levels and repair their balance sheet,” he said. “It becomes harder and harder to sell those assets at any kind of reasonable value if metal prices are unwinding.”\nBarrick’s total debt peaked at $15.8 billion in the second-quarter of 2013, the same year gold futures had their biggest annual plunge in more than three decades. Since then, the company has sold more than $2 billion worth of assets and has been in talks to sell a 50 percent stake in its Zaldivar mine in Chile.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:22:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
