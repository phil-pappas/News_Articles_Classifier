AP Share on twitter by Philip Baker Each year when investors turn over the calendar to greet a new financial year, there's always the hope that the next 12 months are going to be bigger and better than the previous 12.\nThere's always a few new year's resolutions too. But is the next financial year going to be that much different to the past one? And should investors change their strategy which has been built around investing in a low growth, low interest rate environment?\nIf the ending of the 2015 financial year is any guide the next 12 months could be a very wild ride for investors. China slowing, trouble in Europe and the US Federal Reserve looking to hike rates adds up to an interesting cocktail.\nSustainable high-yielding dividend stocks will probably remain the preferred investment option, but the prospect of higher rates in the United States means it's not the lay down misere it once was.\nIt's now been just over six years since the worst of the financial crisis. When the Federal Reserve, and other central banks, slashed rates back then it was generally thought that in the US rates would be heading higher within a year.\nNot so. Only now are they ready to lift off in the US and quite possibly they won't rise too far.\nRecord low rates for six years can breed complacency, as investors get used to central banks giving them a free kick . The risk is that with rates so low investors start to think that what has happened since 2009 is normal. It's anything but.\nAt best, maybe over the next 12 months interest rates won't rise that much in the US and investors can still bank on the yield trade.\n Head north Debt levels are high and growth rates are low, hardly the combination that screams out for tighter monetary policy.\nNormally it's the concern about inflation that warrants higher rates but that's not the case now.\nBut at some stage they will head higher and rates in Australia will also head north.\nThe sell-off in the bond market since April is a sign of what could happen when other central banks start talking rate hikes rather than rate cuts.\nUltimately, market sentiment is likely to remain enslaved to the drip feed of earnings and economic data. Neither seem to be promising much.\nLooking at the near-term horizon, there appears to be more of the same for investors.\nA look at what traders are expecting shows that rates are going to be much lower in the US, UK, the eurozone and Japan, when compared to how low they have been since 1945 and right up until the crisis.\nThe risk for contrarian investors would be that demand stays low and central banks might be forced to do more. With no tricks left up their sleeve the idea of higher rates would seem the lesser of two evils.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-06-30T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T00:08:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
