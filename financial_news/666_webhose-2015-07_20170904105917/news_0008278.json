He is due to start work in the fourth quarter. \nCommenting on the talk, Shore Capital analyst Eamonn Flanagan said \"Zurich has surplus capital it wishes to deploy and has looked at RSA in the past, we believe.\" ($1 = 0.6420 pounds) (Editing by Richard Pullin and Sinead Cruise)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T09:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T09:46:22.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
