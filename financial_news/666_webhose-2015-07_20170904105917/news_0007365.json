The ruling, which was seen by Reuters, was made available to the parties involved in the case on Monday.\nIn an emailed statement on Tuesday, TripAdvisor said it was satisfied with the ruling which it said confirmed that it did not mislead readers regarding the source of its reviews. It added that the processes it used to maintain the integrity of its content were extremely effective.\n($1 = 0.9083 euros) (Reporting by Danilo Masoni; Editing by Pravin Char)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T20:33:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
