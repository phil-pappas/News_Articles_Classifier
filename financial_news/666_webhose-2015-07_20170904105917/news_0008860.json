Mayu Kanamori by James Eyers and Clancy Yeates Westpac Banking Corp is losing over $1 million a day because its computer systems do not allow it to charge property investors and owner occupiers different interest rates.\nAustralia's largest lender to landlords is the only one of the big four banks not to have increased interest rates for property investors in recent days under regulatory pressure over bank exposure to housing.\nNational Australia Bank said on Monday afternoon it would raise rates by 0.29 percentage points on interest-only loans taken out by both investors and owner-occupiers . Sources say NAB is constrained from charging different rates to investors and owner-occupiers because of technical problems. The bank declined to comment.\nWestpac is finding it challenging to distinguish between investors and owner-occupiers, sources said.\nThe Commonwealth Bank of Australia and ANZ Banking Group last week raised rates for only property investors . If Westpac follows and raises its rate on investor loans by 27 basis points, it would gain $423 million in revenue, Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated last week. That is $1.15 million a day.\nUnlike the interest rate increases by ANZ and the Commonwealth Bank, NAB's rate increase will affect some owner-occupiers and add about $70 to the monthly cost of a $300,000 interest-only mortgage.\nRegulators are more concerned about lending to property speculators than people borrowing money for their own home because investors are considered to be driving big increases in house prices in parts of Sydney and Melbourne.\nWestpac and NAB use a single \"reference rate\" for owner-occupier and investor borrowers, which means they cannot increase the standard variable rate for property investors without also hitting owner-occupiers. ANZ and CBA both reduced fixed rates for owner-occupiers last week.\n Banking sources said it might take Westpac several months to work through systems issues to enable it to charge different rates. This could involve senior members of the IT team recoding some of the banking systems to allow different reference rates even though the bank has created different home loan products for investors and owner-occupiers.\n\"Westpac's rates remain under review. Given we haven't had differential pricing across the mortgage book for a number of years, if this was to be introduced we must ensure a smooth transition for affected customers,\" a spokesman for Westpac said.\nWestpac is keen to raise interest rates along with its competitors because it is already growing investor loans near the 10 per cent growth limit imposed by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.\nThis restricts the bank from taking market share off its rivals, as it would be pushed further above the APRA limit which could potentially trigger penalties of having to hold extra capital, which could hit profits.\n\"Whilst ANZ and CBA have been able to reprice all variable investor mortgages, NAB and Westpac are not currently afforded the same luxury,\" Macquarie analyst Mike Wiblin told clients in a note on Monday.\n\"This is due to the fact they currently use the same reference rates for owner-occupier and investor loans. This does appear to limit their repricing flexibility, however there could be ways around this such as increasing the reference rate on all mortgages and offering an offsetting discount to owner-occupier customers. We wait and watch.\"\nDeutsche Bank analyst Andrew Triggs also identified the issue in a note last week. \"While peers may follow [ANZ and CBA], the ability to do so will depend on loan documentation and whether base rates vary between owner occupier and investor lending,\" he said.\nAsked if it was able to raise interest rates for all investor loans without changing the rates for owner-occupied loans, NAB did not respond. Analysts suspect its focus on interest-only loans was a way around its challenges with reference rates.\nNAB said interest-only loans were the \"predominant structure for investors\", and its rate hike was a response to regulatory concerns about landlord borrowing, as well as responsible lending. Group executive for personal banking Gavin Slater said the bank's approach would support responsible lending practices.\n\"In an environment of record low interest rates, NAB believes it is important to encourage our customers to pay down their home loan,\" he said.\nDespite its computer difficulties, Westpac is tightening the screws for property investors. From Tuesday, self managed super funds borrowing to buy property will need to put up a 30 per cent deposit, up from the current 20 per cent.\nThe stricter rule comes as Westpac subsidiaries Bank of Melbourne and St George reduced the \"loan to value\" ratio for SMSF borrowers from 80 per cent to 70 per cent last week. Banks are growing increasingly nervous about property borrowing by SMSFs as they have limited recourse to other assets held by SMSF funds.\nWestpac warned mortgage brokers last week to ensure that foreign investors applying for loans have Australian visas and the necessary approvals from the Foreign Investment Review Board.\nThe pressure on Westpac to resolve its computer problems to enable to to charge different rates is growing because senior bankers tip a split in the home loan interest rate market, with owner-occupiers and investors expected to pay different rates in coming years.\nThe chief executive of Aussie Home Loans, James Symond, said that after recent interest rates changes from the major banks it appeared that investors would pay more for loans than owner-occupiers for the short-term.\n\"Certainly for the forseeable future, this two-tier interest rate market between investors and owner-occupiers looks like it's going to be pretty much common ground across most lenders,\" Mr Symond said.\nHe argued a tightening in banks' credit policies had a more significant impact on the rate of growth in investor lending. In recent months, major banks have forced investors to produce bigger deposits and taken a tougher line on how they assess borrowers' ability to service debts.\n\"The credit changes are having a more significant effect in the potential investor slowdown than a slight increase in rates, from what are historically low rates anyway,\" Mr Symond said.\nUp to 1998, it was common for banks to offer owner-occupiers lower interest rates compared to property investors. The interest rate differential was around 1 percentage point.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:09:48.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
