Either the Germans, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank will back down and continue to provide financial aid along with a less onerous austerity package that the Greek people can live with, or the latter will ultimately need to leave the union and begin the painful process of going it alone. If Europe needs to prime the stimulus pump further to contain cross-infection with other European countries, then it will.\nWhether the Chinese government's move represents little more than a padded Band-Aid remains to be seen.

But in Europe there is an end game – albeit one that is still uncertain.\nGreece is a tiny economy with virtually no financial ties to Australia and of limited economic importance to the rest of the world – even Europe. Thus the contagion to other European countries is a possibility but not a probability.\nBut the contagion effects of a crash in the Chinese stock market to the Chinese economy, Australia and the rest of the world is much more real.\nDespite using its well-stocked toolbox, the Chinese government may not necessarily succeed in stabilising its equity market. Photo: Karl Hilzinger\nClearly, the Chinese government believes so, which is why it went to such enormous lengths at the weekend to prop up the equities market. The Securities Association of China announced that 21 of the country's largest brokerages had agreed to pledge the equivalent of 15 per cent of their net assets – or no less than 120 billion yuan ($26 billion) in total – to invest in blue-chip investment stocks.\nThe move represents a massive flow of liquidity into the market that will ultimately find its way to investors so they can undertake a buying binge.\nIn addition to just throwing money at the problem, the Chinese government canned all new stock-market floats. This follows from recent moves to cut interest rates and ease lenders' capital settings.\nThe trouble is, despite using its well stocked toolbox, the Chinese government may not necessarily succeed in stabilising its equity market.\nEven after falls of 25 per cent in the past couple of weeks, the Shanghai exchange is still boasting a one-year return of more than 86 per cent.\nAnd the money that has been poured into Chinese listed companies is coming primarily from local retail investors that have been treating the equities market like a casino.\nMaking the situation even more explosive is the fact that a large part of the money invested is debt funded – thus it will be subject to margin calls that will force owners to sell stocks.\nLike all asset bubbles, the fundamentals of the Chinese stock market do not support the price rise. Rather the speculative weight of money flooding into the Chinese equity market has given rise to its nose-bleeding heights.\nThe earnings of Chinese listed companies have not risen 86 per cent this year – thus nor has their real value.\nInstead, the growth in the Chinese economy has been easing at the same time the stock market was experiencing these gains.\nWhether the Chinese government's move represents little more than a padded Band-Aid remains to be seen.\nEarly Monday equities trading had the Chinese market rebound more than 7 per cent but it didn't have the stamina to stay there long, and lost much of its gain within an hour.\nThere are plenty of experts who have suggested even the giant financial package announced in the past few days won't be enough. It is viewed by many as a short-term fix to a structural problem, in that the market is poorly regulated, unbalanced and inherently unstable.\nIf China's 90 million retail investors are sufficiently financially bruised from their stock-market-induced losses, there is a possibility the real economy could be damaged.\nThe plunge in Chinese equities during the past three weeks has reached almost $3 trillion in market value, about 10 times Greece's gross domestic product last year – and nearly double Australia's.\nAustralian investors are all too aware that the prospects for Australia's financial wellbeing are highly dependent on China.\nWhile Monday's stock-market weakness in Australia probably has more to do with generalised concerns about Europe, there is evidence those stocks with a major exposure to the Chinese economy, such as BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group, were hit hard as the iron ore price continues to fall.\nIt is likely that as the week progresses, the market's focus will shift from Europe to China as the world watches whether China's experiment in managing a free market can work, or whether the equities market even in China has a mind of its own.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T23:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T01:01:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
