The bill simply kicks the can down the road, masks its irresponsible nature with gimmicky offsets, and creates bigger 'cliffs' for lawmakers to tackle in the future.\" \nGOP leaders are scrambling to meet a July 31 deadline for new highway funding. \nThe multi-year highway bill being proposed by the Senate includes approximately $47 billion in offsets from other areas of the federal budget to help pay for new highway funding over the next three years. The Senate voted Wednesday to proceed with debate on the measure in a critical test vote that appeared in doubt for most of the day proceeding the roll call. \nThe proposal relies largely on revenue from reducing interest rates paid by the Federal Reserve to large banks, selling oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that is used to prevent energy crises and directing fees from the Transportation Security Administration and customs processing. \nHeritage Action said the proposed offsets are \"one of the most concerning elements of the bill. \n\"The bipartisan legislative summary proclaims the bill 'does not increase the deficit or raise taxes,' but the bill only bails out the bankrupt federal Highway Trust Fund for three years,\" the group wrote. \"Within that three-year period, just 10 percent of the bill’s $47 billion in offsets come in the form of real spending reductions.\" \nLawmakers are trying to close a shortfall in federal transportation funding that has been estimated to be about $16 billion per year . \nThe main source of transportation funding for decades has been revenue that is collected by the 18.4-cents-per-gallon federal gas tax. The tax has not been increased since 1993, however, and more fuel-efficient cars have sapped its buying power. \nThe federal government typically spends about $50 billion per year on transportation projects, but the gas tax only brings in approximately $34 billion annually. \nThe Senate proposal calls for taking $16.3 billion from the interest rate changes, $9 billion from the sales of reserve oil, $4 billion from customs fees, $3.5 billion from TSA fees and $1.9 billion from extending guarantees on mortgage-backed securities that had been scheduled to start declining in 2021. \nOther funding sources in the measure include approximately $7.7 billion in tax compliance measures. \nHeritage Action said lawmakers have oversold the impact of the potential offsets on the transportation funding shortfall. \n\"Near-term deficits will increase because of this deal, since all of these pay fors are spread out over the next decade, while the spending increases occur over the next three years,\" the group wrote. \"Additionally, the bill essentially assumes oil will sell at nearly $89 per barrel while current prices hover around $50 per barrel.\" \nHeritage Action and other conservative groups have supported proposals to gradually eliminate the gas tax in recent years to transfer responsibility for transportation projects to state and local governments. \nThe concept, commonly referred to by transportation observers as \" devolution ,\" would lower the gas tax to 3.7 cents in five years and replace current congressional transportation appropriations with block grants.
