He said any deal between Greece and its creditors must take into account “consistent implementation of reforms” by the nation as well as what is feasible for the Greek people.\nGreece this week became the first advanced economy to miss payment to the International Monetary Fund after closing its banks ahead of a referendum on austerity. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who’s urging citizens to vote “no,” made a bid for a compromise with creditors Wednesday that was rejected by the euro region.\n“We’ve seen some very positive examples in Europe,” Oudea said. “If you take Ireland for example, it’s implemented reform, it went through difficult times, but it’s got much better. You could talk about Spain as well.”\nFor now, markets indicate investors trust policy makers’ efforts to keep Greece in the euro after more than five years of crisis and two bailouts. The currency strengthened 3.9 percent against the dollar in the three months ended June, the biggest gain in seven quarters.\nOudea said he expects the euro will weaken slightly in the next 18 months to about 1.05 per dollar.
