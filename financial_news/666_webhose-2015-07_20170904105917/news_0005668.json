The market recovered later in the day, though still shed more than $18 billion in value. \nTuesday: \n$600b - The iron ore industry is expected to contribute more than $600 billion to the Australian economy over the next decade, despite falling prices for the steel making commodity. \nWednesday: \n6.72 pct - China's benchmark Shanghai stock index plunged by nearly seven per cent in early trade as additional government moves failed to shore up the tumbling market. Its recent falls have so far wiped $US3.2 trillion from the market. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index ended the day 5.9 per cent weaker. \nThursday: \n120,000 - The latest jobs figures show about 120,000 jobs have been created so far this year, at an average of 20,000 a month, bringing the June unemployment rate to six per cent. \nFriday: \n9.9 pct - Chinese iron ore prices climbed 9.9 per cent to $US48.99 a tonne on Thursday night, regaining virtually all the ground lost on Wednesday when prices dived 10 per cent to $US44.10 a tonne.
