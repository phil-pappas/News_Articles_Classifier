Julient Taylor Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Geoff Winestock Interest rates could stay near the current lows for half a century, raising funding problems for pension and insurance funds, according to a senior economist at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\"Real interest rates could stay under 4 percent for 50 years,\" Adrian Blundell-Wignall, director of the financial affairs directorate at the Paris-based think tank for developed countries, told an Australian Business Economists lunch in Sydney on Tuesday.\nHe said interest rates could stay low for a long time because there had been massive over-investment especially in the developing world in countries such as China and this had created an overhang of huge excess capacity.\nHe said too many developing countries were still following a policy of encouraging unprofitable investment especially by state-owned enterprises, which were subsidised by artificially low exchange rates and cheap capital. He said this kept returns on investment low.\nHe said developing countries were trying to enter global value chains but they were barely profitable because increasingly developed countries with control of intellectual property were taking most of the profits.\nDr Blundall-Wignall said low interest rates could cause insolvencies at pension and insurance funds which had growing liabilities but had their cash invested in low-yielding bonds.\nHe said investors should be concerned about what happens later this year when the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates because the price of corporate bonds could be very volatile.\nHe said that in the quest to find high-yielding assets, pension funds, insurance companies and shadow structures such as hedge funds had invested in riskier and riskier corporate bonds which would be hard to sell if prices fell. He said there was a \"mismatch\" between the assets and liabilities of these institutions.\n He said on the other hand, as central banks reversed quantitative easing they would sell of some of the bond holdings which would might increase the supply oif safe assets for other investors.", "external_links": ["http://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/GeoffWinestock", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108137886892627412852", "http://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/06jun/oecd_guide_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-07-28T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:03:52.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
