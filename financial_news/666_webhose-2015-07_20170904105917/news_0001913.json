Meadowlands is eight months late producing an audit for 2013, according to a June 1 letter from Assistant Commissioner Susan J. Dougherty obtained by NJ Advance Media. Dougherty levied a $5,000-per-month penalty. The annual audits were a requirement of the for-profit investor group MHA buying the troubled hospital in Secaucus nearly five years ago, and every year, the hospital has been late and hit with fines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:25:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
