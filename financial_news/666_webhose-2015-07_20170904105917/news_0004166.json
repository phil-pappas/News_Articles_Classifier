Analysts say higher provisions do not necessarily imply that credit is deteriorating. Photo: AFP \nBanks in the United States may start preparing for higher loan losses in the coming quarters, after plunging oil prices have made oil producers more likely to default on loans, analysts said. \nTo prepare, banks are expected to set aside more money to cover bad loans, known as \"provisioning\", when they post results in the next few quarters. Big US banks start posting second-quarter results this week, with JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo reporting tomorrow. \nThe move will cut into earnings, and may be an early sign that credit quality among US borrowers is no longer improving after the financial crisis, representing a shift in the credit cycle. Banks for years have been setting aside less and less money to cover credit losses, as companies and consumers defaulted less frequently on a wide variety of loans. \nAnalysts cautioned that higher provisions do not necessarily imply that credit is broadly deteriorating. \n\"We're kind of trying to thread a needle here because on the one hand we don't want to dismiss this situation but on the other hand this is not a catastrophic 'oh my God here we go again',\" said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \nThere are some storm clouds in the global macroeconomy now, including slower growth in China and the threat of a Greek exit from the euro zone. \nBarclays Capital analyst Jason Goldberg wrote last Friday that he sees little direct impact to US bank loan books from those events. \nAt least one reason for higher provisions is actually a positive for economic growth: banks are making more loans, Goldberg said. \n\"I think the credit environment is still good,\" Goldberg said. \nAnnual provisions at Wells Fargo peaked at US$22 billion in 2009 and have declined each year to about US$1.4 billion in 2014. At Bank of America the number fell to about US$2 billion from more than US$48 billion over the same period. \nOppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski forecasts rising loan loss provisions for both banks in the second quarter, as well as JP Morgan. He is looking for a slight decline in provisioning at Citigroup, however. \nThe price of oil fell by nearly 60 per cent between June 2014 and March 2015, and while it has since rebounded about 20 per cent, it is still well off its highs. In an annual exam of loan credit quality, banking regulators are pressing banks to set aside more money to cover their energy loans, according to a report last week from the Wall Street Journal . \nLoans to the energy sector account for 5.7 per cent of total loan exposure at JP Morgan, the largest among the big four US banks, according to a report Cassidy published last Thursday. It accounts for 3.5 per cent of Citigroup's exposure, 2.5 per cent at Bank of America Corp and 2.1 per cent at Wells Fargo. \nOther big lenders with even larger exposure to the energy sector as a percentage of their overall portfolios are Zions Bancorporation and Comerica at 7.9 per cent and 7.3 per cent, respectively, according to the report. \nA Wells Fargo spokesman did not respond to questions. Spokespeople at the other banks declined to comment on upcoming earnings.
