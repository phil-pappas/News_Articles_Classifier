Mohammed || The Economy Times \nParliament of Ghana last week approved a loan agreement between the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) and a consortium of international and local banks for an amount of $1.8 billion for the purchase of cocoa beans for the 2015/ 2016 crop season. \nThe banks are Barclays Bank Plc, Commerzbank, Aktiengesellschaft, Deutsche Bank AG, Natixis, Standard Bank Group of South Africa and Sumitomo-Mitsui Banking Corporation. \nStandard Chartered Bank is the arranger of the facility whiles the government of Ghana is the guarantor of the loan. \nThe loan will enable the company to purchase 900,000 metric tonnes of cocoa for the season. \nThe facility is to enable COCOBOD to raise adequate funds to purchase cocoa beans from farmers through Licensed Buying Companies for the 2015 / 2016 cocoa season. \nThe sourcing of the facility also provides the nation with the opportunity to demonstrate its good track record on borrowing from the international finance market. \nPresenting the report of the Finance Committee of Parliament on the facility, the Chairman of the committee, Mr James Klutse Avedzi, urged the House to approve the loan. \nHe said it would enable the company to raise the needed funds to purchase cocoa for the season. \n\"Further, the approval of the waiver will also allow COCOBOD to use the entire syndicated facility for cocoa purchases and other related uses,\" he said. \nAdditionally, in preparation towards a promised bumper harvest next season, a number of cocoa farmers has last week assembled at the various premises of the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) to receive bags of fertilizer being distributed free by government. \nMr. David Afriyie-Gyebi, the Dormaa Cocoa District Officer of CHED, told the Ghana News Agency (GNA), through a telephone interview from Dormaa-Ahenkro, in the Brong-Ahafo Region that, 25, 960 bags of cocoa fertilizer had been distributed to qualified cocoa farmers at Dormaa-Ahenkro. \nHe added that 10,000 bags of Elite organic fertilizer had also been distributed to farmers in the Dormaa East District and the Dormaa Central Municipality. \nMr. Afriyie-Gyebi said the Dormaa District of CHED had also received 1000 cartons of liquid fertilizer for further distribution to some selected qualified cocoa farmers in the Dormaa Central Municipality, Dormaa East and Berekum West Districts, as well as 300 cartons for distribution to farmers at Jaman South and Jaman North Districts. \nHe indicated that an extra consignment of 70,000 bags of fertilizer was expected to be delivered for distribution to qualified farmers in the Dormaa Central and Berekum Municipalities, Jaman North, Jaman South and Dormaa East Districts. \nMr. Afriyie-Gyebi said the government’s free fertilizer distribution programme had been given a boost this year because of measures put in place by the COCOBOD Management to prevent the shortfall experienced in the distribution patterns of the commodity last year. \nHe said the fertilizer was distributed irrespective of beneficiaries’ political, religious or tribal affiliation and warned those engaged in the illegal selling of it to desist from such unpatriotic acts because they would be prosecuted when arrested.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T22:44:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
