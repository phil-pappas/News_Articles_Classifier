Its name in Russian decrypts as Yugo Vostok Tatarstana or South-East of Tatarstan.\nThe carrier’s fleet will reportedly consist of Bombardier CRJ200LRs. The airline will specialize on regional flights in Volga region. According to Russian legislation, it will be able to get permission for operating international flights after two years of flying domestic routes.\nTwo local airlines in Tatarstan lost their AOCs in less than two years—Kazan-based Tatarstan Airlines, which had its AOC withdrawn at the end of 2013 after a fatal crash of a Tatarstan Boeing 737-500 at Kazan Airport, and Bugulma-based Ak Bars Aero airline, which lost its AOC in May after failing to relaunch flights after a winter temporary suspension caused by a decline in passenger numbers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T18:42:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
