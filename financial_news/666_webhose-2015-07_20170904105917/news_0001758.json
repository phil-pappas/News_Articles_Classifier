The number of paid clicks increased 18 percent. \n\"This growth has steadily held in the mid-to-high teens since at least Q1:13,\" RBC analyst Mark Mahaney said. \"Such consistency is a rarity, especially for a behemoth business ...\" \nOf 48 analysts covering the stock, 38 have \"buy\" or higher rating, while 10 have \"hold.\" The median price target is $670, according to Thomson Reuters data. \n(Reporting by Eileen Soreng and Devika Krishna Kumar in Bengaluru; Editing by Kirti Pandey)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T19:49:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
