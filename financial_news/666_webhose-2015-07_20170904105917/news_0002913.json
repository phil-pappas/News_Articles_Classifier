Terpolilli \nSan Antonio in the summer is just plain hot, with average high temperatures in the mid 90s. We want to keep our healthy routine going all year but most of us need to make some adjustments to avoid the heat stress. Here are a few suggestions to keep fit in San Antonio during the summer. \nGo inside \nChange up your game, by trying something new indoors. Join a summer bowling league or take ice skating lessons. Ice and Golf Center at Northwood s offers ice skating for the public and is located at 17530 Henderson Pass off Highway 281 North. Rent your skates and have some icy fun. \nIf you are not ready to join a bowling league and need to work on your game, there are some new bowling lanes to try. Bowl and Barrel just opened at the Rim Shopping area with the address of 17619 La Cantera Parkway. There are 15 lanes plus food and drink in a tavern atmosphere. Just remember this is about fitness, so go light on the food and drink. \nGet wet \nThere are plenty of swimming pools and water parks across the city to keep you in the splash zone. For a new twist on water fun, there is a place to try kayaks on the San Antonio River. You can rent by the hour or set the distance for 2, 3 or 5 miles. Mission Kayak is located at Espada Park at 330 Mission Parkway and offers a great way to explore the River along the Mission Reach area. Make reservations online and paddle your way into upper body fitness. \nTake a class \nIndoor fitness classes can be a cool way to work out and stay under the air conditioned comfort. Some yoga and Pilates classes allow for drop in or single reservations so you can keep your flexible schedule. Check the local YMCA and San Antonio Parks and Recreation for low cost classes. \nAdjust your time \nIf you are use to taking your fitness around the block, schedule that walk time a bit earlier in the morning or set your fit time later in the evening. Find a shady route and take water with you. If your dog is your fitness buddy, don't forget to watch out for the hot pavement on his paws and keep water handy for Fido also. \nSo stay healthy and cool this summer. \nFor the latest business news and local events, click on the subscribe button above and you will receive an email alert when the next article is released.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T01:38:23.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
