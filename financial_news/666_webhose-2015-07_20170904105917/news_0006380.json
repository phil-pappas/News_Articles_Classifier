The airline, which does not engage in fuel hedging, saved more than $1 billion year-over-year in fuel costs in the quarter and expects more than $4 billion in fuel savings for the full year.\nAmerican’s second-quarter system traffic increased 1.1% year-over-year to 57.82 billion RPMs on a 1.9% rise in capacity to 69.4 billion ASMs, producing a load factor of 83.3%, down 0.7 points. Yield dropped 6.1% to 16.28 cents.\nPresident Scott Kirby did acknowledge “a challenging revenue environment” that drove down system second-quarter PRASM 7% year-over-year and said he does not have a “reasonable expectation” that PRASM will turn positive until the second half of 2016. “I know there’s an obsession in the market with PRASM, but we’re producing the best [earnings] result, as far as we can tell, in the history of the airline industry,” Kirby said.\nCurrency headwinds, big demand drops on flights to Venezuela and Brazil and a rise in industry capacity in the domestic US market were cited as reasons revenue is challenged. “There is no doubt that if supply exceeds demand, unit revenue goes down,” Parker said. “What I think everyone acknowledges is ASMs have grown faster than demand [in the US], which does put pressure on PRASM.” For its part, American plans to grow system capacity just 1% for the full-year 2015 compared to 2014.\nBut significant cost savings driven by a drop in fuel prices are offsetting the revenue softness. “The revenue hasn’t fallen as much as the costs have fallen and as a result earnings are growing,” Parker said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T12:30:38.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
