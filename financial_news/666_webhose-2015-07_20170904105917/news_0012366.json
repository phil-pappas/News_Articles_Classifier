By 0900 BST, the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 0.9%, Germany's DAX was 1.2% lower and France's CAC was 1.4% weaker. \nLosses in the periphery were more pronounced, with Italy's FTSE Mib down 2.6% and Spain's IBEX 35 down 1.7%. \nIn debt markets, German government bonds gained as investors looked for somewhere safe to park their cash, but peripheral government bonds sold off only slightly, suggesting that fears over contagion were not elevated. \nThe yield on the 10-year German Bund was down 5 basis points at 0.742%. The yield on Spain's 10-year government bond was 5 basis points higher at 2.279%, while the corresponding Italian bond yield was 6 basis points higher at 2.309%. \nGreek stocks markets have been closed since last week and are not due to reopen until Tuesday at the earliest. \nThe euro, meanwhile, was down just 0.1% at $1.1100, recouping the heavy losses it suffered in the Asian session, following the announcement by Varoufakis. \nOn Sunday, more than 60% of Greeks voted to reject the terms of the Eurozone bailout. \nDespite the downbeat tone in European financial markets, the selloff was not a bad as expected and market participants said hopes of a deal had been boosted by the resignation of Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, who said early on Monday that he was standing down at the request of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. \nHis resignation came as a surprise, as he had said last week that he would step down in the event of a 'yes' vote. \nVaroufakis said in a blog post that he had been made aware that certain members of the Eurozone would prefer him to be absent from meetings, \"an idea that the prime minister judged to be potentially helpful to him in reaching an agreement\". \nVaroufakis has clashed with Greece's creditors over their demands for tough austerity measures. \n\"Fear of the unknown, following the decisive Greek rejection of austerity, has seen global stock markets drop - however, the freefall that was predicted has not materialised, as investors wait to see how European politicians and bankers react,\" said Rebecca O'Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor . \nAnalysts at HSBC said that once the dust settles on Greece, there are five key factors that will help to support European equities. \nIt said a Greek exit from the Eurozone is still by no means a certainty, while a policy response from the ECB is a distinct possibility. The bank also said that a weaker euro will boost earnings prospects, adding that earnings and margins are depressed and could rise strongly over the next three to five if the Greek crisis does not derail global economic growth. Finally, it noted that valuations for European equities are by no means stretched. \nGoing forward, the response of the ECB will be key in determining the level of contagion to other parts of the Eurozone, while the willingness to compromise by both Greece and its creditors will also be crucial. \nThe ECB is expected to make a decision whether to continue providing emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) to Greece at a meeting on Monday morning. A Greek government spokesman said told ANT1 television that the Bank of Greece would make a formal request on Monday. \"And we believe there are valid grounds for there to be an increase in ELA liquidity,\" he said. \nIn corporate news, shares in Rolls-Royce dropped 9% after the company warned on profits and send it was halting its share buyback programme.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T12:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T12:56:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
