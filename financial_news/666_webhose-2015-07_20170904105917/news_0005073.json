Debtors will be left with just £5,000 of assets. The proposals are currently under consultation until the end of July. \n\"Such powers fly directly in the face of the principles of Magna Carta, property rights and due process,\" Mr Hoar said in his legal briefing published by the Taxpayers' Alliance. \"Most dangerously, it treats individual property as the property of the state once the state has determined it so.\" \nThe announcement comes as HMRC is beginning to flex new powers to demand that people pay tax within 90 days of receiving an \"accelerated payment notice\", even before they have a chance to appeal the sum. This could involve paying back taxes, late payment interest and penalties to HMRC. \n• HMRC targets Etsy (Other OTC: ETSYF - news ) , eBay and Gumtree sellers but when is your hobby taxable? \n• Student hit with £1,300 tax fine over university project but he can't appeal \nUnder the new proposals, HMRC could raid bank accounts before debtors have a chance to appeal the amount of unpaid tax in court, or before court judgment is issued. \nAs a result, the proposals are said to flout centuries-old rights protecting citizens' property from plundering kings, as well as the right to a fair trial, set out in the 800-year-old Charter. \nMr Hoar said: \"Taxpayers may be unable to pay their rents, mortgages, credit card bills and so on before they have an opportunity to challenge HMRC's decision.\" \nJohn Thurso, Liberal Democrat member of the Treasury Select Committee, warned last week that the new powers would override existing law. He said: \"We are talking about the ability of one organ of the state to have the unique right to go against the Magna Carta charter and go in and seize without judicial process or review a bank account.\" \nkate.palmer@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T14:27:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
