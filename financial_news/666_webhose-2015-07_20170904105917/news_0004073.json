Peter Braig by Jonathan Barrett Western Australia's Minister for Mines, Bill Marmion, has voided several exploration applications lodged over Andrew Forrest's Pilbara pastoral station by one of the billionaire's mates.\nThe applications, covering a significant portion of the 230,000-hectare Minderoo station, were lodged by a Cottesloe resident named Christopher Dale , and were understood to be a strategy backed by the Fortescue Metals Group chairman to protect the cattle station from bone fide explorers by having a friend control the mineral rights.\nDepartment of Mining and Petroleum records show Mr Marmion refused the applications on July 6, on advice from a mining warden, who oversees mineral tenement matters. Mr Marmion was contacted for comment.\nMr Forrest has consistently denied any wrong-doing. A spokesman for Mr Forrest declined to comment on the minister's decision.\nThe controversy surrounding mineral rights at Minderoo dates back to 2009, not long after Mr Forrest purchased the station at auction for $12 million which his father had sold a decade earlier. The cattle station is one of the most famous rural properties in Western Australia, having been established by Andrew Forrest's forebear and the state's first premier, John Forrest, and his brothers.\nWithin months of the 2009 purchase, Fortescue applied for exploration rights over its boss's childhood home en masse. As the pastoral lease holder, Mr Forrest objected to the exploration permits lodged by Fortescue, and years of \"negotiations\" between the parties over the terms of access to explore the property ensued.\nA Fortescue spokesman said in 2012 that the miner had serious intentions to mine Minderoo. \"Fortescue's exploration team identified an area north-east of Carnarvon which may be prospective for mineral extraction,\" the spokesman said.\nBut as administrative pressure was applied to Fortescue to \"use or lose\" the exploration rights, the miner started relinquishing control of its Minderoo leases in 2013.\n Instead of the ground going out to a competitive market, documents obtained by The Australian Financial Review under Freedom of Information show that Mr Dale admitted to being tipped off the land was about to become available, although because he was not a related party to Fortescue, he said he had acted properly.\nMr Dale used a self-managed super fund called Richcab to secure the ground before anyone else could know it was available.\nA mining warden, who oversees exploration and mining matters, raised queries over the bone fides of Richcab's intentions before recommending late last year that the minister should dismiss the applications given it was a super fund that hadn't sought a tax ruling from the Taxation Office to act as an explorer.\nMr Forrest has since used another vehicle called Pilbara Property Management to apply for exploration rights over much of the same area previously applied for by Richcab.\nA spokesman for Mr Forrest said in June that the Minderoo leases would be actively explored.\n\"These are both being actively explored and a program of work is currently in progress including reprocessing of the geophysical data,\" the spokesman said.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/mindaroo_map_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-23T09:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T17:01:25.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
