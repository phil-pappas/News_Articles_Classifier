That’s the finding of a recent survey that asked more than 500 people about their preferred payments methods. When people pay in person, 42% use debit cards and 38% use credit cards , while only 17% use cash and 3% use checks. Online, the breakdown was 50% credit cards, 30% debit cards and 20% PayPal or similar bank account-linked services. The respondents who prefer debits cards said they are convenient and allow them “to use real money.” In the case of credit cards, respondents said they want rewards points. [ The New York Post ]\nAre Millennials Not Interested in Mobile Payments?\nA new study from Trustev suggests there might be some issues holding the rise of mobile payments back a bit. 91% of Millennials had at least one debit card, and routinely used them. 80%, meanwhile, had a standard credit card . When it comes to online payments, the older Millennials–between 25 and 34–were more likely to turn to a credit card, and 67 percent of the younger Millennials were following suit. What’s more, alternative payment systems weren’t unknown to the Millennial crowd, just often unused. 66% of Millennials reported having at least one payment app installed-be it Venmo, PayPal, or something else, but these apps weren’t often used. Bitcoin was also sufficiently unappealing. While 63% have heard of it, just 12% have actually used it.

The U.K. is an important market for Apple because the level of contactless penetration in cards and accepting terminals far exceeds that of the U.S. [ Bloomberg ]\nWal-Mart Canada Shuts Online Photo Centre over Potential Credit Card Data Breach\nWal-Mart Canada is contacting customers who may have been affected by a potential data breach of its photo website. The company said it was recently informed of a “potential compromise of customer credit card data” of its photo site.
