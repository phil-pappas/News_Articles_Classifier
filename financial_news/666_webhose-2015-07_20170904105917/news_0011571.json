The fear among economists, investors and traders is that Greece's economic problems could spill into the rest of Europe and perhaps the rest of the world. \nHowever, Trump argued Wednesday morning that Germany will take care of the embattled European country. \"I'd stay back a little bit. I wouldn't get too involved,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo. \"Don't forget that the whole Euro situation was created to compete against the United States. They put together a group of countries to beat the United States. Now Germany's very powerful, very strong. I'd let Germany handle it.\" Trump added that if Germany doesn't fix the Greek debt situation, Russian President Vladimir Putin would step in. \"We have enough problems,\" he said. \"Germany will ... take care of it.
