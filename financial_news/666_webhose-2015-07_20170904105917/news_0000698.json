Greece’s creditor institutions still view an austerity referendum, planned for July 5, as an issue for reaching an accord with Tsipras, according to an EU official.\nIn the event of Greek voters rejecting creditors’ demands, the nation’s financial system would have to be supported, Schwarzman said.\n“The pattern of withdrawals that have been fully covered by ECB loans would suggest that without those loans you’d have a collapse of banking system,” Schwarzman said. “How the ECB and Europe would transition that is something that I don’t know.”\nSchwarzman said he expected contagion from a Greek exit from the euro region would be contained. Blackstone has bought distressed real estate assets in Ireland with the economy starting to rebound from its property crash of 2008.\nIn Ireland, Blackstone is “more in the fix-it stage than the sell-it stage,” Schwarzman said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T15:17:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
