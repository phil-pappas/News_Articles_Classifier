By Roland Head | Fool.co.uk – 34 minutes ago 408.20 -14.9000 \nTwo of today's biggest fallers are Dialight (LSE: DIA) and Alton Towers owner Merlin Entertainments (LSE: MERL). \nI've been taking a look at the news behind today's falls and whether they represent a good buying opportunity for investors. \nMerlin's problem \nShares in Merlin Entertainments fell this morning after the firm admitted that June's Alton Towers roller-coaster crash would have a serious impact on profits. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for the key summer period are now expected to be £40-50m, compared to £87m in 2014. \nMerlin shares dropped 8% to a low of 385p when the market opened this morning and are currently trading at about 405p, 14% lower than before June's crash. \nIs this the bottom? \nMerlin says it is now taking action to \"rebuild momentum and re-engage with our customers\" . \nThe group doesn't say how badly visitor numbers have been affected, but did warn that \"there may be some continued adverse impact\" on profits in 2016. This suggests to me that Merlin is facing a serious struggle to attract visitors back to Alton Towers and other UK theme parks. \nMerlin shares now trade on 21 times 2015 forecast earnings per share. I expect these forecasts to be downgraded after today's profit warning. Merlin shares look expensive to me, especially as there could be more bad news on profits later this year. I personally rate the group as a sell. \nDialight \nShares in LED lighting specialist Dialight have fallen by 45% over the last year, thanks to a succession of profit warnings. Today's interim results announcement has sent the stock down by another 5%, to 518p. \nUnderlying earnings per share fell by 63% to 5.4p during the first half. This suggests that consensus forecasts for earnings per share of 31p in 2015 will now be cut hard. In my view, 15p per share seems more realistic. \nWhy? \nDialight has been hit hard by the downturn in the oil and gas sector, but after looking at today's interim results, I think there may be a more fundamental problem. \nThe group's profit margins seem to be collapsing. Despite strong sales growth from the group's flagship lighting division during the first half, operating profit plummeted:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T12:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T13:14:11.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
