France has consistently argued for the issue to be addressed whereas hardliners led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel have been far less willing to consider an easing of terms.\n“We have a right to expect from both sides, from the Greek side but also from the creditors’ side, goodwill and more responsibility than before,” Tusk said.\nBoth IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, called for some restructuring of Greece’s debt in separate speeches on Wednesday.\n“I continue to believe that it is in the best interest of all parties to find a resolution,” Lew said at a Brookings Institution event in Washington. “Greece needs a path toward a sustainable debt.”\nLoosen Noose The leaders of all 28 European Union countries will meet in Brussels on Sunday to respond to Greece’s proposals.\nSome euro-area governments have signaled they are open to some kind of re-profiling, which could include the freezing of interest rates. Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said on July 7 that such relief “would be acceptable” according to an interview with RTE TV.\nHe said that while haircuts on Greek debt wouldn’t be approved by his euro-area counterparts, finance ministers may agree to an extension of debt maturities.\nMerkel is having none of it.\nA “classic haircut is out of the question and that hasn’t changed,”she told reporters in Sarajevo.\nThe euro area could also resurrect an offer of debt relief made in November 2012 as an incentive to Greece to make good on the terms of its bailout.\nUnder that proposal, Greece would have won a cut in its interest payment and an extension of its repayment period if it had stuck to the deal and delivered a primary budget surplus. The agreement expired with its bailout program on June 30.\nFew Words If there is an accord on Saturday and Sunday, “a few words will probably be needed” on debt, EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said Thursday in an interview with France 24 television.\nGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras put forward a proposal on the eve of the June 27 referendum on the creditors’ bailout proposal for a 30 percent reduction in Greece’s debt without committing to reforms.\nHis request on Wednesday for a three-year bailout loan said tax and pension reforms would be implemented starting next week and all financial obligations would be honored “in a full and timely manner.” However, the all-important details on how the Greeks will do this are still missing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:43:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
