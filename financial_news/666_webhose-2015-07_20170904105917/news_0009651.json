European stocks open higher on a bumper day of earnings as investors look to the outcome of a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve. \nEuropean stocks traded higher on Wednesday on what is a bumper day of earnings, as investors look to the outcome of a two-day policy meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve. \nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 ( ^STOXX ) was trading around 0.7 percent higher by mid-afternoon. \nBritain's FTSE 100 (FTSE International: .FTSE) was around 0.7 percent higher, while the French CAC (Euronext Paris: .FCHI) and German DAX ( ^GDAXI ) were roughly up 0.5 and 0.3 percent respectively. Italy's FTSE MIB (FTSE International: .FTMIBE) however, was 1 percent lower and Spain's IBEX 35 (Mercado Continuo: .IBEX) traded down around 0.2 percent. \nA similar story across the Atlantic, as U.S. stocks traded in a narrow range on Wednesday, with investors digesting earnings and awaiting the release of the Fed statement which could shed light on the timing of a rate hike. \nOne of the biggest names reporting today, Barclays (London Stock Exchange: BARC-GB) , said adjusted pre-tax profit was up 11 percent to Â£3.7 billion in the first half of the year, sending shares up around 1.8 percent by mid-afternoon. \nTotal (Euronext Paris: FP-FR) said second quarter revenue fell 29 percent year-on-year to $44.7 billion, while adjusted net profit fell 2 percent to $3.085 billion as the low oil price continues to bite. Despite this, shares in the firm were trading around 0.8 percent higher. \nTullow Oil (London Stock Exchange: TLW-GB) also continued to feel the heat and reported a $10 million pre-tax loss in the first half of the year and a 35 percent plunge in revenue. The company also said that it would suspend its dividend. Shares were over 3.4 percent higher at the open but reversed gains to trade 5.8 percent lower by mid-afternoon. \nFrench carmaker Peugeot (Euronext Paris: UG-FR) said its net profit for the first half of the year came in at 571 million euros ($630.5 million) after booking a 114 million euro loss a year earlier. Peugeot saw a 6.1 percent pop as a result, but pared slight gains to 5.4 percent higher in afternoon trade. \nIn the pharmaceutical space, Bayer (XETRA:BAYN-DE) reported a 20.9 percent rise in net profit in the second quarter to 1.15 billion euros ($1.27 billion) from 953 million euros in the same period last year, sending shares over 4.6 percent higher. \nCement maker Holcim saw second-quarter net profit plunge 35.2 percent year-on-year to 263 million Swiss francs in its last earnings as a separate company before it begins reporting as a group after its merger with Lafarge. The new group, LafargeHolcim (:HOLN-CH) , also released a \"roadmap\" for the second half of the year. In a statement, the company said on Wednesday, that its dividend will stand at 1.30 Swiss francs per share for the 2015 financial year. Shares in LafargeHolcim plunged over 3.5 percent. \nDutch publishing company Wolters Kluwer (Euronext Amsterdam: WKL-NL) reported better-than-expected revenues, up 17 percent in the first half of the year compared to the same period in 2014. Shares in the firm surged over 6 percent. \nEuropean pay-TV group Sky (London Stock Exchange: SKY-GB) said revenues rose 5 percent year-on-year to Â£11.3 billion ($17.6 billion) for the 12 months ending June 30. The company initially traded up 2 percent but reversed gains to trade around 0.6 percent lower in the afternoon. \nOil and gas company Saipem (Milan Stock Exchange: SPM'S-IT) announced thousands of job cuts on Tuesday and revised down its outlook for the rest of the year. Shares in the Italian firm plunged over 8.8 percent as a result but pared losses, to trade around 5.1 percent lower by mid-afternoon. \nBritish American Tobacco (London Stock Exchange: BATS-GB) said revenues fell in the first half of the year due to currency fluctuations but shares in the company were trading around 3.3 percent higher. \nInvestors will also be watching for any clues on the timing of an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting that concludes on Wednesday. \nFed-watchers surveyed by CNBC expect a rate hike in September, by a very thin margin. The next likely date is December, but there is also an October meeting, viewed as unlikely since the Fed does not have a scheduled press conference after it. \nIn other news, a survey from France's national statistics institute Insee, said consumer confidence in the country fell in July. Another survey in Germany said consumer confidence in the euro zone's largest economy looks set to remain stable going into August.
