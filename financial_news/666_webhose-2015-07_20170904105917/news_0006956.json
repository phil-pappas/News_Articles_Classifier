By Prabhat Sakya | Fool.co.uk â€“ 1 hour 15 minutes ago Print \nWhat is the greatest danger in the world today? Disease? War? Terrorism? No to all of these; I think it is debt. \nYou know, I feel sorry for the Greeks. They are a good people. It is not by chance that this was the birthplace of democracy and debate. They have a sense of what is right and what is fair. Instead of bluster, they discuss and reason about everything. \nGovernments must balance their budgets \nEveryday there are more dramatic headlines about what is happening to this country; but this is not really about headlines. What the Greek people have been through over the past five years has been nothing short of horrific. People have lost their businesses, their jobs, their homes and their families. \nYet another bailout looms for Greece. The conditions stipulated are at least impossible. Greece's debt is now reaching somewhere near a google. I think this is getting silly. \nLinear thinking is very common. You try something; it works. You try it again; it still works. So you keep doing the same thing. But at some point it will stop working. So you stop doing it. \nIt is now Greece's third bailout. The national debt of Greece is estimated to be 344 billion euros. The population of Greece is 11 million. That's quite a lot of debt, for a small country without the economic firepower of the major nations. \nHow could this country be allowed to rack up such a huge credit card bill? Beats me. \nAnd you see, the way to prevent this sort of thing is ridiculously easy: just balance your budget. Governments should not be allowed to produce budgets which are not balanced. Full stop. \nRacking up debt is akin to being a drug addict. And Greece has taken so much, it is now in the emergency room. This means it now needs emergency measures. Bailouts just won't cover it. \nGreece must leave the euro \nGreece has to leave the euro. It has to default on its debts. This will mean the economy will be frozen out of the debt markets -- people won't be able to take out mortgages or loans or make credit card purchases. But this is preferable to a country's spiral into what is basically oblivion. \nThis has to be done as gently as possible so that it doesn't go into shock. But it has pretty much been expecting this for the past five years. And if Europe and its banks pull together, I am hopeful there won't be systemic effects on the global financial system, including the FTSE 100 . \nThe country will see itself as destitute; and, to some extent, it will be. But it will get through it. I suspect it may take a decade, but Greece will improve, recover and eventually strengthen, helped by a weak drachma which will draw tourists and companies. \nThe world is watching this. And it should be. Because Greece must tell the world about the dangers and the horrors of debt. \nHow will our future world be? What will be the effect of the world's growing debt mountain? What will be the impact of the growth of emerging markets, of technology, and of renewable energy? \nThese are some of the topics which you need to consider when you build a long term investment portfolio. And we at the Fool have discussed, debated and finally chosen five companies which we think should be prime components of your retirement nest egg. \nWant to learn more?
