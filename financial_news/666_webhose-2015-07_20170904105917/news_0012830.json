The ticket usually costs around £14 return, but it can be as low as £10, or much more, depending on how early you book and the demand. So the offer was much appreciated.\nAfter inserting the code, I was redirected to a page that said “an error occurred while processing your request and has been reported to technical staff”. I tried again on several occasions but the message stayed the same. I have had email exchanges with National Express staff and I was eventually sent a new voucher code but, you guessed it, the same thing happened again.\nI have just had an email from National Express informing me that I only have four more journeys to complete before I qualify for a free trip. Talk about going round in circles … JM, London SW4\nNational Express has checked the website and tested your code. It says the problem was due to “an unusual technical glitch” on the website. It adds: “Having tested the rest of the free voucher codes issued to customers we can confirm they are working correctly. We have been in touch with JM and booked her and her husband a free journey and apologised for the inconvenience”.\nWe welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
