For instance, Metro users pay for only 6.5 trips per week but have the option of 14 trips including the weekends. Similarly, Metro monthly tickets are priced for 3.1 weeks' travel but allow the holder to travel for 4 weeks.\" \nThe Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) in the Western Cape threatened strike action against Metrorail's fare hike. \n\"Cosatu is opposed to the Metrorail price increase,\" provincial secretary Tony Ehrenreich told Fin24 on June 30. \nHe said on June 30 that Cosatu would be filing a Section 77 Application against Metrorail to stop the increase and to strike if needs be. \n\"Cosatu opposes any increase in the fares until the trains are running on time and regularly, with sufficient capacity to reduce the chronic levels of overcrowding,\" said Ehrenreich. \n\"The current situation is that after spending money on a weekly or monthly ticket, workers have to spend additional money for alternative transport in the event of train delays. This is an extra expense that has become regular due to the bad state of the trains at present.\" \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T12:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T12:57:26.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
