The stock market is very clearly unclear Jul. 25, 2015, 10:01 AM 22 \nStocks have been on an absolute tear since they bottomed out in 2009: \nA Wealth of Common Sense \nBut since the market peaked in early 2000, U.S. stocks haven’t really done much for investors as we’ve gone through a series of booms and busts: \nA Wealth of Common Sense \nOn the other hand, interest rates around the globe are at historically low levels: \nA Wealth of Common Sense \nNevertheless, it’s hard to say that these return numbers from global markets suggest a worldwide bubble gone mad (via Capital Speculator ): \nA Wealth of Common Sense \nHowever, stock market valuations are above average in most of the large developed market countries around the globe (via @CAPE_invest ): \nHaving said that, valuations may not be as stretched as they appear compared to the subdued inflation rates in developed countries: \nA Wealth of Common Sense \nIt’s also worth remembering that the Fed will have to raise rates in the future, possibly before the end of 2015: \nA Wealth of Common Sense \nWhich could mean the end for a 30+ year bond bull market: \nA Wealth of Common Sense \nMany think we’re in another stock bubble because equity ownership is now back to the 2007 peak: \nA Wealth of Common Sense \nIn spite of this data, you could make an argument for people holding more stocks in their portfolios for the simple fact that people are living longer than ever, so maybe they need more stocks to grow their money in retirement: \nA Wealth of Common Sense \nAll of which is to say…the markets are confusing. \nYou could play point-counterpoint all day long with any piece of market data. The trick is to always see both sides of the debate before making a big decision. Even with access to more information than we know what to do with, some investors are still able to focus exclusively on only those facts that back up their current line of thinking. The Internet may be the biggest source of deflation ever invented, but it’s also the biggest source of inflation for people’s confirmation bias. \nYou could pick any single data point that aligns with your current positioning and build your narrative around it to make yourself feel better about your investment stance. But unless you’re able to see all sides of a debate you’ll never be able to make rational decisions when it comes to the markets. There’s something to be said for nuance, perspective and context when it comes to analyzing complex systems such as the markets. \nThe other lesson here is the markets are never easy. As Charlie Munger once said, “It’s not supposed to be easy. Anyone who finds it easy is stupid.” \nRead the original article on A Wealth of Common Sense .
