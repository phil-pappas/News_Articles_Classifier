Finance Magnates was allowed an exclusive peek into the new platform offering trading on foreign exchange (FX), stocks, CFDs, commodities, futures contracts and indices. \nSocial trading itself is a hugely popular mechanism in FX, whereby a number of leaders broadcast or transmit trading strategies to other parties. The rise of such trading strategies has permeated the FX industry, ranking as commonplace in a peer-to-peer oriented community. \nAs for the new web platform itself, it works off a single browser screen capable of streaming a feed of trading ideas and selected instruments via small chart, rates, spread, margin, as well as the buy/sell sentiment in one box. Other aspects of the platform, such as a competition leaderboard, are available from tabs on the screen. \nThe company has hinted at a large cash prize with details forthcoming as to the next stage of the competition. Finance Magnates will update readers when the trading conditions and specifics are made public. Got a news tip? Let Us Know FOUND A MISTAKE How do you feel about the article?
