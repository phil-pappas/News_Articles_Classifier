Source: AAP\nMr Abbott said Australia has investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms in no less than 21 agreements and has had one with China since the Hawke government first signed a bilateral investment treaty with China back in 1988.\nThe government was locked in with the FTA after 10 years of talks with China and a “deal is a deal” and to amend one part of it would reopen it all, he said.\nFormer Labor foreign minister Bob Carr believes that while the unions have legitimate concerns over Australian jobs, he says there are lots of safeguards in the provisions of the FTA.\n“The capacity to bring in foreign labour would not apply to normal projects — they’ve got to test local markets first to see whether they can find Australian workers and Australian conditions apply,” he told AAP on the fringes of the conference.\n“I don’t think it will come to anything.”\nABBOTT POINTS TO BENEFITS OF CHINA FTA\n• It removes barriers to Australian agricultural exports, including beef, dairy, lamb, wine, horticulture and seafood.\n• Meat and Livestock Australia forecast their sector will benefit by $11 billion over the next decade.\n• The FTA means duty-free entry for 99.9 per cent of our resources, energy and manufacturing exports within four years.\n• The Minerals Council of Australia says this removes nearly $600 million in costs from the bilateral minerals and energy trade.\n• Australian banks will be able to expand branch networks in China.\n• Australian fund managers will be able to invest overseas on behalf of qualified Chinese institutions and Australian insurers will be able to provide third party motor vehicle insurance.\n• The agreement secures the jobs of over 400,000 Australian workers that are employed in financial services, while opening new opportunities.\n(Source: Tony Abbott speech to Boao Forum for Asia Financial Co-operation Conference)\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/tony-abbott-told-to-drop-the-race-card-on-china-free-trade-agreement/story-e6frflo9-1227463142119?sv=e0e1b0ca0653cb079b339c796057734e", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=PM+told+to+%26%238216%3Bdrop+the+race+card%26%238217%3B&c=PENNY+Wong+has+told+the+prime+minister+to+stop+playing+the+race+card+when+it+comes+to+defending+the+free-trade+agreement+with+China.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/tony-abbott-told-to-drop-the-race-card-on-china-free-trade-agreement/story-e6frflo9-1227463142119?sv=e0e1b0ca0653cb079b339c796057734e", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/tony-abbott-told-to-drop-the-race-card-on-china-free-trade-agreement/story-e6frflo9-1227463142119?sv=e0e1b0ca0653cb079b339c796057734e&h=PM+told+to+%26%238216%3Bdrop+the+race+card%26%238217%3B", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/tony-abbott-told-to-drop-the-race-card-on-china-free-trade-agreement/story-e6frflo9-1227463142119?sv=e0e1b0ca0653cb079b339c796057734e&title=PM+told+to+%26%238216%3Bdrop+the+race+card%26%238217%3B", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/tony-abbott-told-to-drop-the-race-card-on-china-free-trade-agreement/story-e6frflo9-1227463142119?sv=e0e1b0ca0653cb079b339c796057734e&title=PM+told+to+%26%238216%3Bdrop+the+race+card%26%238217%3B", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/tony-abbott-told-to-drop-the-race-card-on-china-free-trade-agreement/story-e6frflo9-1227463142119?sv=e0e1b0ca0653cb079b339c796057734e"], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T14:47:27.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
