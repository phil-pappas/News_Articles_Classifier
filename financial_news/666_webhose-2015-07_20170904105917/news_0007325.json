For Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, July 14 may feel like he’s recovering from a hangover. Or awaking from a dream in which he’s about to be trampled under the outsize boot of German Chancellor Angela Merkel after that tough bailout agreement reached with the country’s international lenders early Monday.\nWhile investors cheered the deal, it is clear there is a lot of heavy lifting left, including Tsipras’s bid to sell the agreement to the most radical members of his Syriza party in Greece’s parliament on Wednesday.\nThe Greece bailout wasn't loved by Greece stocks on Monday, at least as expressed through Greece exchange-traded fund Global X FTSE Greece 20 ETF GREK, -4.35% which slumped even as global stocks soared. (The Greek stock market was closed — again.) The action in the ETF suggests there may be a hard road ahead for the southern European country and its debt-strapped population of a little more than 11 million.\nRead: Greek debt crisis: Latest news\nToday, investors are hoping to move beyond the chatter around Athens and focus on earnings. That will arrive as sprawling banks J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +1.55% and Wells Fargo WFC, +1.18% report quarterly results early Tuesday.

Morgan beating second-quarter profit estimates by a dime .\nElsewhere, the Iranian nuclear agreement struck early Tuesday is set to have a major effect on crude-oil prices, but the impact on supply may not be immediate: Read: Iran’s return to oil market will be ‘long and arduous’\nKey market gauges Futures on the Dow YMU5, -0.03% and the S&P ESU5, -0.02% are lower on Tuesday. European markets are mixed, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index SXXP, -0.15% pointing modestly higher while other indexes are tracking lower.\nCrude CLU5, +0.08% is moving lower off news of the Iran agreement, while gold GCQ5, -0.13% and silver SIU5, -0.89% are also slipping.\nThe economy Investors are expecting a steady slate of economic reports Tuesday, including the small-business sentiment for June from the National Federation of Independent Business, which dropped sharply in June . A report on import prices as well as a pair of retail-sales reports are due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, and a report on May business inventories is due at 10 a.m.\nThe Quote: “Arguably the toughest justice on the Supreme Court is the oldest, Ruth Bader Ginsburg,” he said. “Also known as the Notorious RBG.
