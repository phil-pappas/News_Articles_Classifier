No agreement has been reached and talks could still falter.\nVeritas, which Symantec bought in 2005 for more than $13 billion, generates cash flow but has low revenue growth. Shaping it up would require firing employees and shutting down product lines, a person familiar with the situation said in April. The potential strategic buyers of Veritas dropped out of the process as it became clearer that a private equity buyer could better afford Symantec’s price while stomaching the months or years of work needed to improve the company’s results, a person with knowledge of the process said.\nData-storage in general is a slow-growth business and Symantec’s storage segment reflected those pressures. Revenue in that business for the latest fiscal year, which ended April 3, was up 2 percent to $2.56 billion, and operating income was down 15 percent to $486 million.\nSymantec had planned on spinning out the unit as a separately traded company later this year if it couldn’t find a buyer. In October, Symantec said it would split into two divisions, separating its storage and security businesses.\nThe Mountain View, California-based company has a market capitalization of $15.5 billion.\nKristen Batch, a spokeswoman for Symantec, declined to comment, as did Randall Whitestone, a spokesman for Carlyle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T01:31:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
