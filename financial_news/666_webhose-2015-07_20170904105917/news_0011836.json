Andrew Quilty Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell Australians have been enjoying good returns with low risk for the last few years but the \"free lunch\" is about to end, for good, warns a leading funds manager.\nDespite a shocking start to the week that saw the local equity market shed almost $40 billion in the wake of Greek debt issues and reduce financial year 2014-15 gains to just over 1 per cent, Australian equity investors have experienced one of the longest bull markets in decades. If there is no correction by August, it will be the third-longest since 1937.\nThe S&P/ASX200 came close to a correction in early June, when the market had fallen by 9 per cent from a peak in April of 5996 points.\nSome significant Australian stocks have been tracking towards correction levels since early 2015. These include market movers such as Westpac, the National Australia Bank and BHP Billiton as well as technology stars SEEK and REA.\nBut Pimco head of portfolio management Robert Mead warned local investors in a note that a major adjustment is on its way for their domestic financial activities.\nMr Mead says shifts in the banking sector to focusing on raising capital rather than deposit funding coupled with the 2 per cent interest rate means \"the kitchen is now closed, permanently\".\nAs the hunt for yield intensifies, Mr Mead said many investors were migrating from Australian banks, which experienced a spate of sell-offs throughout June, and into alternatives such as hybrid investments.\n\"These alternate sources of income seem reasonable as long as the risks are well understood, portfolio concentration risk is avoided and the capacity for larger mark-to-market loss can be handled.\"\n Mr Mead said Pimco's recently released neutral outlook for Australia assumes rates will remain low, with major losses confined to the most bubble-prone classes.\n\"I suggest investors explicitly acknowledge that the real risk-free rate is now negative and be mindful of the additional risk in the instruments they use for income generation.\"\nThe evaporation of local risk-free rewards is another challenge facing equity investors in a slowing global economy. Research released this week by Gavekal Capital showed a broad equity markets correction was edging closer, with almost half of the MSCI World index stocks in a technical correction, after retreating more than 10 per cent off recent highs this year.\nThe biggest decline among MSCI regional indexes was the Asia-Pacific, which had 46 per cent of its stocks in a correction, followed by North America with 43 per cent.\nA total of 15 per cent of the MSCI World Index had lost more than 20 per cent off their peaks and entered bear market territory.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/shares-tank-as-greece-nears-default-20150629-gi0kcl.html", "https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711", "https://twitter.com/rosepowell"], "published": "2015-07-03T08:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:10:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
