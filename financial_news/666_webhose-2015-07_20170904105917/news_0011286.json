Chevron lost 4.9 percent as it reported about a 90 percent drop in profits to just $571 million. \nBut the pain to petroleum-oriented equities did not end there. Drilling company Nabors Industries (NYSE: NBR - news ) lost 1.8 percent and producer Marathon Oil shed 3.8 percent after US oil prices dived almost 3.0 percent to close at $47.52 a barrel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T23:42:48.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
