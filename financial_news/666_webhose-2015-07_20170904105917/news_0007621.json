A government investigation has reportedly found documents suggesting money from the fund was also transferred into the personal bank account of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.\nLend Lease is dealing with the real estate arm of 1MDB, last year unveiling a partnership to deliver a $2.8 billion part of Malaysian's new financial district the Tun Razak Exchange.\n\"As with any agreement, we have undertaken due diligence and put in place appropriate protection for Lend Lease,\" a spokesperson said.\nConstruction of the Lifestyle Quarter, which includes a hotel, three residential towers and a shopping centre, is expected to begin in late 2015 after Lend Lease and 1MDB signed a final agreement in March.\nAnalysts expressed uncertainty over whether the latest allegations might impact the project and Lend Lease.\n\"At the time of the project announcement, media reports suggested issues about 1MDB's solvency to which Lend Lease said it had undertaken appropriate due diligence and had 'protection',\" Commonwealth Bank analyst Ben Brownette said.\n\"Whether that DD and protection extends to recent media claims is unclear; however the company said at the time construction was due to begin 'late 2015' so that is likely the key inflection point.\"\n Last month CLSA analysts wrote to clients describing the project as \"risky for Lend Lease but the estimated $300 million maximum exposure is not threatening.\n\"This project appears risky with maximum risk occurring over the next two years as the retail component is developed,\" CLSA said.\n\"[1MDB] is over-geared and struggling to repay its debts. Lend Lease is confident that its relationship with the government will ensure this TRX project is unaffected even if 1MDB – the subject of governance related media speculation – should collapse.\"\nThe Australian Financial Review has not been able to independently verify the allegations surrounding 1MDB. The government owned fund said this week it has never provided any funds to the Prime Minister, who chairs its advisory board.\n\"1MDB is currently co-operating with a number of enquiries being conducted by lawful authorities including the Auditor General, the Public Accounts Committee and Bank Negara,\" the group said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T18:08:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
