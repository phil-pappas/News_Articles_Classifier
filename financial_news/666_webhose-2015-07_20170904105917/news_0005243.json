This represents a higher CAGR of 14% compared to all other regions which see their markets increase at a combined CAGR of 11.9%.\nProvided that it remains the 2022 FIFA World Cup host Qatar will lead the Middle East with its own power rental arena expanding at a CAGR of 18.5% from 225 million in 2014 to 622.2 million by 2020. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia will follow with respective CAGRs of 13.1% and 10.3% over the forecast period.\nHowever one Senior Analyst covering Power says that Qatar’s exponential growth may be restrained if the country loses the chance to host the World Cup following allegations of bribery in the bidding process and the subsequent resignation of FIFA president Sepp Blatter.\n“With the World Cup planned for Qatar in 2022 and the 2020 World Expo in the UAE significant investments have been made in these countries’ infrastructure development. These include Qatar’s investments of more than 200 billion in developing its rail and highway network and ports in turn boosting its power rental market.\n“On the other hand losing the World Cup could significantly impact the planned flow of such investments and government spending directed towards the country’s large-scale infrastructure development and construction sector subsequently hindering the predicted growth in its power rental project revenues.”\nThe analyst adds that even if the World Cup proceeds in Qatar several barriers will still hinder further growth in its power rental space by 2020 including stringent emission standards to help counter its environmental challenges.\n“High efficiency and emission standards mean that Qatar’s power equipment rental market which predominantly depends on diesel-powered generator sets will face obstacles in terms of upgrading current equipment resulting in added costs for owners.”\nContact: \nDebora White\nManager - Marketing \ndebora@reportstack.com\nPh: 1-888-789-6604\nMarket Research\n###\n\n\nAbout PRBuzz.com \nPRBuzz.com is a press release distribution service that distributes press releases to online news sites and blogs to help customers with search engine optimization and create buzz about their web site, news or business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T18:01:56.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
