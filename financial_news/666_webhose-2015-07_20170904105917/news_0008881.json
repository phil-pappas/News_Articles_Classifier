Nevertheless, it's put them at a competitive disadvantage, said Ernie Patrikis , banking regulatory partner at White & Case .\n\"Enhanced prudential supervision -- those are the key words,\" said Patrikis. You're dealing with \"leverage, capital and other matters. It really puts constraints on banks that competitors don't have. It's remarkable they do as well as they can within that.\"\nPatrikis advises global banking and insurance clients on a range of U.S. regulatory issues and reforms for the international law firm, including implementation of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act , such as the Volcker Rule , enhanced prudential standards and resolution planning, and consumer financial protection issues.\nRegarding bank CEOs who have openly spoken out against the stricter regulatory standards, Patrikis said they are well within their right, despite the fact that the banks played a significant role in the 2008 financial crisis, which led to government intervention.\n\"I think bankers have to criticize and they have to do it more,\" said Patrikis. \"When I first started practicing at the Fed maybe 45 years ago, banks used to sue the Fed. Today nobody dares. The Fed is too powerful. So they have to speak out. They have to go to the Hill. They are protecting themselves.\"\nAs for the Volcker Rule, which limits proprietary trading and went into full effect this week, Patrikis said it is affecting liquidity in the market and could help cause a future crisis.\n\"What bothers me is that we don't know what the impact is of the aggregate of all these restrictions,\" said Patrikis. \"It's like a tactical battle against the banking system and I don't know what the strategy is.\"\nPatrikis is currently president of the Center for Transnational Legal Studies, the body that publishes the treatise on Regulation of Foreign Banks and Affiliates in the United States.\nPrior to joining White & Case, Patrikis served for 30 years at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, including as general counsel, as chief operating officer and as first vice president. He also spent eight years at AIG as general counsel and senior vice president, where he helped lead the insurer's 2001 acquisition of American General Life Insurance and defended the company in proceedings by federal and state authorities.", "external_links": ["http://www.translegalstudies.org/symposium_2014/materials/UPDATED%20Bio%20Ernest%20Patrikis.pdf", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13231113/1/dodd-frank-making-us-banks-uncompetitive-says-white-case-partner.html", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13231113/1/dodd-frank-making-us-banks-uncompetitive-says-white-case-partner.html&text=Dodd-Frank", "http://www.whitecase.com/", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13231113/1/dodd-frank-making-us-banks-uncompetitive-says-white-case-partner.html&title=Dodd-Frank", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13231113/1/dodd-frank-making-us-banks-uncompetitive-says-white-case-partner.html", "https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/dodd-frank.shtml", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13231113/1/dodd-frank-making-us-banks-uncompetitive-says-white-case-partner.html", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ernie-patrikis-no-dont-audit-the-fed-1426633745", "http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-07-22/volcker-rule-might-make-losing-money-illegal"], "published": "2015-07-25T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T14:00:33.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
