Reuters Share on twitter by Angus Grigg China's state pension fund ordered its asset managers not to sell any local shares on Monday, after Beijing halted new equity issues and forced the central bank to extend credit to brokers as part of emergency measures aimed at bolstering markets.\nThe extraordinary intervention helped push the Shanghai Composite Index up 2.4 per cent on Monday but the rise in the overall market disguised big falls among smaller stocks not linked to the government.\nIn a wild day of trading, 649 stocks fell, while only 259 rose in Shanghai as the country's 90 million retail investors appeared unconvinced by the government attempts to engender confidence.\n\"If the market did not rally today it would have badly hurt the government's credibility,\" said Zhang Qi, an analyst with Haitong Securities in Shanghai.\nTraders indicated the ¥120 billion ($26 billion) stabilisation fund set up by the country's main stock brokers began buying large government-linked stocks in the afternoon, leading the Shanghai market higher.\nThe smaller Shenzhen Composite Index fell 1.4 per cent while the technology-focused ChiNext was down by 4.3 per cent.\nIndependent media group Caijing reported the National Social Security Fund ordered the selling ban on Monday, which it said was communicated to fund managers during a series of phone calls.\nIt said they were ordered \"not to sell a single share\" by senior management. The state-pension fund had $159 billion of assets at the end of last year, split between bonds and equities.\n While sizeable, it is less than half the $323 billion worth of stock traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen on Monday.\nPolicies to stabilise China's central government has rolled out a series of policies to stabilise the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets over the last three weeks, after they lost a quarter of their value amid panic selling and wild fluctuations.\nThese measures have seen the halting of 28 initial public offerings, allowing the country's sovereign wealth fund to buy local shares, having the central bank provide liquidity for margin lending and forcing stock brokers to create the ¥120 billion market stabilisation fund.\nThe government efforts have been labelled a \"takeover\" and a form of \"unconventional stimulus\" by Tao Dong, the high profile China economist at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong.\nHe said government intervention in the sharemarket was a major step back for China's capital markets and economic reform.\n\"Beijing has chosen social stability and financial stability over long-term efforts to develop its capital markets,\" he said via phone. \"The government is basically taking over.\"\nThe heavy government intervention looks to be at odds with a Communist Party pledge in November 2013, which stated markets would \"play a decisive\" role in China as it embarked on the next stage of economic reform.\nMr Tao said the government intervention may affect China's push for an increased weighting in the benchmark MSCI Asia Index, a move that would force global fund managers to significantly increase their exposure to China.\nMSCI is reviewing China's position and was expected to increase the country's weighting before the recent market turmoil.\n\"The government is doing things they don't usually do and are not supposed to do,\" Mr Tao said in reference to the central government's intervention in the sharemarkets.\n\"It should be seen as China's version of QE [quantitative easing].\"\nMr Tao said while the measures taken in China where different to the monetary stimulus provided by central banks in the United States and Europe, they were still unconventional methods to boost the economy.\n\"We should not underestimate Beijing's political will to stabilise the markets,\" he said.\nBeijing's determination looks to be partly driven by fears of street protests and public anger directed at the government over the recent sell-off, after the state-media encouraged the sharemarket rally that pushed the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets up 150 per cent in the year to June.\nThis saw an estimated 40 million new stock trading accounts opened in the first five months of the year, as first time investors withdrew money from bank deposits to chase higher returns on the market.\n\"If the stock market collapses then the economy is finished and this was cause social instability,\" said Yang Fan, a senior economist from the China University of Political Science and Law.\n\"China's economy does not have any highlights other than the stock market so the country needs to be united together to boost the stock market.\"\nApart from forbidding shares sales by those managing money for the state pension fund, the most controversial of the government's measures came on Sunday night via the China Securities Regulatory Commission.\nIn a brief statement it said the People's Bank of China, the central bank, would \"uphold market stability\" by providing liquidity to China Finance Securities, a state entity that provides margin loans to brokers.\nIt is estimated that 17 per cent of the market is backed by margin lending and therefore, ensuring adequate liquidity is a crucial plank in stabilising the market.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/AngusGrigg"], "published": "2015-07-06T14:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T12:13:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
