AP BlackRock's iShares fund holds the top 50 stocks listed on the H Shares market. H Shares are listed Chinese companies traded on the Hong Kong exchange.\nMeanwhile, the Van Eck Market Vector fund had a spike in volumes in the past week with inflows gradually increasing, according to Van Eck Australian managing director Arian Neiron.\nThe Market Vector ETF floated on the ASX at the end of June and is the only exchange-traded fund with China A Shares exposure.\n\"Everyone from institutional investors, financial advisers, the brokerage platforms of private banks and mum and dad investors have been transacting in the [China Large-Cap] ETF in the last week,\" Mr Howie said.\n Even though the Market Vector fund is new, its interest has spread quickly as investors attempt to \"day trade\" the volatile China market, Mr Neiron said.\nThe interest in the China ETFs comes off the back of bullish views expressed by key portfolio managers within investment firms at Platinum International and AMP Capital on the China sharemarket.\nBoth Platinum and AMP are qualified foreign institutional investors and hold China A Shares, the stocks at the epicentre of weeks of volatile trading activity, which rose around 150 per cent from November 2014 through to May before losing about half of their value from mid-June, only to bounce again at the end of last week.\nGovernment-sponsored buying of the shares mixed with the heavy use of margin loans accounted for the big peaks and troughs that resulted in the local securities regulator suspending trading in around half of the 2776 stocks.\nWhile inflows into the ETFs indicate some believers in the China story are buying and holding, the increased volumes also indicated there are plenty of investors day-trading the volatile market, Mr Neiron said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T12:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T11:00:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
