Share on twitter by Misa Han Top executives might pay their assistants up to $150,000 plus bonuses this financial year, as the former secretary's job becomes more like a \"junior CEO\", recruiters say.\nAssistants to chief executives in Sydney and Perth are getting paid up to $150,000 and executive assistants to general managers and directors in Sydney up to $115,000, a salary survey by Michael Page shows.\nThe data is based on responses from 137 employers and represents annual salary including superannuation but excluding bonuses, for companies turning over more than $50 million.\nHowever, a Hudson salary guide , released in January, estimates the maximum salary for executive assistants to be lower, at $100,000 in Sydney and $90,000 in Perth.\nDimitra Zographos, executive assistant to a Western Union Business Solutions director, said the job was was like being a \"junior CEO\" in the business.\n\"The future is about adding strategic value to the business. Imagine going up to your CEO and letting them know a tender is going out because you leverage relationships you have with other EAs. But a lot of EAs don't understand that,\" she said.\nMichael Page director Christian Bonadio said the salary range across Sydney and Perth was \"the absolute top end\" and would generally be given to someone who had been with the same employer for a number of years.\n\"It's very rare to be briefed on a role where the client would be saying to us $150k for an EA. Clients who are recruiting externally are looking at a level below that,\" Mr Bonadio said.\n But the EA salary had been increasing as businesses had eliminated the number of support staff, he said.\nHays regional director Alex Jones said the medium salary for EAs was about $75,000 plus super, but at the top end of the market EAs could be expected to be paid up to $130,000, typically in fast-moving consumer good and construction industries.\nThe EA role was getting increasingly multifaceted and EAs could fast-track their careers by learning skills in event co-ordination, finance and budgeting and data analysis, Mr Jones said.\nRandstad director Mike Roddy said the high salary for EAs reflected the change in their roles.\n\"It shouldn't really spook anybody. Once upon a time it was a purely administrative support function but now the role has resemblance to an office manager, so there is demand on maturity, education levels, technical ability and the ability to manage people,\" he said.\nSherida Bolling, executive assistant to Randstad chief executive Frank Ribuot, has been executive assistant at Randstad for 15 years. She said the role of EAs had changed over the years and her role broadened as the organisation grew from 200 to 700 employees.\n\"Traditionally it was known as a gatekeeper role but now you are expected to be a true business partner. Historically it was 80 per cent administration and 20 per cent event and mentoring but it has shifted.\n\"Basic admin and correspondence is still a significant portion, but on top of that you have diary management, travel, project management, consultation with key stakeholders and organising events and conferences.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan", "http://au.hudson.com/salary-guides", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/exec_support_pay_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-13T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:04:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
