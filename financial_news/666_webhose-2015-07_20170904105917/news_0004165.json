It was Rs 905 crore for the debt markets, translating into a net inflow of Rs 4,073 crore, according to data available with the depositories.\nFPIs’ net outflow was over Rs 1,600 crore from the capital markets (debt and equities) last month, while they withdrew Rs 14,272 crore in May.\nAccording to market experts, foreign investors are betting that Greece will strike a deal with creditors by this Sunday. It has recently submitted an economic reform proposal to creditors.\nThe move has created hopes among investors that Greece will be able to secure fresh round of funding, which will help it prevent bankruptcy and remain in the eurozone.\nFund infusion by FPIs will rise once issues related to Greece are sorted and the US Federal Reserve’s position on interest rates gets clearer, say analysts.\nWith the latest inflow, money invested by FPIs in the capital markets has reached Rs 82,500 crore since the beginning of the year.\nFirst Published on July 12, 2015 11:54 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T23:32:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
