Early Monday, copper futures were off another 0.29 percent.\nThe Fed's rate-setting Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday and is considered highly unlikely to lift interest rates just yet, though it does still seem set on a move in September.\n\"We expect Fed voters to pull the trigger in September, but for the path to interest rate normalisation to be a long one given the global risk profile, the lack of inflationary pressure, and concerns over what moving too quickly may do to asset markets, particularly the dollar, and the wider economy,\" said analysts at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.\nExpectations of a hike has slowly pushed up U.S. Treasury yields and widened the dollar's premium over the euro. Yields on two-year U.S. notes pay around 90 basis points more than German debt, near the widest since early 2007.\nThat kept the dollar well supported around $1.0972 per euro on Monday, while it was a fraction firmer against a basket of currencies at 97.279.\nThe dollar was steady on the yen at 123.72 having spent the past few sessions wandering between 123.54 and 124.48.\nA first estimate of U.S. economic growth for last quarter is due on Thursday and is expected to show a rebound of 2.7 percent annualised, from the first quarter's weather-induced contraction.\nThe Dow ended Friday down 0.92 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 1.07 percent and the Nasdaq 1.12 percent. For the week, the Dow fell 2.9 percent while the S&P 500 lost 2.2 percent and the Nasdaq 2.3 percent.\nWall Street has been weighed in part by concerns that a high U.S. dollar and sluggish global demand was pressuring corporate profits, a theme that should wend its way through this week's busy diary of earnings.\nAs well as blue-chip names such as Pfizer and Exxon Mobil, there are a range of social media stocks that have led the market so far in 2015 including Facebook, Cigna, Twitter and LinkedIn.\nIn the energy market, Brent crude was Quote: d 11 higher at $54.73 a barrel, but still near its lowest since March. U.S. crude was off a cent at $48.13.\nGold seemed to have steadied after its recent slide, with spot bullion at $1,097.16 an ounce.
