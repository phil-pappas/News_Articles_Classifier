Economists polled by Reuters had expected new applications to fall to 275,000 last week.\nThursday's jobless claims report marks the 18th consecutive week of new filings below 300,000, which is seen as a sign that the labor market is improving.\nA Labor Department analyst said there was nothing unusual in the latest claims report.\nThe four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes out week-to-week fluctuations and is therefore considered a better gauge of the labor market, rose 4,500 to 279,500 last week.\nA government report last week showed employers adding 223,000 jobs last month and the U.S. unemployment rate sliding to 5.3 percent.\nContinued claims - the number of people still claiming jobless benefits after an initial week of aid - rose 69,000 to 2.334 million in the week ended June 27, the Labor Department said.\nPhoto Caption: (Reuters)\nTweet", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share", "http://twitter.com/home?status=Look%20what%20I%20found%20on%20BaltimoreJewishLife.com!%20"], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T22:39:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
