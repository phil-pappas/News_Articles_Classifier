Steve Colquhoun When I was climbing the corporate ladder at a law firm, there were a few things I disliked about the annual review. The less pleasant aspects of performance review included: rating my innovation when I spent the majority of time photocopying, being told by my boss going home at 6pm doesn't fit with the firm's culture, and making small talk with the oddly chirpy HR lady.\nFT columnist Lucy Kellaway advocates avoiding these unpleasantaries by replacing annual appraisals with nothing at all .\nBut without an annual report card, the only rating I would have had would be the big data collected by the company: budget and revenue, number of hours worked and number of clients. Or I could have kept file notes every time a manager \"checked in\" on me.\nJob search company SEEK has replaced its simple performance ratings system – \"exceeds\", \"meets\" and \"needs improvement\" – with a subjective assessment . SEEK also says it has a \"360 degree feedback\" where you get scrutinised by your colleagues, customers, suppliers and even random external stakeholders feedback all year round, as if getting feedback from your manager two days a year isn't painful enough.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

It is in the business of selling a software where employees get \"brownie points\" from their colleagues, managers and customers for their performance all the time. Meanwhile at LinkedIn, which will keep a mix of formal and informal reviews for the time being, employees can give each other feedback and points using a system called Bravo! purely for the sake of warm fuzzy feeling.\nPerformance rating is also a great safety net should the tumultuous tides of office politics inevitably turn and it's time for you to go.\nThese days, short of groping all your colleagues no white collar gets fired on the spot. Instead, professionals get performance managed out with weekly meetings and KPI talks until they get the hint and walk away.\nThis is when your performance rating from six months ago comes particularly useful. It's something you can whip out to prove your performance is fine, contrary to what is now popular belief around the office.\nIt's not like replacing an annual review with weekly conversations will turn a certain class of lazy and awkward middle managers into A-grade mentors. As the former HR executive for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Rhonda Brighton-Hall pointed out to me this week, if you have a bad manager who can't give proper feedback once a year, things won't get any better just because the conversation turns weekly.\nFunnily enough, even if performance review blows up for 43,000 NAB bankers, there will be 10 people at NAB who will go through the annual ritual: chief executive Andrew Thorburn and his executive team who will have their annual performance scrutinised by shareholders voting on the remuneration report. And they are the ones walking away with six figure bonuses.\nIf staff hate the annual appraisal, companies should bring the process down to earth so it's not stuck in human resources land where performance is measured in \"leadership\", \"engagement\" and \"innovation\" when your job is photocopying and making powerpoint presentations. Better yet, tie incentive payments directly to performance review ratings and managers will have employees lining up outside their doors. It's not the chance to get rid of one of few occasions where staff can get a report card and have a crack at getting a salary bump, and replace it with a year-long pleasantaries and a condescending software.\nMisa Han was an employment lawyer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T10:09:32.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
