Bloomberg Share on twitter by Philip Baker After giving the worry beads a fair workout in the lead-up to a default by Greece, the local sharemarket reacted to news that it finally had by heading higher . It was perhaps not quite the mother of all relief rallies but for the first time in three years the major S&P ASX 200 index has made a positive start on the first day of a new financial year.\nNo doubt it was the last-minute appeal requesting that the country's bailout agreement be extended , just hours before it expired, that has given investors the idea that in the wash-up of all of this drama, Greece will stay in the eurozone.\nThe referendum now gives the power to ordinary people. This all makes for great TV, with customers waiting outside the banks to get their cash, and what can be more enthralling than a country on the brink?\nBut financial markets hate it.\nThe other piece of news that would have emboldened investors on Wednesday was from China, where for the fourth consecutive month the Purchasing Managers' Index came in above 50 , which means the big state-owned companies aren't doing that badly.\nNews that both new domestic and export orders fell in June was largely shrugged aside and the fall in the iron ore to a five-week low wasn't enough to save the likes of BHP Billiton.\nThe local market was helped by a positive session on Wall Street but the S&P 500 has just posted its first negative quarter, down 0.23 per cent since a 1 per cent fall in the last three months of 2012.\nThe poor quarter for stocks has garnered a fair amount of attention and the bears would be thinking it could be the start of a sell-off.\n June, for example, was a bad month, down 2 per cent and the worst June since a 5.4 per cent fall in 2010.\nAlthough this isn't as bad some other major global sharemarkets. The FTSE 100 index shed 6.6 per cent in June, the largest drop since a 7.3 per cent sell-off in May 2012, ironically enough when the Greek debt crisis was also worrying global investors about a likely default.\nGolden run on Wall Street It's been a great run on Wall Street, which is making the bears nervous because there hasn't been a correction, as defined by a 10 per cent fall from the recent peak, since October 2011, a golden run of 44 months.\nThe upcoming earnings season is the next hurdle for US investors but the lack of early guidance on any downgrades suggests it could be a better than expected earnings season.\nThe outlook for the second half of the year, when they do report, will be critical and it will be interesting to see what is said about the prospect of higher rates from Federal Reserve and the US dollar.\nAccording to FactSet, for the second quarter of 2015 year-over-year earnings for the S&P 500 are tipped to fall by 4.5 per cent. The last time the index reported a year-over-year decrease in earnings was for the third quarter of 2012 when it dropped 1 per cent.\nThe earnings season comes as valuations are stretched. They are not as expensive as they have been but, as in Australia, no longer cheap.\nIn the US the current 12-month forward price earnings ratio is 16.7 times, which is well above the 5-year average of 13.8 times earnings and the 10-year average of 14.1 times.\nIn Australia the forward P/E is around 15.2 times earnings compared to its longer term average of 14.5 times.\nSo valuations in much of the world aren't really low enough to excite investors with cash to spend.\nAnd the other issue is that market sentiment is perhaps not as negative at the moment as it can be.\nPeriods of real negative sentiment are the very good entry points into risky assets.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-greece-defaults-on-imf-loan-20150701-gi22dh"], "published": "2015-07-01T12:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T10:05:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
