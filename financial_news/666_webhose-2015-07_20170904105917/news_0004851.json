Bowling, president of the National Corn Growers Association, says he would like to buy one for his Maryland farm to help him scout out which individual fields need extra spraying. \nFarmers are eager for the technology. \nThe small, relatively inexpensive vehicles could replace humans in a variety of ways around large farms: transmitting detailed information about crops to combines and sprayers, directing them very precisely to problem spots and cutting down on the amount of water and chemicals that a farmer needs to use in those areas. \nThe Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a trade group, says agriculture could account for 80 per cent of all commercial drone use. \nAgricultural use of drones is about to take off after being grounded for years by the lack of federal guidelines. The Federal Aviation Administration has approved more than 50 exemptions for farm-related operations since January. \nCompanies with those exemptions say business has grown, helped by quick advances in the technology. \nBret Chilcott of Kansas-based AgEagle, which sells unmanned aerial vehicles and the software to help operate them, says his company took its first orders in 2014. Now, it has a backlog of several hundred orders. He says the technology has transformed the market during that short period. \n\"Last year, users had to land their aircraft and then take the data to the computer,\" he says. \"Now, the data appears on your iPad or hand-held device a few minutes after flight.\" \nThat data could be pictures, 3-D images of plants, thermal readings of crops or animals or other observations that a drone could make while in the air. Information that in the past took days to collect - or could not have been collected at all - can be gathered now in minutes or hours and, in some cases, integrated with separate data collected from other high-tech farm machinery. \nChilcott is optimistic that the technology to scout out problem spots so precisely will be transformative because farmers can limit spraying just to those places. \n\"In five years, we won't have to blanket a field with chemicals,\" he says. \nStill, most farmers cannot legally fly the vehicles yet. \nThe FAA is working on rules that would allow the drones to be used regularly for business while maintaining certain safety and privacy standards. An FAA proposal this year would allow flight of the vehicles as long as they weigh less than 55 pounds (24.95 kg), remain within the operator's sight and fly during the daytime, among other restrictions. Operators would have to pass an FAA test of aeronautical knowledge and a Transportation Security Administration background check. \nSome people have concerns about the guidelines. Pilots of crop dusters and other planes that operate around farms are concerned the rules do not go far enough to ensure safety. \n\"We can't see them,\" says Andrew Moore of the National Agricultural Aviation Association. His group advocated for the unmanned vehicles to include tracking systems or lights to help airplanes figure out where they are, but that was not included in the proposal. \nThe rules could pose some challenges for the eager farmers, too. \nGeske may not be able to use drones efficiently to monitor all the irrigation pipes on his 2,100 acre Missouri farm if he has to keep them within sight. He's still interested, though. The men he hires now use a lot of fuel and their trucks tear up his land and roads. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Whitehaven tips further coal price falls AAP \nWhitehaven Coal's sales are on the rise but it expects prices to continue to fall.
