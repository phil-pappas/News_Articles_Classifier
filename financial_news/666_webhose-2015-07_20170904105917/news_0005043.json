Concerns Greece could be forced out of eurozone have dented global markets in recent weeks as talks on a possible bailout stalled and the country said `no' to more austerity at a referendum. IG Markets chief market strategist Chris Weston said \"grey clouds\" had lifted from the local market on news of the deal. \"We've seen a resurgence of inflows back into the US dollar based on the fact that the possibility of the Grexit has, obviously, diminished ... That's helping those stocks exposed to a weaker Australian dollar,\" Mr Weston said. He said the Greek deal was also generally boosting confidence among local traders after weeks of uncertainty. \"Greece had given people a reason not to buy ... It has been rescued somewhat overnight,\" he said. News of the deal, which still needs to be passed by a potentially hostile Greek parliament, sent European and US markets higher overnight, with Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average lifting 1.2 per cent and London's FTSE gaining almost one per cent. The deal also helped lift the US dollar, which pushed the Aussie dollar back towards 74 US cents, around half a cent lower compared to Monday afternoon. Mr Weston said it was unclear how sustained the local rally would be. \"The question now is whether or not we can create a new high and we need to get through 5609 (points), which is the July 2 high,\" he said. \"If we can close above that level, then I think the bulls will be looking at this market a bit more favourably.\" At 1125 AEST, the S&P/ASX 200 was up 95.9 points, or 1.75 per cent, at 5569.1.
