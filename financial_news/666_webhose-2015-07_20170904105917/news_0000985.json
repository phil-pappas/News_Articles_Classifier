A carry trade is a particular strategy where currency traders borrow funds in a currency where interest rates are low and invest into government or private paper denominated in a currency where higher interest rates are being paid. \nThroughout the years the main funding currency for carry trades has been the Japanese yen, which was later joined by the U.S. dollar as the Federal Reserve introduced its quantitative easing program. Once the European Central Bank has officially joined the club of the rapidly working printing presses, the euro became the new market favorite for cheap funding of carry traders since the start of 2015. \nthe single european currency unit has come under pressure right after the initial spike \nThe single european currency unit has come under pressure right after the initial spike caused by the Eurogroup’s announcement on Monday morning. \nWith most of the opposition parties supporting Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to broker a third bailout deal with the country’s top creditors another set of parliamentary votes is looming. After the agreement has been tentatively reached, the Greek side has yet to pass legislation which will warrant the implementation of the long delayed reforms which Greece has to commit to in order to continue receiving funding from its European partners. \nBrokers who have ramped up margin requirements have been reverting those in the aftermath of the announcement this morning. That said, the overwhelming mood amongst market participants has been that the Greek solution is another “kick the can down the road” scenario. \ntoday’s deal does kick the underlying issues further into the future \nCommenting on the matter, the Chief Economist at FxPro Simon Smith said, “Greece has been ‘saved’ by a deal, which requires reform measures to be passed mid-week by the Greek parliament (Finland and Germany must also pass in their parliaments).” \n“A deal that is reached after months of negotiations with literally hours to spare before a Grexit cannot be a good deal. On the face of it, Greece is the one that has blinked, because the deal does not give any guarantees with regards to the restructuring of Greek debt,” he elaborated. \nThere’s been a lot of market tension around the negotiations with FX volatility subsiding somewhat in a typical summer fashion. According to Mr Smith, this is unlikely to persist for long, as he commented, “today’s deal does kick the underlying issues further into the future and at some point, they will have to be addressed.” Got a news tip?
