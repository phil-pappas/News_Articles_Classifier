What and when you collect will make a huge difference to your lifetime benefits.\nToday’s Social Security question is about the effect of working past 66 on benefit amounts.\nQuestion : I turn 66 in seven and half months. If I continue to work, and my future income is higher than my past earnings, can my future salaried income post-age 66 increase my Social Security benefit? I plan to collect a spousal benefit at 66 and wait until 70 to collect mine.\nAnswer : The answer is yes, your retirement benefit can increase beyond Social Security’s adjustment of your benefit for inflation. This reflects Social Security’s annual Recomputation of Benefits , which takes into account additional covered earnings in the prior year. If your retirement benefit is recomputed to be a higher amount, so too will be your spousal, child, divorced spousal, widow (when you pass), and divorced widow (when you pass) benefits to which your current and former relatives may be eligible.\nNow for the big but. This will happen if and only if one or more of your future years of covered annual earnings exceeds lower annual covered earnings used by Social Security in its calculation of your Primary Insurance Amount (PIA).\nThe PIA calculation is based on the average of your highest 35 years of past covered earnings, where earnings prior to age 60 are indexed (blown up) to reflect economy-wide wage growth between the year you earned the income and the year you reached age 60. Your actual covered earnings after age 60, with no adjustment, are also considered in the determination of the 35 years of highest covered earnings.\nThis practice implies that anyone over age 60 who earns more in a given year than the covered earnings ceiling for that year will automatically experience a PIA increase in excess of the standard inflation adjustment.\nHow come?\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/piaformula.html", "http://www.ssa.gov/retire2/whileworking3.htm"], "published": "2015-07-06T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T20:45:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
