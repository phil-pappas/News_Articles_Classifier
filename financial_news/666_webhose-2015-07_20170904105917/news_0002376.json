Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! MUMBAI: New York-based CommonBond, a lending company focusing on student loan refinancing and student loan consolidation, has entered into a partnership with Prodigy Finance, a global leader in international post-graduate student lending, to connect international post-graduate MBA students in the US with loan options to fund their post-graduate degrees. The partnership will allow international post-graduate students who come to CommonBond seeking student loan options to secure funding for their business school education through Prodigy, which determines the terms and conditions of the student loans. Indians will be among the biggest beneficiary of the partnership as they form the largest student base of international students in US schools, David Klein, CEO and co-founder, CommonBond, told ET in a telephonic interview. CommonBond is a leading marketplace lending platform that lowers the cost of student loans for borrowers and provides financial returns to investors. \"The market for international students financing their degrees in the US business schools is awfully underserved largely due to the lack of funding options from traditional financial institutions,\" he said. \"Our partnership with Prodigy Finance will make US business schools more accessible and affordable for international students,\" he said. The partnership is aimed at meeting a significant need in the post-graduate student lending market in the US. In 2012, about 13% of the 472,000 students enrolled in the US business schools came from other countries, according to the US Department of Education. For international students studying in the US funding options are limited, as non-American citizens do not qualify for federal loans and are often required to have a credit worthy US resident cosign any private loan with a US bank. \"We understand first hand just how difficult it is to finance an international MBA, which is why we launched Prodigy Finance eight years ago as a way of offering borderless loans to international MBA students while enabling investors to earn a competitive financial and social return by investing in these students,\" Cameron Stevens, CEO and co-founder of Prodigy Finance, said in a release. \"We are excited about our partnership with CommonBond as it furthers our vision to create global funding options for international post-graduate students,\" he said.
