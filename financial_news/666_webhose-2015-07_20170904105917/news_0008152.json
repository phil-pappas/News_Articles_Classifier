We still experience a reluctance on the part of small business owners to consider acquiring equipment that will help grow their business as opposed to replacement equipment. Mid-size and larger companies continue to remain fairly bullish on investment opportunities. Abundant capital and low delinquency statistics continue to keep rates and margins under pressure.” Valerie Hayes Jester, President, Brandywine Capital Associates, Inc. Bank, Small Ticket “I believe that there continues to be pent-up demand for capital equipment investment while there is also expectation of higher rates in the future. This can be a powerful combination for growth in our industry.” Paul Menzel, President & CEO, Financial Pacific Leasing, LLC Bank, Middle Ticket “Capital expenditures for equipment continue to ramp upward in almost all sectors. Favorable market conditions, low interest rates and ample capital availability are the driving factors.” Harry Kaplun, President, Frost Equipment Leasing and Finance", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T22:48:04.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
