Jeffrey Meli and Jon Scoffin will take over his role.\nKantor, the 62-year-old former Federal Reserve economist who has spent more than 12 years at Barclays in New York, has accepted a position with the Harvard Advanced Leadership Initiative , according to a memo sent today from Tom King, Barclays’s chief executive officer of the investment bank.\nMeli and Scoffin will become co-heads of research. Meli was most recently the co-head of FICC research at Barclays, while Scoffin was the head of equity research.\n“I feel proud of what we have accomplished here,” Kantor said in a phone interview. “I am comfortable moving on knowing that the research team is in great shape and in capable hands under the leadership of Jon and Jeff.”\nIn his latest role, Kantor was responsible for overseeing Barclays’s global research across commodities, credit, economics, emerging markets, equities, foreign exchange and interest rates. He was a member of Barclays’s executive committee for the investment bank.\nKantor was previously head of economics and market strategy at Barclays. Before joining the firm, he was a managing director and global head of foreign exchange strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Prior to that, Kantor was chief market strategist and economist at Normandy Asset Management Inc., chief European economist at JPMorgan, an economist with the Fed and an assistant professor of economics at Lehigh University.\nAjay Rajadhyaksha has also been named the head of macro research, a newly created position at Barclays in which he’ll oversee the creation of the firm’s global outlook publication. Rajadhyaksha was previously the co-head of FICC research at Barclays.\nAt the Harvard program, Kantor will spend a year pursuing a social-justice project, possibly with a focus in income inequality and equal access to education and healthcare, he said.\n“I’ve always had the feeling that if you’ve been fortunate enough to achieve success in your career that you should give something back,” he said.", "external_links": ["http://advancedleadership.harvard.edu/\\"], "published": "2015-07-25T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T20:14:03.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
