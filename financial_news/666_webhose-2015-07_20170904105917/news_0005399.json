The 2015 Annual Social Security Trustee Report is no different as it highlights the tremendous funding challenges that have been threatening the program since 2010, in which the total expenditures of the Social Security Disability Income program and the Social Security Old Age and Survivors Insurance program have exceeded the non-interest earnings income to the system. Because income from taxes is not sufficient to meet promised benefits, the eventual outcome is that both programs will run out of money and not be able to meet all of its promised benefits.\nDespite the challenges facing Social Security, it will not burn out or fade away. Its existence is fundamental to the social compact in the United States that we will take care of our sick, our poor, and our elderly. With nearly one third of retirees getting almost all of their income from Social Security, a complete dissolution of the system would create an unbearable situation of personal suffering and new societal costs that may create a far worse scenario than increasing taxes and modifying benefits.\nWASHINGTON, DC – JULY 13: Activists participate in a rally urging the expansion of Social Security benefits in front of the White House July 13, 2015 in Washington, DC. Social Security Works, the AFL-CIO and additional organizations held the event to deliver ‘more than 2 million petition signatures’ in support of expanding Social Security benefits.

Instead, income from taxes would be able to meet 81% of disability income benefits and 77% of the retirement benefits once the funds are depleted. The Disability Income Trust Fund is expected to be fully depleted in late 2016, the same projection as last year’s report. According to the current report, the Social Security Old Age and Survivors Insurance Fund is expected to maintain its solvency until 2034, one year longer than last year’s report. However, the combined income, including interest earnings, will continue to exceed expenditures through 2019.\nSince most people generally agree that we cannot just pull this income out from under current retirees or for any generation nearing retirement, a solution is needed to ensure that those who rely on the system for their income are secure. There are really two basic solutions to the funding issues facing Social Security: 1) increase taxes and 2) decrease benefits. There have been a variety of proposals before congress pushing these concepts but we have not seen any real movement towards a workable and politically palatable solution yet. To effectively move forward Social Security will need to increase taxes and reduce benefits. But furthermore, other changes to Social Security need to be considered such as increased means testing and the removal of aggressive claiming strategies. In fact, the system could benefit from some simplification.\nMoving forward it will be important to keep an eye out for changes to the system. Social Security will continue for the foreseeable future to be a crucial part of the retirement system in the United States. If there is ever a decision to move people away from reliance on the system, we will have to drastically increase personal savings at younger ages for retirement. Realistically, we do not see any generation of current workers that would be able to meet their retirement income needs on personal savings alone.\nFar too many people misunderstand Social Security’s funding issues and assume that the future funding shortfall means the end of Social Security. This misconception can cause people nearing retirement to make a huge mistake by claiming Social Security benefits early under the belief that Social Security will run out of money if they wait to collect benefits. By no means should the funding shortfall be ignored, but it is still critical to make careful claiming decisions and consider the benefits of deferring benefits until full retirement age or until age 70. This means you need to understand your Social Security benefits as they exist today and keep up-to-date on changes to the system. Despite its flaws and funding issues, Social Security is here to stay. As a society that promises to take care of its elderly, we are simply not equipped or willing to place our retirees into the financial turmoil that would result from Social Security’s demise.\nGet The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/480594688/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/"], "published": "2015-07-26T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T12:21:44.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
