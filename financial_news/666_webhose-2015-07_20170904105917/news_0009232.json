The index has gained about 9 percent since last Tuesday's close. \nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.6 percent to 1,567.81 points, while Germany's DAX, France's CAC and Britain's FTSE 100 rose by between 0.7 percent and 1.9 percent. \nThe euro zone's banking index advanced 2.3 percent, helped by gains for Societe Generale (Paris: FR0000130809 - news ) , Credit Agricole and UniCredit (Milan: UCG.MI - news ) , the shares of which were up by between 2.2 percent and 3.1 percent \nThe region's volatility index, a crude indicator of investor concern, dropped nearly 4 points to hit a two-week low. \nRonny Claeys, senior strategist at KBC Asset Management, said that in the long run investors will try to find answers to questions such as whether the deal Athens has agreed with its European peers fundamentally resolves the issue of Greece's debt burden. \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in mid-cap Alent spiked 44 percent after U.S. chemicals maker Platform Specialty Products Corp said it would buy the British company for about 1.35 billion pounds ($2.09 billion) in cash to expand its portfolio and reduce costs. \nAmong fallers, International Personal Finance (LSE: IPF.L - news ) dropped 19.9 percent, the biggest drop on the STOXX Europe , after a proposed law change in Poland that could hit the company's results.
