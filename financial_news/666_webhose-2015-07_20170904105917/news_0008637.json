Hilal, at the time serving a jail sentence for stirring-up ethnic conflicts and several murders, was released, and tasked by the Sudanese government with the mobilisation of militiamen, mostly among impoverished Sudanese Arab herders. \nHis militiamen targeted unarmed civilians in the region, attacking Darfur villages, but they rarely came near forces of the armed rebel movements. \nEarly 2008, President Omar Al Bashir offered him the post of presidential assistant for federal affairs. After five years, however, Hilal returned to North Darfur, where his fighters launched widespread attacks on government forces and allied militias. \nRAC \nHilal established the RAC, together with North Darfuri tribal leaders, in the beginning of 2014. In December last year, the RAC announced the formation of a new management board for the Jebel 'Amer gold mining area. The RAC spokesman told Radio Dabanga that the management board, and not the Sudanese regular forces, would be responsible for the protection of the gold mine. \nThe spokesman also said that Musa Hilal called on all Darfuris to \"stand up against the National Congress Party and its corrupt regime\". \nThe alienation of Hilal from the Sudanese government seems to have been reversed last month. On 7 June, Radio Dabanga reported that he attended the swearing-in ceremony of the re-elected President Al Bashir in Khartoum. After his return, he stressed to his followers that he would not lead any uprising against the ruling party, but would cooperate with the government to \"realise reconciliation on all levels of Darfur society\".
