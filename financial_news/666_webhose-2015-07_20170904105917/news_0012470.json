PUBLISHED: 10:37, Thu, Jul 2, 2015 | UPDATED: 13:21, Thu, Jul 2, 2015 GETTY A crowdfunding campaign to bailout Greece has reached £1million \nLondon shop worker Thom Feeney asked everyone in the Europe to \"chip in a few\" euros on a crowdfunding platform in the hope of getting Greece \"back on track soon.\"And the appeal has now reached a total of €1,336,128 (£948,072) in just five days with the sum rising by the second. \nAlmost 80,000 people have pledged their support. The 29-year-old now has five days left to raise the total to his €1.6billion target. He said: \"It might seem like a lot but it's only just over €3 from each European. That's about the same as half a pint in London.\" Twitter/ThomFeeney Thom Feeney started the campaign \nOriginally from York, Mr Feeney said that he set up the fundraiser because he was \"fed-up\" with politicians at the heart of the Greek debt crisis failing to find a solution, while ordinary people in the country suffer. He added: \"While politicians are dithering, this is affecting real people.\"This isn't just about Greece, but about the Greek people, the working classes and trying to help other ordinary people across the world. \"If governments, corporations or banks won't help, what can we do but band together.\"Greece is now officially classed as in arrears to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after it failed to make a €1.5billion (£1billion) debt repayment on Tuesday. It's the first time a developed nation has failed to repay the fund and means Greece has joins the ranks of Zimbabwe, Somalia and Sudan in arrears.The deal would entail years of further austerity for the debt-crippled country but without it, Greece is set to go bankrupt and be forced to exit the euro, which would spell economic disaster .
