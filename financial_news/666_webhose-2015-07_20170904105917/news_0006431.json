It isn’t that there aren’t as many people driving home on the Sunday of Fourth of July weekend as you think. It isn’t even that New York City has more money lying around for parades than you’d imagine. It’s that a sport can capture the public’s imagination without falling back on worn-out blueprints, tired tropes and cynical grabs for attention.\nWhen all the confetti is swept off the Canyon of Heroes, the last parents sign their kids up for soccer and the U.S. women start thinking about the 2016 Olympics, there are still a few key lessons to take away from what they’ve just accomplished. Here are five:\n5. Soccer is up for grabs in the U.S.\nConsider those 26.7 million viewers that the U.S. women drew for their World Cup final and remember that it’s a bigger than any audience that has watched a men’s game here.\nIt’s more than the U.S. men drew for their Round of 16 match-up with Belgium in last year’s World Cup. It’s bigger than the crowd that watched Argentina and Germany in last year’s World Cup final. It’s bigger than any audience that Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Franck Ribery, Manuel Neuer or any of the world’s greatest male players have enjoyed here.\nOh, and it’s certainly better than the roughly 250,000 viewers that Major League Soccer matches drew last year. It’s also better than the 2.2 million viewers who watched Barcelona defeat Bayern Munich in the UEFA Champions League final on Fox this year, and it bested the 1.8 million who watched the English Premier League’s Championship Sunday on NBC’s family of networks.\nAccording to Nielsen, soccer of any kind has the youngest average viewership of any U.S. sport, and it’s still forming an opinion of what to watch. While this may not mean that North American Soccer League games will get huge coverage any time soon (even with an expansion franchise in Puerto Rico and the New York Cosmos making a trip to Cuba), it does mean that the National Women’s Soccer League may have more leverage than it realizes in negotiating national media coverage beyond one-year, partial-season deals with ESPN and Fox.\n4. Continuity is key\nBack in 2011, just 3.9 million Americans tuned in to see the U.S. team’s comeback win against Brazil in the Women’s World Cup semifinal. However, enough people saw Megan Rapinoe’s cross to Abby Wambach for the game-tying header online afterward that the number swelled to 13.9 million for that year’s final.\nWhen the U.S. team returned for this year’s World Cup, the roster was stacked with familiar faces including Wambach, Rapinoe, Lloyd, Alex Morgan, Ali Krieger, Tobin Heath, Becky Sauerbrunn and Hope Solo. By this year’s semifinal, viewership more than doubled to 8.4 million. That core keeps the U.S. competitive, but it also keeps fans involved though familiar faces and prevents the kind of backlash the U.S. national team saw when longtime striker Landon Donovan missed the final cut before last year’s World Cup.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T20:12:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
