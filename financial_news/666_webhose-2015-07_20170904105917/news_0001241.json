Profit fell by a third last year to Â£1.4 billion, accounting for a quarter of overall profits and putting it on a par with the credit card business.\nWhat is more, the investment bank's return on equity was just 2.7 per cent. While returns were hit by deferred pay, conduct and legal costs, as well as restructuring charges, it was far short of the bank's 12 per cent target.\nMcFarlane has said he wants to speed up improvements in profitability. Investors and analysts say this means \"non-core\" activities must be sold off faster, and fewer assets should be allocated to trading.\nInvestment banking still dominates attention and management time at the bank, a legacy of the Barclays Capital business built up by Jenkins' predecessor Bob Diamond.\nA new plan set out three weeks ago and agreed by Jenkins, investment bank boss Tom King and finance director Tushar Morzaria, agreed to cut more assets from the business.\nBut King disagreed with Jenkins about the scale of cuts and threatened to retire early, a source said. McFarlane persuaded King to stay, but the row undermined Jenkins and contributed to his departure.\n\"[The investment bank] is where the battle will be won and lost for our stock and our company and we had a CEO who didn't know anything about it,\" one senior US investment banker said.\nOver the past two years more than a third of investment banking jobs, or more than 8,000 staff, have been axed.\nSources said tensions remain between London and the United States, the investment bank's two \"home\" markets, following the cuts. The US division, largely the former Lehman Brothers business bought by Barclays in 2008, is far more profitable than investment banking in Asia and Europe.\nWhat will go next should become clearer soon. McFarlane has said he will give more details about the plan that undermined Jenkins when half-year results are released on July 29.\nBarclays is not alone in trying to decide the best size and shape of its investment bank in a changed regulatory landscape. New bosses at Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are also assessing how to refocus to improve returns.\nIt has to separate its domestic retail banking business in the next three years under new rules designed to give more protection to savers, and taxpayers.\nBut it is having a tough time determining its structure, which will in turn affect plans for the investment bank, sources have said.\nRanked the world's eighth biggest investment bank last year, down from sixth in the previous two years, according to analytics firm Coalition, Barclays' strongest areas are rates and foreign exchange trading, municipal finance, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) advisory and debt capital markets.\nThe bank is expected to cut back in fixed income, currencies and commodities, potentially allowing it to allocate more capital to advisory activities in the United States and Britain - to help companies on M&A and equity and debt capital markets.\nTwo more radical options would be selling the investment bank altogether, or conversely, bulking it up by raising capital, analysts said.\nThis article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as Troubled Barclays eyes more asset cuts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T17:59:31.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
