Peter Braig Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell The comparatively low number of earnings downgrades over the past weeks is lifting expectations for the upcoming full-year reporting season, with some equities strategists going as far to say they expect the ASX to reach a high not seen since the global financial crisis.\nAs fears of global market contagion from a possible Greek collapse and imploding Chinese equity markets abate, equity strategists are anticipating a positive earnings season.\nPre-earnings season's profit downgrades have been relatively benign, with 16 companies downgrading their profit expectations over the past month, including Woolworths, Metcash, Affinity Education Group, Flight Centre Travel Group, Seek and Arrium.\nAMP's head of dynamic asset allocation Nader Naeimi​ said now global concerns had mostly calmed, he expected even a modest reporting season to propel the ASX up to 6000 points, a level not seen since January 2008.\n\"There haven't been any major surprises in profit downgrades so far. If earnings growth remains constructive, although it is not strong, than the ASX should rise and continue up to 6000 points, where it is likely to struggle to get much higher,\" Mr Naeimi said.\n\"We expect it will climb until the Fed rate rise, which won't derail the equity markets, but it will probably be choppier.\"\nThe US Federal Reserve is expected to lift interest rates for the first time since 2006, with financial markets starting to favour September as the month for lift-off.\nCredit Suisse is also expecting the S&P/ASX200 will reach 6000 points by mid-December, cutting their earlier forecast down from 6500.\n Australian equity strategist Hasan Tevfik explained they remained optimistic because the cost of debt will remain low and that free cash-flow growth will remain solid.\n\"Our analysts currently expect double digit free cash-flow growth for the next 12 months. We think high single digit is achievable. The combination of these two import drivers should be enough to make Aussie equities a relatively attractive asset. Especially when compared to debt,\" Mr Tevfik said.\nIndependent broker firm CSLA's lead Australian equity strategist John Woods described this year's confession season as \"the most benign since the GFC\" with the lowest number of significant downgrades but warned net positive revisions were unlikely.\n\"Investors are unlikely to be looking forward to yet another Australian reporting season of zero growth,\" Mr Woods said, adding maintaining dividend growth would be harder without earnings.\nMr Woods said he expected companies such as Primary Health Care, Nine, Santos and Qantas could struggle to lift their payout ratio because relying debt to facilitate increased dividends will be challenging.\nMr Woods said it was too early to declare earnings season a net positive, but said one of the best indicators was the revision cycle in the previous quarter.\n\"Confessions season this year saw significantly fewer downgrades than recent years,\" Mr Woods said.\n\"Indeed, with only weeks to go till the final numbers are in, earnings estimates at an aggregate level are most likely within 3% of their eventual outcome. Unfortunately, we expect even at this late stage, while small, the risk to this financial year earnings is to the downside.\nOn the back of this month's batch of profit revisions, equity analyst Marcus Padley last week released the below table of stocks to watch heading into results season. Since then, there have been several additional profit downgrades including Sonic Healthcare.\nReporting season starts next month. Here is a list of companies at risk of a disappointing earnings season. #asx pic.twitter.com/Xc3aBnS6tT\n— Marcus Padley (@Marcus_Today) July 14, 2015", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/asx?src=hash", "https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711", "https://twitter.com/Marcus_Today/status/620814344746459136", "https://twitter.com/rosepowell", "http://t.co/Xc3aBnS6tT"], "published": "2015-07-21T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:08:38.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
