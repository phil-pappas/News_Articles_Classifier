Photo: James Davies\nThe banking regulator's focus on the major banks in its response to the Murray inquiry's call for unquestionably strong capital appears to have let regional banks off the hook, but most experts say it is still too early to tell.\nWhen the final report of David Murray's financial services inquiry was released in December, the share prices of the regional lenders took a dive because of the surprise recommendation that all banks would need to have equity capital levels in the top 25 per cent of banks globally.\nThe regional banks have maintained Murray was primarily focused on the majors, particularly because a major rationale for the proposal was Australian banks' high exposure to offshore funding markets. The smaller lenders have a higher reliance on local deposit funding.\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's information paper on international capital comparisons appears to confirm this view, pointing out Murray said unquestionably strong capital is most important for systemically important banks, which APRA identifies as the big four and it left them out of its analysis.\nAdvertisement \"APRA has previously identified the four major banks as systemically important, and these banks are the largest Australian debt issuers in foreign capital markets,\" it said. However, the regulator also said an \"unquestionably strong capital standard should apply to all ADIs\".\nA spokesman for Bank of Queensland said there are still \"a number of moving parts that could influence the outcome for regional banks\".\n\"We remain confident however that the arguments we have put forward around creating a more even playing field have been well received by most stakeholders.\"\nMutual lenders to benefit Bank analysts' views were mixed on what the study means for the regionals because there is little to go on, but most believe the capital changes coming from APRA and the international bank supervisor will be a relative benefit for the smaller banks – and much more so for the mutual lenders because they already have the highest capital buffers.\n\"It looks like the regionals are in the back of APRA's mind – they just don't seem to be in a position where they are being focused on,\" said one.\nAnother agreed the regulatory focus looks like it will be on the majors, but pointed out investors may force the regionals to match the majors.\n\"It is the smaller banks that usually go bust in a crisis, so you can't have a major bank with all its diversification benefits having a capital ratio 200 basis points higher than a regional bank,\" he said.\nHowever, Bell Potter analyst TS Lim pointed to analysis Bell Potter had done that estimates that even if the regionals raise their common equity levels to 10 per cent, where it is thought the majors will need to be, the amounts they need to raise will be proportionally smaller.\nFor Bendigo & Adelaide Bank it would be about $200 million, Bank of Queensland would have a $100 million surplus and Suncorp-Metway Bank would need about an extra $40 million. By comparison, all of the majors except NAB would need to raise about $8 billion extra.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T17:30:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
