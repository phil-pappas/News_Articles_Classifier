This estimate does not include the cost shipping companies incur to run their vessels. \nFifteen ships had berthed at the port waiting to be loaded or to unload their cargo while seven others were waiting to berth. With the daily cost of running one vessel ranging at between Sh5 million and Sh10 million, depending on its size, the losses from the strike are massive. The Mombasa port also serves landlocked countries in the region. \n\"It's rather unfortunate that the strike started with our workers and yet even members of the mother union had not started the boycott. As you can see, we decided to deploy our management staff to do the work and we hope to resume fully by tomorrow,\" Mr Ndua said yesterday. \nPort users were on Tuesday and yesterday told to stay away, with clerks and truck drivers saying they had spent the two days trying to have their trucks loaded to no avail. \nMr Hamisi Lalo, a driver, said he loaded his truck with rails he was to transport to the China Road and Bridge Construction camp site but was stopped at the gate. \n\"This is unfair because my boss is waiting for me and I am stuck here because of the strike. We have incurred huge losses because I was supposed to come back for another load,\" he told journalists at the container terminal. \nAlthough workers at the management level had been deployed at the terminal, there was little sign of activity in most of the berths and Mr Ndua said if the workers continue to stay away, the port's management would hire replacement workers. \n\"We are telling our employees that KPA has not had an engagement with them in which we have differed and, therefore, there is no justification for them to withhold labour,\" Mr Ndua said. \nHowever, Dock Workers Union Secretary-General Simon Sang said workers were not consulted when the new NHIF rates were introduced. The first deductions were reflected in the June salaries. \n\"Our strike is legal because it kicked off after the expiry of the seven-day notice. What we are stressing is that the rates cannot be based on the gross salary and they must stop the deductions with immediate effect,\" he said. \nAt the Likoni channel, where about 160 workers are also on strike, the Kenya Ferry Service Company's unionised members kept off their work stations. \nLed by their shop stewards, members sat in different groups on the island and on the mainland Likoni channel crossing points discussing the strike. \n\"We will not go back until the government meets our demand of stopping the deductions and refunding our already deducted money,\" said one shop steward, who requested for anonymity. \nManagement staff took up the marshalling of commuters and traffic on both sides of the crossing for the second day. \nMeanwhile, learning activities in Mombasa Country could be paralysed from today after the Kilindini branch of the Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) announced that its members would start boycotting class to push for the reduction of the health insurance rates. \nBranch Executive Secretary Dan Oloo said teachers would stay away from work until the new NHIF rates are reduced. \n\"One cannot wake up one day and decide to deduct your salary without consulting you. No going to class until our demand is met,\" he said. He also demanded that the deductions be based on basic, not gross, pay. \nMr Oloo said Knut had resolved to join other unions in the strike to oppose the rates. \n\"How can you use the same style to deduct from those earning less than Sh35,000 and those earning over Sh100,000 a month?\" he asked. \nOn Tuesday Trade Union Congress Chairman Tom Odege, Secretary-General Wilson Sossion and Deputy Secretary Charles Mukhwaya said the deductions must be suspended and the money already deducted refunded before unions could return to the negotiating table. \nReported by Gitonga Marete, Mwakera Mwajefa and Brian Ocharo.
