Reuters Of course, AMP's extraordinary out-of-cycle margin expansion was prompted by ANZ, CBA and NAB's decision days earlier to unilaterally increase rates on existing investment loans. In the case of ANZ and CBA, costs climbed by 0.27 percentage points. NAB went further, slugging interest-only and line-of-credit loans with a 0.29 percentage point increase. No longer taking less and giving more, NAB's decision is more punitive in both cost and coverage. Over the 12 months to May, interest-only loans represented a higher 43 per cent share of all approvals than investment property loans, which accounted for 37 per cent.\nObserve here how the big four are materially improving margins on both their back books and incoming flows. Significantly, only the latter is relevant to satisfying APRA's investor growth target. And it's likely the banks will offer superior incentives to owner-occupiers, which make up 63 per cent of new flows, to offset the slower asset growth that is realised across their investment property portfolios.\nThe moves are undoubtedly motivated by the desire to mitigate the lower returns the major banks will earn as a consequence of APRA insisting they boost core equity capital buffers by a minimum of 200 basis points. In the absence of any loan repricing, this surcharge would cost the majors about 2 percentage points in annual return on equity.\nAs Moody's commented during the week, the aggressive loan repricing is a \"credit positive\" in so far as banks are bolstering returns and de-risking lending activities at a time when all but the senseless concur housing conditions in Sydney and Melbourne look like a bona fide bubble.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

RP Data Boom accelerates All bank security holders benefit: depositors and bond-holders get safer leverage and world-class first-loss equity capital ratios while the return on equity leakage suffered by shareholders is minimised. This episode is thus a striking demonstration of the market power possessed by what are four of the 20 largest banks in the world. The majors are true \"oligopolists\" or price-setters, and will not likely become price-takers until the competitive playing field is levelled.\nHousing market dynamics, which we have forecast with accuracy in these pages since 2013, nevertheless remain a concern. In the typically slow winter months the non-seasonally adjusted auction clearance rates have clung to boomtime-like 75 per cent-plus levels. Notwithstanding claims from the RBA and others that the market is slowing – a common yet mistaken refrain since 2014 – house prices have re-accelerated in 2015, given the tailwind of twin RBA rate cuts. And a rapidly depreciating Aussie dollar, coupled with ongoing financial instability in China, will only serve to further amplify the strong foreign bid for our bricks and mortar.\nAccording to the RBA's preferred index provider, RP Data, Australian home values have jumped 8 per cent in the first seven months of 2015. This has been propelled by the 12.6 per cent and 11.6 per cent capital gains registered in Sydney and Melbourne respectively, between January and July. On an annualised basis, Aussie home values have jumped 14 per cent over the past seven months, which is a substantial step up in growth over late-2014 levels. In Sydney and Melbourne, home values have been appreciating at a staggering 23 per cent and 19 per cent annualised pace this year. And some editorial spruikers say this is nothing to lose sleep over!\nOne of the most impressive new housing analyses is a fundamentals-based valuation model produced by Craig Shepherd, an economist with the $10 billion fund manager JCP. His research follows my withering critique of RBA claims that housing is now \"30 per cent undervalued\" – after allegedly being fully valued 12 months ago – because of the slump in long-term interest rates that has been driven by central banks spending more than $10 trillion buying government bonds. \"If we unrealistically suppose the RBA cash rate stays at 2 per cent forever, the Australia-wide median house price is currently fairly valued,\" Shepherd says. \"While this is hardly a bubble, the Sydney and Melbourne markets are still over-priced by 23 per cent and 24 per cent respectively, even given the heroic assumption rates never rise.\"\nHis model controls for mortgage rates, rental yields, maintenance, depreciation, building costs, inflation and fixtures and fittings, among other variables, and then discounts back expected cash flows to arrive at a valuation today. The bad news is that \"with negative short-term 'real' interest rates in Australia [our cash rate is below our core inflation rate], and the Fed funds rate expected to rise over the next five years to about 3 per cent, it seems improbable the RBA can keep rates this low forever.\n\"If we assume the RBA's cash rate normalises to a still historically modest 3.5 per cent, which is also below its long-term spread to the Fed rate, the median Australian house price is over-priced by 31 per cent today,\" Shepherd concludes. \"If the cash rate rises in this way, Sydney and Melbourne homes are also presently overvalued by about 47 per cent. By any historic measure that would certainly be considered an asset price bubble.\"\nIn this context, I would encourage you to reflect on Dornbusch's Law, which advises that \"crises take aq much longer time to come than you think, and then happen much faster than you thought\".\nThe author is a director and shareholder in Smarter Money Investments, which manages fixed-income investment portfolios.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T10:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T10:13:09.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
