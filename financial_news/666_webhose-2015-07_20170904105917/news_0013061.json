His appointment is part of a routine reshuffle and is not expected to bring about a shift in Japan's currency policy.\nThe new vice finance minister for international affairs is likely to stick with the G7 and G20 commitment to market-set exchange rates and a policy that does not target currencies. Asakawa currently chairs the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs, dealing with an anti-tax avoidance action plan known as the anti-BEPS (Base Erosion, Profit Shifting) directive.
