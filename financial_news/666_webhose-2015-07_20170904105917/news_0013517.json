The company's capital budget remains unchanged at C$1.55 billion.\n\"Acquiring Coral Hill allows us to assume full operatorship of our Swan Hills assets and to increase our position in the highly economic core of the Swan Hills play,\" Saxberg said.\nCoral Hill's board of directors has unanimously approved the deal and is recommending shareholders to vote in favor of it.\nThe deal is expected to close around Aug. 14.
