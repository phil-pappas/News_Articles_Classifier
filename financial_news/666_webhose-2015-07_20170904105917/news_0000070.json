Photo: Tim Shaw\nA little-known Shanghai-backed development group wants to break through Melbourne's restrictive air safety height barrier with an 85-storey tower in Bourke Street.\nThe syndicate of Shanghai developers which own Sydney-based Besgate​ group has submitted \"indicative\" plans to build a super-tall 273-metre tower on a site occupied by the heritage-listed Eliza Tinsley building between Spencer and King streets.\nAt 85 storeys, the tower would be slightly shorter than its curvaceous 90-storey neighbour approved to be built by Singaporean developer Fragrance Group on the former Savoy Hotel site on Bourke Street opposite Southern Cross Station.\nAny building above 228.5 metres in central Melbourne penetrates the city's obstacle limitation surface (OLS) – a height barrier protecting aeroplane flight paths – and must get approval from aviation authorities before being built.\nRecognising the potential difficulties around height, Besgate has sought planning approval first for an alternative, shorter, tower that rises 66 storeys.\nThe group purchased the 2764-square-metre Bourke Street block from Australia Post in 2013 for $22 million with a permit for a 43-level tower and 560 apartments.\nThe re-submitted proposal improves on the existing permit by increasing the average size of apartments, height of ceilings and eliminating borrowed light in units, KM Develop executive director Steve Wong said.\nKM Develop, a subsidiary of corporate consultants KordaMentha​, is managing Besgate's Melbourne projects.\nMr Wong said the 85-storey tower with 980 units on Bourke Street was an \"indicative proposal\" waiting for approval from aviation authorities.\n\"We're not asking them [Department of Planning] to approve that as part of this application,\" he said.\nThe plans for the 66-storey tower show 818 apartments, a 90-space childcare centre and publicly-accessible open-air style grand foyer.\nThe facade of the heritage-listed Eliza Tinsley building on Bourke Street and part of Langs Lane will be retained but the remainder will be demolished under the proposal.\nBesgate​ managing director Justin Gao said the company's first development foray in Melbourne was a 2007 joint venture with Brady Group at 380 Little Lonsdale Street.\n\"We're a consortium of investors from China. We consider ourselves as one of the pioneers of Chinese developers coming to Australia,\" he said.\nBesgate has built the mixed use B1 Tower in Parramatta and is working on another called Atria in North Sydney. It also has numerous buildings in Shanghai.\nIn Melbourne, alongside 640 Bourke it now boasts two other large development sites.\nOne, at 140 King Street, has permits for a Rothe Lowman designed 57-storey building with 271 units. Another, without permits, covers the former City Peugeot dealership at 558-566 Swanston Street which Besgate snapped up for $13 million three years ago.\n\"We're still working on Swanston Street but we expect to put it through the pipe in the next two or three months,\" Mr Gao said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T22:10:13.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
