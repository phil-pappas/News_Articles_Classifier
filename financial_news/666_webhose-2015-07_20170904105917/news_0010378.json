One factor contributing to the decline is the auto maker's latest vehicle recall. \nGM is recalling close to 51,000 subcompact cars in North America due to an issue in which the radio locks up disabling some warning functions, the Associated Press reports. \nThe recall affects the 2014 and 2015 model year Chevrolet Sparks and the 2015 Chevrolet Sonics. \nAdditionally, GM is recalling about 196,000 older Hummer models worldwide as the vehicles' heating and air conditioning blower motor speed can overheat if operated for a longer period of time, the AP said. \nThe overheating blower can melt nearby plastic and possibly result in a fire. GM is aware of three minor burns due to this issue, but no crashes, the AP added. \nGM is traded on the New York Stock Exchange . Trading on the stock exchange floor was halted earlier today due to a technical issue. Trading is expected to resume after 3pm EST. NYSE stocks have been trading on other platforms. \nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings team rates GENERAL MOTORS CO as a Buy with a ratings score of B. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate GENERAL MOTORS CO (GM) a BUY. This is driven by some important positives, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its increase in net income, impressive record of earnings per share growth, notable return on equity and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Automobiles industry. The net income increased by 343.7% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $213.00 million to $945.00 million. GENERAL MOTORS CO reported significant earnings per share improvement in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, GENERAL MOTORS CO reported lower earnings of $1.64 versus $2.35 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($4.49 versus $1.64). The return on equity has improved slightly when compared to the same quarter one year prior. This can be construed as a modest strength in the organization. Compared to other companies in the Automobiles industry and the overall market on the basis of return on equity, GENERAL MOTORS CO has outperformed in comparison with the industry average, but has underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500. Regardless of the drop in revenue, the company managed to outperform against the industry average of 6.8%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 4.5%. The declining revenue has not hurt the company's bottom line, with increasing earnings per share. Even though the current debt-to-equity ratio is 1.33, it is still below the industry average, suggesting that this level of debt is acceptable within the Automobiles industry. Regardless of the somewhat mixed results with the debt-to-equity ratio, the company's quick ratio of 0.79 is weak.
