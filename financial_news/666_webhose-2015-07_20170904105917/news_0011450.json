The other 65,000 are adults who earn between 100 percent and 138 percent of the federal poverty line. \nThe expansion is actually saving Arizona money, because by unfreezing the optional population, the state got a boost in matching funds provided by the federal government. That boost to the \"restoration\" group was more than enough to cover the costs of the second group. \nArizona's additional costs for covering all the groups are paid by a hospital assessment that is being challenged in court. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T20:07:55.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
