The price represents a 20 percent discount to Haitong’s last close in Hong Kong.\nHaixia Capital offloaded its stake at a loss after a 45 percent plunge in Haitong’s Hong Kong-traded shares over the past month. A flurry of measures to stabilize the Chinese stock market, including a pledge by state-run financial firms to buy 120 billion yuan ($19.3 billion) of shares and a halt to initial public offerings, is failing to stop a rout that erased more than $3.2 trillion of value.\nThe fund manager, backed by government-owned State Development & Investment Corp., bought the Haitong shares earlier this year at HK$17.18 each, as part of a $4.2 billion stock sale completed in May, Hong Kong exchange filings show.\nHaixia Capital offered the shares to investors at HK$11.12 to HK$12 apiece, according to terms for the deal obtained by Bloomberg on Tuesday. It doesn’t own any further stake in Haitong after the sale. UBS Group AG was sole bookrunner for the disposal.\nShares of Haitong were suspended from trading in Hong Kong on Wednesday, after closing down 13 percent at HK$13.90 the day before. No reason has been given yet for the halt.\nA woman in the administrative department of Haixia Capital’s board office, who declined to give her name when reached by phone, said nobody was available to immediately comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T09:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T05:40:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
