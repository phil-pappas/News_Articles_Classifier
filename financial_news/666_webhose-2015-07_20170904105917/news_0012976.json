Kasukuwere's predecessor had on June 1 issued a seven-day ultimatum for vendors to move to the sites outside the city. \nThe day after the new minister's announcement, Harare municipal police began their crackdown, using unnecessary or excessive force, beatings, arbitrary arrests, and unlawful seizure and destruction of goods. On July 9, the municipal police beat and arrested 26 vendors, many of them women, and handed them over to national police, who charged 23 with \"conduct likely to cause breach of peace,\" and 3 with assault. The following day municipal police seized and burned street vendors' goods, mainly clothing. The group of 23 charged were later fined and released; the 3 charged with assault were granted bail on July 24. \nOn July 14, municipal police beat and arrested 16 more street vendors, including Sten Zvorwadza, Samuel Wadzanai Mangoma, and Lucy Makunde, leaders of the National Vendors Union of Zimbabwe (NAVUZ), which represents street vendors. They were charged with inciting public violence after they demanded that municipal police return goods seized from them. \nSeveral vendors were injured in the beatings. But prison officials denied the detained vendors access to medical treatment, despite a court order secured by their lawyer. The magistrate court denied them bail on July 21. Their lawyer filed an appeal at the High Court against the denial of bail, which has been repeatedly postponed and is now scheduled to be heard on July 30. Their trial is scheduled to begin on August 4. \nOn July 24, police arrested three activists who were part of a group of 60 street vendors who visited the detained NAVUZ leaders at Harare Remand Prison. Police alleged that the three activists - Edgar Gweshe, Charles Nyoni, and Don Makuwaza - had taken photographs at the prison, which is prohibited under the Protected Places and Areas Act. They were held for a day, then released on bail. \nOn July 25, police arrested three more activists - Mfundo Mlilo, Nixon Nyikadzino, and Dirk Frey - on charges of organizing a meeting outside Harare Remand Prison in violation of the Public Order and Security Act. The court ordered their release on July 27 because they were detained for more than 48 hours without being brought to court, as required by law. \nInternational standards on the use of force by law enforcement personnel, including police and government inspection agents, are the 1979 United Nations Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the 1990 UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. The Code of Conduct provides that law enforcement officials, in performing their duties, respect and protect human dignity and uphold everyone's human rights. Law enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary, for a specific legitimate aim, and that is strictly proportionate to the need. \nThe authorities should immediately drop their spurious charges against the vendors and activists, and release those still in detention, Human Rights Watch said. Zimbabwe's government should respect and protect the rights of all citizens, including street vendors and the activists who represent them. \n\"Beating women who are struggling to survive as street vendors and bringing trumped-up charges against them is no way to treat Zimbabwe's citizens,\" Mavhinga said. \"What the government needs to do is to work with the vendors to find a way for them to work freely and safely.\" Zimbabwe \nA United States dentist who has become the target of worldwide outrage for hunting and killing a protected lion in … see more » Copyright © 2015 Human Rights Watch.
