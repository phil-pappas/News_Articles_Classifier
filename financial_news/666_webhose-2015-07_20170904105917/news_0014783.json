That is the reality on the ground. The dreaded Dum-so is in the fourth year and counting. So far, there is no indication of an early solution to the problem. \nMr. Ebo Amoah, an engineer with the Volta River Authority at the dam site at Akosombo sounded rather ominous the other day when he told the media that the situation could worsen with the unpredictable nature of the rainfall pattern. \nAccording to energy experts, this nation is in this situation because the state has failed to honour its financial commitments to the Volta River Authority and the Electricity Company of Ghana. \nAs it is, Dum-so has drastically affected mobilization of resources. Companies are unable to hit their targets and are, therefore, finding it difficult to pay their taxes and other financial commitments to the state. \nWhen the Finance Minister, Seth Terkper went to Parliament and presented his mid-year review of the national budget, the other day, he asked for more money to run the state treasury, because most projections were not realized. \nThe President and his economic technocrats have a serious job to do. We are told, for instance, that public debt has ballooned from GHc9.5 billion as at January 2009 to GHc90 billion at the moment, representing 67 percent of Gross Domestic Products. \nIn the year 2015 alone, this nation would need to fork out GHc10 billion (about $3.3 billion) to pay interests on our loans. Surely, this nation cannot continue to go on borrowing spree to finance capital and other developmental projects. \nRather ominously, we are told the Mahama administration has already eaten into the oil stabilization fund set up to ensure that there is something to cushion this nation on a rainy day. In the words of the Minister of Finance, as much as GHc206 million has already been taken from the fund. \nThat is not the only reason why the President and his Economic Management Team have to sit up. Most economic projections were not met. For instance, the government voted to spend as much as GHC39.1 billion on capital expenditure (excluding payments on arrears) to provide key services including solving the perennial Dum-so debacle. \nAccording to Mr. Seth Terkper, the Government has slashed this promise by GH1.2 0 billion. The state will now spend only GHc37.9 billion. \nIn spite of this reduction in public expenditures, the Finance Minister asked for GHc866 million more before it could put the economy afloat. In all these calculations, the problem of Dum-so persists and this country is kept in the dark, literally. \nThe Chronicle is sad to note that in all these permutations, solution to the dreaded Dum-so has eluded the directors of the state machinery. The state of Ghana has therefore condemned Ghanaians, especially those in the productive sectors in the cities and towns in the Southern Sector of the country, to live like cave men and women. \nIt is important to note that this administration is the only one on record to have benefitted from oil cash injections. It has also borrowed more than all previous administrations put together. At the last count, every Ghanaian, including those to be born today, are indebted to internal and external creditors to the tune of GHc3,000 and above. \nThe irony of all this is that Minister of Finance, Seth Terkper, keeps talking of the Mahama administration as being on course with its economic policies. We shudder to think what the economic picture would look like when the government's policy direction takes a different turn, from official point of view. \nFor most Ghanaians though, the reality in our market situation and cost of living generally, drive it home that Mahama's economic policies are not working. The state economy is on its sick bed. On the evidence so far, the economy is not responding to treatment. Mahama and his economic team needs to up their game! Ghana \nIn spite of to the current economic challenges and rising inflation on other sectors of the economy which Ghana's mobile … see more » Copyright © 2015 Ghanaian Chronicle. All rights reserved.
