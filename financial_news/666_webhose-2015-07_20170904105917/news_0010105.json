Jessica Hromas by Robert Harley Forget comparisons with Melbourne or Brisbane, Sydneysiders should compare their city with global leaders such as London, New York, Singapore and even Dubai, says the new NSW Minister for Planning, Rob Stokes.\n\"We have a generational opportunity to reshape Sydney and we should seize it with vigour,\" Mr Stokes said in a upbeat speech to 600 guests at a Property Council lunch in Sydney on Thursday.\nSydney had to \"confront the institutional and government challenges\" that had crippled its progress for decades, starting with the \"silo thinking of government departments and the 43 local governments\" across the city.\n\"We have a city shaped by the tyranny of small decisions. There has never been a sense of metropolitan planning.\"\nMr Stokes said Sydney had strengths in its ethnic diversity, educational institutions and environment. Its weaknesses were trains, traffic and transport.\n\"Through lazy planning (from 1960s to the 1990s) we gave no thought to connecting homes with jobs,\" he said.\nProperty Council NSW executive director, Glenn Byers pointed out that western Sydney already had a deficit of 200,000 jobs and, as the population grew, another 100,000 people would have to travel east for work. Mr Stokes said he would have more to say on the Western Sydney employment lands.\nConfident presentation The property audience had heard such ambitions before, though perhaps not as grandly or confidently presented.\nMr Stokes, who became an MP in 2007 and the Planning Minister with the re-election of the Baird government in March, was a lawyer and planner by profession.\nHe started with confidence. The Housing Acceleration Fund was refreshed with more money in the recent budget, issues papers had been released to cut the number of state environment planning policies and to extend the housing code.\nMr Stokes said the Greater Sydney Commission, which was modelled on the successful Greater London Authority, and importantly had gained the support of the Opposition, would be running by the end of the year.\n\"Once we get the Greater Sydney Commission in place, we get to the big kahuna â€“ the planning legislation,\" he said.\nDespite all that, many in his audience had seen little change to the complex bureaucracy and lengthy delays that bedevilled NSW projects.\nMr Stokes also had still to win over Sydney residents suspicious of developer-driven change.\nHe encouraged the audience to imagine Sydney as \"great global city dominating and leading our region for the next century.\"\n\"Cities are all about the benefits and opportunities of change. We need to explain the benefits.\"\nHe acknowledged that increased density had generally been badly done. \"It is no wonder the local communities oppose density,\" he said.\nHe said the Bays Precinct, the proposed redevelopment of government waterfront holdings from the Fish Markets to Rozelle, would have to be \"an exemplar\" of density done well.\n\"Conflicts are inevitable, but let's fight about the things that matter,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:10:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
