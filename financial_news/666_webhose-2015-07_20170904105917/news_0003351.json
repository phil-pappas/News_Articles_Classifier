Erin Jonasson by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Takeover target Asciano is through to the second round of bidding for the Port of Darwin's 99-year lease, along with Flinders Ports and the Port of Brisbane.\nPalisade Investment Partners and Morrison & Co Transport are out, leaving just a handful of companies in the running with final bids due at the end of September.\nIt comes after Canadian infrastructure giant Brookfield lobbed a $9 billion takeover bid for the ASX-listed Asciano, as foreshadowed by Street Talk .\nThe sale of the port has been progressing slowly, but the Northern Territory government is aiming to have the long-term lease signed and implemented by the end of the year.\nThe port's earnings have been crushed by the falling iron ore price in the past 12 months, with customers such as Roper River Iron Ore project-owner, Sherwin Iron, hurting.\nBut bidders have been told to expect earnings to pick up again from the 2017-18 financial year when big liquefied natural gas ships start arriving to carry gas to Asia.\nFlinders is being advised by KPMG Corporate Finance while JPMorgan is tending to Port of Brisbane.\nFlagstaff Partners is the sell-side adviser.\n Separately, a \"steering committee\" on logistics group Bis Industries has been formed with around nine banks doing the key negotiations on behalf of the 20-strong debt syndicate.\nPrivate equity group KKR & Co is trying to get the debt syndicate to agree to a $1 billion refinancing.\nInvestment banks Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, UBS and BNP Paribas were among the lenders who chipped in to Bis' last major debt deal, a $950 million, three-year refinancing package in December 2012, along with three of the big four Australian lenders.\nNow KKR has asked the syndicate to push out covenants and amend some of the existing terms in order to gift the company a decent runway to ride out sector volatility.\nDeloitte was recently called in to provide comfort to Bis's senior credit investors on the profit forecasts, commodity price assumptions and reporting systems put together by new Bis head honcho Brad Rogers, and the contracts the business has in place.\nThe use of a steering committee is not uncommon in multi-bank restructurings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:03:29.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
