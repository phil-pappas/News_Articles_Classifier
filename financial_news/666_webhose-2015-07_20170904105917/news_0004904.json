It fell as low as 97.108 in the previous session before taking back lost ground.\nU.S. data on Wednesday showed new home resales rose to a 8-1/2 year high, bolstering bets that the Federal Reserve is on track to hike interest rates later this year. The prospect of higher rates enhanced the dollar's appeal, and propelled it to session highs.\nThe British pound also got a lift from the prospect of higher interest rates, and was up slightly on the day at $1.5624 .\nMinutes from the Bank of England's July 8 meeting revealed on Wednesday that several policymakers are moving towards voting for the first rate increase following BOE Governor Mark Carney's recent comments that a hike might happen around the end of year.\nEconomists predicted that three of nine members of the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee might vote for a rate hike in August, which could put the central on track for a majority to back an increase later this year or in early 2016.\n(Editing by Shri Navaratnam)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T04:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T04:11:02.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
