In one fell swoop, the hunter became the hunted. \nThe ongoing three-way wrestling match has been held up as a flashing indicator of a recent return to boardroom brouhaha and a frenzied pace of mergers and acquisitions. \nRenewed confidence and a fear of being left behind is creating a potent combination that has seen companies return to blockbuster deal-making at the fastest pace for almost a decade. \nHeinz' $45bn takeover of mac and cheese maker Kraft \nAlready this year, more than $2.2 trillion worth of takeovers have been signed, including Shell’s £47bn takeover of BG, Heinz’s $45bn takeover of Kraft Foods (Sao Paolo: KFGI34.SA - news ) and Charter Communications (NasdaqGS: CHTR - news ) ’ $79bn swoop on Time Warner Cable (Xetra: T3W1.DE - news ) . \nThe frenetic pace puts 2015 on track to surpass 2007 as the biggest year on record for mergers and acquisitions, when $4.3 trillion worth were sealed. \n“We have seen a markedly more hostile Jurassic Park-style environment this year, where making a move for another business can make you a prey to someone else,” said Luigi Rizzo, Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s head of M&A for Europe, Middle East and Africa. \nTelecity, the British data centres group, also became someone else’s lunch when it was gobbled up by US group Equinix (NasdaqGS: EQIX - news ) in May, just weeks after attempting to seal its own £2.4bn merger with Dutch rival Interxion. \nWith the exception of US pharmaceutical group Valeant’s struggle to take over Allergan, hostile deal-making had been notably absent for some time. Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) , City sources say that the wheels are in motion for more consolidation across many sectors, and company bosses are gearing up to take leading roles in the transformation of their industries. \n“There is available cash and where there is ongoing consolidation, companies are encouraged to act”, said Michel Driessen, partner at EY’s transaction services group. \nCertain sectors have dominated. Telecommunications and technology companies account for almost a quarter of the top 50 deals so far this year, closely followed by health care. \nBritain’s previously sleepy and stale telecoms indsutry was woken up with a bang last year when BT’s boss Gavin Patterson unveiled his ambitions to enter the mobile market with a £12.5bn takeover of EE. \nA domino effect then occurred, as Three, backed by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka Shing, inked a £10bn takeover of O2, with both sides desperate not to be left behind and even more vulnerable to a beefed-up BT. \nThese multi-billion deals are also evidence of a noticeable shift away from the smaller deals that had been employed by companies after the downturn, in favour of more transformative M&A. \n“We are in a great market globally,” said Hernan Cristerna, co-head of global M&A at JP Morgan. “Confidence is building, and boards (and investors) are more comfortable backing the right deals today than 12 or 24 months ago”, he added. \nThere have even been 31 deals over $10bn this year. \nHalf of the takeovers announced in the first six months originated in American boardrooms, with US buyers accounting for $1 trillion of M&A, after taking advantage of the swift economic recovery. \nThat has also translated into Wall Street’s dominance over the City in investment banking, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) taking the top spot in league tables, bringing in $1.3bn of fees. JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch closely follow. \nOne banker said that the 50 biggest deals this year also accounted for around 50pc of the total deal value, emphasising the importance for investment banks to win a role in blockbuster deals rather than occupy themselves with smaller deals. \nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis, companies battened down the hatches and focused on stripping out costs, but with the world economy now growing again, cash piles have increased and ambitions have grown. \n“With the return of economic growth, confidence is increasing,” said Kasim Kutay, co-head of Europe at Moelis. “When combined with the fact that shareholders are once again embracing M&A and financing remains ample and affordable, the result is heightened deal activity.” \nIt has even become quantifiable to measure shareholder enthusiasm for M&A share prices of acquiring companies have risen by 2.6pc on average on the day a deal is announced in comparison with the typical immediate sell-off in the past eight years. \n“Whereas we used to have to prepare clients that their share price would drop on a takeover, now they are asking us how much their share price will rise,” one banker joked. \nIn the current low-interest-rate environment, institutional investors and companies are desperate to find growth and better yields. While at one stage, shareholders might have called on companies to return cash via share buybacks, brokers are saying that they’ve been urged to pass the message on to finance chiefs that they should halt buybacks, as they result in investors holding more cash than they would like to. Instead, companies should be using stock to fund deals that will allow them to improve their earnings growth and strip out costs. \nCompanies have been heeding that message, and during the first half of the year, there have been more takeovers using a combination of shares and cash than ever recorded, and the lowest use of cash since 2003, according to Dealogic. This is despite balance sheets being awash with cash and debt funding being at its cheapest level since 2007. \nThe revival of corporate deal-making has shunted private-equity firms, the kings of the last deal-making boom, on to the sidelines. \n“Private-equity firms have, in recent years, been able to raise more money than ever before, yet it has been a challenge this year to deploy capital in size,” said Rizzo. \nBecause of the cost savings companies are extracting through mergers and acquisitions and their ability to access cheap debt markets this year, private-equity firms are increasingly being trumped in bidding wars. \n“Despite how aggressive private- equity firms are being at trying to put money to work, companies are feeling significantly more confident,” said Jacques Callaghan, co-head of European investment banking at Canaccord Genuity. \nPrivate-equity firms are also now losing out to overseas strategic bidders in the fight for assets, as was seen in Canada’s Brookfield purchase of Center Parcs , South Africa’s Brait takeover of New Look, as well as deep-pocketed sovereign wealth funds and pension funds. \n“In addition to the traditional competition from trade buyers, we have seen stronger bids from sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, as well as new Asian buyers. The continued strength of the IPO market has also meant fewer primary opportunities,” Rizzo added. \nHowever, private-equity firms are faced with a Catch-22 position: while they want to achieve the best deal when buying a business, they also want the highest price for anything that they are selling. As a result, deal valuations are also now at a peak, with debt multiples returning to 2007 levels as well. \nPrices are being chased higher and higher by an intense competition for assets and a fear of being left behind. \nAnd although many are saying that companies are approaching M&A more cautiously than at the peak of 2007, if the current pace of deal-making continues, there will be a heightened sense of pressure on rival businesses to do deals. \nBut businesses that spend billions out of a fear of being left behind may have a loosened grip on rationality, and when executive egos are thrown into the mix, there is great potential for costly deal-making. Already this week, questions have been raised about logic behind the $18bn deal between professional services firms Towers Watson and Willis . \nThe last M&A booms, of 2000 and 2007, were shortly followed by painful downturns. The City will be hoping that the latest bonanza isn’t a harbinger of the next crash.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T16:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T18:57:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
