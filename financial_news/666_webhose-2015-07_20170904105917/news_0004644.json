This will enhance productivity and contribute to national development. This is our way of telling HR to do better”, she said. \nSpeaking on behalf of the organizing committee, Mr. David Attricki, Editor-in-Chief of the HR Focus Magazine, thanked Dr. Djabatey for C&J Medicare Hospital’s sponsorship of the HR Focus Conference and Awards. \nHe commended the hospital for its contribution towards the wellbeing of employees through its “Well Man” and “Well Woman” packages. \nMr. Attricki added, “The HR Forum and Career development session is our way of giving back to society and that is why we are doing it for free.” He used the opportunity to call on other corporate bodies to help HR Focus promote HR innovations, development and best practice by sponsoring the event. \nC&J Medicare Hospital is a Gold Sponsor of the HR Focus Conference and Awards 2015 amongst other sponsors. \nHR Focus Conference and Awards 2015 comes off on the 8th and 9th October, 2015 at the Banquet Hall, State House and it will comprise an HR Forum, exhibition, career fair and an HR awards night.
