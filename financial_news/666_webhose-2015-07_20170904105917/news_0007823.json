PP, by email \nThe tax disc, first introduced in 1921, has ceased to exist in paper form since last October, with a new electronic system put in its place. \nUnder new rules announced in the Autumn Statement last year, motorists now have to register their car online to pay Vehicle Excise Duty. This can be done via Direct Debit on the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) website, on the phone, or at a Post Office branch. \nThose who don't register for the tax could be caught out by number plate recognition cameras which track each vehicle on the road. \n• Death of the tax disc: learn new rules or risk £1,000 fine \nBut what happens to those who continue to display the paper tax disc on their car? Could they be penalised? \nPaul Watters, head of roads policy at the AA, said that since the vehicle tax disc was officially abolished in October 2014 there has been no legal obligation to display a tax disc on your vehicle. But he said that there was \"nothing to stop you continuing to display the disc, whether its ‘expired’ or not, and it seems that many drivers may be reluctant to remove the old disc.\" \nAccording to an AA-Populus poll, conducted a month after the tax disc abolition, only a fifth of its members had actually removed the disc from their windscreen. Things are a little different today, with many motorists now used to the changes. \nMr Watters said that drivers must, of course, still tax their vehicle, and they can check their current tax status online. \n• Defunct car tax discs start to sell for £40 on eBay \nA spokesman for the DVLA confirmed that as the paper tax disc has been abolished there is no longer a need to display it but it is not an offence if the keeper chooses to do so. \nDo you have a question for our experts?
