Greeks can only withdraw up to 420 euros ($464) a week. \nFor businesses the capital controls were slightly eased last week but economic activity especially imports continues to encounter numerous obstacles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T21:05:32.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
