Local authorities have 1.86 trillion yuan of debt that matures this year, as well as a further 919.3 billion yuan in contingent liabilities, according to a government audit report based on data as of June 2013.\n“This is virtually the central government offering local authorities more credit and targeted interest-rate cuts,” said Zhao Yang, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Hong Kong. “The additional quota will benefit the economy because lower costs of government-led projects will help boost investment.”\nThe ministry of finance didn’t immediately reply to a fax seeking comment Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T11:16:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
