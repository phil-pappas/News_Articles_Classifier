It said it had discussed the creation of a joint project company to operate the pipeline, and the possibility of OMV getting a stake in this joint company. \nBASF and OMV did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nBASF oil and gas subsidiary Wintershall has previously said, in June, that it is keeping faith with its Russian investments and wants to do more there, despite tense relations between Moscow and Europe over Ukraine. \nGazprom currently owns 51 percent in the project to build Nord Stream 2, which has a planned capacity of 55 billion cubic metres per year.
