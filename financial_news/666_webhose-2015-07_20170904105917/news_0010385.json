(AP) -- A Wal-Mart manager and his daughter were arrested Wednesday in connection with an investigation into a theft at a northeastern Oklahoma Wal-Mart store in which a man disguised as an armored truck driver walked out with more than $75,000. \nBristow police detective Kevin Webster said the man and his daughter were taken into custody, but he would not say how they are believed to be connected to the theft. No charges have been filed. \nA spokesperson for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. \nAuthorities said the suspect entered the Wal-Mart store in Bristow about 10:30 a.m. Saturday, walked to the cash office, signed for the deposit and walked out of the store. He drove away in a dark four-door Chevrolet. \nBristow Police Chief Wayne Williams has said the unidentified suspect was dressed similarly to a Loomis armored truck driver. Wal-Mart employees called police after the real Loomis employee arrived about 45 minutes later. Bristow is about 35 miles southwest of Tulsa. \nAuthorities in northeast Oklahoma have received some anonymous tips about the identity of the suspect whose image was captured by a video surveillance camera. Williams has said investigators do not believe the suspect lives in the area and have no evidence he ever worked for an armored transportation service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T22:09:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
