That is certainly the case, but if they say ‘no’ they will have to introduce another currency after the referendum because the euro is not available as a means of payment.\" \n\"The moment someone introduces a new currency, they exit the euro zone. Those are the elements that give me some hope that the people will not vote ‘no’ today.” \nMr Schulz is ignoring the fact that any country in the world, including Greece, can use the euro even if they're not part of the monetary union. But, the point he seems to be getting at is that the government will have to start thinking about IOUs to pay their workers and pensioners given the liquidity crunch that is being suffered by the country right now. Once that starts happening, the paper begins to be traded very much like a de facto new currency. It's a slippery slope to a euro exit. \n= 09.10 = \n= Former PM Antonis Samaras casts his vote = \nThere's little doubt over whether New Democracy's Antonis Samaras will be picking Oxi or Nai today. The conservative former PM has backed a vote to stay in Europe at all costs. At one point, his party even threatened to boycott the referendum in protest that it was even being put to a public vote. As PM Mr Samaras held elections in late December which eventually resulted in the election of Syriza. \nShould Greeks now support 'Yes', he could once again become a pivotal figure in any possible national unity government that could emerge if Mr Tsipras steps down. \n= 09.05 = \n= \"What have we done to offend the Gods?\" = \nOur man in Athens, Colin Freeman has been talking to some anxious locals in the Plaka neighbourhood of Athens ahead of today's referendum \n\"I will vote 'Yes', as I want us to stay in Europe,\" said Adania Economea, 42, the owner of the Verandah cafe in Plaka. \"But it is terrible that this is separating us all into 'Yes' and 'No' camps. \n\"My 80-year-old mother has been telling me about the years of the civil war in Greece, which I can now imagine as she described. We are not at that stage yet, of course, but I fear things could get very difficult.\" \n\"People are waiting for war,\" said Kimaratos Panagiotis, a butcher chopping up lamb legs in the local meat market. \"Business is double what it was, as the rumours are going around that we are going to run out of meat.\" \nIf we vote 'No' and then leave the Eurozone, at least we will have control of our own destiny again. I can't believe that some of those Greeks who have suffered just like I have are likely to be voting \"Yes\". \n\"They have just been listening to the propaganda in the media, which says we are going to becoming like Africa if we leave the Eurozone.\" \n= 09.00 = \n= Alexis Tsipras casts his vote = \nThe Greek PM has taken the media by suprise, casting his vote in Athens this morning. After casting his ballot, Mr Tsipras told the hoarde of waiting journalists: \"As of tomorrow we will have opened a new road for all the peoples of Europe, a road that leads back to the founding values of democracy and solidarity in Europe.\" \nA 'No' vote, he said, \"will send a message of determination, not only to stay in Europe but to live with dignity in Europe.\" \n= 08.44 = \n= Voting begins = \nVoting has been open for just under four hours in Greece and we're getting our first trickle of ballot box pics \nAn Orthodox priest puts a referendum vote in the ballot box at a school \n= 08.00 = \n= Greek referendum day arrives = \nHello and welcome to today's live coverage of referendum day in Greece. July 5 2015 marks the most pivotal day in Greece's 14-year membership of the euro. \nGreek citizens from the age of 18 will be able to vote in their local districts to say 'Nai' (yes) or 'Oxi' to the country's bail-out deal. \nThe voting booths opened at 7am local time (5am BST) and will close around 7pm (5pm BST). There are no official exit polls, but we should have the first results coming in from around 7pm London time. \nHere is the question that awaits on the ballot paper: \nOur International Business Editor Ambrose Evans-Pritchard is in Athens today and bought news last night of the president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz who warned of an impending health and social crisis if Greeks choose 'Oxi' tonight. \nMr Schulz, who has previously called for a technocratic government to replace Alexis Tsipras's Syriza, said yesterday: \"Without new money, salaries won't be paid, the health system will stop functioning, the power network and public transport will break down.\" \nThe warnings echo a chorus of other EU officials who insist tonight's referendum result is a verdict on whether or not Greece can remain in the euro. \nMr Tsipras has maintained that it firmly is not. Should Greeks back him and deliver 'the Big No' he says it will embolden his government to go back to the negotiating table and secure better terms for the country's bail-out future. \nShould it be a 'Yes', Mr Tsipras has indicated he is willing to step down from government. His finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has said categorically he will resign from his post. \nThe polls show the result is too close to call. Four polls carried out on Friday showed the 'Yes' camp was marginally ahead. A fifth put the 'No' camp 0.5pc in front. These are all within the range of error. \nOne senior German official voiced his concern of the \"nightmare\" scenario tonight: \" The nightmare result would be 51-49pc in either direction ....And the chances of this are not insignificant\" he told Reuters. \nWe'll be bringing you all the permutations of what result could mean for the country's government, economy and banking system, so make sure to stick with us. \nOn a lighter note, here's this morning's Matt cartoon taking on the referendum in its own inimitable way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T12:14:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
