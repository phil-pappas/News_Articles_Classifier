That's why the small business budget boost was so important with the instant asset write-off which has done so much to boost confidence,\" he told reporters while ambling around at a Woolworths store in western Sydney.\nHe then elevated grocers to our front line defence against this foreign peril.\n\"That's why today's grocery code of conduct is so important. It's all about producing stronger local businesses and if we've got stronger local businesses we'll have a stronger local economy, and we'll be very well placed to deal with whatever the future throws at us.\"\nThat's right, we are throwing fruit and veg at this potential global cataclysm - and possibly a half-eaten onion.\nHe even emphasised the point just in case everyone thought he was going a bit loopy.\n\"We have a great supermarket system, that rests on the shoulders of great local suppliers and this is about ensuring that we continue to have very strong local suppliers,\" he said. \"And if we do that we will avoid the problems that we see overseas.\"\nAnd CBD thought the Grocery code was merely designed to rectify problems they don't have overseas - monopolist local retailers, like Coles and Woolies, strong arming grocery suppliers.\nMP Hammer We may have found a reason why our PM often leaves the impression that all he has is a hammer, and everything looks like a nail.\n\"Growing up I was fortunate to have a grandfather who was a carpenter,\" our PM said in a message to the 2015 Australian International Furniture and Design Fair.\n\"He crafted many beautiful objects and instilled in me an appreciation of good materials, and the importance of quality workmanship.\"\nIf only grandad instilled in little Tony the virtues of building something instead of tearing things down.\nEt tu CGU? IAG is still basking in the glow of its hallowed status as an investment blessed with the support of the guru, Warren Buffett .\nSo it must have come to earth with a bit of a thud on Tuesday with the news that its subsidiary, CGU, had been caught dabbling in \"useless\" payday insurance by the corporate cop.\nIt is one of the parties now offering to refund millions of dollars to customers of collapsed payday lender, The Cash Store Pty Ltd, which sold the insurance products underwritten by a CGU subsidiary, AHI.\nASIC said the insurance product \"covered consumers against the risk of becoming unemployed, sick or dying during the period of the payday loans, which could be as short as one day, and was usually around two weeks.\"\nOne particular problem was the fact that the insurance was null and void if the customer was unemployed. This was obviously not explained to the predominantly jobless payday loan customers.\n\"ASIC took action because we were concerned about the unfair sale of the payday insurance when it was highly unlikely that consumers would be able to make a claim,\" ASIC's deputy dawg, Peter Kell , said\nAn IAG spokesman said the insurer shared ASIC's concerns and said it is confident it has no other relationships with payday lenders.\nLast drinks Former Qantas boss Geoff Dixon wound up his farewell tour from Tourism Australia on Tuesday night.\nHe has now officially pulled stumps as its chairman, and will now be pulling beers at one of the many pubs he owns with Mark Carnegie and John Singleton .\nBut he managed to mix his past and future careers by hosting a small gathering of the Tourism Australia team at one of his pubs.\nHis home town pub, the Turvey Park Tavern in Wagga Wagga, was obviously out of the question - even for a tourism team.\nSo Dixon hosted them instead at one of his watering holes a bit closer to TA HQ - the Blues Point Hotel, McMahons Point.\nThe gathering included tourism boss John O'Sullivan - who is, quite appropriately, on holidays at the moment. And what Dixon refers to as the \"unsung heroes\" at TA who he's worked with closely over his six years.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T21:50:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
