It did not give detailed sales numbers but said it sold 35,000 Lord of the Rings Blu-Ray sets in 15 minutes and that a Kate Spade handbag was sold out in a minute. \nSome Amazon shoppers vented on Twitter that Prime Day deals were selling out too quickly and complained that deals were not attractive enough. \nOther shoppers used the #PrimeDayFail hashtag on Twitter. One user tweeted: \"Hey @Amazon, #PrimeDay is not Black Friday in July. It's April Fools' in July. #primedayfail\". \nAdobe Digital Index said that 50 percent of overall sentiment related to Prime Day on social media was about disappointment. \n\"Much of the disappointed chatter focussed on the lack of blockbuster deals,\" it said, adding that users cited sales of less desirable items like socks and towels. \nAn Amazon spokeswoman said the retailer was listening to its customers and planned to add more deals like TVs. \nChannelAdvisor calculated the 80 percent rise in U.S. sales as of 12 p.m. ET (1600 GMT) based on sales by partner retailers that sell on Amazon.com. \nSales rose 40 percent in Amazon Europe, ChannelAdvisor said. \nAmazon declined to comment on the data. \nWal-Mart launched a three-month online sale of some 2,000 items on Wednesday. The company said customers \"shouldn't have to pay a fee\" to get low prices, a dig at Amazon, which it did not name. Deals should be around for more than a single day, a spokesman said. \nTarget Corp (TGT.N) has been running its own summer \"Black Friday\" sale since 2010 and is offering it for 10 days through Saturday. \n(Additional reporting by Mari Saito; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T02:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T05:59:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
