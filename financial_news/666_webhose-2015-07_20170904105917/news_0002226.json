Tanya Lake Share on twitter by Joanna Mather Money owed to the tax office has blown out by 21 per cent in just four years and, at $35.3 billion, is equal to more than half the annual GST take and more than each of the annual defence and education budgets.\nThe figures raise questions about the debt collection capacity of the Australian Tax Office, which has been hit hard by public sector job cuts, with nearly 5000 jobs due to be shed by 2018.\nIn a new report on Tuesday, the Inspector-General of Taxation, Ali Noroozi, highlights the fact outstanding tax debt reached 2.27 per cent of gross domestic product in 2013-14, or $35.3 billion.\nHe questions the effectiveness of the ATO's strategies for pursuing debtors, recommending more frequent contact with at-risk clients and intervention at an earlier stage.\n\"The level of collectable debt has grown in quantity and as a proportion of GDP notwithstanding previous ATO strategies,\" the report says.\n\"Such growth in debt requires specific attention or government policy and public services would be adversely impacted.\"\n$20b 'collectible' Overall, the amount of total tax debt managed by the ATO as a proportion of GDP has risen from from 1.88 per cent in 2010-11, at $26.8 billion, to 2.27 per cent in 2013-14, or $35.3 billion.\n Most debt, about 55 per cent or $20 billion, is considered \"collectable\". This is debt not subject to dispute or the taxpayer is not subject to some form of insolvency administration.\n\"Disputed\" debt comes in at 26 to 29 per cent and \"insolvent\" debt at 16 per cent -19 per cent.\nThree quarters of collectable debt rests with micro-businesses. That is, those with turnover under $500,000.\nBut small businesses with turnover of between $500,000 and $1 million account for a growing proportion of \"insolvency debt\".\n\"Over time, it appears that small businesses with turnover between $500,000 and $1 million almost tripled their amounts of insolvency debt from $422 million in 2012–13 to $1.228 billion in 2013–14,\" the report says. ​\nThe inspector general's role is to identify systemic issues in the administration of tax law.\nThe ATO has acknowledged that it is facing challenges in relation to debt collection. It has not met its deliverables or its key performance indicators for collecting and managing tax debts in the past two financial years.\nTax Commission Chris Jordan announced in March that the ATO would act more swiftly to recover payment and initiate bankruptcy procedures.\nResponding to the report on Tuesday, the ATO said it had a new debt collection strategy.\n\"The strategy focuses on making it as easy as possible for individuals and businesses to understand and meet their tax obligations including paying debts,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\"The strategy recognises that even viable, well-run businesses occasionally experience short-term cash flow issues and the ATO will continue to work with them and support them in meeting their obligations, for example through payment arrangements, remission of interest and hardship provisions.\"\nThe report says the ATO may have to contact debtors more frequently in the early stages of their arrears.\nIt is critical of junior debt collectors in the ATO, who have too much latitude to issue garnishee notices and should be better supervised.\n\"Junior officers have been authorised to make important decisions, without senior officer approval, such as garnishing taxpayer bank accounts up to $50,000,\" the report says.\nDebt collectors unpopular Mr Noroozi recommends the debt collection function of the ATO be moved into the compliance area. He notes that 200,000 garnishee notices, effectively a way for the ATO to seize funds from a bank account, have been issued in three years. He also says there is strong opposition to the ATO's use of external debt collection agencies.\n\"I have recommended that the ATO make public its reasons for using external debt collection agencies and transparently share the intended benefits and outcomes to assuage concerns,\" the report says.\nH&R Block tax communications director Mark Chapman says many taxpayers are worried that the ATO is not managing its debt compliance activities as well as it should.\n\"The most worrying aspect of this report is the disappointingly ambiguous response from the ATO itself,\" he says.\n\"While they have formally accepted 16 of the Inspector-General's recommendations, their detailed responses to those recommendations appear to consist of vague motherhood statements or remarks which effectively disagree with the recommendations.\n\"The ATO should make specific commitments to implementing his recommendations within an agreed timeframe.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-07-14T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:35:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
