Related Topics Kenya: Corruption Is As Plain As Mismatched Wealth and Salaries, Obama Says \nThe report said that despite some attempts to massively produce biogas in Africa, there has been little success. \n\"Great distances, as well as a lack of infrastructure and cultural uptake, have impeded development. Production of biomethane is rare in Africa, but in 2014, Kenya began to construct its first grid-connected biomethane plant, which was expected to begin producing power in 2015,\" the report indicates. \nIn 2013, US President Barack Obama unveiled a $7 billion(Sh704.9 billion) plan to improve energy access in Africa over the next five years. \nObama announced the \"Africa Power initiative\" during his tour of Senegal, South Africa, and Tanzania. \nHe will be in the country this weekend for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit where green energy is expected to be discussed. \nThe report said the two 13MW binary units which were completed in February, expanded the Olkaria III complex to 110 MW capacity. \nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta Commissioned a 140MW Olkaria IV Geothermal Power Plant in Naivasha on October 17. \nTwo more 70MW units became operational in December. \nThe report says favourable government policies and increased cost-competitiveness, particularly for electricity generated from wind and solar photovoltaics, have spurred recent renewable energy development,. \nIt said future policies need to respond to emerging opportunities and challenges by addressing new developments. \n\"The challenge now is to develop the necessary policy frameworks to drive the renewable energy transition to achieve sustainable and universal energy access for all,\"the report says adding that renewables play an increasingly central role in the provision of energy services to people globally. Kenya \nUS President Barack Obama has challenged Kenya to empower women and girls to achieve its development dream faster. see more » Copyright © 2015 The Star. All rights reserved.
