The reporting pace picks up this week, with more than 100 companies coming out with Q2 results, including 40 S&P 500 members. Banks are no doubt heavily represented on this week’s reporting docket, but we have plenty of bellwethers from other sectors as well to give us a good flavor of this earnings season. \nBanks had an overall decent time in Q2, with an improving interest rate backdrop, nothing new on the regulatory/litigation expense front and some modest gains on the core banking and capital markets fronts. The gains in treasury yields during the quarter have started reversing in July with the resumption of the never-ending Greek story. Overall profitability for the group is expected to be only modestly up from the same period last year, with revenues constrained by continued net-interest margin pressures and cost cuts as the major tool for earnings growth. \nTotal earnings for the Finance sector are expected to be up +2.7% on -0.5% lower revenues in Q2. While not much, the sector’s positive growth in the quarter is in contrast to more than half of the 16 Zacks sectors that are expected to see earnings decline from the earlier level. \nThe key Finance sector results this week include : \nJ.P. Morgan ( JPM ) – J.P. Morgan is expected to report EPS of $1.45 on $24.1 billion in revenues before the market opens on July 14th (Tuesday), which compares to EPS of $1.46 on $26.5 billion in revenue the year-earlier quarter. The bank has a mixed record surprises in recent quarters, though it handily beat on EPS and modestly missed on the top-line in Q1. The stock has been the best performer among its peers, up +4.6% in the year-to-date vs declines of -1.1% each for the Finance sector as well as the S&P 500 index in that same time period. \nWells Fargo ( WFC ) – Wells Fargo is reporting Tuesday morning as well, with the bank expected to earn $1.04 in EPS on $21.5 billion revenues, which compares to EPS of $1.01 on $21.1 billion in revenues in 2014 Q2. Wells Fargo has quite an impressive track record of meeting or beating EPS and revenue estimates consistently. The stock has been essentially flat year to date \nBank of America ( BAC ) – Bank of America has been the weakest performer of the large money-center banks, both in terms of profitability as well as stock price performance. The company is expected to report 36 cents in EPS on $21.3 billion revenues vs. EPS of 29 cents on $21.7 billion in revenues in the year-earlier quarter; it reports on July 15th (Wednesday). The stock has been down more than -9% year to date \nCitigroup ( C ) – Citigroup will report Q2 results July 16th (Thursday) and is expected to earn $1.35 in earnings on $19.2 billion in revenues vs. EPS of $1.08 on $18.8 billion in revenues in 2014 Q2. The company has a mixed record in terms of earnings surprises, with the stock down -2.4% year to date. \nGoldman Sachs ( GS ) – Goldman reports the same morning as Citigroup, with the brokerage firm expected earn $3.75 on $8.7 billion in revenues vs. EPS of $3.07 on $7.9 billion in revenues in the year-earlier quarter. As would be expected, the company hasn’t missed EPS estimates for quite some time; the last time they missed was in 2011 Q3. The stock is up a solid +5.3% year to date. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.
