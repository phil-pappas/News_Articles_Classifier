These cases involve several individuals, mostly bankers, government officials and businessmen. \nThe cases are at various stages. But among five that have been concluded, the prosecution has managed to secure conviction on only two cases and in the other three cases, persons involved were acquitted. Analysts predict several challenges that might be behind such failure. \nThe prosecution has a share to the blame as in most decisions given magistrates are pointing out some doubts, which at the end resolved in favour of the accused persons. \nThe challenges could be lack of sufficient training and the interpretation of the law on part of key players in the administration of justice. Money Laundering Act was enacted in Tanzania in 2006, as Act Number 12. \nThe purpose for such enactment was for Tanzania as a country to have the legal framework coming up with provisions for prevention and prohibition of money laundering and also to have provisions for disclosure of information relating to money laundering and suspicious transactions. \nOther purposes were to establish the financial intelligence unit that is central for receiving reports on suspicious transactions but also to establish the national multi disciplinary committee as a sort of supervisory and advisory body for the money laundering scheme. \nHowever, the Act took almost a year for the same to come into force. Furthermore, regulations for the operation of the Act were put in place in 2007. \nBy that time, it is noted that there was no immediate commencement of prosecuting or charging persons with money laundering because the investigative machineries, like the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau and the police, had not been trained on such new law practice. \nIt was until 2009 when the prosecution started instituting money laundering cases and that was after provision of training locally and internationally to a batch of not less than five senior attorneys in Australia, London and in other specialized courses in South Africa. \nThere was also some locally conducted training but involving foreign training firms like Down Ton Hill, a training firm based in London, which had conducted two basic trainings in Dar es Salaam. So you could see the period, we had to scale up the successes. Analysts recommend that more training is needed as it appears the nature of the offences is still new and is the new area for most of legal practitioners. \nProsecutors are saying that they have enough training on the field, but the ball is on the other key players, notably judicial officers. It does not help if one party gets trained but the other party, especially on the decision makers does nothing. \nAnother challenge relates to lack of a comprehensive witness protection scheme, considering the fact that such trials dealing with people who have money and some are prepared to part with portion of their worth in order to do whatever they can do. \nThe other thing which is factual is that the cases involve long proceedings with very big number of witnesses and many exhibits. In some cases you have more than 25 witnesses and more than 30 exhibits. \nSo these are cases that could not be disposed within a short time like simple stealing, armed robbery cases and the reason is simple, due to the nature. Financial transactions would always need you to bring witnesses working in the financial institutions, people who are the victims of the crime. \nMoney laundering is the process of transforming the proceeds of crime into ostensibly legitimate money or other assets. It is also said to be a process of making illegally-gained proceeds that is dirty money, appear legal that is clean. Typically, it involves three steps: placement, layering and integration. First, the illegitimate funds are furtively introduced into the legitimate financial system. \nThen, the money is moved around to create confusion, sometimes by wiring or transferring through numerous accounts. Finally, it is integrated into the financial system through additional transactions until the dirty money appears clean. \nFor the offence of money laundering to be committed, there must be predicate offences, which in some jurisdictions are already criminalized or crimes under other Penal Laws, but are predicated to suit money laundering purpose. For example in Tanzania, there are offences such as forgery and stealing. \nIf you just forge a document without going further and swindling the money and then wait until you convert it into an investment or other proceeds that will remain an ordinary forgery punishable under Section 337 of the Penal Code. But same forgery is a predicate offence to money laundering. \nIt happens that one may forge a document and finally steal money from a bank. The stolen money is deposited into an account and the owner of that account transfers the money to his wife's account. \nIf the wife uses that money to, say build a hotel, then the hotel for that purpose will be the proceeds of crime and the money will have been laundered in that way. So those are the concepts that needed to be well understood by the practitioners.
