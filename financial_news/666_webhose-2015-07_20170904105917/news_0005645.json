Jon Reid Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Debra Cleveland\nFamily relationships can become pretty fraught when a parent dies and their assets are split up. The division is not always fair and often hasn't been planned properly. Another equally difficult situation is when the parent – or anyone in the family – becomes unwell and can no longer handle their finances, and someone else needs to take over.\nWith governments statistics showing only 11 per cent of Australians have a valid enduring power of attorney, most households are obviously unprepared.\nWorse, a new report finds that even when the necessary legal steps have been taken there are still problems.\nAs an example, your mum may have set up an enduring power of attorney naming you as attorney. But when you contact the bank on her behalf, bank staff either can't find a copy of the document (because banks have different ways of storing them) or still need you to complete extra documentation, such as third-party signatory forms.\nThe report, Policies and Practices of Financial Institutions around Substitute Decision-Making , is a collaboration between the University of Western Sydney (UWS), the Cognitive Decline Partnership Centre and the Council on the Ageing NSW. It looked at how banks and credit unions handle powers of attorney and whether these instruments are practical and effective.\nA key problem, it found, was that there is no national register to help verify the authority of a power of attorney. Further, the rules relating to the duties and registration of those holding powers of attorney differ between states and territories.\nIt's at bank branch level that many problems surface, says Sue Field, UWS adjunct fellow in elder law. \"Banks do have policies about powers of attorney, but sometimes it's not filtered down,\" she explains.\n \"There is also no mandatory requirement in NSW to register these powers of attorney unless you're going to engage in property dealing, in which case you've got to register with Land and Property Information.\n\"So the bank has no guarantee that this instrument is the most recent. They can take it at face value but it could have changed.\"\nChoose the right person Choosing the right person to act as your power of attorney is vital, says family and estate lawyer Barbara Campbell of Campbell & Co Lawyers. \"You should only give power of attorney to someone you trust with your life,\" she says.\nAnd, with no offence to men intended, she says, research finds that it tends to be sons, nephews and male relatives who are more likely to \"cheat\" or misuse funds.\nField agrees with the importance of carefully canvassing of who you appoint. \"The first thought most people have is their spouse or one of their kids,\" she says.\n\"But before you even think of who, think about what you want: integrity, geographical availability and financial acumen. If they can't look after their own money, how can they look after yours?\"\nMaking the wrong choice could leave you open to financial abuse and family breakdown.\n\"We may have a skewed view but you're less likely to go to a lawyer paying $500 an hour if you're a happy family – you only come in when things go belly up,\" Field says. \"For example, you may appoint one kid and then the others are not really happy.\"\nThose who don't want – or don't have – family members to act for them should consider a trustee company. Be aware, however, of the costs that can come out of the estate for this service.\nCampbell says older people can be persuaded by those who don't always have their best interests at heart to make them attorney.\nShe cites the case of an elderly woman who had the proceeds of the sale of her home invested with a financial institution. The money was then released, without her agreement, to her brother under a power of attorney. \"Her other three siblings then proceeded to 'lend' the money to themselves,\" says Campbell. \"Years later the woman's daughter, despite being an equal beneficiary in her mother's will, discovered at her mother's funeral an estate with nothing in it, and the matter is still in litigation nearly four years late in the Supreme Court.\nThe other area to watch, she adds, is \"undue influence\" when someone is favoured over other family members. Checks on whether the older person has the capacity to make these decisions (including a geriatrician's evaluation) need to be set in place.\n\"Sometimes it's worth having a family conference to get to know the dynamics,\" Campbell says. \"A recent example occurred when a plan for one of three children to buy out a share of the family home could have lent to the family imploding after the parent's death. Not wanting this to occur, the parents agreed to a full family conference with lawyer and a financial adviser so all best options could be explored. No longer is it the norm to never discuss your will and estate planning with your adult children. I advise older parents to do so.\"\nTraining tool for tellers Commenting on the report, Australian Bankers' Association chief executive Steven Munchenberg says banks have a role in ensuring there are safeguards to aid customers' financial decision-making.\n\"Powers of attorney are important to help protect customers,\" he adds. \"In addition to this substitute decision-making tool, banks have other options, such as two-to-sign accounts, for customers who want to retain their financial independence but need a bit of help.\"\nCapacity Australia, a self-funded charity, champions decision-making autonomy and freedom from abuse and exploitation for people with decision-making disability. It has developed an e-learning tool to help bank staff better understand dementia, financial capacity, supported decision-making, financial abuse and appropriate responses to suspected abuse. CBA and NAB tool trials showed almost 100 per cent improvement in identifying financial abuse risk and what to do about it.\nBoard director Jenna Macnab explains: \"If a teller notices that another person comes in with an elderly customer but does all the talking for them, [the tool] guides them (in a tactful way) to talk to the customer in private instead.\n\"It also provides information on powers of attorney, when to escalate matters to a manager, and using supported decision-making – for example, where a customer appears to be confused they may be supported just by removing them from the formal teller environment to a less noisy place.\"\nIt has been predicted that 1 million people will be living with dementia by 2050. Capacity Australia president Carmelle Peisah says that with this \"tsunami\" ahead it's vital that legal, medical and financial practitioners identify when people can't manage and provide them with help, rather than miss it and unwittingly facilitate elder abuse.\ndcleveland@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter: @ClevelandAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ClevelandAFR", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DEBRACLEVELANDmoney/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/ClevelandAFR"], "published": "2015-07-10T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:09:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
