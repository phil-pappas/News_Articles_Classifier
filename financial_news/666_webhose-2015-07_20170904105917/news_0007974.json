About O'Connor Marketing: http://oconnormarketing.com.au/about-us/ O'Connor Marketing has revealed the key traits which entrepreneurs often share and the steps that help them to run successful businesses: Purpose One of the most important things to do when developing an idea for a business is to answer some questions about why you want to do it. Do you want a business you can run from home, in order to make a bit of extra cash? Or is your aim to establish a multi-million-dollar start-up company that eventually sees you featured on magazine 'Rich Lists'? O'Connor Marketing believes that it is important to figure out whether you want a lifestyle business, which fits your routine, or an equity business, which you could one day list publicly or sell for a major profit. It is also important to decide whether you are doing this for passion or for money. Determining your purpose for starting a business will help you to set achievable goals points out O'Connor Marketing. People Another key characteristic of a successful entrepreneur is that they are surrounded by a team of the right people, who understand the business's vision and provide expertise the founder doesn't have. Planning For a business to be successful, O'Connor Marketing believe that you need to make sure you are selling a good product. The firm says that entrepreneurs need to make prototypes, test them, and be sure people are prepared to pay real money for them. Profit Once it is established that the product works and has a clear target market, entrepreneurs need to make sure the target audience is willing to pay their set price. It is also important to ensure that demand is growing and that the selling point is not simply that you're offering the lowest price points out O'Connor Marketing. Positioning Trust is an extremely important thing to establish in the business world highlights O'Connor Marketing. Customers can be skeptical about new businesses, so you need to demonstrate that you are credible. Businesses also need to make their purchasing processes simple and demonstrate quality customer service. Profile O'Connor Marketing believes that every business should have a social media identity that reflects how they want to be seen and a website that ranks well on Google. Entrepreneurs should also develop their own personal brand to help grow the business.
