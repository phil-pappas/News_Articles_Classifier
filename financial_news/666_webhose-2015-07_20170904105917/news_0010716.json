Ethiopia is, and will remain, deeply grateful for all its aid and assistance. The relationship between the US and Ethiopia is based on mutual benefit and, it should also be based on mutual respect. Given its value, a realistic and accurate evaluation of progress in Ethiopia is in the interests of both countries. \nEthiopia is a strategic partner of the United States in the global war on terrorism. The United States remains among the largest donors to Ethiopia with millions of U.S. foreign aid. U.S. development assistance to Ethiopia focuses on reducing famine vulnerability, hunger, and poverty and emphasizes economic, governance, and social sector policy reforms. Some military training funds, including training in such issues as the laws of war and observance of human rights, also are provided. The visit of the president of the US to Ethiopia will definitely strengthen such long standing relations. Hence it is most welcome. \nOver the last decade, Ethiopia has made tremendous development gains in education, health and food security. In 2014, GDP growth was 10.3 percent. The addition of 38,000 health extension workers has helped reduce the under five child mortality rate by more than six percent a year since 2000. \nTo further the country's progress, the Ethiopian Government has committed itself to a five-year Growth and Transformation Plan and includes sustainably improving rural livelihoods and national food security. U.S. assistance capitalizes on a partnership with the government to increase economic growth with resiliency, deliver quality basic public health and education services and promote a governance environment that is conducive for sustainable economic development. \nThe purpose of the Small Projects Office that was established in 2003 to administer grants for small scale, high impact projects within Ethiopia that foster community development. SPO operates four separate programs: the Ambassador's Special Self Help Program (SSHP), the President's Plan for Emergency Relief Small Grants Program (PEPFAR), the United States African Development Foundation ( USADF) Small Grants Program and Democracy and Human Right programme. \nThe SSHP funds community-initiated projects that support education, income-generating activities, and water/sanitation initiatives, as well as other activities that improve living conditions or increase income. \nThe PEPFAR Small Grants Program funds activities that enable community- and faith-based organizations, as well as organized groups of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), to implement small-scale projects that promote HIV/AIDS prevention and to provide care and support. \nThe Democracy and Human Rights Fund helps finance activities that support democratic institutions, promote political pluralism, and protect and advance human rights. \nThe United States African Development Foundation (USADF) generously reached out to the Small Projects Office in an effort that would contribute to small-business growth in Ethiopia. \nIn the ten years between 2003 and 2012, the Ambassador's Special Self-Help Program, the PEPFAR Small Grants Program, the Democracy and Human Rights Fund and the USADF funds have together granted USD 3,336, 257 to 227 projects that benefited more than 6,361,374 people in all states of Ethiopia. \nProjects supported by SSHP, PEPFAR SG, DHRF and USADF have helped build schools in towns where children were previously unable to attend; provided HIV/AIDS education to vulnerable mentally-challenged young people to prevent further spread of the disease; protected little girls by producing materials that increased awareness and the prevention of female genital mutilation; provided clean water by constructing wells, pit latrines, and clothes-washing facilities; and supported income-generating activities that enabled single women , girls, youth and People living with HIV/AIDS to increase their earnings to sufficiently care for their children. \nU.S. Ambassador to Ethiopia Patricia Haslach praised the technical quality and content of Ethiopia's Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development (CAADP) Policy and Investment Framework and pointed to a future of enhanced U.S. cooperation on agriculture development with the Government of Ethiopia (GoE). She added, \"Ethiopia has made significant progress as evidenced by the support that your country investment plan has generated and by the positive technical review. Now we have to translate this great progress on \"process\" to measurable results for the lives of millions of Ethiopian farmers and pastoralists.\" \nAfter noting that the Growth and Transfo-rmation Plan recognizes the need for a significantly increased role for the private sector (both domestic and foreign) in agriculture, Ambassador Haslach also addressed the pivotal role women will play in achieving Ethiopia's agricultural development ambitions: \"Women are a largely untapped source of growth. We need to develop and implement strategies that increase the opportunity of women to participate in income generation and decision-making._ By investing more in Ethiopia's women, we can leverage their predominant role and ambitions in agriculture, food security, and nutrition.\" \nDuring her visit to Ethiopia, Ambassador Haslach had the opportunity to see agricultural projects receiving support from USAID and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)._ In Mojo, she toured the Luna Abattoir and the Bezabeh Feedlot, both beneficiaries of USAID's Livestock Meat Marketing Program._ Also in Mojo, Ambassador Haslach visited two women-owned small scale dairy operations, supported by USAID's Ethiopia Dairy Development Project and USDA's Feed Enhancement for Ethiopian Development Project. \nFeed the Future is one of President Obama's priority Presidential Development Initiatives, and carries forward the President's pledge made last summer in L'Aquila, Italy for the U.S. to provide $3.5 billion worldwide towards global food security. Ethiopia is one of approximately 20 countries prioritized by the USG for support. \nThe U.S. is the largest donor to Ethiopia's agriculture and food security sector. Over the last five years, the American people have provided over $850 million in development assistance to the sector._ The U.S. commitment to Ethiopian agriculture was recently enhanced by the opening of a USDA Foreign Agriculture Service (FAS) Office at the U.S. Embassy._ FAS will support market linkages, development of animal and plant health systems, and international trade agreements and negotiations. The U.S. also supports Ethiopian agriculture through its contributions to multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and World Food Program, and more recently, through the new Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP). \nObama's Power Africa initiative on geothermal power in Ethiopia \nThe Power Africa Initiative, along with Trade Africa was launched by President Barack Obama following his visit to Africa. Power Africa has secured close to 20 percent of the USD seven billion which is to be available for 20 million Africans in the continent. _Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana, Liberia and Nigeria are the six benefiting countries of Power Africa Initiative. The initiative will help to generate some 10,000 MW of electric power. However, the US is more inclined to assist Ethiopia on geothermal energy sources . \nUS Supports to Ethiopia's Climate Resilient Green Economy Strategy \nThe United States joins Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom in affirming its support for the implementation of Ethiopia's Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy. In joining the partnership, initially announced at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's Conference of the Parties in Lima, Peru in 2014, the United States formally asserts how it will contribute towards the achievement of Ethiopia's aspirations to become a carbon-neutral, middle-income economy by 2025. \nU.S.-Ethiopia trade relations \nEthiopia is currently our 101st _largest goods trading partner with $872 million in total (two way) goods trade during 2013.
