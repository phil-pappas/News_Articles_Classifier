The gold and silver refining business was sold to Asahi Holdings for £124m and the transaction completed in March. \nThe company gave no details of how large the return to shareholders would be, but Johnson Matthey is understood to believe it could make acquisitions totalling up to £300m and still be able to return money from the sales. \nIt is the first time the company has formally mentioned the prospect of a shareholder return, and came as it reported group sales rose 6pc to £797m in the three months to the end of June. Underlying pre-tax profits dipped 1pc to £94m. \nAdjusting for the impact of the sale of the gold and silver refining business, revenue rose 8pc and profit was 1pc higher. \nThe emission control technologies unit - the largest part of Johnson Matthey, which makes catalytic converters - posted a 6pc increase in revenue to £478m over the period. This was ahead of the global car production division, which was flat, and reflects tougher controls on vehicle exhaust emissions imposed by the EU. As a result, the unit sold more of its higher-value catalytic converters. \nLooking ahead, the company said that while it expected full-year results to be slightly ahead of the previous year, it did warn that sterling’s recent strengthening against the dollar and the drop in the price of precious metals could weigh. \nJohnson Matthey posted a pre-tax profit of £440m last year and the company said on Wednesday that foreign exchange rates and metal prices could cause a £10m headwind to its performance this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T16:41:35.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
