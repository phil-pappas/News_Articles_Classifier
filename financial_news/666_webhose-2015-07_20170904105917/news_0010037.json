Lawmakers broadened a bill that would have businesses avoid paying higher taxes on certain gains in value. Gov. Maggie Hassan vetoed it, saying she'd consider the proposal as part of budget negotiations. \nA Planet Fitness spokeswoman recently said the company would like to stay in New Hampshire but is continuing to explore its options. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T18:41:00.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
