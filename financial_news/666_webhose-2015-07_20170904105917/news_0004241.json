Estimates for 2016 were increased to 98 cents from 95 cents per share. \nThe firm reiterated its \"sector perform\" rating and $30 price target on the stock. \nOn July 9, Coty announced it acquired a sub-set of P&G 's ( PG ) beauty portfolio for approximately $12.5 billion. \nWhile the deal will transform Coty into a larger beauty player, the firm sees limited further upside and encourages investors to remain on the sidelines. \n\"We believe that Coty is not being conservative in their synergies estimates and don't see an obvious opportunity for further synergies,\" RBC Capital analysts said. \nCoty is a beauty company that manufactures and markets products in the fragrances, color cosmetics and skin and body care segments, with distribution across both prestige and mass markets. \nShares of Coty are dropping, down 0.40% to $27.49 in morning trading Tuesday.Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates COTY INC as a Hold with a ratings score of C. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate COTY INC (COTY) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its compelling growth in net income, notable return on equity and good cash flow from operations. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including premium valuation and generally higher debt management risk.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Personal Products industry. The net income increased by 129.8% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from -$253.30 million to $75.50 million. The company's current return on equity greatly increased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of significant strength within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Personal Products industry and the overall market, COTY INC's return on equity significantly exceeds that of both the industry average and the S&P 500. COTY INC reported significant earnings per share improvement in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, COTY INC swung to a loss, reporting -$0.26 versus $0.44 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($0.98 versus -$0.26). The debt-to-equity ratio is very high at 7.13 and currently higher than the industry average, implying increased risk associated with the management of debt levels within the company. Even though the debt-to-equity ratio is weak, COTY's quick ratio is somewhat strong at 1.37, demonstrating the ability to handle short-term liquidity needs.
