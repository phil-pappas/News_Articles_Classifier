According to industry sources homewares volume sales declined during the year.\nCompetitive Landscape\nRigolleau led sales within homewares in 2014 recording a value share of 31%. The company is one of the largest glass manufacturers in Argentina and notable for its extensive monopoly in the production and sale of beverageware and dinnerware. In these two areas the company recorded a value share of above 90% in 2014 given negligible local competition and import barriers that limited the supply of foreign products.\nFull Report Details at\n - \nIndustry Prospects\nHomewares has a projected forecast period constant 2014 price value CAGR of 1% with sales set to reach ARS3.5 billion by 2019.
