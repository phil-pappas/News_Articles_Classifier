Apple was valued at about $740 billion as of Thursday's close. \n\"She (Porat) is known to be tough as nails when it comes to expense management and I think the first quarter off the back, she is delivering,\" FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi told Reuters. \"A lot of investors are comforted by the fact that her first quarter as CFO, reporting, she is delivering.\" \nOnline video ads could be a $17 billion opportunity in the United States alone by 2017 and YouTube looks best positioned to benefit, Jefferies & Co analysts wrote in a note. \nGoogle said watch time for YouTube rose 60 percent in the second quarter and the video service roped in more viewers aged 18-49 than any U.S. cable network on mobile alone. \nGoogle and Facebook are trying to woo big companies to market their products via online videos. \nYouTube has an edge over Facebook as it has a more mature monetization platform that seems to attract the best content, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said. \nGoogle said the gap was closing between mobile and desktop \"cost per click\" (CPC), or the average price of online ads. \nMobile CPCs are likely to exceed desktop CPCs in the long term, Munster said. \nGoogle's CPCs fell 11 percent in the quarter but that is not the complete story, Jefferies analysts said. \nYouTube TrueView ads, where advertisers pay only when users don't skip an ad, cost less than traditional search ads. \nGoogle's fast rampup of YouTube monetization is also hurting pricing, they said. \nThe company's advertising revenue rose 11 percent to $16.02 billion. The number of paid clicks increased 18 percent. \n\"This growth has steadily held in the mid-to-high teens since at least Q1:13,\" RBC analyst Mark Mahaney said. \"Such consistency is a rarity, especially for a behemoth business ...\" \nOf 48 analysts covering the stock, 38 have \"buy\" or higher rating, while 10 have \"hold.\" The median price target is $672, according to Thomson Reuters data. \nGoogle's shares were up 15.5 percent at $695.13 in late morning trading on the Nasdaq. Facebook's shares also rose 5 percent to $95.30. \n(Additional reporting by Eileen Soreng in Bengaluru; Editing by Kirti Pandey)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T21:08:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
