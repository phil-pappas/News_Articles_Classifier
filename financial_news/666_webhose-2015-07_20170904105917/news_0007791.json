PUBLISHED: 12:01, Wed, Jul 29, 2015 | UPDATED: 18:09, Wed, Jul 29, 2015 GETTY Peterborough, Cambridgeshire \nCrawley, Newbury, Colchester and Chatham are among the towns where average prices are up to £450,000 cheaper than a property in central London, found Lloyds Bank. Even towns only around 40 minutes away from central London, including Reading, Stevenage, Sidcup and Billericay, give buyers a saving of up to £373,000 on a similar property in London Underground zones 1 and 2. The difference in cost is more than enough to pay for increased travel costs, with an annual rail pass from these areas costing around £3,499 or up to £4,944 for areas further afield. Overall the most affordable commuter towns were found to be Wellingborough and Kettering in Northamptonshire, where average house prices are £160,245 and £177,584 respectively.
