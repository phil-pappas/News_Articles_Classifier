The company earned 19 cents compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 15 cents per share (read: Wall Street Celebrates Amazon Q2: ETFs to Benefit). Moreover, the company swung back to profit from the loss of 27 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues surged 20% year over year to $23.2 billion and were well past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.3 billion. Persistent strength in cloud computing business was the key to its success as cloud computing revenues skyrocketed 81%. As a result, the stock added 9.7% (as of July 29, 2015) since reporting earnings on July 23. Raining Gains from Cloud Computing In any case, cloud computing is a flourishing area in the tech space. Cloud computing is a procedure by which data or software is stored outside of a computer, but can be easily accessed anywhere/any time via the Internet. This process is gaining traction as it can cut IT costs of companies by removing expensive servers and trimming maintenance staff. Goldman Sachs predicted that cloud computing infrastructure and platforms are expected to expand at a 30% CAGR from 2013 to 2018 against 5% increase in the overall enterprise IT, as per Forbes. Research firm IDC projected last year that public IT cloud services spending will surge at a five-year CAGR of 22.8% to over $127 billion in 2018. The growth rate represents the sixth time higher rate than the broader IT market. In 2018, public IT cloud services will make up over 50% of the global software and storage development (read: Behind the Surge in the Cloud Computing ETF).
