The company has reportedly managed to test working transistors using 7nm process technology. This would be the first time a chip maker has managed to achieve such a feat. Usually, the smaller the transistor gate, the better the efficiency of the chip. As a result, reducing it to just 7nm will drastically improve the power to performance ratio of the chipset. \nThe progress made by IBM is in line with Moore’s Law which states the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years. At present, chips are being manufactured using 22nm and 14nm processes. The next step would be 10nm process, but this breakthrough takes things to a whole new level. \nAt 7nm, chips will be much more power efficient than the ones made by larger processes. For example, it is said that IBM’s 10nm technology increases power to performance ratio as much as 50 percent when compared to 14nm process. The new 7nm technology further increases this to 50 percent as compared to IBM’s 10nm process. This kind of tech can boost the efficiency of the chips and increase the battery life of the device in use. As a result, chips manufactured using 7nm process could revolutionize the wearable industry which requires compact chipsets with higher efficiency. For example, smartwatch battery life could get a significant boost with 7nm chips. Sponsored Links \nHowever, IBM notes that it’s not easy to manufacture chips at such a Nano level. For example, 14nm is almost 7000 times smaller than a strand of hair. Then one can only imagine how small 7nm is. Also, a single company cannot make such a breakthrough so fast. It was the result of collaboration between a number of entities including Samsung, IBM Research and GlobalFoundries which made this tech possible. IBM alone has pledged to spend about $3 billion over the coming five years for research aimed at reducing the size of chipsets. \nIBM also notes that it wouldn’t have been possible to manufacture 7nm chips if it continued to work with the conventional materials. The company and its partners had to experiment with different material such as Silicon-Germanium to be able to produce chips at such a scale. They also had to resort to an optical etching tech which uses extreme ultraviolet light. \nAlthough the company has managed to create a working transistor using 7nm, it’s still in the prototype stage and it may take at least a few years for such chips to end up in the market. So, this tech will probably make it to final products only after the 10nm chips have been widely used.
