The state's finances have also been buoyed by more than $7 billion in legal settlements from financial firms, which left the state with a surplus after passing its fifth consecutive on-time budget in April. \nSubway ridership in New York City reached its highest in more than 65 years in April, according to the MTA. Last year, some 5.6 million customers rode the subway on an average weekday, the most since 1949. \nMoody's said its rating reflects the MTA's yet-to-be fully funded $32 billion five-year capital plan and its \"high\" costs for debt and employee retirement benefits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T19:34:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
