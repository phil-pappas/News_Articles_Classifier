It slid further to 63.66 on bouts of dollar demand from importers before quoting at 63.56 at 1201 hours.\nThe local unit moved in a range of 63.66 and 63.56 in morning deals.\nOverseas, the US dollar stayed flat in early Asian trade as the market geared up for a flurry of US data that could bolster expectations that the Fed would lift rates sooner than later.\nMeanwhile, the benchmark Sensex rallied 57.71 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 28,078.58 mid session.\nFor Updates Check Banking & Finance News ; follow us on Facebook and Twitter\nFirst Published on July 2, 2015 12:13 pm", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress", "http://twitter.com/financialxpress"], "published": "2015-07-02T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T09:06:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
