(NYSE Paris:SESG) (LuxX:SESG), one of the world’s leading satellite operators, today announced it has initiated the first-ever live and linear Ultra HD (UHD) trial with cable MSO (Multiple System Operator) Armstrong. Armstrong is testing SES’s camera-to-screen Ultra HD ecosystem at its headquarters cable lab in Butler, Pennsylvania. SES’s Ultra HD offering, first unveiled in April 2015 at the NAB Conference, combines broadcast and IP technologies in a fully-managed, scalable service. The solution leverages satellite’s inherent broadcast advantages and the multicasting capabilities of DOCSIS 3.0, the advanced transmission standard in use by Armstrong and other leading cable systems today. “We have a great long-term partnership with SES that enables us to innovate with satellite-delivered content solutions and provide exciting new potential offerings, said Mike Giobbi, Chief Technology Officer for Armstrong. “We look forward to testing Ultra HD on our cable system and working closely with SES on this exciting solution.” “We are very excited to have Armstrong as the first to test our linear Ultra HD solution in a real-world environment,” noted Steve Corda, Vice President of Business Development for SES in North America. “The outcome of these tests will support progress toward our objective of accelerating the roll-out of linear-live Ultra HD. The roll-out into cable TV households across North America will allow a very cost efficient, scalable and high performance delivery system.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:42:13.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
