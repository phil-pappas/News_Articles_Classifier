The one exception, though, is the US, where British travellers will get 7 per cent fewer US dollars than a year ago, even though the pound has recovered in recent weeks to $1.57. Don’t wipe out the benefits by overpaying for your foreign cash, especially at airport foreign exchange booths. Shop around for the best rate in advance. New research from Consumer Intelligence shows you can get an extra €29 on every £500 you convert by choosing the currency service that offers the most generous exchange rates. Some services will deliver the money to your home if you book online. Consumer Intelligence said that MoneyCorp’s home delivery service currently offers the best rate, converting £500 into almost €691, with FairFX close behind. The Post Office is the most popular place for Britons to buy their travel money but it offered just €680 on £500, according to the mystery shopping exercise. M&S and Travelex also disappointed. If you’re still planning to travel, make sure you take enough cash to see you through your holiday.

The strong pound is good news for those shifting large sums of money abroad to buy a foreign property. Clare Nessling at overseas mortgage specialists Conti said a €200,000 holiday home would cost British buyers £159,363 one year ago, when the pound traded at around €1.25: “Today you would pay £142,857 for a similarly-priced property, a saving of £16,506 on currency rates alone.” Taking stock Stock markets have plunged because of the Greek crisis and other global concerns, such as a share price crash in China and the threat of an interest rate hike in the US. Ordinary investors are increasingly worried about the impact on their stock market-linked savings such as Isas and pensions. Lee Goggin, co-founder of website FindaWealthManager.com, has seen a surge in the number of people seeking expert advice in recent days. “Investors are clearly nervous and looking for security amid markets that are increasingly volatile and difficult to forecast,” he said. He added the number of his site’s users who are genuinely worried has risen by more than 50 per cent in the last month alone. But Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, urged investors to stay calm. “Volatility is an unavoidable part of stock market investing. It is the price investors pay for the long-term outperformance of equities over other assets such as bonds and cash,” he said. Make sure that your money is diversified. Resist trying to time the market by selling up in the expectation that shares will crash further, Stevenson said: “If you do that, you lock in your losses and run the risk of missing out on the recovery.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T10:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T15:31:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
