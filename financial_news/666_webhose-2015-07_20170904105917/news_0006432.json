Also diminishing in importance, to an extent, is online banking on a desktop or laptop computer. But that shift raises big questions, chief among them: are you safe when mobile banking? And what can you do to increase your safety? Those worries gnaw at many of us and are often why we don't bank with a mobile device. Know this: right now most bank security experts agree that mobile banking is safer than online banking, mainly because crooks have had 20 years to bake sophisticated schemes for pilfering via the the online banking channels (in 1994 the Stanford Credit Union in California introduced online banking). But that is changing fast. Crooks follow the same trends we all do. As we shift to mobile banking, so do they - and they are fast at work concocting new breed malware and phishing schemes to separate our login credentials from us. That is why experts insist that now is the time to toughen up our mobile defenses. How? Experts tick off six steps to mobile banking security. *Enable a PIN, said Frederik Mennes, security competence center manager with VASCO Data Security. Note: two in three of us do not, according to research by Consumer Reports . It takes a few seconds to set up a four digit PIN - do it in SETTINGS, in iPhone, also Android - but it is enough to deter all but determined data crackers. Yes, it’s a minor bother when logging in but that bother is a whole lot less than the pain of losing an unprotected phone (and 4.5 million U.S. smartphones were stolen or lost in a recent year, according to Consumer Reports ). Apple’s TouchID, by the way, where a fingerprint stands in for a PIN, is an adequate substitute, said most experts. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:43:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
