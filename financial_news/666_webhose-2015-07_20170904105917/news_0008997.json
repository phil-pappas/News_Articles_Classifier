Michele Mossop by Matthew Smith When Kerr Nielson's former wife walked down the street in Beijing this week she was stopped and asked when the Chinese sharemarket was going to rebound.\nChinese locals are accustomed to seeing Judith Nielson, a noted arts philanthropist, with Kerr, the billionaire funds manager and owner of Platinum International. He would be there visiting Chinese companies where he now invests around a quarter of the $25 billion he manages; she would be scouting pieces to populate her contemporary Asian art gallery, White Rabbit Gallery, in Sydney's inner suburbs.\nKerr Neilson had been telling many of his local friends in China last year the market would go up, which is why he's been heavily invested in China shares now for some time. Through Platinum's International and Asia funds Kerr lays claim to the biggest investor in Greater China with roughly $6 billion through the Hong Kong (H Shares) market, the local Chinese (A Shares) market, and in Chinese companies listed on the NASDAQ in the United States.\n\"They think I'm a wizard,\" Neilson tells AFR Weekend from his base in Sydney, referring to the reputation he has among China locals.\nBut as quickly as the market rose it suddenly fell â€“ hence why Chinese locals are suddenly seeking share tips from his former wife. When will they start making money out of the sharemarket? When will it start going up again?\n\"This was supposed to be the time when the little guy came good,\" says Neilson in his first interview since this week's China meltdown. Chinese who didn't make money during the country's property boom had thought that the sharemarket would offer a pathway to riches.\n\"The people who were weren't connected and who weren't in the know when everyone was making money out of property thought this was their chance,\" he says.\n\"The lollipop was snapped away for a lot of people.\"\n Neilson is the largest investor among a small group of Australian firms betting on China directly through the China A shares market. Another major fund is AMP Capital's China Growth Fund.\nNeilson and Patrick Ho, AMP Capital's China Fund's portfolio manager, are the two people with more skin in the game in Chinese equities than anyone else in Australia. And despite this week's wild market ride, they are still two of the biggest China bulls.\nOn Friday, AMP disclosed that 22 out of the 78 stocks or 15 per cent of the underlying investment portfolio by value held in the fund had been suspended.\nDespite this fallout Ho remains optimistic on the future of the mainland China sharemarket and predicts it will regain much of this week's losses during the second half of this year.\nNeilson too is expecting prices to come back but he's less willing to put a time frame on the recovery.\n\"The situation could fray further,\" says Neilson, who adds that he is a buyer and not a seller of Chinese companies, both on mainland China and overseas exchanges\nHe thinks the government may have lost its cool when it sponsored brokerage firms to buy shares to prop up prices. But he's still happy to own China-listed consumer companies including white goods and drinks manufacturers and distributors, which look cheap now based on the future earnings potential.\n\"The nature of the government's intervention will have suppressed [investor] enthusiasm but you can't deny the potential growth of these companies,\" he says.\nNeilson explained the real economic effect of the Chinese government's poorly managed sharemarket experiment as likely to delay the country's economic transition.\nBecause of the limited share ownership within Chinese households compared to Australia and other developed markets, Neilson and other investors who are familiar with the region believe the sharemarket rout has a limited affect on the broader economy.\n\"This is still a system going through a massive transition, if anything what's happened here is the government has just overplayed its book.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:51:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
