A trial could begin as soon as Feb. 1, 2016.\nRakoff dismissed some claims related to Petrobras bonds issued in 2012 and some claims based on non-U.S. transactions, and also said some claims should be arbitrated.\nHe said he will explain the legal reasoning behind his decision, which is dated Thursday, \"in due course.\"\nIn a statement, Petrobras said it would \"continue working firmly in defense of its rights.\"\nShareholders led by England's Universities Superannuation Scheme Ltd alleged that Petrobras, whose formal name is Petroleo Brasileiro SA, artificially inflated the value of its securities by overstating the value of major assets.\nThe decision comes as Brazilian prosecutors pursue the largest corruption investigation in the country's history, focusing on what authorities have said was a years-long scheme involving bribery, price-fixing and political kickbacks.\nSome of Brazil's most powerful executives have been accused of overcharging Petrobras while bribing politicians, mostly those affiliated with President Dilma Rousseff's Workers' Party.\nIn seeking to dismiss the investor lawsuit, lawyers for Petrobras had argued that the company was itself a victim, and not accountable for the wrongful actions of a few individuals.\nThe investors' lawyers countered that the \"unprecedented\" scope of the corruption made it impossible to believe Petrobras executives were ignorant.\nJeremy Lieberman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at the law firm Pomerantz, said he was pleased with the decision.\n\"We look forward to aggressively litigating our case and working to achieve a substantial recovery for harmed shareholders - the true victims of defendants' fraud,\" he said in an email.\nThe case is In re: Petrobras Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-09662.
