Rob Homer by Jill Margo Frank Lowy lay seriously ill in Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital. It was June 2011. The Westfield chairman had early bile duct cancer and had just undergone a brutal operation to prevent it developing into pancreatic cancer.\nBut recovery was not the only thing on his mind. In just four weeks he had a long-standing arrangement for mediation with the Australian Taxation Office.\nThis was over $68 million that had been held in a Liechtenstein foundation and had been donated for the benefit of Israeli charities.\nAged 80, Lowy had just had a Whipple, an operation that involves the removal of the head of the pancreas, the duodenum, a portion of the common bile duct, the gall bladder and sometimes part of the stomach.\nThree weeks after the operation, when he was finally given solid food, he took heart at his recovery and persuaded the doctors to discharge him.\nThis was not the first time the Lowys and the ATO had been involved in a tax dispute. They had settled an earlier matter for $25 million. There was speculation in the media this new issue was connected to the previous one.\nIn 2008 there had been scorching international publicity as the Lowys were investigated by a US Senate subcommittee. And the issue been subject to investigations by US tax authorities, as well as the ATO in Australia. In Australia it was decided mediation would be the best way to deal with the matter and a hearing was set for late July.\nDeclined advice to postpone When he fell ill, Lowy declined advice to postpone it. \"So what if I'm sick?\" he said. \"This is not going to kill me. If anything kills me it will be the illness. I don't want to leave this issue unresolved.\"\nA hotel suite was booked for two days, so the Westfield chief could get rest during breaks in the mediation.\nThe Liechtenstein foundation was a hybrid, a round peg that did not fit the square holes of Australian tax law. One set of Australian laws applies to foreign companies and another to foreign trusts. But such foundations contained a mix of features from both.\nThe ATO conceded this in an earlier submission to a US Senate inquiry, noting it had encountered difficulties in applying Australian taxation laws to non-common law entities such as Liechtenstein foundations.\nNovel legal issues, not subject previously to any judicial determination, were raised. The lawyers for Lowy and the ATO debated the matter but could not persuade each other of their positions.\nThey did, however, agree on the question of penalties, there being no suggestion of intentional disregard of the law.\n\"I had to make a decision,\" Lowy said. \"Fight this case all the way to the High Court on a matter for which there was no precedent, or without admission accept the figure arrived at through the process of mediation.\"\nDecided to accept He decided to accept and pay another settlement – which included tax, penalties and interest and was subject to confidentiality.\nWhen asked why he accepted, Lowy said it was a pragmatic decision. \"Litigation is a waste of human and material resources and over a long period it becomes destructive in every aspect.\n\"Given my illness, I didn't know how long I had. So I wanted my affairs to be clear of this issue and having regard to our family's financial position, I felt it was worth compromising.\"\nWith the documentation complete, Lowy celebrated by going back to bed.\nA month later, he opened an email to find good news. His medical results had been sent to Harvard and Stanford for assessment and there was a note giving him a clean bill of health.\nAnd in due course he got some other good news – nothing came of the two US inquiries.\nFrank Lowy's annus horribilis, SMH Good Weekend, today\nHow Lowy got Westfield into the heart of New York, AFR Monday", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T08:18:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
