Photo: Supplied\nReal estate agency Oliver Hume has consolidated its move into developing apartments by purchasing a large West Melbourne site for $18 million.\nThe agency, known for its strong geographic spread on Australia's east coast, where it specialises in greenfield and apartment sales, snapped up the home of Don Kyatt Automobiles, occupied by the four-wheel-drive and commercial spare parts specialists for 26 years.\nThe 3600-square-metre land holding on the corner of Roden and Adderley streets will be Oliver Hume's second project in the immediate area.\nBuilders Hacer are midway through construction of the group's 12-level \"Nord\" apartment on Flemington Road, a 143-unit complex designed by Hayball architects.\nOliver Hume development manager Rowan Pollard said the firm's 10-year old property fund arm would develop the project in a syndicate arrangement with investors.\nThe fund has developed other apartment projects in Parkville, Cheltenham and Brisbane.\nThe site had no permit and the group was assessing options of up to 200 apartments, he said.\nCBRE's Tom Tuxworth​, Mark Wizel​ and Josh Rutman​ negotiated the Adderley Street sale.\nMr Tuxworth said developers were moving into West Melbourne driven by an oversupply of projects in the CBD.\n\"The medium house price of West Melbourne is $980,000 so the $500,000 apartment market is seen as a genuine alternative for developers,\" Mr Tuxworth said.\nThe face of the former industrial suburb has been rapidly changing.\nA Chinese developer in April paid $12.1 million for a 1273-square-metre site at 33-37 Dudley Street, which currently houses the Greg Chappell Cricket Centre and an UltraTune service centre.\nAnother single-storey warehouse with major development potential on the corner of Roden and Spencer streets currently used by Rose Office Furniture is in the final stages of selling.\nFurther along Spencer Street, at number 409, another corner development site occupied by Spencer St Automobiles is about to come on the market through CBRE.\nAnd at 50-56 Batman Street, Fitzroys is managing the sale of another development site expected to fetch more than $11 million.\nProminent developers such as Tim Gurner​ and Vicland's Bill McNee​ have also targeted the area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T22:11:34.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
