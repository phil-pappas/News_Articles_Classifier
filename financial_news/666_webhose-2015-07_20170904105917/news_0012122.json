April’s gain was revised to 187,000 from a previously reported 221,000, indicating weaker job creation than initially thought.\nThe unemployment rate fell to 5.3% in June, compared to 5.5% the prior month. The rate is the lowest since April 2008.\nAt 3.31pm, the benchmark R186 was bid at 8.245% and offered at 8.235% from Wednesday’s close of 8.260%.\nThe middle-dated R207 was bid at 7.730% and offered at 7.720% from a close of 7.770% previously.\nThe rand was at R12.2587, from a weakest level of R12.3579 on the day and a previous close of R12.2540.\nThe euro was at $1.1086 from a previous close of $1.1054.\nTraders said it was mainly local buying that was supporting the bond market at present.\n\"Local participants bought R1.3bn on Wednesday and foreign participants sold R665m of South African paper,\" Barclays Research said in a note.\nMarket participants are also keeping an eye on the latest Greece debt developments for further market direction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T17:52:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
