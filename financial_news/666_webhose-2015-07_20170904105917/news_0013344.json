[USD/] \nA robust dollar often weighs on commodities as raw materials such as oil, traded in the U.S. currency, become less affordable for users of the euro. \nOn the oil products front, gasoline pared early gains while diesel turned negative, weighing further on the sentiment in crude. \nThe front-month contracts in gasoline and diesel futures, set to expire on Friday, dominated activity on the petroleum complex, traders and brokers said. \nGasoline (RBc1) was up 0.2 percent after rallying 1.2 percent earlier on the strength of Wednesday's U.S. government data showing demand for the fuel rose over 6 percent from a year ago. Ultra low sulphur diesel (HOc1) was down by a touch after rising 1 percent earlier. \n\"With the products expiration tomorrow, the cash markets around the Gulf Coast and New York Harbor are well supplied,\" causing gasoline and diesel to come off their highs, said Donald Morton, trader at Connecticut-based Herbert J. Sims & Co. \n(Additional reporting by Christopher Johnson in London and Keith Wallis in Singapore; Editing by Dale Hudson and Meredith Mazzilli)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T21:30:46.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
