Mallzee's existing investors, Scottish Investment bank, Par Equity, and angels Gareth Williams, CEO of Skyscanner, and serial investor Rob Dobson also participated. \nThe deal follows two months of negotiations for Mallzee founder Cally Russell, 27. \"We set out to raise £1m but there was significant interest in the round, so we settled on £2.5m,\" he said. \nCally Russell, 27, founded Mallzee in 2013 \nThe deal also represents a significant increase in valuation from earlier this year, when Mallzee appeared on Dragons' Den, Mr Russell claimed. \nIn February, he was shown pitching for £75,000 on the hit BBC show in exchange for 5pc of the business. \nPeter Jones offered him the full amount in exchange for 15pc of the company, after telling the young founder that Mallzee was \"either a £100m business or nothing\". \n\"I'm glad I walked away from the deal,\" said Mr Russell. \"We were given such a small valuation then. If you look at the money we've raised just now, it's a much better deal. \n\"Peter Jones gave me the confidence to aim high,\" he added. \"We said we could be a £100m business and we're well on the way to proving him right.\" \nMallzee, which allows users to swipe through more than a million products from 150 retailers, has two apps, targeting the UK and US. At present 75pc of users are based in the UK. \nRoyal Mail has claimed that investing in the start-up will help it to tap into \"high-growth revenue streams up the value chain\". \n\"It helps align the business with the rapid growth in consumer purchases made from mobile devices and developments in shopping apps,\" the postal group said. \n37pc of UK online shoppers used a mobile device to make an e-commerce purchase in the last three months and shopping apps are the fastest growing app category. \nRoyal Mail's Nick Landon will take a seat on Mallzee's board as part of the terms of the deal. \n\"He's a switched on guy who understands the space,\" said Mr Russell. \"We're a middleman so we don't deliver items direct but delivery is a hugely important part of the process.\" \nMr Russell would not confirm if Royal Mail would be developing a bespoke logistics product for Mallzee. \"We'll have to wait and see on the detail,\" he said. \nHowever, Mr Landon said that Royal Mail can \"rapidly add significant value\" to the Mallzee business by introducing the app to a wider audience. \nMallzee takes a small commission from each sale and also generates recurring revenue by charging retailers to be featured in the app. \n\"We're still pre-profit but we're pretty damn close now,\" said Mr Russell. \"We expect to be in profit in the second quarter of next year.\" \nThe business currently generates \"hundreds of thousands of pounds\" in revenue, he claimed. \nTo hit its 1 million user target, Mallzee will be doubling its staff from 15 to 30 by the end of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T16:36:27.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
