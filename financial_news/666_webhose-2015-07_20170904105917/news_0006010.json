A massive plunge on China's mainland share market, and a mixed response to government measures to stem the falls, is adding to the wild ride. The trend continues on Tuesday, with the Australian market rallying after Eurozone leaders finally struck a deal on a third bailout for debt-stricken Greece. Although the new Greek deal reduces the risk of a \"Grexit\", the country's financial crisis remains a significant issue, IG market strategist Evan Lucas said. \"The deal has several very tough days and weeks ahead,\" he said. The Greek debt negotiations and China's share market crisis have not only caused extreme caution, they have also dented consumer confidence. \"As long as uncertainty and fear rule, the rollercoaster ride will continue for Australian investors,\" Prof Fang said. Turmoil on China's market will have a longer-lasting effect on local shares than the turmoil in Greece, he said. \"Both are bad news for Australian investors, but China is our biggest trading partner and its growth is closely tied to our commodity prospects, so it's the one to watch.\" But Prof Fang and other market watchers say there is no need to panic. David Bryant, the chief executive of Australian Unity Investments, has said these global events are unlikely to be as significant as they currently appear.
