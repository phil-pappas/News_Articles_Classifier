Photo: Reuters\nChina's recent stock market meltdown could lead to - or be the result of - underlying economic weakness that would have serious repercussions for exporting nations, including Australia, according to one of Morgan Stanley Investment Management's most senior portfolio managers.\nAndrew Harmstone, who oversees about $US5.4 billion through funds under the US investment house's global balanced risk strategy, says if the hit to wealth from the recent trillion dollar equity sell-off were to scuttle Beijing's plans to turn China from an export-driven to a consumption-focused economy, there could be \"significant implications for the rest of the world\".\nThe same was true if the sharp market correction were triggered by investor concerns about the real health of the Chinese economy, which was also possible.\nAustralia, as China's biggest supplier of iron ore and coal, would be in the firing line, he said.\n\"If indeed the Chinese economy is slowing, and if consumption drops because of the wealth effect, this could have implications for developed markets,\" he said.\n\"It clearly has implications for developing markets that are exporting to China and also to developed markets like Canada and Australia.\"\nAlthough stressing his faith in the Chinese government's economic management, Mr Harmstone said the recent stock market turmoil exposed the limits to what Beijing could do to control risk events.\nDespite a concerted effort by the central bank and government to ease monetary policy, control equity sales and limit new stock issues, the Shanghai market lost nearly 25 per cent of its value in one month.\nIt has settled in recent days, but the event rattled professional investors around the world.\n\"Usually when the government signals and then takes action like that it actually has a reaction,\" Mr Harmstone said.\n\"However, this time it didn't.\n\"This was the first time that I'd felt that the government was not going to be able to control things.\"\nHis comments add to a growing list of warnings about the build-up of risk in the world's second-biggest economy.\nCredit Suisse said in a research note this week that the combination of a \"credit bubble, property bubble and investment bubble\" in China \"remains the biggest risk to the global economy\".\n\"A Chinese hard landing still remains the biggest long-term macro risk that we see globally,\" the bank said.\nMr Harmstone said he was yet to scrutinise China's second-quarter national accounts, which showed year-on-year gross domestic product growth in line with government targets of 7 per cent.\nHowever, given deflationary pressures in the country, nominal GDP - before inflation - of 5.8 per cent might be closer to reality, he said.\nCredit Suisse says in its note that GDP growth below 3 per cent \"would make us bearish on global growth\".\nIf China was slowing quicker than thought outside the country, few exporters would be spared the fall-out, Mr Harmstone said.\n\"If this was contained in China, than that would be fine,\" he said.\n\"But we also know that 30 per cent of Apple's sales are in China.\n\"In fact, when Chinese equities were going down, Apple was going down.\"\nHe said everyone from European carmakers and luxury goods exporters to bulk commodity giants such as Australia would be affected.\n\"The Chinese economy is very big,\" he said.\n\"If there is a significant dislocation - I'm not saying there is - it could have significant implications for the rest of the world.\"\nHe said assuming no hard landing in China, however, commodity prices appeared to be stabilising, meaning exchange-traded commodities, resource companies and similar investment instruments represented good value at the moment.\n\"Again, the caveat there is the Chinese situation,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/china_dilemma_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T05:45:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
