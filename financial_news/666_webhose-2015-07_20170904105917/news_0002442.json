The study of economics is largely based around the concept of scarcity but these two authors look at the subject through a different lens' commented the video creator today.\nThis book brings the reader on a logical journey to understand that there is a far reaching scarcity mentality which exerts a band with tax on thinking. This affects all areas of the brain.\nThe video explains that many people use a statue of Saint Joseph to help sell a house as per an age old tradition. The house seller is supposed to bury the statue upside down in the front garden of the house to be sold. There are numerous reports of surprised and delighted house sellers who tried out this ritual.\nMany successful house sellers report an upswing in other areas of their life once the statue sells the house. They question of this is mere coincidence or is related to the small statue.\nThe answer to this question lies in the book Scarcity according to the new video. Scarcity in any area of life exerts a band with tax on all areas of thinking. This tax has a very negative effect on thinking. Worry over not selling a house is a form of scarcity and spills over into all other areas of life and thinking.\nThe tax on thinking is lifted once the house sells which is possibly the explanation for the general turn in good fortune which many people notice.\nThe short video is hosted on a Youtube channel dedicated to research into the Saint Joseph statue tradition.\nAbout Pearl Consultancy Lifestyle\nPearl Consultancy Lifestyle is an online all female lifestyle consultancy company.
