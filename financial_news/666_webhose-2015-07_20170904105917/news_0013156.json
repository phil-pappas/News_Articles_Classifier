Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Clancy Yeates One of the country's biggest mortgage brokers, Mortgage Choice, says the clampdown on lending to landlords has dragged property investors' share of its loan approvals to a 20-month low.\nIn a sign banks' tighter credit standards are having some impact, Mortgage Choice says the proportion of its loan approvals going to property investors fell from 34 per cent in May to 30 per cent in June, the lowest share since late 2013.\n\"It's a 12 per cent reduction in investor loans in a very, very short period of time,\" chief executive John Flavell said.\nWhile there have not been official figures yet confirming this trend, Mr Flavell said it was the first data pointing to a slowdown in investor lending triggered by banks' tougher credit policies.\nAll of the large banks unveiled measures to rein in investor lending in May, including cutting interest rate discounts. Mr Flavell said changes to credit policies were having the biggest impact.\nIn particular, he said some first-home buyers trying to enter the market as property investors were finding it harder to get credit from banks under the new lending criteria.\n\"The pricing is less impactful, but the policy pieces have just knocked them out left, right and centre,\" Mr Flavell said.\nChanges introduced by banks in recent months include caps on loan-to-valuation ratios for investor borrowers and tougher rules for assessing borrowers' incomes and their sensitivity to higher interest rates.\n These have been made in response to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority demanding banks slow growth in the stock of all outstanding housing investor loans to less than 10 per cent a year, compared with the current pace of 10.4 per cent.\nMr Flavell said it was not clear it APRA's target would be met, but the lending policy changes hit hardest first-home buyers who were also investors, because they tended to have less equity and lower incomes than more-established property investors.\n\"It doesn't knock out the foreign investor. It doesn't knock out middle-aged, middle Australia with heaps of equity access and excess income and high tax. It knocks out the people who are trying to get in,\" he said.\nThe figures from Mortgage Choice are a tentative sign of slowing in lending to property investors, who have been driving the boom in house prices in Sydney and to a lesser extent Melbourne.\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics will publish figures this week on loan approvals for May and economists are expecting them to reveal a slowdown in new lending. Bloomberg says the median market economist forecast is for a 3 per cent fall in the number of loans to owner-occupiers.\nJPMorgan economist Ben Jarman said for banks to comply with APRA's 10 per cent-a-year speed limit for total housing investor credit growth the rate of new lending to investors would need to fall back \"quite a lot\".\nThis is because credit growth – APRA's target – is a function of both new lending and the repayment of debt. Much of the recent lending to investors has been in the form of interest-only loans, which tend to be paid off more slowly.\n\"To slow the overall rate of credit growth you should have to have a noticeable pullback in the flow of new lending,\" Mr Jarman said.\nANZ Bank economist David Cannington said investor credit growth appeared to be hitting a plateau near the 10 per cent-a-year cap imposed by APRA.\n\"Lending institutions have basically got the message that APRA are looking to target investment loan growth at 10 per cent and they are actively trying to make sure that they don't significantly breach that limit,\" he said.\nThe clampdown on investors comes as more first-home buyers are entering the property market as landlords, which can make property ownership more affordable because of tax breaks.\nMr Flavell said about a fifth of Mortgage Choice's investor clients were first-home buyers.\nAmid soaring prices in Sydney and Melbourne a federal parliamentary inquiry is being held into home ownership.\nBut Mr Flavell said that at the same time as the inquiry was being held lending policy changes introduced in response to APRA's cap had made it harder for many first-home buyers who were also investors to enter the market.\nHe also highlighted the federal government's decision to abolish first-home saver accounts – a scheme that provided people saving for a deposit with tax breaks and co-contributions from government.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117021518580315645042", "https://twitter.com/clancyyeates"], "published": "2015-07-05T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:10:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
