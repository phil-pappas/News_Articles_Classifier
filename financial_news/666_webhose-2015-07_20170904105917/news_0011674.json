At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Please note this call is being recorded. \nFor opening remarks and introductions, I will now turn the call over to Vic Allgeier, TTC. Please go ahead. \n\nVic Allgeier, FARO Technologies, Inc. - Investor Relations, President and CEO of TTC Group [2] \n\nThank you and good morning, everyone.

Our reported sales for the second quarter of 2015 were $83.8 million, an increase of $1.7 million or 2% compared to $82.1 million for the second quarter of 2014. Excluding approximately $8.4 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, primarily from the Euro and Yen, relative to the US dollar, our second quarter 2015 year-over-year sales growth would have been 12%. \nThe Americas delivered a strong second quarter 2015 with year-over-year sales growth of 18% despite continued economic weakness in Brazil. The Focus Laser Scanner product reported 18% unit sales growth globally over the same quarter last year. And Laser Line Probe and Arm accessory continue in sales momentum with year-over-year unit sales growth of 31%. Macroeconomic industrial sluggishness continued to cast a headwind against metrology sales in Asia, especially China and Japan. Our sales in China increased $2.7 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year mostly driven by lower metrology sales in automotive. \nTurning to product and service sales. In the second quarter of 2015, product sales were $69.4 million, an increase of $2.0 million or 3% compared to $67.4 million in the second quarter of 2014. Excluding approximately $6.8 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, second quarter 2015 year-over-year product sales growth would have been 13%. The Americas delivered strong year-over-year product sales growth of 21%. In the quarter, sales through distribution represented 12.7% of total sales with Focus Laser Scanner sales mix to distributors increasing to 56.2%. In the second quarter of 2015, service revenue was $14.4 million, a decrease of $0.3 million or 2% compared to $14.7 million in the prior-year period. Excluding approximately $1.6 million of FX headwinds, second quarter 2015 year-over-year service revenue growth would have been 8%. \nTurning to sales by region. In the Americas, sales in the second quarter were $39.0 million, an increase of $6.1 million or 18% compared to $32.9 million in the second quarter of 2014. Excluding approximately $0.9 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, the Americas year-over-year sales growth would have been 21%. This increase was driven by unit sales growth across all major product lines highlighted by a strong 37% increase in Focus Laser Scanner units sold and a 34% increase in Laser Line Probe units sold compared to second quarter last year. \nIn Europe, sales in the second quarter were $26.5 million, a decrease of $2.4 million or 8% compared to $28.9 million in the second quarter of 2014. Excluding the negative impact of approximately $6.1 million due to the Euro exchange rate, Europe's year-over-year sales growth would have been almost 13%. The Europe team delivered a 56% increase in Laser Line Probe units sold over the prior-year quarter and drove strong demand for the recently introduced FARO Freestyle. \nIn Asia, sales in the second quarter were $18.3 million, a decrease of $1.9 million or 9% compared to $20.2 million in the second quarter of 2014. Excluding the negative impact of approximately $1.4 million in foreign exchange rate driven mostly from the Yen, Asia's year-over-year sales decline would have been 3%. The sales decrease was primarily driven by a decline in China sales of $2.7 million following a slowdown in automotive-related metrology sales. As a positive sign in the second quarter, Asia reported a 20% year-over-year increase in Focus Laser Scanner units sold. \nTurning to orders. New order bookings in the quarter were $83.8 million, relatively unchanged from second quarter of 2014. Excluding approximately $8.4 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, year-over-year growth in new order bookings would have been 10%. Second quarter 2015 reported results represent a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0, which is consistent with our long-term growth model. \nTurning to gross margin. Gross margin of 53.2% [increased] 2.3 percentage points compared to 55.5% in the prior-year period. Product margin of 57.5%, down 3.3 percentage points from the same quarter last year, [increased] overall gross margin by 2.5 percentage points. The decrease in product margin was mostly driven by higher manufacturing cost and a lower Focus Laser Scanner average selling price from product and channel mix, offset partly by higher Arm average selling price. Gross margin from service revenue in the second quarter of 2015 was 32.4%, up 1.6 percentage points from the prior-year period and increased overall gross margin by 0.2 percentage points, mainly due to lower customer service costs. \nTurning to operating expenses. Selling and marketing expenses in the second quarter of 2015 were $20.1 million or 23.9% of sales, compared to $19.7 million or 24.0% of sales in the second quarter of 2014. This increase of $0.4 million or 2% is mostly related to higher marketing headcount to support our vertical market strategy. General and administrative expenses increased by $0.2 million or 2% to $9.1 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $8.9 million in the same period last year and remained unchanged at 10.8% of sales. The increase of $0.2 million is mainly due to severance expenses from cost reduction actions offset partly by deliberate spending reductions to mitigate severance impact. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $2.7 million or 3.3% of sales in the quarter, up $0.8 million from second quarter 2014, primarily due to the opening of the Exton facility and startup of our ERP system. Research and development expenses in the second quarter were $7.3 million or 8.7% of sales compared to $6.7 million or 8.1% of sales in the same period last year. The increase of $0.6 million or 9% is mainly related to higher headcount and an impairment charge relating to discontinuing certain licensing agreements. \nTurning to profitability. Operating income in the second quarter of 2015 was $5.4 million, a decrease of $3.0 million compared to the second quarter of 2014. This decrease was driven by a $1.0 million decline in gross profit mainly due to a lower gross margin and an increase of $2.0 million in operating expenses. \nIncome tax expense in the second quarter of 2015 was $1.2 million compared to an expense of $2.3 million in the same period last year. This decrease of $1.1 million relates primarily to lower pretax income and a decrease in our effective tax rate to 22.7% compared to 26.2% in the same period last year. Net income decreased to $4.1 million or $0.24 per share in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $6.3 million or $0.36 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact of a total of $1.5 million in severance expense and a write-off of a license related to the Company's Imager product, net income in the second quarter of 2015 would have been $5.6 million or $0.32 per share. \nI will now briefly discuss a few balance sheet items. Cash and short-term investments were $155.6 million at the end of second quarter of 2015 compared to $174.3 million as of December 31, 2014. The decreased to $18.7 million was primarily due to closing two acquisitions with a total cash payment $12.0 million and a $6.1 million in capital expenditures. Accounts receivable was $70.0 million at the end of second quarter of 2015 compared to $84 million as of December 31, 2014. Day sales outstanding increased to 76 days at the end of second quarter 2015 from 74 days as of December 31, 2014 mostly due to lower prepayments for the decrease in China sales. Inventories totaled [$90.9 million] at the end of second quarter 2015 compared to $80.0 million as of December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily related to lower-than-expected ended quarter sales, increase in raw materials and finished goods by a total of $7.0 million. Demonstration inventory was up $2.5 million mostly on higher account manager headcount and new products, while service inventory was up $1.4 million on new products and growth in our installed base. \nFinally, I'll conclude with headcount numbers. We had 1,350 employees at the end of second quarter 2015, representing a year-over-year increase of 212 employees or 19%. Geographically, we have 515 employees in the Americas, 527 in Europe, 308 in Asia. Account manager headcount increased by 26 or 12% to 248 at the end of second quarter 2015. In the Americas, account managers increased by nine or 11% to 89. In Europe, account managers increased by 14 or 21% to 82. In Asia, account managers increased by three or 4% to 77. \nI will now hand the call over to Jay for his comments. \n\nJay Freeland, FARO Technologies, Inc. - President, CEO & Director [4] \n\nThanks, Bob and good morning everybody. Before we get started, I would like to highlight to the rest of the group that our new CFO, Laura Murphy is on the phone today. I am not throwing her into the fire to have her discuss any of the results or take Q&A, but I did want to give her a chance to introduce herself to the group. \nSo Laura? \nLaura Murphy, FARO Technologies, Inc. - SVP & CFO [5] \n\nYes. Thank you. Good morning everybody. I'm very excited to be joining the FARO team and look forward to having a chance to talk with many of you. \n\nJay Freeland, FARO Technologies, Inc. - President, CEO & Director [6] \n\nAll right. Thanks, Laura. As we get started, I apologize to everybody, I have managed to pick up laryngitis, so please bear with me as I go through the script today. Our second quarter sales growth of 12% though, excluding foreign currency, represents a nice recovery from the first quarter, it's close to our long-term mid-teens growth model. The Americas highlighted the recovery with strong 18% sales growth after 3% last quarter. Asia continued to be impacted by weaker capital spending, mostly within China and Japan. \nIn the quarter, we executed on cost reduction actions to proactively take out cost to the business, given the current market headwinds. Our second quarter sales recovery and the deliberate cost management increased EPS from $0.04 per share in the first quarter to a reported EPS of $0.24 per share in the second quarter. And if you exclude $1.5 million in severance expense and a license write-off related to the Imager product, second quarter EPS would have been $0.32 per share, or slightly below prior year. \nThe Americas achieved 18% sales growth by delivering unit sales growth across all major products. As a direct result of proactive marketing initiatives, the Americas team delivered outstanding year-over-year unit sold growth of 37% for the Focus Laser Scanner and 34% for the Laser Line Probe. \nIn Europe, our second quarter sales grew almost 13% excluding foreign currency, slightly below last quarter's 16% growth rate excluding FX. On the laser tracker, unit sales were down on weaker automotive demand and Swiss manufacturers facing a less favorable export environment. The Europe team marketed the superior technology of the Laser Line Probe to deliver 56% year-over-year growth in units sold. \nAsia continued to encounter challenging macroeconomic conditions causing capital spending delays and cancellations, especially in China and Japan. Our second quarter 2015 sales in China decreased $2.7 million from the second quarter last year, mostly driven by lower sales into automotive. With China new vehicle inventory increasing, light vehicle production growth rates have slowed to near zero which directly impacts the capital spending behavior of our automotive customers. Despite the weak macro economy, Asia Focus Laser Scanner units sold posted 20% year-over-year growth in the second quarter of 2015. \nSales growth for metrology remains relatively soft. Our industrial manufacturing customers in the automotive, aerospace, and machining verticals, especially in Asia, are hesitating on capital spending for productivity improvement, given uncertain global business conditions. Leasing demos remain high but manufacturers are taking longer to complete their purchasing decisions. As a result, Arm units sold growth were down 6% in the quarter versus last year and laser tracker units sold were down 10%. \nIn times of soft capital spending, it becomes even more critical to provide the customer with a clear intangible return on investment via technology and price. Our strong R&D reinvestment enables FARO to be the market leader in technology and price. For instance, our latest generation, Laser Line Probe, sets the standard in the ScanArm market. In the second quarter, Laser Line Probe units sold increased 31% year-over-year globally, demonstrating how our commitment to R&D drives sales growth. \nOur technical advantage and disruptive price also drove 3D documentation in the second quarter. The Focus Laser Scanner reported 18% year-over-year unit sales growth. The Americas highlighted this growth with 37% year-over-year increase in units sold by expanding its distribution network and implementing effective marketing initiatives. The average selling price of the Focus Laser Scanner was slightly lower on a year-over-year basis due to a higher distribution sales and a product mix shift to more Focus X 130s in Asia. The recently launched FARO Freestyle handheld laser scanner continued to gain sales momentum and contributed modestly to our year-over-year sales growth. \nWe anticipate currency headwinds and weaker macroeconomic conditions to challenge our sales growth in the near-term. With published indicators suggesting a slowdown in Chinese automotive and industrial manufacturing in general, we anticipate continued deferred capital spending to continue to negatively impact Asia in the near-term. Our internal strategic decision-making remains focused on delivering long-term mid-teens sales growth. Consistent with prior communications, we remind you this is a long-term growth model and does not represent specific financial guidance for this quarter or this year. Despite the near-term challenges, we believe in our long-term fundamentals and our innate capability to deliver value to the markets we serve. \nOur product pipeline today is stronger than ever, demonstrated by our recent product releases. The next 18 months will be exciting for the FARO brand as we are preparing an aggressive product introduction plan to further disrupt our markets. While we're focused internally on product development, we closed and integrated three acquisitions in the last 12 months. Our senior leadership team and I see meaningful acquisitions right now in the market that would broaden and strengthen FARO over the next 12 months. With that said, our strategy remains to reinvest our cash into R&D, long-term growth initiatives, and maintain the financial capability to transact material acquisitions given the right price and fit. \nWhile our second quarter results did not fully meet our internal expectations, I'm pleased by how we delivered a topline recovery in this challenging market. Excluding currency, we achieved 12% year-over-year sales growth, just below our mid-teens long-term objective. The Americas bounced back from a challenging first quarter to post 18% year-over-year sales growth and the Europe team delivered nearly 13% year-over-year sales growth excluding impacts and executed (inaudible) third quarter. \nWe reported another quarter of strong 3D documentation sales growth. Our most recent product releases, the Laser Line Probe and FARO Freestyle delivered strong sales growth. At the end of June, our software team released a major revision of our CAM2 Measure 10 software. The latest version CAM2 Measure 10.5 leads the market with the ability to connect multiple 3D measurement devices within the same coordinate system, and simultaneously scan into a single seat of software on one computer. The capability allows users to seamlessly scan large objects with rapid speed and precise accuracy and complete 3D scanning jobs faster than ever before. This major release reflects our continued commitment to invest in a disruptive product development, this time on the software side of the business. \nIn closing, I would like to thank the FARO team who stepped up after the tough first quarter to search for extra leads, develop extra opportunities, execute extra demos, and close the deals to deliver a solid second quarter recovery. I would also like to extend my appreciation to our customers and shareholders for placing their confidence and investment in us. \nI will now open the call to questions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T20:15:44.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
