Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Lisa Murray The Chinese government's aggressive intervention in its sharemarket did not start with the raft of emergency measures it unleashed this month to counter a dramatic selldown.\nPolicymakers have been massaging the market all year. Indeed, the market rally to June 12, when both the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets had more than doubled in less than 12 months, was widely believed to be state-sponsored. It was seen as part of President Xi Jinping's \"China Dream,\" a chance to take part in the country's economic evolution.\nChina's bull market \"has just begun\", a website run by the Communist Party mouthpiece, The People's Daily , trumpeted on April 21.\nLess than two weeks earlier, the government had lifted the ban on multiple accounts, allowing individual investors to have as many as 20 open at the same time. This move was all the more significant as retail investors dominate trade, accounting for roughly 80 per cent of daily turnover.\nThe government could hardly stand by and watch the market go into free fall, having pumped it up all the way to its peak. Its credibility was on the line.\nAt first its intervention appeared to fail. An interest rate cut on June 27 was ineffectual. It was only when the government rolled out a series of unprecedented measures, suspending initial public offerings, clamping down on short selling and ordering a series of share-buying programs by state institutions, backed by funds from the central bank, that the market began to stabilise. At one point, more than half of all listed companies had suspended their shares, adding to the extreme response.\nOn Monday, China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index gained for the third straight day, rising 2.4 per cent to close at 3970. The Shenzhen Composite Index was up 4.8 per cent and the ChiNext, a board for high-tech firms and start-ups, finished the day 5.8 per cent higher.\nMore than 400 of the suspended stocks resumed trading, although over 1000 are still frozen. While the trading halts – which have been put in place for a variety of reasons including the vague explanation of \"significant matters\" – reduce volatility, they also damage the Chinese market's reputation, particularly with foreign investors.\n To better manage market volatility in future, The People's Daily on Monday flagged the introduction of a \"financial stabilisation fund\" to act as a buffer and stabilise prices when the market \"experiences an unreasonable and irrational surge or slump\".\nThe problem with these types of measures is that it creates an expectation the government will intervene to support the market at any cost, which is a belief that encourages \"irrational\" buying in the first place.\nStill, Beijing's response appears to have been successful in countering panic selling. And this is important for global economic stability. As Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia, points out, China accounts for more global growth than the US, Europe and Japan combined.\nThe key questions now are how long China's government needs to lend its support to the market and how much that support will cost.\nRothman believes if China's equity markets did fall further, it would have a \"small but material negative impact\" on GDP growth. The financial sector accounted for 7.4 per cent of the country's GDP last year and that share rose to 9.7 per cent in the first quarter, so any drop-off in activity will impact growth in the second half.\nHowever, he says, as two-thirds of active trading accounts had less than US$15,000 there would be only a \"modest impact\" on retail sales growth. He is also not too concerned about the rapid build-up in margin finance to fund share purchases, because consumer debt is still very low and savings very high. Household bank deposits in China stand at about US$8.5 trillion ($11.5 trillion).\nThe government may have hoped the equities rally of the past 12 months would boost household wealth and drive spending, but there is little evidence that has been the case. This could be viewed as a policy failure, but it also means that any impact from the recent market falls is muted.\n\"There are limited links between the stock market and the real economy,\" says Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard. \"We think the government response was an overreaction because they felt their reputation was at stake, having talked up the market on the way up.\"\nSo what happens now? After a rocky few weeks, the market appears to have stabilised.\nHowever, the government has confused investors about whether it's committed to liberalising the country's capital markets or setting the stage for more, rather than less, intervention.\nTao Dong, Credit Suisse's chief China economist, says Beijing's response was not dissimilar to interventions by the Federal Reserve in 2008 and the European Central Bank in 2012 in the face of overwhelming risks to the financial system.\nStill, he says, the government's actions are a setback for China's reform agenda. \"The basic function of capital markets is raising funds,\" he says. \"If you change the rules, it doesn't help the confidence of the supplier of capital.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/lmurray75", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/app/basic/117863643605371534837/posts"], "published": "2015-07-13T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:03:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
