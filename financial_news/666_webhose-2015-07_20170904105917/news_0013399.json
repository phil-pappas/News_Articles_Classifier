Alexis Tsipras, Greece's prime minister, is now scrambling to reach a deal that will unlock vital cash to keep the country afloat and reopen the country's banks - which have remained shut since the end of June. \nMr Tsipras said the \"No\" vote would bolster the Greek government's bargaining position . Other European leaders don't see it that way. \nSigmar Gabriel, Germany's vice chancellor, is already talking about giving Greece \"humanitarian aid\" in the event of a total meltdown, while Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who leads the Eurogroup of finance ministers, said the result of the referendum \"does not bring us closer to a solution\". \nAngela Merkel, the German Chancellor, flew to Paris on Monday for emergency talks with French counterpart Francois Hollande. The eurozone will hold and emergency summit on Tuesday where leaders will discuss the situation. \nThe crunch date is July 20, when Greece is due to repay €3.5bn to European Central Bank (ECB). Failure to do so will almost certainly mean the ECB will pull the plug on emergency loans to Greek banks. It has already pushed the banks closer to insolvency by adjusting the haircuts on collateral accepted for these loans . \nThis could trigger Greece’s exit from the eurozone. \n= How much money does Greece owe and to whom? = \nGreece owes €330bn (£234bn) to its international creditors. Most of it (60pc) is owed directly to other eurozone nations, and Germany is its biggest creditor. \nThe rest is owed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the ECB, and a combination of Greek and foreign banks. Under current projections, Greece will be paying back its debts until 2057. \n= Why did Greece borrow so much? = \nGreece's accession to the euro helped to lower the country's borrowing costs. European banks lent the country billions of euros, which it used to pay for things such as the 2004 Olympic Games and higher salaries for the country's public sector workforce. The boom quickly turned to bust following the 2008 financial crisis. \n= When will Greece literally run out of money? = \nWithin days. Sources told the Telegraph last weekend that one of the big four banks in Greece is almost out of cash. Louka Katseli, chairman of the National Bank (NYSE: NBHC - news ) of Greece, admitted last Friday that Greek banks would come under increasing pressure as of last night. \n= Has a country ever ran out of cash before and what happens if there is no money? = \nYes. In 2008, Giesecke and Devrient, the Germany contractor supplying the banknotes to Zimbabwe under the Robert Mugabe regime, stopped supplying the state-owned printers because of security concerns. \nAt the time, the country was dealing with rampant inflation, which meant people were transporting notes in wheelbarrows. \n= Greece has euro printing presses - can't it simply print its own euros? = \nIf only life were that simple. According to the ECB, Greece has the printing presses to produce €10 banknotes (The ability to print €200 and €500 banknotes has only ever been granted to Austria, Germany and Luxembourg), but any attempt to print more money would have big consequences. EU rules state that only the ECB has the right to authorise the issue of euro banknotes within the bloc. \nUnauthorised banknotes would be considered counterfeit. If Greece's national bank became aware that the country was printing notes, it would be obliged to inform the ECB, and \"order the party in possession of the non-compliant reproduction to hand overthe non-compliant reproduction\". \n= If Greece leaves the euro, what is the knock on effect for the rest of Europe? = \nThe eurozone was never designed with an exit plan in mind. The Maastricht Treaty’s 112 pages make no mention of a way for a country to pull out of the euro project. \nHowever, an exit would mean a union that was designed to be \"irreversible\" can be unwound. Some say the single currency is better off without Greece. Others say Grexit would be the beginning of the end of the euro itself. \nAnalysts at RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) estimate the minimum direct financial cost for creditors is £160bn - or 2.3pc of eurozone GDP. \n= What are the options - can Greece re-introduce the Drachma? = \nHistory suggests the introduction of a new currency must be done quickly and with the help of capital controls that restrict money flowing out of a country. \nExperts say the best solution for Greece would be to move to a virtual drachma, with prices, wages, loans and rents converted to drachmas overnight. \nThe introduction of physical notes would take longer. When Iraq introduced new banknotes in 2003 , De La Rue (Other OTC: DELRF - news ) , the world’s largest printer of banknotes, took a couple of months to start printing the new currency. \nTo keep cash circulating, euro notes inside Greece could be clearly stamped until a drachma currency was printed. However, this could cause problems as some euros would be deemed more valuable than others. Notes with a serial number starting with \"Y\" are printed in Greece. However, the note could now be owned by someone in France, who may have trouble spending it. \nThere have also been reports of some Greeks converting their euros to bitcoin, using the cryptocurrency in order to get money out of the country. \n= What if I am travelling to Greece - Will my credit cards work, can I get cash, is it safe? = \nThe UK government has urged holidaymakers to take enough cash with them on holiday to cover their expenses. \nCredit and debit card payment systems are reported to be working as normal. However, the Government says banking services throughout Greece could potentially become limited at short notice. It has also warned families to \"take appropriate security precautions against theft\". \nWhile cash withdrawals by foreign bank account holders are not restricted, many ATMs have already run dry. \n= Could Greece run out of food and other basic essentials such as medicine if it has no money? = \nWith images of empty supermarket shelves and reports the country is stockpiling basic medical supplies, there are greater risks of shortages. \nThe UK Foreign Office is advising UK travellers to \"take sufficient supplies, including prescription medicines, for the duration of their trip\". \nEuropean policymakers have insisted they are ready to help Greece if the country plunges into a humanitarian crisis. \nShoppers stand in an aisle with empty shelves in a supermarket in Athens (Photo: AFP) \n= Will airlines still be able to fly me home if the country runs out of money? = \nThe Prime Minister has already chaired a contingency planning meeting to make sure there are plans in place if the crisis escalates. \nGeorge Osborne, the Chancellor, has said that the Government has deployed extra resources to the islands of Crete, Corfu, Rhodes and Zakynthos, which already have a vice-consular presence. \nIn a statement yesterday, Mr Osborne said authorities would \"do whatever is necessary to protect the UK’s economic security\". \nFamilies are also urged to check with their travel insurance provider to ensure they have adequate cover.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T03:22:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
