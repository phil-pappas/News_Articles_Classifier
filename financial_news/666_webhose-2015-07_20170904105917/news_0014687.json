Wu has been nominated as a company director by TPG Stallion, a substantial shareholder.\nIn March, Li Ning said its namesake founder was returning to lead a turnaround drive after China's best-known sports brand posted a third consecutive year of losses, squeezed by global brands and cheap local rivals.\nThe former Olympic champion gymnast returned as interim chief executive to replace Kim, who ran daily operations as interim chief executive from July 2012 until last November. Kim is an executive of U.S. private equity fund and Li Ning backer TPG Capital.\nThe Chinese sportswear maker said Kim had no disagreement with the board. It gave no further details.
