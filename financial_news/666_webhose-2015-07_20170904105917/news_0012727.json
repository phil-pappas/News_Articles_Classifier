Other areas of importance discussed was the creation of secondary education funding by counties through tax credits and the upcoming ballot initiative to alter TABOR (taxpayer Bill of Rights). That particular initiative has high significance in that it would allow Colorado to keep and spend the sales and excises taxes collection from marijuana and lower current tax rates to keep in compliance with TABOR in the future. Colorado voters approved TABOR in 1992, a constitutional amendment designed to restrain growth in government. TABOR limited the amount of revenue governments could collect and spend.\nA leading tax and business attorney, Mr. Murray holds a Master's Degree in taxation, is a well-known and published author on taxation and business and has provided House testimony in support of Colorado taxation issues.
