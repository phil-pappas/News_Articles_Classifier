It did not identify any poor performers. \nXinhua's mission statement clearly states that it should \"firmly grasp the correct political direction\" as well as \"offer vigorous public opinion support to the Chinese Dream for the great renovation of the Chinese nation\" -- a catchphrase of Xi's. \nAs president of Xinhua, Cai carries ministerial-level rank. He was previously a reporter for the agency and the vice director of the propaganda department of the Chinese Communist Party central committee. \nSince taking over China's top leadership positions -- Communist Party general secretary and state president -- in 2012-2013, Xi has placed particular emphasis on relations with Russia. \nHe has held no fewer than eight summit meetings with its president Vladimir Putin, most recently at a gathering in Russia of the BRICS emerging countries and members of a regional security group that includes China, Russia and four Central Asian nations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T15:39:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
