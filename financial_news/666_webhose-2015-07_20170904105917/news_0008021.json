As compliance becomes increasingly – if not completely – commoditized, to be successful, accounting firms need to take a number of essential strategic actions.\nIt can be said that the government is using accounting firms as intermediaries to ensure they collect the appropriate taxes. Consequently, business owners, for instance, view compliance services as a necessary evil. While compliance is not going away, from the perspective of the accounting industry, the delivery of compliance services is going to change dramatically resulting in fewer but more significant compliance practices.\nThere are a number of very discernable and powerful reasons for the commoditization of compliance services. Moreover, the scenario is only going to intensify in the near future. Cloud computing, for example, is going to be instrumental in changing the structure of delivering compliance services. More disruptive to the accounting industry is artificial intelligence , which is going to dramatically transform the profession.\nAs with any type of greatly commoditized service, compliance practices are facing increasingly intense pricing pressure. This is likely to force a substantial and rising number of accounting firms to downplay or even abandon providing compliance services in favor of focusing on practice areas that have greater potential such as family office services and business coaching .\nFor those accounting firms that choose to concentrate on compliance, there are a number of strategic actions they can, and many probably should, implement. With respect to business development, the following are likely going to be crucial:\nDevelop areas of specialization : It has become almost essential to be expert in a particular industry to meaningfully grow a compliance practice. Depending on the size of the accounting firm and the partners therein, the firm can have multiple areas of specialization. Considering that clients want to work with experts who truly have an in-depth understanding of their worlds, this is critical. Become a thought leader : Being an expert is “worthless” unless the clients, potential clients, and referral sources know this to be the case. For accounting firms (and all professional services firms), the optimal way to communicate and demonstrate their expertise is by becoming thought leaders . What would probably prove most cost-effective and profitable is enacting precision-targeted content marketing campaigns. Network for results : Most accountants networking efforts lack any degree of exactness. Street-smart networking , in contrast, that leverages the content marketing efforts in a calculated manner has been proven to generate a steady stream of new accounting firm clients. A number of large and small accounting firms are going to dominate the business of compliance. Moreover, they will likely do so very profitably. This is going to require they bring in new clients on a regular basis. The solution here is a combination of specialization, thought leadership, and street-smart networking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T15:35:30.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
