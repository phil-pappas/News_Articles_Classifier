Investment loans had been running at an average of 49.5 per cent of all loans in NSW for the previous 12 months. The decline also comes as auction clearance rates trend down in Sydney .\n\"These figures suggest that APRA controls are starting to take effect, but not at the expense of the overall mortgage market,\" AFG managing director Brett McKeon said, \"If this trend continues, it should help allay concerns about overheating in Sydney, in particular, as investment levels there come back into line with the sustainable, long term, national average.\"\nThe listed AFG has a loan book of more than $100 billion and its figures give an accurate picture of the type of home buyers borrowing.\nThroughout Australia, the same moderating trend was repeated, with investment loans declining in South Australia from 41.8 per cent to 36.8 per cent, in Queensland from 36.1 per cent to 34.1 per cent and in Victoria from 36.5 per cent to 35.7 per cent. Western Australia saw a drop to 31.2 per cent from from 31.8 per cent.\n There has also been a significant change in who is lending to home buyers. Last month saw 30.9 per cent of all mortgages processed for non-major lenders – the highest such figure since 32.5 per cent recorded in December last year.\nMore to come.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/102874628957085545973", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/mcranston1"], "published": "2015-07-06T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T12:10:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
