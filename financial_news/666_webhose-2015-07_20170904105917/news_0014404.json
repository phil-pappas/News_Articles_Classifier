John Koskinen, the IRS chief, denied that he'd misled Congress, as Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and 20 other GOP lawmakers maintain. ADVERTISEMENT He also suggested that the Republicans were coming after him because they didn't like what congressional investigations into the IRS's improper scrutiny of Tea Party groups have found. \"I understand the committee's disappointed that there hasn't been more evidence supporting where they originally started,\" Koskinen told reporters, after testifying at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing presided over by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). \"I've testified honestly and truthfully about what I knew at the time I knew it,\" Koskinen added. \"We've provided them a phenomenal amount of information. And if it hasn't met all their expectations about the substance of it, that's not our fault.\" Chaffetz and the GOP lawmakers said Monday that they'd already started contempt of Congress proceedings against Koskinen, and wouldn't rule out seeking impeachment if Obama didn't act. A federal judge also threatened Koskinen with contempt of Congress on Wednesday. The GOP lawmakers say that Koskinen misled Congress about the IRS's efforts to recover thousands of lost emails to and from Lois Lerner, the central figure in the Tea Party controversy, and obstructed their investigation in other ways.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T06:09:04.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
