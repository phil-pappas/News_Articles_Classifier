That tends to dent demand and, in turn, pull prices lower. \nAnalysts said investors are now beginning to refocus on macroeconomic data after the past few months were dominated by the Greek debt crisis and a more than 30 percent plunge in Chinese stocks. \n\"With the relative calm that has engulfed Europe, traders are feeling a little more comfortable and focusing on equities and the deluge of corporate data hitting them in this latest reporting season,\" said Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) trading group. \nIn London, shares of Pearson (Xetra: 858266 - news ) , the British publisher of the Financial Times, dived 1.57 percent to 1,255 pence on rumours it was sounding out potential buyers for its influential economic and business daily, though no decision to sell has been taken, Bloomberg News reported. \nEmbattled banks were also in focus with a report saying Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) could shed 30,000 jobs, while Standard Chartered (Other OTC: SCBFF - news ) unveiled a streamlined management team. \nBarclays' share price rose 0.27 percent to close at 280.85 pence, while Standard Chartered advanced by 0.93 percent in value to 1,026.50 pence. \nUS stocks climbed Monday following solid earnings from Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) and Lockheed Martin's purchase of Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies for $9 billion. \nIn New York mid-day trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 18,120.25, up 0.19 percent. \nThe broad-based S&P 500 added 0.10 percent at 2,128.86, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.19 percent to 5,220.28. \nAsian stocks were mixed Monday, with Sydney and Shanghai rising as concerns eased over Greece and China's recent market rout. \nShanghai ended 0.88 percent higher at 3,992.11 points, while Sydney added 0.30 percent to close at 5,686.90. \nHong Kong was flat at 25,404.81, while Seoul closed 0.17 percent lower at 2,073.31. \nTokyo and Jakarta were closed for public holidays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T20:59:13.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
