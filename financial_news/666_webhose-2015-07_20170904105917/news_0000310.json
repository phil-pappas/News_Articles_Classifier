Photo: Supplied\nMost of us plead guilty to Googling ourselves from time to time – but when was the last time you checked your company's online image by punching your business name into a search engine?\nLacey Filipich did – and found she was invisible when she started out. Filipich is the founder of Money School, a Perth-based provider of financial education courses for individuals.\nShortly after launch last year she was dismayed to learn that a friend had searched for Money School on the net and given up when nothing approximating her business popped up.\nAdvertisement Filipich was there – but buried on page 10 or 11 of a Google search; a place she was determined not to stay.\n\"To be able to have someone look for the name of my company and pop up on the first page, it's critical,\" Filipich says.\nWriting regular blogs on all matters financial and sharing her posts with her network, via Facebook, has proved a successful DIY strategy for nudging her business name up the Google ranks and into the coveted first-page position.\n\"It's all about getting your name and visibility out there as a new business,\" Filipich says.\nAnd keeping it there, says Spencer Travel founder Penny Spencer, who handed the business of doing so over to a Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) consultancy six years ago, after concluding the DIY approach was too hard.\nSEO refers to activity aimed at improving a web site's rankings in the unpaid results of search engines including Bing, Yahoo and Google, the undisputed market Goliath.\nResults are determined by secret, and regularly changing, algorithms, which rank sites in order of usability and relevance of content. Sites which appear on the first page of search results attract many more visitors than those further back.\nEstablished in 1998, Spencer's Sydney firm employs 80 people and specialises in corporate travel. She receives about four inquiries a week via her website.\nThat's good going for her market niche and has much to do with the fact that she does well in searches for business travel agents, according to Spencer. She spends about $5000 annually – \"not massive money\" – on SEO services.\n\"If you're going to have a website you need to get people in the door,\" she says.\n\"I tried early on in the business to do it myself but never got anywhere. It's really hard to keep it on the first page. If you take your eye off it for a minute, you're off.\n\"You need to have people working on it all the time and advising you because it changes all the time. If you can afford to have someone in house just concentrating on web presence – but [for] most small businesses that's difficult.\"\nLachlan Wells, a digital marketing strategist at Melbourne SEO agency Optimising, says businesses typically pay $800 to $2000 a month for SEO services.\nProprietors like Filipich, with limited budgets and time to spare, can employ many of the techniques the professionals use to rise up the ranks.\nThey include on-page optimisation, which involves setting out menus and page structures correctly, improving speed and mobile responsiveness, ensuring pages include relevant key words and adding new content regularly.\nBesides blogs, consider posting How To guides or demonstration videos relating to your product or service offering, Wells suggests.\nOff-page optimisation focuses on encouraging other sites to reference and link to yours – a task made easier if the content you are offering is useful and relevant to their business or activities, Wells says.\nThink it doesn't matter too much for your small concern? Disregard your cyber image at your peril, warns Richard Flanagan, Google's head of small business marketing.\n\"It's always important to be aware of how you present to others – and your online presence is no exception,\" Flanagan says.\n\"Is your website easy to use across all devices? Are you appearing when people search for the services you offer?\n\"People's expectations of businesses have changed hugely over the past few years... A strong online presence is also a sign of quality. So are online reviews, in much the way that word of mouth has operated, these are also indicators of a good business.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T04:54:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
