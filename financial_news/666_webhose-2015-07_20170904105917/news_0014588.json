And they also help your loved ones when you are not around.   Chetan Bhatia Hindu mythology often refers to Mr Chitragupt the Head of Accounts in God’s kingdom, who is said to manage the account (not financial, but MORAL) of every Hindu on Planet Earth, a mammoth task by any measure. He based on his flawless record keeping skills or systems, evaluates the fate of every being and has the responsibility of allocating heaven & hell as per the strength & weakness of the moral account. There are many tales around the whole process of death and the process of allocation of the so called heaven or hell. But you must be wondering why I am getting into mythology when I am supposed to tell you how to maintain records of your money matters.Chitragupt underlines the very importance of keeping records and taking decisions on the basis of the records kept, which in turn are unbiased and in the right direction. In late 1980s there were many like me, who started working and the ultimate financial planning in those days used to be purchasing a life insurance policy from LIC of India. Typically someone elderly would ask the young lad with his first salary in his hand to buy one such policy and start saving. And the young person would buy one such policy without questioning the logic in most cases. Then more such policies, post office deposits, bank deposits and company deposits would come the young man’s way. A bit savvy lot would go for some share trading also. However, due to lack of computers and smart phones backed by modern technologies, many would not have any idea of where they do stand in terms of their investments.Things have not changed even today no matter which gadgets you use. The young generation may have access to best computers, online portfolio services, free and paid applications on their smart phones. But still if you ask them about their networth today, seldom you get a quick answer. Forget that, many of them complain that they do have one bank account earning taxable 4% rate of interest on a sum of Rs 4 lakh for one year whereas in other bank account the bank deducts charges of Rs 750 per quarter for past three quarters for failing to maintain minimum balance. Also there are issues such as failure to pay life insurance premium just because the premium notice does not reach the life assured for whatever reason. This happens due to lack of awareness, which arises due to failure to keep records of all financial transaction.The point here is not to show the young working population in bad light, but to point out the facts and getting a solution to it. Let us look at how to overcome the problem of failing to keep good record.You have wide choices in terms of the means to keep records – you may use a simple note-book or use a nice smart phone application of your choice. You may want to record your transactions monthly or fortnightly, whatever suits you. But please make it a point to do so at regular interval.
