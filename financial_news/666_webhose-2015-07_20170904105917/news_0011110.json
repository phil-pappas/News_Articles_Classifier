The right vision of Europe By Telegraph View: | Telegraph – 8 minutes ago Print \nTelegraph View: George Osborne is right to seek \"a single market of free trade\" \nOfficial estimates for the expansion of the UK economy released yesterday were another reminder of how well Britain is doing after the grim years that followed the global financial crisis. With record employment, almost no inflation and robust growth, the most pressing problem now facing the UK economy may be dealing with a return to “normal” borrowing costs when the Bank of England inevitably raises interest rates. \nStill, there is a cloud in this sunny sky: Europe. UK manufacturing is faring poorly, partly because the pound is strong against the euro , and partly because of weak demand for its products from fragile European economies. That is a reminder of how Europe’s economic performance affects our own, and underlines the need for change. \nOf course, the best change would for the eurozone economies to become much more productive and dynamic, and thus better trading partners for Britain. But that may never happen, not least since the European Union promotes growth-killing regulation while failing to complete the wealth-creating single market it nominally exists to build. There are also growing signs that the constraints of the single currency are limiting the capacity of the economies using it. So it would be prudent for Britain to seek a looser relationship with the rest of the EU, one that leaves us less exposed to stumbling European economies and the political-bureacratic shackles that hobble them. \nEconomy Flag (Alamy) \nIn that context, it is extremely encouraging to hear George Osborne speak in a Daily Telegraph interview of Britain’s future relationship with the EU as being part of “a single market of free trade” - especially since the Chancellor is overseeing the detailed renegotiation of our EU membership, which will then be put to a referendum. \nWhile the outcome of that vote is hugely important, it is arguably still less so than the nature of our relationship with Europe. If Britain can trade freely as part of a genuine free market (which must include services as well as goods) then the question of whether we are a formal member of the EU or not becomes secondary. What matters is that Britain’s world-class companies can do business across the European continent (and around the world) without interference from national governments or officials in Brussels. \nThe Chancellor has identified the correct destination for Britain on its European journey. We now look forward to hearing how the Government will get us there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T09:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T09:44:43.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
