Paul Jeffers by Duncan Hughes A $300 search of council plans could be money well spent by property buyers, say lawyers and veteran developers, as it could reveal development proposals with the potential to turn a property goldmine into a financial sinkhole.\nIn a sign of the times, planning tribunals are being inundated by hopeful developers and fearful residents with requests for reviews of decisions about plans to transform suburban streetscapes and skylines.\nLawyers such as Robert Kern, a conveyancing specialist for legal firm Slater and Gordon, urges buyers to consider a search of council records to identify any planned neighbourhood developments. He cautions that buying property near development sites \"leaves fewer options then you might think if things go wrong\", such as a bankruptcy or damage caused to surrounding properties.\nCollapsed pit renders neighbours homeless Potential problems are highlighted by a recent land collapse at a development site in Mount Waverly, a suburb about 18 kilometres south-east of Melbourne's central business district.\nPaul Klisaris, mayor of the City of Monash, says it could be five weeks before residents living in houses neighbouring the collapsed excavation pit can return home. The 15-metre-deep site, in a quiet suburban street, was being excavated to make way for a three-storey building with a basement car park when a wall caved in.\nMount Waverly, traditionally a suburb of winding leafy streets and post-war, triple-fronted, single story brick facades, is being transformed by a huge increase in apartments. The collapse in the construction pit at the corner of Huntingdale and Highbury Roads is believed to have been caused by heavy rain.\nKlisaris says council and resident costs will be passed on to the developer.\n Creeping dangers But Kern says other problems – such as damages to the foundations or cracks in walls and ceilings of neighbouring houses – are much harder to detect and could result in expensive structural repair bills long after the development has been completed and sold.\nDaren McDonald, a partner at property consultancy ShineWing Australia, says a neighbour's decision to sell their property for development could be a bonanza or bombshell for your street's values, views and amenity.\nPromises of a prestige, luxury development with off-street parking can breathe new life into a community's prospects and property prices, generating buyer interest as it becomes a more popular postcode.\n\"Is your site likely to increase, or reduce, in value as a result of the proposed development?\" asks McDonald. \"Is enjoyment of your property going to be enhanced, or diminished, by the proposed development?\n\"On the basis that the development was approved, this may increase the value of the adjoining site from a future development perspective. But it may diminish from a personal perspective due to increased noise, traffic, overlooking or over-shadowing apartments.\"\nFor example, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, which considers planning appeals, earlier this month turned down a proposal from a developer to build two double-storey apartments in Burwood, about 14 kilometres east of Melbourne.\nThe developer claimed the design was in keeping with the state government's policy development zones close to transport and service hubs.\nBut it was overturned after local residents claimed the property was out of keeping with the single-storey neighbourhood, that removing the existing garden and trees would have \"adverse visual impact\" and that the driveway lay-outs meant cars would need to reverse onto the street.\nDozens of cases are considered by VCAT and equivalent appeal tribunals in other states and territories each month about planning proposals and impact on local communities.\nA three-storey block of apartments in another Melbourne suburb was this month given the green light by the tribunal because it was considered to have little impact on the streetscape, despite bitter protests from owners of neighbouring properties.\nThe only concession to complaints was that the development should have a flat, rather than a pitched, roof.\nHard cases Kern warns many homeowners could have a hard time establishing grounds for a successful legal action if a development causes damage to their recently-bought property.\n\"Not only do buyers have to prove either the property had already been damaged, or there was a high chance of damage at the time of sale, they also have to prove the seller was aware of the damage, or potential for damage,\" he says.\nIf the developer goes bankrupt, then the developer has no money so recovering damages can almost be impossible, he adds.\nThe building boom on the nation's east coast means that builders, or contractors, often sub-contract to tradespeople, who, in turn, sub-contract to others.\nThis can create problems attempting to identify who was responsible for a problem, particularly if it emerges a long time after completion and sale.\nSearch local council records Kern recommends buyers spend $300 to search local council records for nearby development approvals. \"It's cheaper than pursuing a $30,000 claim for damages in the future due to a project you were not aware of,\" he adds.\nMcDonald recommends chatting with planning and building departments at the local council.\n\"Council should be able to provide you with a copy of the planning permit as to what has been approved,\" he says.\n\"If you are looking to acquire a property, do your own due diligence. See what has been approved, what may be in process, and what someone may do to their site in the future.\"\nAlso chat with owners of adjoining properties to find out whether they are planning, or are involved in, nearby developments.\n\"Who are they? What do they know about the development? Are they owner-occupiers? Are they developers/builders? Could you join with nearby land owners to share knowledge, engage consultants, obtain legal advice?\" he adds.\nIn some cases, consider the appointment of an independent surveyor to inspect and advise on both your own property and the development.\n\"Make sure it is in accordance with building regulations and plans,\" McDonald says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T10:06:44.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
