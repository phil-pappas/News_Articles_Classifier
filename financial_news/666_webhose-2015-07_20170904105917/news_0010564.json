The sentencing hearings for Hirsch and McClung are scheduled for November 5, the statement said. \nAccording to admissions in the DPA and statements in the charging documents, from 1998 through 2010, the company and its employees, including Hirsch and McClung, orchestrated $3.9 million in bribe payments to foreign officials in various countries in order to secure government contracts. \nTo conceal the payments, the co-conspirators made payments under the guise of “commitment fees,” “counterpart per diems,” and other payments to third-party vendors. \nIn reality, the payments were intended to fund bribes to foreign officials who had awarded contracts to Louis Berger or who supervised the company’s work on contracts, the statement added. \nIn April, Louis Berger was hired to project manage a major revamp of transport systems in Madinah. \nPrince Faisal bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, chairman of Al Madinah Al Munawwarah Development Authority (MMDA), signed a contract with Louis Berger for the transportation infrastructure initiative worth SR375 million ($100 million).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T13:12:59.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
