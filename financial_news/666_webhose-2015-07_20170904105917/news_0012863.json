They also emphasise the functional relationships between the two levels of government,\" said Kariuki. \nSome of the policies that are nearing completion include National Agricultural Policy, National Irrigation Policy, Kenya Veterinary Policy and the National Tea Industry Policy. \nShe said the ministry has also formulated draft bills and regulations to streamline the management of various agriculture sector value chains, such as the Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture Regulations, the Seed Industry Regulations, Agriculture, Food & Fish Authority and Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organisation regulations and Warehouse Receipt Systems Bill among others. \n\"The National Agriculture policy will be the overarching policy document to guide the agriculture sector. It will be the basis for strategies, plans and programmes for the country's agricultural development and will affirm the relationship between food, health and prosperity for Kenyans,\" the PS said. \nShe added that the Kenya Veterinary Policy creates an environment for safeguarding health and welfare of animals in order to guarantee the highest safety and nutritional standards of animal products and contain spread of diseases from animals to humans. \nKariuki noted that the policies and legislations have been formulated through extensive sector and countrywide consultations, some of which are still ongoing. \n\"High level consultations with the parliamentary committees have been held and will greatly contribute to finalisation of these documents. A point of emphasis has been the need for county and national government to build synergy in formulating relevant policies for the country that can drive the overall national agenda for agriculture. It is expected that when these policies are implemented, greater economic development in the country will be achieved,\" Kariuki said.
