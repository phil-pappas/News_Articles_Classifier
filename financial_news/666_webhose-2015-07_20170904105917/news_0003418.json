The share gain raised Google’s market capitalization by $65 billion to $475 billion, marking the biggest one-day market-cap gain in U.S. history if the gains stick through the close, S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt said. The current record belongs to Apple Inc., which gained $46 billion on April 25, 2012.\nBut at least five brokerages – J.P. Morgan, Bernstein Research, Nomura Research, Jefferies and Evercore -- think Google’s stock will go even higher.\nThey all raised their 12-month targets on the company Friday morning to $800 after it reported a sharp rise in earnings and sales that trumped Wall Street expectations. At that price, Google’s market cap would catapult above the half-a-trillion mark to $547 billion, making Google only the second company, along with Apple AAPL, +0.70% to be valued above the half-a-trillion threshold. Apple is currently trading at a $740 billion valuation.\n“Google hasn’t delivered a quarter like this in a long time,” said J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth, while reiterating an outperform rating on the stock.\nA number of other banks raised their price targets higher than $700, including Deutsche Bank, to $780 from $625; Wells Fargo, to $780 from $760; RBC Capital, to $750 from $640; Pacific Crest, to $745 from $675; Raymond James, to $720 from $625; and Cantor Fitzgerald, to $720 from $625.\nBMO Capital Markets was the only brokerage to upgrade Google’s stock on Friday, to buy, but the vast majority of analysts already rate Google the equivalent of buy, according to FactSet.\nA few banks kept their targets below $700, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Barclays and Morgan Stanley, which raised their targets to $620, $660, $670 and $675, respectively. Those targets would have represented slight increases from Google’s closing price of $601.78 on Thursday, but they all represent declines from current trading prices. The average price target among a poll of 40 analysts is $711.62, according to FactSet.\nThis quarter marked a reversal from the prior four periods in terms of paid clicks growth, which came in above the consensus at more than 18% year-over-year, versus expectations of 14% growth.\nSee Also: Netflix and Google are streaming into overdrive\nNomura analyst Anthony DiClemente, who currently rates Google at buy, said the quarterly results debunk the major bear cases against Google, including that desktop search is declining and expense growth is expanding faster than revenue growth (they’re not), and that YouTube growth is stalling — also not true as viewership is growing at the fastest pace in two years , with YouTube viewing hours jumping 60% year-over-year and expanding on mobile.\nAnalysts applauded Google’s new chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, for her comments on reducing expenses and hinting at capital returns down the road, saying that it backs the company’s commitment to improving margins and delivering value to shareholders.\n“We believe this will be a thesis-changing quarter for many as margins stabilize and likely expand,” Anmuth said.\nSee Also: Google’s new CFO walks fine line on costs\nAmong the more bearish pool of analysts, Goldman Sachs’ Heather Bellini reiterated a neutral rating on Google, pointing to the fact that cost-per-click fell by a worse-than-expected 11%, versus the Street view of a 4.5% decline.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak, who reiterated an equal-weight rating on Google’s stock, said it remains on the sidelines as it gauges “the sustainability of top and bottom-line beats” into the back-half of 2015 and 2016.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T21:40:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
