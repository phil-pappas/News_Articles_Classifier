The shares had already fallen 75 percent over two years through Thursday, when Ocwen issued a quarterly earnings report after the markets closed. Compass Point Research & Trading LLC analysts said the results represented a loss of 12 cents a share after excluding certain items, trailing their earnings forecast of 18 cents a share, partly due to elevated servicing and interest expenses.\nOcwen is retrenching after facing complaints from regulators, including those in New York State , and mortgage-bond investors about how it handled soured loans. The company shrank its portfolio by 26 percent to $316 billion in the year through June 30, according to newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance . It is the fifth-biggest U.S. servicer, having grown by buying up contracts after the financial crisis.\n“The second half of 2015 will be challenging from an income perspective,” partially because of sales of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac contracts, in which it expects to recognize losses, Chief Executive Officer Ronald M. Faris said on a conference call with analysts.\nFaris also said he wasn’t sure when or how much of the remaining $22 billion of a previously announced sale of $25 billion of servicing rights to rival Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. would be completed. Company forecasts implying a 11 percent decline in expenses trail the probable 30 percent drop in its average portfolio through 2016, according to Compass Point analysts Kevin Barker and Jesus Bueno.\nNet income fell 85 percent to $10 million in the second quarter from a year earlier, while revenue declined to 16 percent to $463 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T23:41:54.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
