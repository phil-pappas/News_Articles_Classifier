NYSE said the outage was due to an internal technical issue and not the result of a cyberattack. Other exchanges were trading normally.\nThe NYSE must now verify the cause and report its conclusions to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which will use those findings to investigate whether any violation of rules occurred, Bloomberg reported.
