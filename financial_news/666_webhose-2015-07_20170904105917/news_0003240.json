U.S. companies were expected to post their worst sales decline in nearly six years in the second quarter, in part due to the strong dollar that reduces the value of U.S. companies' overseas income.\nThe dollar index was down 0.7 percent at $97.36, and had earlier traded at its highest level since April on firming expectation of a U.S. interest rate hike later in the year.\n\"The U.S. market is slightly overvalued at the moment, and will be more than slightly overvalued if revenue growth does not pick up,\" Toohey said.\nApple, Microsoft and Yahoo are scheduled to report results after market close. Strong earnings from technology companies have been driving gains in the Nasdaq.\nAt 11:16 a.m. ET (1516 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 201.15 points, or 1.11 percent, at 17,899.26, the S&P 500 was down 8.62 points, or 0.41 percent, at 2,119.66 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 19.24 points, or 0.37 percent, at 5,199.62.\nSeven of the 10 major S&P indexes were lower with the telecommunications index leading the decliners with a 1.78 percent drop. Verizon Communications' 2.6 percent fall weighed the most on the index.\nLexmark International slumped as much as 23.2 percent to $36.36, its lowest in 18 months, after the printer maker said it would cut 500 jobs, or about 4 percent of its global workforce.\nTesla fell 4.7 percent to $269.35 after UBS downgraded its rating on the stock to \"sell\" from \"neutral\". The downgrade is the third this month.\nHarley-Davidson was up 3.9 percent to $57.12 after its quarterly profit beat expectations.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,729 to 1,175. On the Nasdaq, 1,525 issues fell and 1,063 advanced.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 23 new 52-week highs and 17 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 78 new highs and 79 new lows.
