Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis told Bloomberg TV earlier Thursday that he'd rather \"cut his arm off\" than sign a new bailout deal that didn't include rehashing the deals to make payment dates more realistic. \nPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his ruling Syriza party's major issue with bailout proposals so far has been that they effectively turn Greece into a zombie country, stumbling along the poverty line and existing solely to pay off its heavy debts. \nThe IMF admits in its latest debt sustainability report on Greece that things have deteriorated so badly over the last year that debts are currently \"unsustainable\" and the country can't cope with any debt repayments for at least 3 years, even if things start moving back in the right direction. Greece's next payment — €3.5 billion (£2.5 billion, $3.89 billion) to the European Central Bank — is due July 20. \nIt also admits Greece will probably need a debt \"haircut\" — writing off some of the money it owes. \nSome of the IMF's proposals are even more radical — one idea is to give Greece a 20-year \"grace period\" during which it wouldn't have to pay debts. \nGreece's economy has been crippled by huge debt demands, shrinking 25% over the last five years , and the IMF says the country will need €50 billion (£35.5 billion, $55.5 billion) to survive over just the next 3 years. \nAll of this is a huge boost for Tsipras, who told Greeks in a TV address on Wednesday that the country's creditors need to give it \"breathing space.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T19:05:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
