The district's investment was Rwf900 million. \n\"The leadership of the country encourages Rwandans to look for homegrown solutions, work hard, and collaboratively seek solutions to the problems we face,\" Musoni said commending the decision by Nyanza District to prioritise road construction. \n\"Each district gets over Rwf10 billion each financial year. It would not be hard if each allocated at least Rwf1 billion to roads construction,\" he said. \nMusoni said the mentality that an asphalt road is only the work of central government was outdated as Nyanza had demonstrated, urging others to follow suite and only seek support from central government after they have made some progress. \nThe minister said each year, the infrastructure docket is allocated at least Rwf30 billion towards road construction. This, he said, could well be supplemented if districts gave ample allocation towards roads. \nMusoni said infrastructure is a stimulant for development. \n\"Good infrastructure initiatives help enhance investment, which boosts people's welfare and increases productivity. Nyanza town residents and other interested people should pick interest in investing in the city to take advantage of the new infrastructure in place,\" he said. \nThe Nyanza District mayor, Abdallah Murenzi, said they opted for a tarmac road after realising that laterite and other methods were not durable and required frequent maintenance. \nHe said the new roads had added to the beauty of the town that was once the administrative capital of the country. \n\"This is a touristic city. Tourists like visiting clean places. So, these roads will facilitate movement. The roads will also keep buildings free from dust, which will reduce renovation expenses,\" he said, adding that they want residents to live in planned villages to effectively benefit from the available infrastructure. \nFelix Mungakuzwe, a motorcyclist in Nyanza City said, \"Before the tarmac, the roads were in a very poor state. \nThey were almost impassable during the rainy season and too dusty during the dry season; we were obliged to have an extra jacket for our clients. We would also pay a lot of money to repair our motorcycles.\" \nMayor Murenzi said from 2005, Nyanza City had got 15km of tarmac roads, including the 7km road which had been promised by President Paul Kagame. Of the 15km tarmac roads, 10km have streetlights installed to ease movement during the night. \nDuring the event, the minister said construction of the Ngoma-Bugesera -Nyanza Road will start in 2017 to link the Eastern to the Southern provinces, adding that Nyanza Stadium will also be revamped. \nHe thanked NPD Ltd for the \"quality work\". \nAt the ceremony, NPD donated five cows to needy residents in the district as part of their corporate social responsibility.
