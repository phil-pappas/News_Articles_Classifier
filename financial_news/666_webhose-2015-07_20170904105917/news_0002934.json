Matej Leskovsek for The New York Times by Shivani Vora Croatia's capital isn't typically thought of as a shopper's paradise, but the Lower Town of Zagreb is a favourite destination of in-the-know locals. It's a central area that developed in the early 20th century after the main train station, Zagreb Glavni Kolodvor, was built and is defined by its Hapsburg-era architecture, interconnected by garden squares. A robust collection of boutiques is scattered around pedestrian-heavy streets within a short walk from one another, and though their merchandise ranges widely, from handmade clothing and accessories to sweets and liqueur, most of the goods are made in Croatia.\nAtelier Kobali\nHigh-quality hats with a classic aesthetic are the draw at this more-than-a-century-old family enterprise. A small team of craftspeople constructs the headwear for men and women in material like wool, tweed, camel's hair and lace in a nearby workshop. Check out finds like the jaunty bright red wool beret for women and a men's light brown camel's hair top hat.\nPetra Preradovica 1, Tel: +385-1-481-2867\nDesigner Nenad Sovilj, 35, creates one-of-a-kind jewelry, like an oversize resin bib-shaped necklace, with a turquoise spiked inlay and a black shoelace-like closure, and a spiked gold cocktail ring resembling a skyscraper.
