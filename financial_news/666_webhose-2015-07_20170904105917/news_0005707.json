Engagement Agreement July 10, 2015 09:00 ET | Source: Till Capital \nHAMILTON, Bermuda, July 10,   Till Capital Ltd. (NASDAQ: TIL ) (TSX.V:TIL) (the \" Company \" or \" Till Capital \"), a company incorporated in Bermuda, announces that it has entered into a non-exclusive engagement agreement (the \" Agreement \") between the Company and Taussig Capital Ltd. (\" TCL \"), a company incorporated in Bermuda. The Agreement does not require shareholder approval. \nPursuant to the Agreement, TCL will serve as a non-exclusive \"advisor\" to the Company in connection with a proposed financing of a minimum of US$50 million and up to a maximum of US$150 million in equity capital from strategic investors (the \" Proposed Financing \") on a best efforts basis. The Proposed Financing will be priced at the current book value of the Company's restricted voting shares (the \" Shares \"), and any proceeds over US$150 million will be subject to approval by the Company's Board of Directors (the \" Board \"). The Proposed Financing may only be offered in jurisdictions in which TCL or, if applicable, its sub-advisors, are duly licensed and authorized to conduct business as a broker/dealer in securities or are exempt from registration therein. These jurisdictions may include any of the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Switzerland. \nMr. Joseph Taussig, a principal of TCL, is also a member of the Till Capital Board and is a principal of Multi-Strat Re Ltd. (\" Multi-Strat Re \"). Multi-Strat Re is a company incorporated in Bermuda, with whom the Company's wholly-owned reinsurance subsidiary, Resource Re Ltd. (\" RRe \"), has previously entered into a separate agreement for underwriting and related services in support of its reinsurance business. Mr. Taussig has previously advised other asset managers on the formations of large, U.S. listed reinsurance companies. \nThe Agreement provides that TCL will earn a cash success fee of 6% (subject to a maximum fee of US$3,000,000) of all capital invested in the Company by any investor(s) it introduces prior to the year-end 2017. In addition, TCL will be awarded one Share purchase warrant (a \" Warrant \") for every 20 Shares purchased (or subject to conversion) by investors introduced by TCL until the 2017 year-end. Each Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one Share at the same price per Share as the Proposed Financing, and will expire up to 10 years from the date of issuance subject to applicable regulatory or stock exchange restrictions. The Warrants will have piggyback registration rights in tandem with securities issued pursuant to the Proposed Financing or any other securities of Till that will be registered under U.S. federal securities laws. In the event of the issuance of warrants to TCL in connection with a financing transaction in accordance with the Agreement, any additional share purchase warrants that may be due to Multi-Strat Re or its parent, Multi-Strat Holdings Ltd., as part of separate agreements with RRe, will no longer be owed by the Company. \nUnder the Agreement, the Company also agrees to pay TCL monthly retainers of US$25,000 (the \" Retainers \") for four months, not to exceed US$100,000 in total, which will be deducted from any success fees. TCL also will be reimbursed for reasonable out of pocket expenses, which are not to exceed US$25,000. \nThe Agreement also provides that after completion of the Proposed Financing, the strategic investors, who are themselves asset managers, will be allowed to manage 75% of their invested capital as part of the Company's reinsurance related assets, with the remainder expected to be managed for a minimum of two (2) years under the direction of the Company's Chief Investment Officer, Mr. William Lupien. The Company will enter into standard external asset manager agreements with the strategic investors to satisfy this provision. \nThe Company may engage another placement agent, investment bank, or advisor (an \"Other Advisor\" ) to raise equity capital, provided the engagement does not conflict with the TCL engagement, and TCL shall not be entitled to success fees or compensation of any kind on such financing transaction. Should an Other Advisor be engaged, the Retainers and TCL's success payments will become equal to any payments that may be paid to an Other Advisor if their fees exceed those of TCL. The Agreement also includes certain other standard provisions relating to a TCL reserve list of potential investors. \nTill Capital Ltd. \nTill Capital Ltd. is a Bermuda-domiciled company with two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Omega Insurance Holdings Inc. and Resource Re Ltd.
