Earlier, it had struck a near four-month low at $54.80. \n\"A combination of plentiful supply and concerns about demand is putting prices under pressure,\" Commerzbank (Xetra: CBK100 - news ) analysts said in a note to clients on Friday. \nAnalysts have also said that the prospect of Iranian oil returning to the oversupplied market after Tehran recently reached a deal with major powers over its nuclear ambitions was dampening appetite. \nThe deal will see world powers lift crippling economic sanctions, which have restricted Iran's oil exports, in return for toning down its atomic programme. \nIran has the fourth biggest proven oil reserves in the world. \nOil prices have plummeted from above $100 a barrel in June last year because of the supply glut brought about by strong production from the United States and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries led by Saudi Arabia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T15:34:31.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
