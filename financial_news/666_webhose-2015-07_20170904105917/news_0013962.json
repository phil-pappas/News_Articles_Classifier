Ryanair’s formal acceptance - which is widely expected - will take the vote above the 90pc threshold initially set by IAG. \nRyanair and any other remaining shareholders now have until August 18 to vote on the deal, which was backed by Irish politicians in May. \nSpeaking on Friday morning, Mr Walsh said he was confident that the deal with Aer Lingus would go ahead, following a commitment from Ryanair to sell its stake in the Irish carrier. \n“We have made a very fair offer for the company. We are excited about Aer Lingus joining IAG,” Mr Walsh said. \nHe added that the strong quarterly and half-year results were partly thanks to cost cutting and improved productivity. \n“We said previously that profit improvement would be slower in the second quarter and we are on track to reach our full-year targets,\" he said. \n\"We continue to take cost out of the business, with both employee and supplier unit costs down at constant currency, and improvements in productivity levels.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T12:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:31:18.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
