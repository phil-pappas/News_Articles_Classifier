All four - Jeroen Hoencamp in the UK, Hannes Ametsreiter in Germany, Aldo Bisio in Italy and Antonio Coimbra in Spain will now report directly to Mr Colao. \nRob Shuter, in charge of Vodafone in the Netherlands, will also join the group executive committee and take on oversight of the company’s smaller European markets, such as Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) and Greece. \nMr Humm, a German who joined Vodafone in 2012 having previously led T-Mobile US through a failed attempt to merge with AT&T , will leave later this year. \nPhilipp Humm joined Vodafone three years ago \nMr Colao said: “I fully understand his desire to pursue his career ambitions outside Vodafone in light of the new organisation and wish him all the best for the future.” \nVodafone said the removal of a layer of management in Europe will “simplify organisational processes, enhance management efficiency and accelerate decision-making”. The company’s first-quarter results are due to be announced on Friday but changes are not believed to be related to any recent performance problems. \nInformed sources said the restructuring was also not linked to its talks with John Malone’s European cable group Liberty Global. The pair opened discussions last month about assets swaps aimed at creating combinations of mobile and fixed-line networks in markets such as Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, where Liberty owns Virgin Media. \nIt is understood that a complicated merger of Vodafone’s European arm and Liberty is also being explored , which could trigger a spin-off of the mobile operator’s assets outside its home continent. \nUBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) has estimated synergies of up to £25.4bn if a deal can be struck in a way that satisfies both sets of shareholders and German antitrust regulators. A potential announcement is understood to remain some way off, however. \nVodafone said there were no changes to its management structures in the Africa, Middle East and Asia-Pacific region.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:52:49.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
