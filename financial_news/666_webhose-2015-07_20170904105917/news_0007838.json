The ETF, which is based off of the Nasdaq CEA Cybersecurity Index SM , is designed to track the performance of companies engaged in the cybersecurity segment of the technology and industrials sectors. It includes companies primarily involved in the building, implementation, and management of security protocols applied to private and public networks, computers, and mobile devices in order to provide protection of the integrity of data and network operations. \n\"Along with the clear benefits of an increasingly interconnected world comes the growing need to ensure the security of cyberspace. This presents significant opportunities for companies involved with this task, many of which are not represented in traditional index ETFs,\" said Ryan Issakainen, CFA, Senior Vice President and ETF Strategist at First Trust. \"We believe this ETF provides a diversified, efficient way for investors to gain exposure to this important theme.\" \nCIBR seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield (before the fund's fees and expenses) of the Nasdaq CEA Cybersecurity Index SM (NQCYBR). The Fund will normally invest at least 90% of its net assets (including investment borrowings) in common stocks or in depositary receipts that comprise the Index. The Fund, using an indexing investment approach, attempts to replicate, before fees and expenses, the performance of the Index. \n\"We are delighted to support another listing and product launch from First Trust,\" said Jeff McCarthy, Vice President and Head of ETP Listings at Nasdaq. \"We value our partnership with First Trust and their continued confidence in Nasdaq as a primary listing and trading facility for ETFs.
