They're killing us at the border and they're killing us on jobs and trade.\" \n- Venezuela next? - \nThe Mexican government has denounced Trump's remarks as \"prejudiced and absurd,\" while Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro called the real estate mogul a \"thief.\" \nVenezuela's Cisneros Media, the company that organizes the national pageant and airs Miss Universe on Venevision, said it was \"evaluating the situation\" following Trump's comments. \nMiss Universe is particularly popular in Venezuela, as the country is second to the United States in contest winners with seven.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T03:40:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
