Cheap money—and more of it—puts upward pressure on the price of tuition. Now the New York Fed has noticed it also and has produced a study that delves into this issue. \nIn the report, Credit Supply and the Rise of College Tuition , the Fed found that when students fund their education through loans, there’s a tangible impact on tuition. \n\"Higher tuition costs raise loan demand, but loan supply also affects equilibrium tuition costs—for example, by relaxing students’ funding constraints,\" wrote the report's authors, David Lucca, a Fed capital markets researcher and colleagues Taylor Nadauld and Karen Shen. Fewer constraints on loans can lead to few constraints on tuition increases. \nThe report used detailed student-level financial data and changes in Federal student aid programs from the National Post Secondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), a Department of Education data set that helps identify the impact of increased student loan funding on tuition. The Fed traces awareness of this phenomenon to the second Reagan administration--and examines whether greater access to student loans could create an asset bubble. More Headlines Fed Rate Hike Is Nothing to Panic About \n\"In recent years,\" the Fed report states, \"much attention has been devoted to this question in the context of the housing market, for which credit is central, in an attempt to establish whether the U.S. housing boom of 2002-2006 and the ensuing bust can be explained by fluctuations in mortgage rates and loan availability to subprime borrowers.\" \n\"From a finance perspective,\" the Fed noted, \"the market for post-secondary education has shared several features with the housing market in the past few decades, despite the fact that student loans fund a capital investment while mortgages fund an asset.\" The appearance of a dreaded bubble in the student loan market has alarmed some observers for years. The Fed stopped short of announcing that one had been sighted. \nMortgages and student loans are the twin pillars of consumer finance, with student loan balances having outstripped credit cards . Both types of loans are often originated through government sponsored programs. Annual student loan originations jumped from $53 billion in 2001 to $120 billion in 2012, while the cost of tuition has been on the upswing. \nThe Fed traced concern about this trend to the 1980s, when William Bennett, Ronald Reagan’s controversial Secretary of Education, claimed that increases in financial aid have enabled colleges and universities to raise tuition, because they were confident that federal loan subsidies would cushion the increase—and that the flow of dollars would be uninterrupted. \nThe intervening years have supported that view. In the recent past, average undergraduate tuition nearly jumped nearly two fold from $6,950 in 2001 to over $10,000 in 2012 dollars, a real increase rate of over 3.5% annually. Even during the depths of the Great Recession, money was poured into the Department of Education and funding for student loans increased. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T19:33:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
