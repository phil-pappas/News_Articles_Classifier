Photo: Bloomberg\nBHP Billiton is big enough to handle a $US2.8 billion ($3.7 billion) pre-tax writedown of the value of its shale oil and gas assets in the United States. They are still in BHP's books about $US24 billion after the writedown, and BHP itself is valued at $140 billion.\nThe writedown provides more evidence that the group's $US20 billion US shale invasion in 2011 has not been a winner, however.\nIt was part of a shale oil boom in the US that has added about 9 million barrels a day to global production, and persuaded Saudi Arabia to stop rationing production and begin producing more oil at lower prices.\nThe Saudi shift was intended to force the oil price down and undermine the economics and expansion potential of oil shale, and it has.\nShale oil and gas production is capital intensive, because production from shale wells tails off quickly. Companies must continue drilling to maintain or grow production when prices are strong. The flip side is that when prices are weak, low profit or no-profit production can be cut quickly by slowing development spending.\nShale producers are, in other words, structurally set up to be swing producers, and Saudi Arabia is producing its oil to the max to make sure they take on the role: BHP's shale spending, for example, peaked at $US4.8 billion in the year to June 2013, was $US3.4 billion in the year to June just completed, and will fall to $1.5 billion in the year to June just begun.\nBHP bought shale gas tenements in Arkansas for $US4.75 billion in February 2011. Five months later it paid $US15.1 billion to take over an American shale gas and oil pioneer, Petrohawk.\nIt marked the value of its Arkansas assets down by $US2.8 billion in 2012 as booming shale gas production pushed US gas prices down. The bulk of the new writedown is on its Hawkville gas and liquids field, one of the assets it picked up with the Petrohawk takeover.\nA low US gas price is still in the valuation mix: shale gas production is still keeping US domestic gas prices low.\nBHP is believed to have not materially lowered its longer-term oil and gas price forecasts as part of its latest asset impairment review, however. The new $US2.8 billion writedown is driven mainly by a reassessment of the geology of Hawkville, which is proving more complicated and expensive to exploit than expected, and because BHP is complying with lease retention conditions at Hawkville by spending money to drill and develop the resource that it would otherwise hold back until prices improve.\nBHP's petroleum division boss Tim Cutt says the impairment charges do not therefore reflect the quality of the rest of BHP's US onshore portfolio. It includes oil and liquids-heavy plays in Texas, and a high-quality dry-gas field in Louisiana, Haynesville, that Cutt says is \"an excellent development option as market conditions improve\".\nThe high capital intensity of shale production means, however, that it is always going to be driven up and down by the oil price â€“ and at current prices BHP's US shale business is far from lucrative, and quite possibly still overvalued. Citigroup's oil and gas team says, for example, that it values BHP's shale assets at $US11.2 billion, using oil and gas prices that are 32 per cent and 26 per cent higher than current market prices.\nBHP has been driving its shale production costs down, and it said on Wednesday that it could generate positive free cashflow from its shale portfolio at an oil price of $US60 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI), and a US gas price of $US3 a thousand cubic feet.\nIts cashflow \"break-even\" prices are under pressure, however. WTI oil averaged $US69.68 a barrel in the year to June 2015 but is currently about $US53.34 a barrel, was as low as $US43.46 in March, and has averaged just over $US53 a barrel this calendar year. The \"Henry Hub\" benchmark price for US domestic gas averaged $US3.32 a thousand cubic feet in the year to June 30, but has averaged $US2.86 a thousand cubic feet so far this calendar year, and is now $2.84.\nPrices well above BHP's cashflow break-even level are, of course, needed if BHP is to generate a satisfactory return on funds invested: and with Saudi Arabia flooding the market with oil, significantly higher prices are not generally expected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:09:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
