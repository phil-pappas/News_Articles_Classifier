Axa already has a multibillion-pound black hole in its pension fund. \nStephen Yandle, chairman of Axa UK Pension Trustees said: “This is a very positive step in providing additional security of members’ pensions.” \nThere will be no impact on payments as a result of the deal, he added. \nThe longevity swap means the trustees will pay Reinsurance Group of America an annual premium based on a model of how long scheme members are expected to live. The US company will then pay pensions, suffering the impact if the calculations underestimate life spans. \nCharles Cowling of JLT Employee Benefits said: \"We will see the number of longevity swap deals increase significantly. An insurer taking on the liabilities of a pension fund is a weight off the mind of many corporates. \n“Rising deficits and liabilities are a major drag on the sponsoring company of a scheme and we're beginning to see their impacts being reflected in share prices. A proactive approach to reducing pension risk is now a well-established route for companies and BT, Aviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) and Scottish Power have all been recent high profile examples of this type of transaction.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T23:30:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
