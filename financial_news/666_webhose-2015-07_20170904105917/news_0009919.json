But that doesn’t make investors any smarter.\nStock research was a problem in years past, with earnings data and other key information slow to trickle out. Now, 10-Qs are posted on investor relations websites in short order, and thanks to screening software, a savvy investor can size up a company or an entire industry sector in a few hours.\nBut the glut of information presents a challenge of its own, as many investors become overwhelmed by headlines and analysis. There are many valuable tools and reports out there, but there is also a lot of noise — and that makes acting on the facts that really matter increasingly difficult.\nAs the old saying goes, “Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.”\nHere’s why oil is in bear territory (1:03) Oil prices are sinking amid a global glut of crude, and the market isn’t betting on a speedy rebound. Sarah Kent reports. Photo: AP\nIn regular correspondence with readers and investors, I find myself revisiting a short list of misconceptions. So I’d like to address them. Here are five ways investors are misled by numbers in this age of infinite data:\n1. Market-cap horse races\nIt may get attention to post headlines like “Apple’s Market Cap Loses $60 Billion After iPhone Sales Disappoint.” But a lack of context makes these moves seem bigger than they are.\nFor instance, Apple AAPL, -1.07% stock is still killing it — with shares up 13% year-to-date and up 30% in the last year. So who cares even if $60 billion sounds large?\nEven worse is when you replace dollar amounts with companies, like “Google just ‘added an Uber’ to its market cap.” There are already enough crazies out there who think Google GOOGL, +1.59% will eventually buy Uber without that kind of irresponsible headline conflating an earnings pop with an acquisition. Big companies are worth a lot of money, and even a small move can have big dollars attached to it.\n2. ‘Cheap’ stock obsession\nCoverage of penny stocks is a cottage industry despite the fact that nominal share price doesn’t matter. While there are some small and cheap companies with big potential, most stocks that trade for a dollar or less are dogs and have been battered for a reason.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-earnings-boosted-by-iphone-sales-1437510647", "http://www.businessinsider.com/google-market-cap-added-an-uber-after-earnings-2015-7"], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T17:38:38.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
