The announcement sent IG’s shares down more than five percent in early trading. \n“The Board is disappointed to lose somebody with Tim's proven leadership skills but fully understands his decision,” said chairman Andy Green. \nMr Howkins’ retirement comes nine months after Mr Green was appointed as IG Group’s chairman. His tenure as chief executive has taken IG’s revenues from £12m to almost £400m, and grown the firm’s overseas operations to now make up half of all turnover, the firm said. * From the archives: Tim Howkins interview Peter Hetherington, chief operating officer, will take over as interim boss while the firm starts the search for a permanent chief executive. \nIG Group also reported a 4.9pc rise in revenues to £388.4m for the year to the end of May, despite the £27m losses sustained in January when the Swiss franc was abruptly untethered from the euro, sending the currency up as much as 30pc during a frantic day of trading . \nIG had already warned that the Swiss chaos would cost it up to £30m in irrecoverable trading losses among its clients. Fewer than 100 customers still have open cases with the firm, of the 342 who initially owed money when the franc sent their trading positions into the red. \n“We recognise that the scale of the move was beyond anyone's expectations and we are being sympathetic to debtors' ability to pay, accepting less than the full amount of the debt where this is justified by the financial circumstances of the individual,” the firm said. \nPre (Shanghai: 600048.SS - news ) -tax profits for the year fell 13pc to £169.5m as administrative costs rose by £27.3m. IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) attributed this spike in spending to higher marketing costs along with the launch of an execution-only stockbroking service in the UK, Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) and the Netherlands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T12:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T12:08:58.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
