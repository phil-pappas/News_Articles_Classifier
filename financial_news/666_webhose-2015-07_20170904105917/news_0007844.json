German Chancellor Angela Merkel's deputy said Athens had wrecked any hope of compromise with its euro zone partners by overwhelmingly rejecting further austerity.\nAt 0602 GMT, futures for the Euro STOXX 50, Germany's DAX and France's CAC were 2.5 to 3.1 percent lower. Britain's FTSE futures fell 1.1 percent.\nGreek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis also announced his resignation on Monday, saying he had been \"made aware\" that some members of the euro zone considered him unwelcome at meetings of finance ministers.
