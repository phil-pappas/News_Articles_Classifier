But at the same time we say that the requirements for starting negotiations about a concrete ESM programme are not present at the moment,\" she said.\nThe two leaders were due to pursue discussions over dinner. The two have requested an emergency meeting of euro zone leaders in Brussels on Tuesday to discuss Greece.
