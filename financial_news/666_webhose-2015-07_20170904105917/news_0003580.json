(NASDAQ: FCFS ), a leading international operator of retail pawn stores in the U.S. and Mexico, today announced revenue, net income and earnings per share for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015. \nMr. Rick Wessel, chief executive officer, stated, \"We are pleased to report solid second quarter results driven by strong core pawn revenue growth of 16%, led by a 20% increase in consolidated retail sales. This growth was realized through a combination of improving same-store core revenue growth and new store additions, including recent acquisitions of 27 pawn stores in North Carolina, Virginia and Kentucky. Our operations in Mexico continue to generate strong local-currency revenue, earnings and transaction growth although the strength of the U.S. dollar and the resulting downward pressure on the Mexican peso has reduced dollar-reported earnings. As a result of the increased negative volatility of the peso over the last month, along with anticipated further declines in scrap jewelry and payday lending earnings, we are now projecting full-year earnings to be in a range of $2.60 to $2.75 per diluted share.\" \nNote: All growth rates presented above and in \"Revenue Highlights\" and \"Pawn Operating Metrics\" are calculated on a constant currency basis. The average exchange rate of the Mexican peso decreased 18% and 15% during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively, compared to the comparable prior-year periods. \nEarnings Highlights Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2015 totaled $0.47 compared to $0.55 in the same prior-year period. Second quarter 2015 earnings were impacted by approximately $0.04 per share in non-recurring expenses related to acquisition costs and payday lending store closures. On a comparative basis with the prior year, second quarter 2015 earnings were reduced by an additional $0.11 per share due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and decreases in non-core jewelry scrapping and payday lending operations. A summary of comparative earnings per share impacts is included elsewhere in this release. Year-to-date diluted earnings per share were $1.06 compared to $1.32 in the same prior-year period. Comparative earnings for the first half of 2015 were impacted by $0.43 per share, primarily due to the impacts described above and in the summary of comparative earnings per share impacts included elsewhere in this release. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $141.5 million, an increase of 6% on a constant currency basis. Net income was $76.6 million for the trailing twelve month period. A reconciliation of EBITDA to net income is provided elsewhere in this release. \nRevenue Highlights Core pawn revenue from retail merchandise sales and pawn service fees increased 16% during the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014. Total revenue increased to $167.6 million, an 11% improvement, reflecting strong growth in core pawn revenues partially offset by a 30% decline in total non-core payday lending and jewelry scrapping revenues. Retail merchandise sales increased by 20% for the second quarter of 2015, compared to the prior-year period, with increases of 22% in Mexico and 17% in the U.S. Pawn fee revenue grew 10% in total compared to the prior-year period, with increases of 11% and 8% in Mexico and the U.S., respectively. Same-store revenue growth from core pawn operations (excluding scrap jewelry sales and consumer loan fees) increased 8% in Mexico and 4% overall in the second quarter compared to the prior-year period. The overall growth was net of a 1% decrease in U.S. same-store revenues, which represented a significant sequential improvement over the 3% decline recorded in the first quarter of 2015. For the first half of 2015, 52% of revenues were from operations in Mexico which are primarily conducted in Mexican pesos and translated into U.S. dollars, for financial reporting purposes, at the weighted average exchange rate for the period. On a constant currency basis using the prior year exchange rate, 55% of first half revenues would have been generated in Mexico. Driven by a 7% decrease in the market price of gold and a 30% decline in volume, revenue from non-core wholesale scrap jewelry operations decreased 37% in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014. The gross margin for scrap jewelry sales improved to 19% in the second quarter of 2015, compared to 17% in the prior-year period. Non-core consumer loan revenue from payday and title lending operations decreased 19% in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014. The decline in non-core consumer loan revenues reflects the Company's on-going strategic downsizing of these operations. The Company's U.S. consumer loan business comprised only 4% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2015. \nPawn Operating Metrics The consolidated gross margin on retail merchandise sales remained solid at 38% during the second quarter of 2015, given the continued shift in the Company's consolidated retail product mix toward general merchandise inventory that carries slightly lower margins than retail jewelry items. Pawn loans receivable increased by 10% on a year-over-year basis at quarter end as pawn loans grew equally in both the U.S. and Mexico. On a same-store basis, pawn loans increased slightly in Mexico, with loan growth remaining stronger in the interior markets, offset by decreases in certain mature markets mostly in northern Mexico regions. Same-store pawn loans were down 4% in the U.S., a slight improvement compared to December 2014 when the loans declined 5% due largely to the impact of lower gasoline prices on U.S. pawn loan demand. Consolidated annualized inventory turns for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2015 were 3.5 times per year. Aged inventories (items held for over a year) accounted for approximately 6% of total inventories, which slightly exceeded the Company's historical average due primarily to aged inventories in recently acquired stores. Excluding inventories in the stores acquired during the past twelve months, aged inventories represented only 4% of total inventories. Total inventories at June 30, 2015 increased 23% over the prior-year period, in-line with store growth and largely driven by acquisitions. \nStore Count Activity Year-to-date, a total of 53 stores have been added as the Company acquired 29 large format pawn store locations in the U.S. and opened 24 new stores in Mexico. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2015, the Company added 133 net new large format pawn locations, representing a 17% increase in the total number of large format pawn stores. In June 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of a 25-store chain of large format pawn stores with 24 locations in North Carolina and one in Virginia. In addition, the Company acquired two pawn stores located in Kentucky in a separate asset purchase transaction. Second quarter earnings results include non-recurring transaction and integration costs of approximately $0.03 per share associated with acquisition activities. As previously announced, the Company intends to close seven additional consumer lending locations in Texas during the second half of 2015 as part of its strategy to further reduce exposure to payday lending products. This represents a 12% decrease in the number of U.S. consumer lending locations, and will reduce the number of total remaining U.S. locations to 51 stores, all of which are in Texas. As of June 30, 2015, the Company operated 1,046 stores composed of 694 stores in Mexico, of which 651 are large format, full-service pawn stores and 352 stores in the U.S., of which 283 are large format, full-service pawn stores. \nFinancial Metrics Pre-tax store operating margins were 25% for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2015. Excluding the impacts of non-core payday lending and wholesale scrap jewelry operations, operating efficiency remained consistent with the prior year. The EBITDA margin was 20% for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2015 and the net operating margin (pre-tax income) was 15% for the same period. The calculation of EBITDA margin is provided elsewhere in this release. The Company's return on equity for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2015 was 17% and the return on assets was 11% for the same period. \nLiquidity As of June 30, 2015, the Company had $77 million in cash on its balance sheet and $114 million of availability for future borrowings under its long-term revolving bank credit facilities. The average interest rate on the Company's $56 million currently outstanding bank debt is 2.69%. The leverage ratio at June 30, 2015 (outstanding indebtedness divided by trailing twelve months EBITDA) was 1.8:1. Net debt, defined as funded debt less invested cash, was $189 million at June 30, 2015. The leverage ratio of EBITDA to net debt was 0.7:1 and the ratio of net debt to equity was 0.4:1. Cash provided by operating activities was $91 million for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2015, while free cash flow totaled $72 million. Free cash flow is defined in the detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures provided elsewhere in this release. The Company authorized a two million share stock repurchase plan in January 2015. Year-to-date through June 30, 2015, the Company has repurchased 463,000 shares under the plan at an aggregate cost of $23 million. For the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2015, the Company invested $84 million in acquisitions, $20 million in capital expenditures and $54 million in stock repurchases, funded primarily with operating cash flows and a $37 million increase in net debt. \nFiscal 2015 Outlook Due to the significant further weakening of the Mexican peso during the first and second quarters of 2015, combined with further declines in the price of gold and additional downsizing of the Company's U.S. payday operations, the Company is updating its fiscal full-year 2015 earnings guidance to a range of $2.60 to $2.75 per diluted share. This compares to the previous guidance at the lower end of the range of $2.75 to $2.90 per share. The Company's previous guidance, at the low end of the original fiscal 2015 range, was based on a projected exchange rate of approximately 15.25 Mexican pesos / U.S. dollar for June and the remainder of the year. Based upon the continued volatility and recent further weakening of the exchange rate, we are now assuming an exchange rate in a range of 15.5 to 16.25 Mexican pesos / U.S. dollar for the balance of the year. Accordingly, the incremental foreign currency exchange rate impact for the second half of the year is estimated to be an additional $0.04 to $0.08 per share of earnings headwind. The previous assumption for the price of gold for 2015 was in a range of $1,200 to $1,300 per ounce. Assuming a revised range of $1,100 to $1,200 per ounce based on current market conditions, coupled with a reduction in expected gold transaction volumes, the impact to second half earnings from reduced scrap jewelry profits is in a range of approximately $0.03 to $0.05 per share. The updated fiscal 2015 earnings estimates are further tempered by a greater than expected year-over-year decline in earnings from payday and title lending operations driven in large part by new payday regulations in Texas and the strategic closure of additional locations by the Company. As a result, the Company has reduced its previous second half forecast for consumer lending earnings by $0.02 per share. Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 that factor in the anticipated headwinds mentioned above are expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.66 per diluted share. The Company now expects to add approximately 80 to 90 new stores in 2015. A majority of the additions are expected to be de novo large format pawn stores in Mexico. \nAdditional Commentary and Analysis \nMr. Wessel further commented on the second quarter results, \"Led by our stores in Mexico, the retail sales component of our pawn operations was again a significant growth driver, as we continued to generate strong same-store merchandise sales growth while maintaining industry-leading retail margins. Our inventory levels of popular consumer merchandise remain well positioned with minimal levels of aged inventory. We also experienced second quarter growth in both pawn fee revenues and receivables, with same-store pawn loan improvement in many of our key markets.\" \n\"We added 36 total locations during the second quarter and are on track to meet our 2015 store opening target. The June acquisition including 24 stores in North Carolina is of significant note, as it establishes a new market for First Cash and fits strategically into our existing footprint in the southeast/mid-Atlantic states. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2015, we added 133 net new large format pawn locations, representing a 17% increase, and we currently have 1,047 total locations.\" \n\"While our operations in Mexico continue to generate significant local-currency revenue and earnings growth, the strength of the U.S. dollar continues to impact our reported results in Mexico, with the average exchange rate of the peso decreasing 18% during the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the prior-year period. Although consolidated earnings have been impacted by the peso volatility, we have not seen a significant effect on customer traffic or local peso-denominated transaction metrics and margins in Mexico. Additionally, peso earnings are retained in Mexico where they are utilized to fund local operations, working capital and store growth, rather than being exported and exchanged into U.S. dollars.\" \n\"Our cash flows and balance sheet are strong, which should provide the capacity and flexibility to further drive shareholder value. The Company's long-term credit facilities, which include a combination of the senior notes with long-term fixed-rate financing and bank facilities with flexibility on borrowings at favorable rates, provide additional working and investment capital for organic growth, strategic acquisitions and future share buybacks. Our current leverage ratio of 1.8:1 indicates our capacity for additional leverage as future accretive investment opportunities arise.\" \n\"The strength of our cash flows and balance sheet enabled the Company to repurchase 463,000 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $23 million during the first half of 2015. Over the past twelve months, First Cash has invested $158 million in capital expenditures, acquisitions and stock repurchases with a nominal $37 million increase in net debt.\" \n\"We continue to believe that our pawn operations in both Mexico and the U.S. are well positioned to provide affordable short-term credit to unbanked and underbanked consumers in markets with favorable population and demographic trends. Although we continue to be challenged by headwinds from weaker foreign currency exchange rates, lower gold prices and the expected decline in our non-core payday operations, First Cash has demonstrated a history of consistent revenue and earnings growth in our core, currency adjusted pawn operations.\" \nForward-Looking Information \nThis release contains forward-looking statements about the business, financial condition and prospects of First Cash Financial Services, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (together, the \"Company\").
