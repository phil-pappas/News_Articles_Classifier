Of course he would; it’s so incredibly American to boast. \nMuch has been said about US corporate raiders such as Ader arriving on our sleepy shores. But rather than batten down the hatches against these aggressive agitators, UK Plc has been encouraged by the City to discuss and negotiate with such figures in the interests of shareholder value. However, while that all may sound rather cordial, the actual negotiations between business and activist have often proved to be distinctly ugly. \nWhile there were champagne toasts last week at Ader’s SpringOwl headquarters in New York, the bullishness about the activist’s success rate rather glossed over last year’s initial, bitter spat between Bwin and Ader, a former Bear Stearns gaming analyst. \nLast year Ader, who had built up a 5pc stake in Bwin, said the gaming firm’s hiring of former 3i chief executive Philip Yea made him “question whether the choices made by [Bwin’s] board were in line with the goal of restoring shareholder value”. Ader also launched a campaign website called “SaveBwinParty.com” and pushed for four of his nominees to join the board. Thanks to Bwin’s spinners, these nominees were scorned for their independence . But on the morning of last May’s shareholder showdown a truce was called and SpringOwl was given one board seat. \nJason Ader launched a sustained campaign against Bwin last year before calling a truce \nSuddenly, Ader was “looking forward to working with Philip Yea”. Less than a year on, it appears that he has developed such a “strong relationship with Philip” that he even felt comfortable enough - after months of vague takeover rumours - to present Bwin’s chairman with 888 as a bidder. \nAder did not hide his light under a bushel when it came to taking credit for the 888 deal. “I brought 888 into the process to maximise shareholder value because I believe not only are 888 the best buyer for this company but that its management team will realise significant long-term synergy value for our shareholders with the least amount of execution and regulatory risk,” he said. \nHowever, his words are now being carefully re-read by Bwin investors after The Telegraph revealed rival bidder GVC could be gearing up for another tilt . Regulatory risk is removed if Amaya (NasdaqGS: AYA - news ) , which is being investigated by US officials, is no longer part of GVC’s party. But then it becomes a question of how GVC intends to pull off a takeover of a business more than three times its size. With no existing bonds or loans to speak of, Aim-listed GVC would have to tap public markets for the first time. \nThere is plenty of cash sloshing around loan and debt markets, but a sizeable bid for a company in unregulated gaming markets would require some scrutiny from credit committees. GVC also has an uphill battle as it has to not only trump 888’s offer but get Ader to swallow his pride. A spoonful of cash might help humble pie go down, but a 110p-a-share deal with 888 will mean a huge and certain return for Ader, who originally bought his stake from Bwin’s divorced founders last February when the stock was trading at just 11p. \n= Profits at the Panel = \nBidding wars are a sure-fire sign that dealmaking is back with a vengeance, and bankers are already suggesting that this year promises to outstrip the heady heights of the debt-fuelled peak in 2007. But there may be no better barometer of boardroom brouhaha than the UK’s Takeover Panel annual accounts. \nBritain’s takeover watchdog has reported a surplus of cash for its financial year after enjoying the upturn in deal making following several years of decline. The uptick has meant that the Panel, which is governed by a collection of investment bankers on secondment and City grandees, has swung back into the black. The Panel reported a 25pc jump in its income to £12.1m from £9.7m and posted a cash surplus of £70,749. Last year the watchdog posted an annual loss of £1.6m during its financial year after another bleak year of UK takeovers and the cost of holding a lavish conference for international regulators. \nThe Panel’s annual report also mentions Pfizer’s headline-grabbing £69bn approach for British drug maker AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN - news ) , which put the watchdog under the spotlight. There had been criticism that Pfizer’s promises on British jobs and research were not worth the paper they were written on, with Labour seizing on Kraft’s closure of Cadbury’s Bourneville after its controversial takeover. There was much discussion about how Pfizer (NYSE: PFE - news ) could be made to keep its word on jobs without flouting European rules or the Government’s commitment that Britain was open for business. \nPfizer offered up commitments to AstraZeneca, but there was a fierce debate about whether these would be honoured \nAs a result of the Pfizer controversy, the Panel was given new powers to police bidders’ promises, by appointing independent supervisors and requesting written reports for up to five years. However, it remains murky territory. The Panel settled on a rather clumsy approach in an effort to define the honourableness of a bidder - and whether they are making a post-offer “intention statement” or a post-offer “undertaking”. Only an “undertaking” is monitored for five years, while an “intention statement” must just be correct and “based on reasonable grounds”. \nAs a result, bidders will now be happy to shower intentions about jobs when it comes to future sensitive takeovers, realising that it shows willing but little commitment. And target companies will instead want to insist on undertakings. This spells another messy battleground that could simply serve to kill off future deals. \nThe Takeover Panel's office in Paternoster Square", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T00:06:55.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
