James Davies Share on twitter by Michael Smith There is now no escaping the fact the big Australian banks will have to raise billions of dollars to meet tough new regulatory requirements, but they have been given some wriggle room in the way their capital strength is measured against their global peers.\nThe banking regulator has flagged a less rigid approach than previously expected by saying the banks do not necessarily have to adhere strictly to a benchmark based on what their global peers are doing.\nThis does not mean the banks are off the hook with meeting new capital requirements, which they have been preparing for.\nAnalysts estimate this will need to raise up to $30 billion between them, although there were some suggestions Monday that the regulator's recommendations could see those estimates reduced.\nA study released by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) found the banks' common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, a key measure of their strength, is outside the top quartile of international peers but above the median.\nBased on that, it says will need to improve their capital adequacy ratios by at least 200 basis points compared to June last year, but they would not be strictly tied to an international benchmark that would have forced the banks to obey what regulators in other countries were telling banks with less domestic-focused operations to do.\nIn other words APRA wants the Australian banks to be strong compared to their global peers but not necessarily as strong as the strongest.\nThe findings are not consistent with a PwC study commissioned by the banks last year which found banks were at or above the 75th percentile of bank capital relative to global peers, a claim which raised a few eyebrows.\n APRA's comments, one of two key recommendations it will make on capital requirements, were reflected in bank stocks , which fell around 0.9 per cent in early trade on Monday, although ANZ fell further than the others with a 1.1 per cent decline.\nIt was confirmation that they will need to raise more capital but hardly a bombshell that had not already been factored in by the markets.\nNational Australia Bank was first off the market to respond, saying it had already increased its CET1 ratio from 8.46 per cent to about 10 per cent following a $5.5 billion rights issue in May.\nThe APRA comments are a sign it will take a less dogmatic approach to the issue than some banks were worried about and introduce the new changes in an orderly manner. It did not specify a timeframe for the introduction of the new measures.\nThe banks will hardly applaud the new measures but will be satisfied APRA has given them a path for an orderly transition to the new regulatory regime. The devil will still be in the detail, however, and there is still a recommendation to come around how the banks carry higher risk weightings against mortgage books.\nMichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-greece-on-the-brink-20150713-gias8r", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR", "http://www.twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-07-13T08:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T10:43:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
