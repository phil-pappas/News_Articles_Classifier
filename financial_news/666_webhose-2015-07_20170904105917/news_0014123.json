Various options to alleviate the effect on production are being evaluated,\" First Quantum said in second quarter results late on Wednesday.\n\"Agreement has been reached to redirect the majority of Sentinel's power allocation to enable Kansanshi to operate close to full capacity, while delaying the ramp-up at Sentinel.\"\nKansanshi mine was earlier projected to produce 250 to 265 tonnes of finished copper while the Sentinel was expected to produce up to 100,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate in 2015.
