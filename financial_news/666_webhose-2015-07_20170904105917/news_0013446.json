The U.S. thermal coal sector is oversupplied by some 50 million tons, according to consulting firm IHS Inc. Alpha’s operations are massive enough that the closing of just a handful of its mines could eat into that surplus. It planned to supply as much as 63 million tons of the thermal coal burned by power plants this year. It also accounts for a fifth of all U.S. metallurgical coal production.\n“Mines are going to have to go away,” said Jim Thompson, director of coal at IHS, in Knoxville, Tennessee. “We are in an environment in which mines that are not competitive have to close or the industry will continue to be ill.”\nAlpha’s footprint is huge. It had at least 58 mines producing coal in the second quarter, accounting for more than 8 percent of the active U.S. total, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Andrew Cosgrove and William Foiles. And that’s down from 67 producing mines a year prior.\nAll but two of its mines are in Appalachia, a region that’s been ceding market share to rival coal regions in recent years and is no stranger to shuttered mines.\nPowder River The others are in the Powder River Basin, a mineral-rich swath of sage grass and antelope stretching from central Wyoming into Montana. The region boasts the nation’s largest and cheapest reserves, which come in 60-foot coal seams cheaply scooped out of the earth without tunneling underground. It’s been called the Saudi Arabia of coal because of its seeming resilience to the collapse in prices.\nA complete shutdown of a mine in the Powder River Basin would be unprecedented, James Stevenson, director of North American thermal coal at IHS, said. Companies have closed parts of mining sites in Wyoming, but have never shuttered an entire operation, he said.\nAnd yet, so oversupplied is the current coal market -- and so fast is demand at power plants falling off -- that nothing appears to be off the table.\n“It’s a painful bit of medication,” said Hans Daniels, executive vice president for Doyle Trading Consultants LLC, a Grand Junction, Colorado-based coal analytics company. “But what’s needed is for these mines to close.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T04:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T01:57:10.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
