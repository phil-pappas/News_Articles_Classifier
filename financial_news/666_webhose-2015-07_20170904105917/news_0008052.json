The debt sale is being arranged by Wells Fargo & Co. and Barclays Plc.\nAndrea Eisenmenger, a spokeswoman for the Ontario, California-based company, didn’t respond to an e-mail and a call before normal business hours. Representatives of Wells Fargo and Barclays declined to comment.\nPrime Healthcare has been the subject of an administrative subpoena and investigation from the Department of Justice regarding a labor dispute for over two years, according to its website . Its debt, which is rated six levels below investment grade, may be cut further if it faces an adverse outcome with respect to ongoing investigations or litigation, according to a July 20 Moody’s Investors Service report.\nThe company owns and operates 27 hospitals focusing on acute care, the report said. The company had about $2.5 billion in revenue in the 12 months through March, according to Moody’s.\nProceeds from the rest of the deal will repay the company’s revolving credit line, refinance a term loan and fund previously announced acquisitions, Moody’s said.", "external_links": ["http://www.primehealthcare.com/About-Us/Facts-About-Prime-Healthcare.aspx\\"], "published": "2015-07-24T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T22:17:54.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
