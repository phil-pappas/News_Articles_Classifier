No agreement has been reached and discussions could still fall apart. Coyote is backed by New York-based private equity firm Warburg Pincus, which first invested in the company in 2007.\nA deal between Coyote and UPS would be the third-largest logistics deal this year, as the industry goes through a wave of consolidation amid rising consumer demand. In April, FedEx Corp. agreed to buy Dutch parcel-delivery company TNT Express NV for $4.8 billion. Later that month, XPO Logistics Inc. agreed to acquire European counterpart Norbert Dentressangle SA in a deal valued at $3.53 billion including debt.\nWarburg Pincus has backed the company with bolt-on acquisitions, including Access America Transport last year. While terms for that deal werenâ€™t disclosed, Coyote said in a statement that the combined company would be one of the biggest third-party logistics providers in North America, with run rate revenue of more than $2 billion, 17 locations and about 1,750 employees.\nRepresentatives for Warburg Pincus and Coyote declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Atlanta-based UPS.", "external_links": ["http://www.warburgpincus.com/investments/coyote-logistics/\\", "http://www.coyote.com/press/coyote-logistics-and-access-america-transport-to-merge\\"], "published": "2015-07-23T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:16:52.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
