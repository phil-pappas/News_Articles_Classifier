The Business Advocate show is a weekly business advocacy show organized by the BUSAC Fund in association with the Ghana Journalists Association and the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation. \nHe noted that many of the Association's members, including Hairdressers Associations, Associations of Garages, Barbers, and Bakers among others, spent almost 80 percent of their capital on rent as they were required to pay between two and five years rent advance. Sometimes they had to pay the same amount again after the first advance period elapses. \nThis situation, he said, had led to the closure of about 500 of such businesses nationwide, leading to unemployment for about 2000 people. \n'The sector employs even more people than government because we employ many people, including those on the streets. Some members are closing down due to rent problems leading to unemployment and people going back to the streets,' he stated. \nHe also attributed the high cost of rent to the influx of foreigners into Ghana's retail sector where some of CIBA's members who could afford to pay high amounts to the landlords for rent, operated. \nHe stated that CIBA had been engaging the Rent Control Department to solve the issues and had been part of initial stages of an ongoing review of the Rent Act, adding however that the Department had come up with a new draft document for review, which did not solicit the input of CIBA. \n'Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies should be innovative and create a light industrial area with accommodations for indigenous businesses to rent from them', he stated. \nMr. Hafis Iddrisu, Rent Manager at the Rent Control Department of the Ministry of Water Resources, Works and Housing, said although some aspects of the Act could be described as irrelevant now, there were other aspects that were still relevant, thus the ongoing review was to address such irrelevant areas by coming up with contemporary ways of rent control. \nHe said the penalty for landlords who flout the no rent advance exceeding six months rule for instance, was not deterrent enough. According to the Act, those who flout it are currently fined about GHÂ¢10.00, which allowed landlords to continue demanding more than six months advance from prospective tenants. \n'A more deterrent penalty may ensure adherence,' he said. \nHe urged tenants who had problems with their landlords and vice versa, to file complaints with the department in order to ensure adherence to the rent Law, as the Department could not act if complaints were not made. \nMr. Iddrisu said the review process was at the stage where a Validation Workshop had to be held on the draft bill before it was sent to Parliament. However, due to delays in disbursements of its budget allocation, it had not been able to organize the workshop. \nHe assured tenants and businesses that the workshop would be organized by end of the year to allow the process to continue. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T03:58:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
