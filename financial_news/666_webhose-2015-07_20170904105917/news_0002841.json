This has complicated a restructuring the company has been going through to deal with its debts. \nThe company was forced to take nearly $2 billion in impairment charges and write-offs on its 2014 results due to a fall in oil prices and a realisation that reserves at an oil field in Iraqi Kurdistan had been overstated.
