Reasonable financial assistance to allow the Greek banking system and economy to continue functioning,\" Hayes said in a statement issued by Fine Gael.\n\"The resources of the EU structural and cohesion funds and funding from the ECB will be needed to support investment and help the economy return to growth ... Debt restructuring and reprofiling will be a necessary part of negotiations.\"\nHe said the Greek government would have to implement reforms and become more cooperative in negotiations.\n\"If negotiations are to proceed in an atmosphere of compromise it is also necessary that Greek political leaders ditch their aggressive, provocative language,\" he said.
