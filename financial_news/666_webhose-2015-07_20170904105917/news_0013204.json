PUBLISHED: 09:34, Wed, Jul 1, 2015 | UPDATED: 09:58, Wed, Jul 1, 2015 The Share Centre Richard Stone, chief executive of the Share Centre \nIn an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk Richard Stone revealed why he personally believes a 'Brexit' – leaving the EU - may be the best solution for Britain.As head of one of Britain's leading self-select stockbrokers Mr Stone has seen first-hand how legislation directives from Europe have thrown up numerous problems for British investors and markets. He doesn't believe that Brussels-based lawmakers fully understand the needs of personal investors in Britain, which makes it near impossible of them to suitably regulate the market. \"People don't realise that we have already given up control of UK financial services regulation and that this all now originates out of Europe,\" Mr Stone told Express.co.uk. The Buckinghamshire-based boss fears that David Cameron will not be able to wrest back control of Britain's financial services regulation as part of his negotiations on membership of the Union ahead of the in/ out referendum to be held before 2017. He said: \"The EU generally has a very different economic approach to the UK. \"European states typically favour more state intervention in the running of the economy and in terms of policy tend to be more protectionist.\" AP David Cameron has started discussions over EU membership \nMr Stone pointed to the EU's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), as an example of a policy that isn't entirely suited the British market. The first draft of the legislation would actually have outlawed people trading equities on a self-select basis. Though the wording has since been amended, it demonstrates the differences between Britain and Europe toward personal investing and risk.Mr Stone said: “The European regulation mindset is one of protecting people from themselves.\"They don't have the same equity market culture on the continent that we have here. “Savers on the continent typically don't invest in equities in the same way that they do in this country - there is a greater emphasis on bonds and debt financing of companies.\"The continental European mindset is more typically that people should be prevented from doing things that are risky. This manifests itself in there not being the same range of service providers offering investment services to personal investors.\"Mr Stone believes that a critical issue around membership of the EU is whether the UK has the power to interpret or take ownership of financial regulation that has come out of Brussels.For instance, the 'Prospectus Directive' is another piece of EU legislation that is poorly suited to the British market, said Mr Stone. The rules mean that if a company wants to raise more than €5million (£3.5million) they have to issue a detailed prospectus for investors. Such documents are expensive and time consuming to create and the rules are better suited for markets where this is a large amount of money. In Britain the directive acts as a barrier to firms reaching out to personal investors to raise capital, according to Mr Stone. He says that the regulation makes it difficult for companies that want to raise capital simply and easily from smaller investors, and disadvantages personal investors who get locked out of discounted placings.The firms now prefer placings to small numbers of institutions in order to bypass these rules. The chief executive also believes that fears Britain would be disadvanatged through lost trade if were to leave the EU are not necessarily well founded. He said: \"Over the coming years, growth is going to come from China and emerging markets where we could do equally well, with good trading arrangements, as we do with Europe.”In the lead up to the in/out referendum the Share Centre plans to gauge the views and concerns of its 250,000 customers and reflect them to the market. Mr Stone says that the firm will provide a platform to British personal investors to discuss and champion a variety of key issues that should form part of the discussions and negotiation process. The Share Centre is one of Britain’s leading independent self-select stockbrokers and caters to more than £2.7bn of personal investors' assets.
