Guidelines a sham – Greens \nGreen Party energy spokesman Gareth Hughes doesn't believe the guidelines protect animals or people from heavy metals in soil and are \"less stringent\" than existing laws. \nHe's called them \"another fake solution\" from the Government which makes it look like they're doing something when they're not. \n\"The guidelines suggest that a farmer can graze stock on land that’s previously been used as a toxic petroleum waste dump, with no requirement that the soil, or the milk that the cows produce, be tested for contamination by persistent heavy metal contaminants,\" he says. \nBut far from it, the Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand says. \n\"Landfarming and the benefits it brings is actually a good story to tell,\" chief executive Cameron Madgwick says. \nHe believes the report will \"alleviate any concerns\" farmers and food producers had about the practice. \n\"Today’s release coupled with other reports released on the practice show that not only is landfarming a safe practice, it can also be a profitable one for farmers.\" \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T04:39:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
