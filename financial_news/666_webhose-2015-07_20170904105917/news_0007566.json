We're waiting to see what is happening with the Greek situation,\" Mr Weston said. \nMr Weston said investors seemed to be content for now with the market around the 5,500 point level. \n\"We probably need to see a really big new catalyst other than the macro concerns: Greece and China clearing up. US earnings season could help.\" \nBut after the local market had closed, it was announced that after marathon talks involving Greece and eurozone leaders on Monday, unanimous agreement on a Greek bailout finally had been reached. \nIn China, the share market has continued its recovery from weeks of volatility as several firms resumed trading. Also, mixed economic data showed a pick-up in China's export growth, but two-way trade fell in the first half of the year. \nIn the resources sector, global miner BHP Billiton was 24 cents lower at $26.41, Rio Tinto eased 54 cents to $51.53, and Fortescue Metals Group fell nine cents to $1.725. \nAmong the major banks, ANZ was off 35 cents at $31.90, Commonwealth Bank reversed 61 cents to $85.18, National Australia Bank dropped 19 cents to $32.88, and Westpac retreated 14 cents to $32.96. \nResearch released by APRA on Monday found that Australia's big four banks would need to lift their capital reserve levels by about one sixth in order to meet a key recommendation of the Financial Systems Inquiry. \nTelstra rose two cents to $6.23, and health insurer Medibank Private dipped two cents to $2.07. \nKEY FACTS \n* On Monday, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was down 18.8 points, or 0.34 per cent, at 5,473.2 points. \n* The broader All Ordinaries index was down 17.7 points, or 0.32 per cent, at 5,460.4 points. \n* The September share price index futures contract was down 32 points at 5,405 points, with 33,511 contracts traded. \n* The price of gold in Sydney at 1700 AEST was $US1,161.30 per fine ounce, down 90 US cents on Friday's price of $US1,162.20. \n* National turnover was 1.37 billion securities worth $3.7 billion. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T10:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T11:14:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
