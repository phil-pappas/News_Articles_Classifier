Photo: Supplied\nDeveloper demand continues to drive sales south of the city as a small South Melbourne warehouse with the potential for an 18-level tower changes hands for $6.152 million and one of the last prime City Road sites is offered to the market.\nFitzroys' Michael Ryan said the 910-square-metre block on two titles at 63-65 and 67-69 City Road was in a sought-after location that had undergone a rapid transformation over the past decade, hosting numerous luxury tower developments.\nThe property was tenanted for $422,000 a year plus GST but with leases subject to redevelopment clauses.\n\"This is one of the last development sites available on City Road,\" he said.\nIn South Melbourne, an 884-square-metre corner warehouse at 30-38 Thistlethwaite Street was snapped up on a yield of 2 per cent by an investor mindful of its long-term development potential, Dixon Kestles director Simon Regan said.\nThe $6960 per square metre rate paid reflected where sales in the area were heading, he said.\nUnder the planning scheme, the site had the potential to be developed up to 18 levels, he said.\nThe deal follows Melbourne-based developers Bayport Group and Elite Property Group paying $17.81 million for a site at 235-243 Normanby Road which has plans for a 40-level building.\nThe joint venture partners this week augmented their South Melbourne purchase with a $7.225 million deal for a residential development site in Hughesdale in Melbourne's inner south-east with plans for a new townhouse project.\nSavills' Julian Heatherich and Jesse Radisich said the price reflected a competitive market for residential development sites.\nMr Heatherich said the property at 568 Neerim Road and 34 Poath Road was sold with vacant possession by community services organisation MonashLink.\nElite and Bayport's push into the city's southern suburbs follows the group's divestment of a portfolio of four industrial assets for $50 million in an off-market deal to a Fife Capital-managed private investor fund late last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T22:15:41.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
