The company led by ex-Louis Vuitton designer Marc Jacobs is aiming to float on the New York stock exchange in the next few years. \nLVMH said its flagship Hennessy cognac brand had returned to organic growth in the second quarter as strong business in the United States helped make up for continued weakness in China. \nThe group said it was monitoring \"with great attention\" the development of the so-called grey market of unofficial online distributors of luxury goods but predicted it would continue to exist while significant regional price differences remained.
