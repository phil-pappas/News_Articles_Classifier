Cyprus and Malta, in particular, are very popular as they offer direct citizenship without long waiting or residence periods. \n\"Portugal's Golden Residence Visa, as well as the Hungarian Residence Bond program, have also seen significant interest, as they offer investors residence in exchange for a smaller investment (in comparison to Malta or Cyprus). \n\"The Caribbean has also recently seen strong demand as countries such as Antigua and Barbuda or Grenada offer direct citizenship in under six months.\" \nA new home \nAlong with the rise in second citizenship applications, the number of people immigrating has increased dramatically since the turn of the century, the report said. \nMajor reasons for this include turmoil in the home country, security concerns and optimising education of children. \nThe UK and in particular London has become a hub for moving millionaires due to a number of factors including: \n- The language. \n- The international nature of the city. \n- Ease of travel - EU has open border policy. \n- Ease of moving money into the country. \n- Ease of buying property in the country. \n- Quality of schooling and universities. \nSource: Fin24 South Africa", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T13:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:24:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
