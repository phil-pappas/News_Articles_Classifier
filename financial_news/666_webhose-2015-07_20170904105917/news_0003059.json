Instead, Mr Haldane suggested executives should be paid in debt instruments like contingent convertible bonds , which are wiped out when the bank takes a major financial hit. \nMeanwhile, he said shareholder rights could be changed for the better, for instance by giving more voting rights to investors who have held shares for a longer period of time, in line with a new French law. Mr Haldane also suggests using different classes of shares, as is sometimes done in US companies when the founder of a company wants to sell equity in their firm without losing overall control. \n“These laws and emerging practices are in their early throes and are not uncontentious, especially among institutional shareholders. Nonetheless, they are symptomatic of a common desire to strengthen long-term investors’ hand in the oversight of companies,” said Mr Haldane in the speech, which took place in May but has only just been made public. \n“If these initiatives grew in prominence, they would begin to address some of the short-term and risk-shifting problems embedded in the current corporate governance model.” \nEmployees could also be given a greater say in running firms, he said, pointing to Japan, Germany and France, where staff can influence the board. \n“A majority of Japanese, German and French company executives put employee job security above shareholder dividends. For UK and US companies, a strong majority place the balance the other way around,” he said. \n“This suggests a very different set of managerial objectives and incentives across countries.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T20:40:43.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
