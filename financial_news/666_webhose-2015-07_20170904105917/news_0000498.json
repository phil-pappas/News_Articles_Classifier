Subject to the parliament in Athens approving a barrage of reforms by Wednesday, Greece will be able to opt for a third bailout package worth up to £61.1bn (€86bn), including £17.8bn (€25bn) to recapitalise its banks. \nThe FTSE 100 closed higher by 64.57 points to 6,737.95 points. The second-tier FTSE 250 was up by 222.61 points to 17,708.88 and the FTSE Small Cap by another 18.27 to 4,699.43. \nAnalysts react cautiously Nonetheless, analysts' initial comments retained a cautious bias. \nOn the subject of a restructuring of Greek debt, Alberto Gallo at RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) highlighted the fact that Monday's deal only left the door open to the extension of maturities and not haircuts to the nominal value of the debt. Adding an extra 20 years EFSF/IMF loans would result in a 21% decrease in the net present value of those debts, he explained. \n\"Is this sufficient to make Greek debt sustainable? The answer will depend on growth rates - but probably extensions alone would not be enough. Our view remains that a longer extension is needed or a partial conversion of debt into flexible bonds,\" Gallo added. \n\"We think that risks of a Greek exit have reduced in the short term [...] However, we continue to believe that longer-term risks remain very high, particularly surrounding program negotiations and execution; however, not to the extent that we consider a Greek exit as part of our baseline,\" Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) 's Francois Cabau and Nikolaos Sgouropoulos said in a research note sent to clients. \nThe agreement came after almost 17 hours of talks in Brussels which some observers described as \"rancorous\". \nPositive Chinese data Acting as a backdrop, Chinese exports grew by more than expected by economists in June, rebounding by 2.8% over the month (Consensus: 1.0%) to reach a four-month high, according to the country's General Administration of Customs. \n\"The underlying picture is that as some of the factors that weighed on external demand earlier this year, such as an unusually weak Q1 in the US, have faded, export growth has rebounded,\" Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics said in a research note e-mailed to clients. \nMarkets were also expectant ahead of a possible deal on Iran's atomic programme, following seventeen days of negotiations. \nIAG bolstered by broker upgrade, Greek news International Consolidated Airlines Group was at the top of the FTSE 100 after UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) upgraded the stock to 'buy' from 'neutral' and raised its price target to 700p from 580p. The stock price was also boosted by the news out of Greece and perhaps also Friday's announcement from American Airlines (Xetra: A1G.DE - news ) that it would pare its growth plans, which triggered a rally in the wider sector Stateside. \nShares in FTSE 250-listed Alent (LSE: ALNT.L - news ) surged 45% on news that US chemicals business Platform Specialty Products will buy the company for around $1.35bn in cash. The board of Alent intends to unanimously recommend the transaction to its shareholders, who will be entitled to 503p a share under the terms of the deal. The figure represents a premium of around 49% to Alent's closing price of 337.7p on 10 July. \nBarclays may acquire another bank as part of its plans to ringfence its retail operations, while setting up its investment bank as a standalone unit. The lender needs to study that option because it has only one banking license in the UK, although it might also opt to apply for an additional one, according to the Financial Times. However, a purchase would speed up the entire process. \nNostrum Oil has made a further approach to Tethys Petroleum regarding a possible offer the entire company. The possible offer price, whether in cash or shares, of C$0.2185 represents a premium of 46% over the closing share price on the Toronto Stock Exchange as of 9 July. As part of the transaction Nostrum is willing to extend interim funding to Tethys even before any shareholder vote takes place. \nEnergy company BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) has started up and loaded its first liquefied natural gas from the second production train at the Queensland Curtis LNG (QCLNG) facility in Australia. The first LNG from Train 2 set sail on the Maran Gas Posidonia. At plateau production, which is expected mid-2016, both trains at the Queensland facility will be producing enough LNG to load ten vessels per month combined, exporting around 8m tonnes per year, the company said. \nPolymetal purchased a 100% interest in the company holding the licence for the Primorskoye silver-gold property located in the Magadan region of Russia from Decamor Investments for an initial consideration of $4.5m. The company intends to complete at least 15km of exploration drilling before 20 September 2016 and to obtain an audited Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant reserve estimate under the JORC standard and pay the deferred consideration before 31 December next year. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,179.52 +1.04% FTSE 100 6,737.95 +0.97% FTSE 250 17,708.88 +1.27% FTSE 100 - Risers International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (CDI) (IAG) 549.00p +3.39% Kingfisher (KGF) 363.00p +3.01% Morrison (Wm) Supermarkets (MRW) 178.00p +3.01% Admiral Group (LSE: ADM.L - news ) (ADM) 1,472.00p +2.72% Carnival (CCL) 3,473.00p +2.48% Schroders (SDR) 3,180.00p +2.45% Whitbread (WTB) 5,235.00p +2.45% Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) (HL.) 1,192.00p +2.41% Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) (RIO) 2,600.50p +2.40% Hammerson (HMSO) 662.00p +2.32% FTSE 100 - Fallers BG Group (BG.) 1,071.00p -0.88% Coca-Cola HBC AG (CDI) (CCH) 1,345.00p -0.59% National Grid (LSE: NG.L - news ) (NG.) 851.10p -0.48% Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) 'B' (RDSB) 1,840.00p -0.46% British American Tobacco (BATS) 3,617.00p -0.26% Royal Dutch Shell 'A' (RDSA) 1,818.00p -0.22% Severn Trent (Other OTC: STRNY - news ) (SVT) 2,148.00p -0.09% Fresnillo (FRES) 671.50p -0.07% United Utilities Group (UU.) 888.50p -0.06% Imperial Tobacco Group (IMT) 3,258.00p -0.06% FTSE 250 - Risers Alent (ALNT) 487.00p +44.21% Renishaw (RSW) 2,212.00p +5.89% Brewin Dolphin Holdings (BRW) 324.70p +5.22% Just Eat (JE.) 423.00p +5.15% Rightmove (RMV) 3,424.00p +5.00% Shawbrook Group (LSE: SHAW.L - news ) (SHAW) 365.00p +4.58% Ocado Group (OCDO) 469.80p +3.96% Morgan Advanced Materials (MGAM) 335.00p +3.88% Shaftesbury (SHB) 903.50p +3.85% Indivior (Berlin: 2IV.BE - news ) (INDV) 245.30p +3.76% FTSE 250 - Fallers International Personal Finance (LSE: IPF.L - news ) (IPF) 352.60p -25.20% Lonmin (LMI) 74.00p -9.15% Drax Group (LSE: DRX.L - news ) (DRX) 261.80p -1.95% Vedanta Resources (Other OTC: VDNRF - news ) (VED) 447.60p -1.54% Pace (PIC) 367.60p -1.47% CLS Holdings (LSE: CLI.L - news ) (CLI) 1,840.00p -1.45% RPC Group (LSE: RPC.L - news ) (RPC (NYSE: RES - news ) ) 658.50p -1.42% Centamin (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) (CEY) 59.00p -1.42% Spire Healthcare Group (SPI) 337.80p -0.88% Murray International Trust (MYI) 932.00p -0.85%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T00:48:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
