Money managers interested in oil have a long bias (there has been no net short since the current time series began in 2006). So the small net long indicates an unusually high level of bearishness among hedge funds. \nSentiment has turned bearish as a series of negative factors hit the market in quick succession including the nuclear agreement with Iran China's stock market tumble rising output from OPEC an uptick in the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States and flush oil stockpiles. \nHedge funds have cut their long positions since May by just over 100 million barrels from 388 million to 281 million. On the short side of the market money managers have added almost 70 million barrels to take their total to almost 163 million barrels. \nThe ratio of long to short positions at just 1.7 to 1 is the lowest since September 2010 and has fallen from more than 4 to 1 over the last 11 weeks. \nThe question is how much further oil prices will fall with hedge funds already so heavily invested in a bullish narrative? \nThere is scope for hedge funds to cut their net long position even further. Gross long positions were still almost 65 million barrels above their five-year low on July 21 while gross short positions were 47 million barrels below their five-year high. \nIt is likely that the net long position has already fallen further since the data refer to positions at the end of trading on July 21 and oil prices continued to fall throughout the rest of the week. \nThe critical question is at what point the hedge funds start to square up their short positions in order to take their profits. \n\nJohn Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.
