Bloomberg Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe When Hillary Clinton ran for president eight years ago, billionaire investor Warren Buffett dropped by her fundraiser event in New York and told the room full of financiers that rich guys like him weren't paying enough tax.\nBuffett, the third-wealthiest person in the world at the time, revealed that his tax rate of 17.7 per cent on income of $US46 million was lower than the 30 per cent rate paid by his receptionist.\nThe eye opening comparison caught the nation's attention, especially amid rising public outrage over widening income inequality in the United States.\nSo on the eve of the 2012 election, President Barack Obama latched on to Buffet's idea to introduce a minimum tax rate for high income earners.\nPolitically, it was a winner. Presidential rival and former private equity boss Mitt Romney embarrassingly revealed he paid just 14 per cent tax on his income of $US13.7 million.\nObama proposed the so-called \"Buffett rule\", seeking to force Americans earning more than $US2 million a year to pay a minimum tax rate of 30 per cent. The new tax was to be phased in for those earning between $US1 million and $US2 million.\nIt's a significantly higher income threshold than the $300,000 limit the Australian Labor Party proposed hitting with a 35c in the dollar \"Buffett tax\" at its national conference on the weekend.\nBlocked in Congress Alas, in the US, the Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012 failed to become law after Republicans in Congress blocked the measure.\nIt may appear wrong that billionaires like Buffett are legally able to pay relatively low average taxes.\nThe reason is arguably less nefarious and more complex than casual observers might assume.\nIn the US, capital gains and dividends are lightly taxed at rates of between 15 per cent and 23.8 per cent for wealthier individuals, much lower than wages, salaries and bonuses.\nEven though the rich pay much more tax than middle income earners, their average rate is generally lower because a higher share of their earnings flow from investments in stocks, property and businesses.\nAustan Goolsbee, a former chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, says: \"The Buffet rule basically just says that you can take advantage of capital gains income but if you use it too much, there is a floor on how low your taxes can go.\"\nClinton backs plan again This month, Clinton again endorsed the plan, condemning Republican opponents for wanting to cut taxes for the rich.\nAlan Viard, a former senior economist in George W Bush's administration, says the Buffett rule is \"a way to curtail the preferential tax rates for qualified dividends and long-term capital gains for high income households\".\n\"So the question is do you want to raise the capital gains and dividend tax rate for very high income households?\" he says.\nYet that leads to the thorny issue of double taxation.\nIn the US, corporate income is generally taxed at 35 per cent before it is paid out to investors.\nUnlike Australia, there is no dividend imputation credit granted to investors for tax paid at the company level.\nDouble taxation Free-market economist Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute, says the Buffett rule would increase double taxation.\n\"The fundamental problem is that advocates of the so-called Buffett rule ignore the fact that the income has already been taxed,\" Mitchell says.\nAny double tax effect from imposing the Buffett tax in Australia would be less severe due to shareholders enjoying franking credits.\nBut a Buffett-inspired tax would still in effect hit certain types of income twice.\nLen Burman, director at the Tax Policy Center in Washington and author of The Labyrinth of Capital Gains Tax Policy: A Guide for the Perplexed , says the Buffett rule has the right goal, but is the \"wrong tool\".\nClosing loopholes Instead, Burman suggests closing tax \"loopholes\" and reforming the tax code.\nIn Australia, capital gains on assets held longer than 12 months attract a 50 per cent capital gains tax discount.\nSuch tax concessions, combined with negative gearing and tax deductions for superannuation and salary sacrifice, contribute the lion's share of tax-write offs for the wealthy.\nBurman supports the plan by Obama's bipartisan Bowles-Simpson deficit-reduction commission. It proposed eliminating most tax subsidies to fund a cut in the top income tax rate to 28 per cent.\nCapital gains and dividends would also be taxed at 28 per cent – the rate set by Republican president Ronald Reagan's Tax Reform Act of 1986.\nRemoving concessions for special interests and having a lower top income tax rate would make the system simpler, harder for tricky tax lawyers and accountants to dodge, arguably fairer and incentivise work.\nStill, the idea that vast hoards of the rich are paying barely any tax is misleading. It's true 22,000 US households made more than $US1 million in 2009, but paid a tax rate of less than 15 per cent.\nAustralian Taxation Office figures show at least 55 taxpayers earned more than $1 million but paid no tax in 2011-12 and 2012-13.\nWhile understandably concerning, the numbers are relatively tiny in a system of millions of taxpayers.\nHigh income earners pay the vast majority of tax in Australia, especially after taking government transfers into account.\nTop quintile paying up Only the top 20 per cent of households by income – collecting more than $200,000 a year – pay any net tax on average, allowing for estimates on age pensions, child payments and other welfare, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics household income survey.\nThe US Congressional Budget Office says the highest income quintile paid more than two-thirds of all federal taxes in 2011. The lowest income quintile paid less than 1 per cent of federal taxes.\nUS households in the lowest income quintile paid an average of $US500 in federal taxes, an average rate of about 2 per cent. The middle quintile paid about $US7,000 (11 per cent). Households in the highest quintile paid about $US58,000 (23 per cent).\nSo Buffett's secretary paying 30 per cent must be very well paid.\nNot that these figures necessarily determine whether the rich are paying their fair share.\n\"Fairness is not an economic concept,\" Greg Mankiw, a conservative economist and former adviser to president Bush, wrote in the New York Times.\n\"If you want to talk fairness, you have to leave the department of economics and head over to philosophy.\"\nAnd as Alan Viard of the American Enterprise Institute points out, the whole debate may be a distraction from broader tax reform.\n\"We are assuming income tax is the right system,\" Viard says. \"Consumption tax is a better system, so all this notion of raising rates on rich people is dubious.\"\nRead next: Labor's Buffett rule could ban franking credits for the rich", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts", "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/business/yourmoney/15view.html?_r=0"], "published": "2015-07-28T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:04:46.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
