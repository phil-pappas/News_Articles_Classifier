Allergan was up 7.02 percent at $329.87 while Mylan fell 14.63 percent to $56.28.\nFiat Chrysler fell 4.8 percent at $14.42 after a U.S. auto safety watchdog announced a $105 million fine against the automaker over lapses in safety recalls.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,266 to 811.
