Everything from quick call, the set up and dialing, good data experience, fast downloads, YouTube, whatssap and videos show up really quick and all that\". \nHe stated that 70 percent of the capital would be invested in new cell sites in Accra alone. \nRonald Reddick also stated that Battery thefts at cell sites havebeen a major concern for the company. \nHe averred that Tigo Ghana has so far recorded 900 stolen batteries from cell sites running into close to one million dollars in losses. \n\"They are actually quite intelligent with how they do it such that it doesn't set off the alarms and we won't know that they are missing until the site goes down. I don't think we will ever pass on such cost onto the consumer although it increases our operational cost a little bit\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T02:14:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
