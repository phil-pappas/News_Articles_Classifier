Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! MUMBAI: Standard Chartered Chief Executive Bill Winters made his first significant move in reshaping the Asia-focused British bank by simplifying its organisational structure, transferring key people, including India chief Sunil Kaushal , while stripping his deputy Mike Rees of his powers. The London-headquartered lender has formed a 13-member management team under Winters to deliver on its promises to shareholders. The management team will deliver a plan to address the future performance of the group by the yearend as it aims to achieve $1.8-billion cost savings by 2017. The number of regions has been cut by half to four, ASEAN & South Asia, Africa & Middle East, Greater China & North Asia, Europe & Americas. Ajay Kanwal, currently head of consumer banking, will head the ASEAN & South Asia region from Singapore. A CEO for India would be appointed later. \"The group needs to kick-start performance, reduce its cost base and bureaucracy, improve accountability, and speed up decision making,\" Winters said in a statement. \"I am working with a talented and experienced management team to create a bank that delivers strong returns and sustainable profitability,\" he said. The British bank has been facing rough times with bad loans piling up and regulatory penalties for various violations in the US. It has seen an exodus in its top management, including its chief executive Peter Sands, for failing to improve profitability. Winters took charge last month. \"These are exciting times for Standard Chartered and I am looking forward to building further our excellent franchises across the Middle East and Africa,\" said Kaushal, who guided the bank's India operations in the past two years. The bank has been correcting some of its past mistakes by selling non-core investments. It shuttered its institutional cash equities business and has sold a retail securities unit in Taiwan. It is in the process of selling consumer finance companies in Korea, Hong Kong and China. It plans to eliminate 4,000 jobs. It has also seen some top executives such as V Shankar, head of Middle East and Africa, quitting recently to float a private equity fund which will invest in the region. Prior to that, ex-Asia chief Jaspal Bindra quit the bank. But those who remain in the bank also saw their powers reduce. Rees, who had regional chiefs reporting into him, joined the bank in 1990, rising to become deputy CEO in April 2014. He was the best paid board member last year and has been awarded about $72 million in the six years after the financial crisis, Bloomberg News reported. Rees \"was in charge of pretty much everything, now he's in charge of what?,\" asked Sandy Chen, an analyst at Cenkos Securities Plc in London, who has a buy on the shares. \"By putting himself as the key decision maker on top, Winters can oversee the profit-enhancing reforms more effectively.\" Under Sands, the firm had reported a 30% drop in pretax profit in 2014, hurt by legal bills. The lender is scheduled to report first-half results next month.
