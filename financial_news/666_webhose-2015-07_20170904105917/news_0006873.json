The condition is often due to the unhealthy diet and lifestyle practiced by people. The good news is that those who are trying to lose weight have a chance of becoming healthy again with the use of a natural ingredient.\nResearch identifies omega-3 fatty acids as a potential appetite suppressant. Omega-3s can be found in fish types such as trout tuna mackerel and salmon as well as in plants and oils. People are beginning to see the importance of incorporating food items with omega-3 into their diets.\n“Nowadays there are also many individuals who use fish oil supplements to obtain the right amount of omega-3 fatty acids” said VitaBreeze Supplements spokesperson Michelle O’Sullivan.\nOmega-3s are considered to be essential fatty acids and they cannot naturally be produced by the body. There are three types of omega-3s; one is EPA or eicosapentaenoic acid the second is DHA or docosahexaenoic acid and there is ALA or the alpha-linolenic acid. ALA is usually found in vegetable oils such as walnuts and flaxseed. Omega-3s are essential for cognitive function and they are believed to be effective for reducing inflammation and the risk of diseases such as arthritis and heart disease.\nAccording to research published in the journal Appetite omega-3 fatty acids may have the ability to increase feelings of fullness. This can be very helpful for obese or overweight individuals. In a study it was found that individuals who consumed high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids had reported reduced hunger levels after eating. Further research is still underway to determine if the appetite-regulating effects of omega-3s can lead to long-term weight loss.\nThe researchers in the American Journal of Physiology- Endocrinology and Metabolism Hongqin Wang and colleagues published a study that found increased consumption of omega-3s can reduce levels of leptin a hormone that affects a person’s appetite.\nAccording to the study published in the journal Lipids by Jana Ruzickova and colleagues omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA can potentially reduce the prevalence of obesity by preventing fat storage in the body. The two omega-3s have the potential to prevent the production and enlargement of fat cells.\nThere are many weight loss methods that are proven to work for many people and they include following specific dietary and exercise programs. Overweight or obese individuals can also take advantage of fish oil supplements as the best ones available in the market contain the highest amounts of DHA and EPA ().\nAbout VitaBreeze\nVitaBreeze is a nutraceutical brand that manufactures high-quality natural supplements to help people live a healthy enjoyable and longer life.
