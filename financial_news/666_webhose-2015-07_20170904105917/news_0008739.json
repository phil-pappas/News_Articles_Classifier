Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Sally Rose Self-managed super fund owners have urged the federal government to replace the annual cap on superannuation contributions with a rolling or lifetime cap to encourage more people to save for a self-funded retirement.\nIn a submission to the tax white paper process, seven groups argue the contribution caps need to be overhauled to encourage more people to save for their retirement.\n\"The voluntary contributions system needs to have much more flexibility to allow people to step-up or ramp-down how much extra they are putting aside in super depending on their ability to save at different times in their lives,\" said Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chairman Kate Carnell who was one of the co-signatories.\n\"We should be encouraging people to save for retirement to reduce the burden on the age pension system\".\nPeople aged under 50 can contribute up to $30,000 to their super each year at the concessional tax rate of 15 per cent. Those aged over 50 are eligible for the discount on an extra $5000 worth of contributions each year.\nSMSF Owners' Alliance executive director Duncan Fairweather said the groups behind the proposal to scrap annual caps had not made a specific recommendation in favour of a rolling or lifetime caps because Treasury should conduct a more detailed assessment of both options.\n\"We appreciate that a rolling cap, calculated over a period of perhaps three, five or even 10 years might be more practical to implement than a lifetime cap\".\nOther co-signatories to the submission were the Australian Shareholders' Association, Australian Investors Association, Independent Contractors Australia, The Melbourne SMSF Group, and Self-managed Independent Superannuation Funds Association.\n Key plank A key plank of the submission is that any changes to superannuation tax rules should be forward looking only and not applied to people who have amassed savings under the rules now.\nIt was lodged on Friday, the final day of the consultation period that the government agreed to extend by four weeks and broaden to include retirement incomes in a deal with the Greens to get its pension reforms across the line.\nThe Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia has been leading a push for the maximum amount individuals are allowed to have in super capped at $2.5 million.\nBalancing act Mr Fairweather said the problem with ASFA's proposal for a lifetime cap of $2.5 million was that it pertains to superannuation balances, rather than contributions.\n\"It is absolutely fair we have a system that limits how much people can put into super at a concessional tax rate, but once that money is in super they should not be penalised for making good investment decisions and achieving strong returns\".\nLabor has proposed taxing annual retirement income over $75,000 drawn from superannuation .\nThe group of seven oppose increasing taxes on super earnings, arguing the income tax system creates a bias against savings and some tax concessions are necessary to encourage saving.\nThey argue that making it easier for people to make additional contributions to super in the years they can afford it will help the nation move towards a time when the age pension serves only as a safety net for a minority.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/sallymrose", "https://plus.google.com/115164720240377561218/about?hl=en"], "published": "2015-07-26T11:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:53:00.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
