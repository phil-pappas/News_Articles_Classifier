Chief Executive Elon Musk said Friday the company is “almost ready” to make its cars go driverless on highways and parallel-park themselves\nThe much-awaited software update that would make Tesla TSLA, -0.22% vehicles able to steer themselves safely down the road has one more thing to sort out, Musk said in a tweet.\nFinal corner case is dealing with low contrast lane markings (faded white on grey concrete) while driving into the sun at dusk\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 31, 2015 He later added the software update would be available to Tesla owners worldwide.\nEarlier this month, when Tesla launched new features for its Model S electric sedan , Musk said he was personally testing the features in the new software, which would be available in beta mode to a few customers within months.\nMusk also said that one of the challenges of going driverless had been making the car’s software recognize roadway markings that are faded, and the need to recognize the difference between proper markings and skid marks or other blemishes on the roadway. Tesla for months has been testing its driverless software prototypes on highways between San Francisco and the Pacific Northwest.\nThe Model S cars have built-in driver-assistance systems that include, among other things, forward radar, a camera mounted by the rear-view mirror, and 12 sensors that can sense objects within 16 feet of the car. Tesla is able to release over-the-air software updates so owners don’t have to bring their cars in for service.\nThe road to autopilot driving has been incremental. Last year, Tesla launched features such as lane-departure warnings, and earlier this year it released adaptive cruise control, blind-spot warning, and a forward-collision warning system.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/627040639553830912"], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T22:09:24.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
