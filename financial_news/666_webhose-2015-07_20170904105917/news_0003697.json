AP by Oliver Renick US stocks rose, with the Nasdaq Composite Index reaching a record, after Greek lawmakers passed a bailout agreement while companies including Netflix and Citigroup rallied on earnings.\nThe Nasdaq Composite increased 1.26 per cent to 5163.18 at 4pm in New York, topping its closing record set on June 23. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 0.8 per cent to 2124.29, within 0.3 per cent of its record. The Dow added 0.39 per cent to 18,120.25.\n\"It looks like the equity market likes the Greek settlement,\" said Ron Anari, the Jersey City, New Jersey-based senior vice president of trading at ICAP. \"At this stage of the game the Federal Reserve is in the driver's seat, we're going to see a hike sometime in September, and the equity market understands that. It's expecting more positive economic news.\"\nGreek lawmakers passed reform measures demanded by creditors in exchange for negotiating a third bailout package. Following the vote, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi said today that the central bank raised the level of emergency aid to Greek lenders.\nThe S&P 500 is on pace for its biggest weekly gain in four months, and at the highest in three weeks as it closes in on its May 21 record. The gauge fell as much as 4 per cent from that level amid concern the Greek debt crisis and China's equities rout would hurt global growth as the Federal Reserve considers raising interest rates this year.\nFed chair Janet Yellen appeared before the Senate Banking Committee in Washington, continuing her semi-annual testimony on monetary policy. Yellen told lawmakers that raising rates too late holds risks, along with tightening too quickly.\nYesterday she signalled the Fed is on track to raise interest rates this year, while emphasising that the timing of the first rate rise is less important than the subsequent path of increases, which she said would be gradual.\nPolicy makers are watching for further improvement in the labour market. A report today showed filings for US unemployment benefits fell last week for the first time in a month, heading back toward the lowest levels in more than a decade.\n Separate data showed confidence among homebuilders held in July at the highest level since November 2005, indicating the residential real estate market may be picking up speed. Meanwhile, a gauge on manufacturing in the Philadelphia area fell more than estimated by economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\nEarnings season is also drawing more focus as investors sift for clues on the health of the world's largest economy. Analysts project earnings for members of the gauge dropped 6.4 per cent in the second quarter.\nCitigroup, the third-largest US bank, posted profit that beat analysts' estimates as chief executive officer Michael Corbat cut expenses. Shares climbed the most in almost six months. Second-quarter net income jumped to $US4.85 billion, or $US1.51 a share.\nPhilip Morris International, the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company, posted second-quarter profit that topped analysts' estimates, helped by price increases and growth in eastern Europe. Net income rose 1.9 per cent to $US1.89 billion, or $US1.21 a share.\nGoogle's second-quarter earnings topped analysts' estimates amid slower spending, reassuring investors who had been concerned about the internet search giant's ability to keep costs in check. Profit before certain items was $US6.99 a share, the company said in a statement Thursday after the closing bell. Sales, minus revenue passed on to partners, rose 13 per cent to $US14.35 billion. Analysts on average had projected $US6.73 a share in profit on $US14.3 billion in sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T05:09:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
