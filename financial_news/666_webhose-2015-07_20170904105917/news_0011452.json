Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! MUMBAI: When it was put to him that he'll need to fill the big shoes of his predecessor KV Kamath, ICICI Bank's new chairman MK Sharma said with a smile: \"I will create my own shoes.\" The low-profile, ex-vice chairman of Hindustan Unilever, who took charge as non-executive chairman in July, is known to be a man of great persuasive skills. But the new occupant of the chairman's room will definitely mark a change of pace. Kamath, who's moved to head the new BRICS Bank , is credited with building ICICI Bank into India's second-biggest commercial lender and a leader in many respects. That's why he's a larger-thanlife figure for ICICI Bank's customers, investors and borrowers. Sharma knows the bank well, having been an independent director between 2003 and 2011. That makes him an \"insideroutsider,\" he said. He's also been an independent director on companies such as Thomas Cook, Wipro, Asian Paints and Blue Star . \"I have decided that I will accept my limitations and play up to my strengths,\" the new chairman said. Sharma started his career with DCM in 1969, before joining HUL in 1974, where he spent 33 years, retiring as vice-chairman in 2007. \"I was pleasantly surprised when I got a call from ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar with an offer to be the nonexecutive chairman of ICICI. After all, KV Kamath had a huge stature with the bank, and I knew it was truly big shoes to fill,\" he said. \"Of course I am aware that there must have been lot of surprise and comparison over my appointment.\" Sharma put this to Kochhar, who replied that she too had faced a similar situation when she was nominated as CEO, succeeding Kamath. She too had decided to \"make her own shoes,\" Kochhar told him. \"That helped me make my decision too,\" Sharma said. Though not as highly recognized as Kamath, Sharma is well respected in corporate circles and is regarded as being possessed of a wealth of capabilities that vests him with credibility. While Kamath and Kochhar are seen as similar in profile and personality, Sharma brings a different level of understanding, said an analyst tracking the company. When it comes to decisions, Sharma said the chairman should listen to the board, elaborating on his mode of operation. \"The board is superior to a chairman. And my approach is that of being persuasive, reasoning and influencing. And that approach does not naturally occur to Indians who tend to direct and command. I find that instead of command and control, influencing and reasoning approach is far more effective,\" said Sharma. It's rare for an executive with a legal background to have reached the vice-chairman's role in an consumer goods giant such as HUL. \"He has this huge credibility within HUL and that stature saw him rising up the ranks,\" said a former colleague. Fund managers said top management changes only matter if the company is performing poorly. \"Leadership change makes a difference for investors only if any company is doing badly or the market environment is very challenging,\" said Samir Arora, fund manager at Helios Capital. \"So KV Kamath, who was also an ICICI insider and well connected, would be equipped to handle that kind of a scenario better. In this case, I don't think that is a concern at this point of time because ICICI is doing okay and with his credentials, Mr Sharma would only add more value to it.\" While some insiders suggest Sharma was handpicked by Kochhar, she said it was actually the board's decision. \"In deciding on the appointment, the board felt that Mr Sharma's stature in the Indian corporate sector and experience in companies operating in diverse businesses including agriculture-linked businesses would prove invaluable in provide guidance and leadership to the board,'' Kochhar said. \"He is very familiar with the ICICI group given his long association with the Bank and its subsidiaries and would provide stability and continuity in the context of KV Kamath leaving before the end of his term to take up his new role.\" Sharma is clear about his remit and what he can accomplish at ICICI Bank. \"My professional competency is that of a general manager, my strengths are in corporate governance, risk management and transparency. I will focus on senior management issues, governance and risk issues for the bank,\" he said. \"Mr KV Kamath and his predecessor Mr N Vaghul have been mentors and coaches for several next-gen leaders in the organisation. To that extent I will be playing a limited role.\" An avid gardener, Sharma likes nothing better than to pore over legal tomes to keep himself abreast of new laws and regulations in his spare time. ICICI is in safe hands with Sharma keeping an eye on governance, risk and speaking out on critical areas, said R Suresh, founder and managing director of RGF Executive Search. \"He is acceptable to every member of the board and the CEO and is erudite and learned,\" he said. \"And unlike K V Kamath's authoritative profile, he has a persuasive approach. And that is what ICICI needs best at this point of growth.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T02:05:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
