Bailey said Nexen shut down the pipeline as soon as the leak was detected. \nBailey said the pipeline is in a remote area accessed by helicopter and that the spill has not affected any residences or people. He added that the line is approximately 328 feet (100 meters) away from a lake and that the company is ensuring that the lake is protected. \nThe Alberta Energy Regulator and the company said it's too soon to say what might have caused the leak. \nOfficials with the regulator are on site to assess the situation and ensure Nexen meets safety and environmental requirements during the cleanup. The emulsion has not flowed into a body of water, but it did spill into wetlands, the regulator said. \nLong Lake, about 21 miles (35 kilometers) southeast of Fort McMurray, uses steam to heat oilsands bitumen deep underground, enabling it to flow to the surface. \nThe Alberta Energy Regulator said that in March, it investigated a spill of about 710,000 gallons (2.7 million liters) of condensate at Murphy Oil's Seal oilfield in northwestern Alberta. Condensate is used to dilute heavy oil so it can flow through pipelines. \nThis week's spill comes at a time when the safety of pipelines are a hot bed issue as Canada's Conservative government is pushing the Obama administration to approve TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the Gulf. The Keystone XL oil pipeline, which is designed to go from Canada through Montana and South Dakota to Nebraska, has been mired in the U.S. regulatory process for nearly seven years. \nDelays in approving the Keystone XL oil pipeline have caused friction between the U.S. and Canada, the latter of which needs infrastructure in place to export its growing oil production. Canada relies on the U.S. for 97 percent of its energy exports. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T22:10:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
