Data on Wednesday showing earnings are rising the fastest in six years may give them a further nudge.\nThe data will come a day after Carney is grilled by lawmakers on the U.K. Parliament’s Treasury Committee about the economic outlook and financial stability. While inflation remains far below the BOE’s 2 percent target, the nine-member MPC’s central view is that it will accelerate and the next move in rates from a record low will be an increase. For Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, that push for tightening may start soon.\nThe labor data “will encourage them and for the next couple of months we are going to see wage inflation picking up,” said Ross Walker, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London. “The big difference is that they just view labor market conditions as being a bit tighter.”\nEarnings rose an annual 3 percent in the three months through May, compared with 2.7 percent, economists forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Including bonuses, wages increased 3.3 percent. Unemployment probably stayed at its lowest since 2008.\nWage Acceleration McCafferty says there’s a risk that average earnings will “accelerate markedly” from next year. Weale has talked about a “fizzing” labor market.\nFor those not inclined to tighten yet, there are risks related to Greece’s crisis as well as weak U.K. inflation, with data Tuesday forecast to show prices stagnated in June. That doesn’t mean deflation concerns should resurface, with Investec Securities pointing to a drag from clothing prices due to the timing of discounting.\nOne policy maker, BOE Chief Economist Andy Haldane, is pushing against the Weale-McCafferty view, saying wages aren’t on a “rocket-propelled ascent” and the pound’s advance will weigh on inflation.\nEconomists forecast the key rate will be increased from 0.5 percent in the first quarter, while investors are only fully pricing in a 25 basis-point move by the middle of 2016.\nA split on the committee could happen as early as next month, when officials will have new forecasts. Carney and his colleagues will also assess Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne’s latest fiscal plans. For Michael Saunders, an economist at Citigroup Inc. in London, the July 8 budget changes to tax credits and introduction of a living wage “may well lift pay growth, especially at the bottom end of the pay scale.”\n“This prospect probably makes it more likely that the MPC will hike rates in the next few quarters, unless external factors threaten to derail the U.K. recovery,” he said.\nThose external threats are difficult to predict, with Greece facing a new deadline on reforms in return for bailout funds. Failure could mean its exit from the euro, which would weigh on the currency bloc, Britain’s biggest trading partner .\n“The more that euro-zone countries are adversely affected by events surrounding Greece, the more U.K. growth would be liable to take some hit,” IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T08:05:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
