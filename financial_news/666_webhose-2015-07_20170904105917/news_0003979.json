He was relocated to Asia in 2011 after working as head of bond syndicate for CEEMEA (Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa) for the same bank. \nRoch's move to ANZ comes after Holian recently left the role of head of Asian debt syndicate at the Australian bank. Joseph Pepping, an associate director on ANZ's debt syndicate team, also left in June to joint Bank of America Merrill Lynch and is currently on gardening leave. \nRBS declined to comment. Attempts to contact ANZ's corporate communications team were unsuccessful.
