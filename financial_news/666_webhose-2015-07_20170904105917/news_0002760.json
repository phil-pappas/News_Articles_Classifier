A takeover at $10, with 55 percent paid in scrip, would be 17 percent accretive, he said.\nOne institutional investor who holds Asciano stock agreed that Brookfield had \"room to move\" on its initial offer, and said that \"$9 could certainly turn into $10.\"\nMr Fraser argues that Brookfield could gear Asciano more aggressively, lowering the Canadian group's debt and equity funding for a formal proposal to around US$4.9 billion from US$6.5 billion.\nAsciano's current ratio of net debt to earnings before interest taxation depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is running at 2.7 times, but Mr Fraser estimates Brookfield could increase the gearing ratio to 4.5 times.\nBrookfield more highly geared Brookfield is more highly geared than Asciano, with a proportionate net debt to proportionate EBITDA ratio of an estimated at 5.7 times, according to Shaw and Partners.\nBankers are confident that Brookfield's interest in Asciano is serious, but investors remain uncertain whether an acceptable formal bid will emerge.\n\"There's definitely some scepticism out there that there will be a binding bid that people will really like,\" said one large institutional investor, adding that Brookfield is likely to need to provide more cash to get investors to agree to a takeover.\nAsciano's shares closed on Tuesday at $7.94, well below the proposed offer of $9.05 per share.\nMany local institutional investors are unwilling to take on scrip in an US-listed externally managed fund and pay management fees.\nOne institutional investor said it would be \"very uncomfortable\" owning Brookfield scrip. While Brookfield was a credible organisation, it owned some low-quality assets, the investor said.\nBrookfield has not disclosed how much cash it will offer investors but analysts initially estimated that scrip would make up at least 50 per cent of a formal bid.\nMr Fraser said Brookfield has capacity to fund more of the bid in cash, noting that it has raised some $3.5 billion of equity over the past five years.\n\"Clearly their investors are happy to pony up the money,\" Mr Fraser said.\nInvestors are waiting for a formal offer from Brookfield to emerge before making a decision on its merits.\nBrookfield is continuing its exclusive due diligence on Asciano. No deadline has been set for its due diligence period but Asciano is expected to update investors on its talks with Brookfield at its annual results on August 18. ﻿", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/infrastructure/ports/brookfield-infrastructure-in-9bn-bid-for-asciano-20150701-gi25z3"], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T22:10:47.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
