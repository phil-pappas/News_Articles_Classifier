A deal would give Delta a roughly 20-percent stake, although terms must still be concluded and approved by Skymark's creditors, according to the report by Nikkei Asian Review.\nA Delta spokeswoman said, \"It would be premature for us to comment on the matter.\" Delta's President Ed Bastian said last month that the Atlanta-based airline had been approached about making the investment.\nSkymark could not immediately be reached for comment.\nSkymark holds many landing slots at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, which connects to cities throughout Japan and which many travelers prefer to Narita International Airport because it is closer to Tokyo's downtown. Skymark's slots are for domestic routes only.\nIf the deal succeeds, Delta could attempt to build Haneda as a transit hub for passengers coming off its flights from Los Angeles. Currently, Delta's connecting opportunities are limited because it has no alliance partner in Japan.\nRival U.S. carrier United Continental Holdings Inc has an alliance with Japan's ANA Holdings Inc, and rival American Airlines Group Inc has an alliance with Japan Airlines Co Ltd.\nPlanemaker Airbus Group SE and aircraft lessor Intrepid Aviation Ltd are the biggest creditors to Skymark, which ran into financial trouble after embarking on an ambitious expansion that included buying Airbus A380 jumbo jets.\nThere are two restructuring plans for Skymark currently on the table, one involving ANA Holdings investing in Skymark, and one proposed by Intrepid.\nCreditor approval is key for either Skymark restructuring plan to go ahead.\n(Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in New York; Editing by Diane Craft)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T02:10:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
