Photo: Bloomberg\nOil has been reeling for about a year; now gold is getting slammed - not pretty for commodities investors.\nThe Bloomberg Commodities Index dropped to a 13-year low Monday - weaker than after the banking meltdown of 2008 and the euro-zone crisis of 2012.\nFrom wheat, to copper, to natural gas, little has escaped the rout.\n\"Commodities are a mess,\" Walter \"Bucky\" Hellwig, who helps manage $US17 billion at BB&T Wealth Management, said.\n\"We are not looking to add to positions.\"\nIt's the year's worst-performing asset class, with the Bloomberg gauge down more than 7 per cent.\nIn Monday's drop, the value of holdings in exchange-traded products for gold plunged to its lowest since 2009.\nDuring a stretch of about 15 minutes in Asian trading hours, prices of the metal fell the most in two years.\nA stronger dollar and concern about a slowdown in China are contributing to gold's decline. Few are betting on a rebound soon.\nHedge funds and other money managers are the least bullish on gold since government data began in 2006.\nWith so many investors going short, lower prices aren't bad for everyone.\nThe Newedge CTA Index shows daily returns for the 20 largest commodity trading advisers. It jumped 1.7 per cent last week.\nBloomberg", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iBn5w8zzzTt8/v1/-1x-1.png", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i1Fe3LlKxKR8/v3/-1x-1.png", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iQmkKNN6VZKk/v2/-1x-1.png", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/ix1De6ZCz7nk/v2/-1x-1.png", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/is0nDkn57MZU/v2/-1x-1.png"], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T15:16:54.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
