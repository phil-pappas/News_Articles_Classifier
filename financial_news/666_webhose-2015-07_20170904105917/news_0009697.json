But it ended the day 2.41 percent higher, adding 89.00 points, to 3,775.91. \nHong Kong plunged 3.18 percent, or 827.83 points, to 25,236.28 -- wiping out a 0.70 percent rise in the opening minutes that came on the coat-tails of the mainland gains. \nMore than 60 percent of Greece's voters heeded the government's call to vote \"No\", brushing aside warnings from European leaders that it was effectively an in-out poll on the euro. \nWhile the euro sank to $1.0963 in US electronic trade immediately after the poll, it recovered throughout Monday and ticked even higher after Varoufakis's announcement. \nThe combative Varoufakis -- who has been at the centre of Athens' high-profile debt negotiations for months -- clashed with Greece's creditors and refused to bow to their demands for tough austerity. \n\"Soon after the announcement of the referendum results, I was made aware of a certain preference by some Eurogroup participants, and assorted 'partners', for my? 'absence' from its meetings,\" he wrote in a blog. \nIt was \"an idea that the Prime Minister (Alexis Tsipras) judged to be potentially helpful to him in reaching an agreement. For this reason I am leaving the ministry of finance today\". \n- 'Grexit' chances increased - \nThe single currency was also at 135.45 yen compared with 134.91 yen in the US. \n\"There's nothing we can do now except lower our risk and wait,\" Ayako Sera, a strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, told Bloomberg News. \n\"The euro was created based on this great dream of a unified Europe, and if they withdraw from the euro then the whole system is going to come into question.\" \nThe dollar weakened to 122.52 yen from 123.05 yen on Friday. \nA series of high-level meetings were hastily arranged across the continent, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande calling a European summit for Tuesday. \nGerman and French finance ministers were set for talks in Warsaw Monday, while the Euro Working Group of top treasury officials will meet in Brussels. \nAnd the ECB will consider a financial lifeline for Greek lenders, which have been closed under capital controls since last weekend. \nShinya Harui, currency analyst at Nomura Securities in Tokyo, said: \"I personally think the chance (of the Greek exit) is very high, at around 70-80 percent.\" \nShanghai blasted out of the blocks after the government announced a series of measures at the weekend to back up the struggling mainland markets, which have lost about a third of their value since peaking on June 12. \nOn Sunday, Beijing said the central bank would provide liquidity through the state-backed China Securities Finance Co., which manages margin trading. \nAnd market watchdog the China Securities Regulatory Commission said there would be no initial public offerings (IPOs) \"in the near future\". \nOn Saturday China's 21 largest brokerage firms said they would invest at least 120 billion yuan ($19.3 billion) in so-called \"blue chip\" exchange traded funds (ETFs). \nThe moves come after other actions last week failed to arrest steep declines. \nHowever, Jimmy Zuo, a trader at Guosen Securities Co. in Shenzhen, said: \"The market didn?t buy into the measures and the downbeat mood is quite hard to change.\" \nOn oil markets, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in August plummeted $2.10 to $54.83 a barrel and Brent crude tumbled 75 cents to $59.57. \nGold fetched $1,167.50 compared with $1,168.43 late Thursday. \nIn other markets: \n-- Taipei slipped 1.09 percent, or 102.27 points, to 9,255.96. \nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co closed 1.40 percent lower at Tw$140.5 while Cathay Financial Holding fell 1.72 percent to Tw$51.5. \n-- Wellington was off 1.10 percent, or 64.28 points, at 5,776.62. \nFletcher Building (NZSE: FBU.NZ - news ) was down 2.11 percent at NZ$7.90 and Warehouse Group was off 0.37 percent at NZ$2.70. \n-- Manila fell 1.06 percent, or 80.15 points, to 7,455.15. \nMetropolitan Bank lost 0.32 percent to 93.20 pesos, Universal Robina Corp. shed 0.62 percent to 192.60 pesos and SM Investments retreated 0.51 percent to 881.50 pesos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T11:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T11:54:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
