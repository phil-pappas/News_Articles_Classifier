ICSID in a partial ruling last year said that move was unlawful.\n\"We are pleased with ICSID's decision to reject the challenges made by Venezuela to remove the Tribunal's Chairman and ConocoPhillips' appointed arbitrator,\" said Kris Sava, a spokesperson for Conoco.\nVenezuela's attorney general's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nCash-strapped Venezuela faces over 20 major arbitration awards, most stemming from high-profile nationalizations during Chavez's presidency.
