(MarketWatch) — People love winners more than they do losers. And though it seems too easy and too good to be true, that is a profitable investment strategy as well.\nI’m referring to so-called momentum strategies, which call for investing in stocks that have been performing the best and shunning those that have done the worst. Followers of such strategies often evoke a surfing analogy, since surfers gravitate toward already strong waves.\nA recent study has found that momentum strategies have been beating the broader stock market at least since 1801 — yes, 214 years ago. That’s noteworthy because most stock-picking strategies eventually stop working, even those that otherwise have strong statistical foundations. That is a function of the efficient market, since success draws in more and more investors until the goose laying the golden egg is killed. It’s difficult to overstate the significance of a single strategy that has been working for over two centuries.\nIt’s also noteworthy from a statistical point of view. Almost all prior studies, whether of the Momentum Effect or of other stock-picking strategies, have focused on performance back to 1927, the limit for most databases. (A popular database is maintained by the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago, known as CRSP.)\nThat exclusive focus is worrisome because of the inevitable data mining. With hundreds of finance professors poring over the same data, not to mention the thousands of Ph.D. candidates at graduate schools across the globe, there is the not inconsiderable risk of “discovering” patterns that don’t exist.\nBy focusing on a 126-year period (1801-1927), the authors of this longer-term research have conducted what they claim to be the “ world’s longest backtest .” The authors are Christopher Geczy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and Mikhail Samonov of Forefront Analytics, a Philadelphia-based quantitative-research firm.\nTo be sure, momentum strategies have their detractors. But, according to an impressive article in the latest issue of the Journal of Portfolio Management by Clifford Asness, Andrea Frazzini, Ronen Israel and Tobias Moskowitz, the detractors’ arguments don’t hold water. (The four authors, principals at AQR Capital Management, have strong academic credentials. Frazzini and Moskowitz are finance professors at Yale and the University of Chicago, respectively.)\nAre momentum strategies especially risky at stock market tops? That could be a particular concern right now, even if you otherwise are inclined to follow them, since you may worry that the bull market that began in 2009 has already topped out or will do so soon.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://ssrn.com/abstract=2292544", "http://www.iijournals.com/doi/abs/10.3905/jpm.2014.40.5.075"], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T14:13:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
