European markets in particular rallied as fears of a Greek exit from the euro zone subsided and possibilities of a third bailout were renewed. \"In what has become a familiar scene in last few weeks we're seeing a very strong rally across the board,\" said CMC Markets' chief market analyst Ric Spooner. \"We've seen a lot of false starts as markets become optimistic and pessimistic about Greece, but the extent of the international reaction suggests the markets are confident the issue is behind them in the medium term.\" According to Mr Spooner, this morning's rise was a catch up after Australian markets were wrong footed as one of the only Asian markets which closed lower yesterday. Mining companies enjoyed a rebound with BHP share prices increasing 3.75 per cent and RIO rising 3.65 per cent.
