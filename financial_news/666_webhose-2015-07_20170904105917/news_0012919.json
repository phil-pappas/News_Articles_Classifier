Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell Greece has voted 'no' to a now-lapsed offer of a bail-out agreement characterised by austerity measures and economists are warning it is likely the beginning of Greece's exit from the eurozone and its shared currency.\nA flurry of meetings across Europe is taking place as leaders involved in the crisis grapple with a volatile, high-stakes situation. Key meetings include those between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, but also key Greek creditor, the European Central Bank's governing council.\nBarclay's analyst Francois Cabau said the \"No\" vote most likely meant Greece would leave the eurozone's shared currency but this could be avoided.\n\"We see two possibilities, even if both are less likely than an exit. Europe and Greece could agree on a program on the IMF's terms. A more disruptive scenario would be one in which financial and macroeconomic conditions rapidly worsen and social unrest could result in a political crisis, yielding a more moderate pro-deal government.\"\nInstead, Barclays is one of many investment banks anticipating an exit. It anticipates credit assets will be weak in the short term, bond yields to climb in peripheral bonds such as Italy and Spain, and the euro to be hit hard.\n\"The now high probability of Greece leaving the European Monetary Union is unambiguously negative for the euro in the near term as foreign exchange markets reassess the stability of the currency union and the prospect of more accommodative ECB action. We recommend staying short euro against the US dollar and against the Japanese yen,\" Mr Cabau wrote in a note to investors.\nEquity markets and bond markets are also likely to be hit, particularly in Europe where equity markets will almost certainly descend sharply upon opening. There is also likely to be a flight to safety towards US Treasury bonds, German bunds and gold.\nWestpac economists said the US Federal Reserve was less likely to raise rates in September with risk aversion likely to boost the US dollar. This has ongoing repercussions for the global economy and Australia.\n They are also expecting bearish credit markets, and the euro and the Australian dollar to fall as investors head towards the US dollar in a flight to safety.\n\"Contagion remains the key concern,\" Barclays analysts said.\n\"The direct exposure of other EMU member states and the Eurosystem amounts to 3.5 per cent of euro area GDP, while exposure of European banks to Greece has fallen to less than one-tenth of that. Even with low recovery values, direct losses should be manageable.\"\nAnother key event will be the response of the European Central Bank's governing council, which is due to meet on Monday. The ECB is unlikely to immediately cancel the emergency funding to sustain Greece's struggling banks but Barclays analysts say it will be shut down by July 20, pitching the banks towards default as they rapidly run out of cash.\nCommonwealth Bank analysts concur further external financial assistance is unlikely.\n\"The odds of Greece defaulting on upcoming debt obligations is high and the probability Greece exits the eurozone is rising.\"\nIf the emergency funding is cut off, Greece will need to scramble towards a new currency.
