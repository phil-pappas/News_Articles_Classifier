Momentous events often come up short, from the Oslo accords of 1993-95 that were supposed to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to the Arab Spring thaw that give way to the tumult incubated by autocracy. Will the fanfare that greeted the nuclear deal with Iran, and the hope in Iranian streets for an end to crippling sanctions and suffocating isolation, fare any differently? \nSaudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab allies fear Tehran will use unfrozen assets and increased oil revenue to lock in its gains in Arab lands. Given how Iran and its proxies have built a Shia axis across the Levant stretching down into the Gulf, that is understandable. But even cautious estimates of Iran’s unmet investment needs run to $850bn over the next five years. The Gulf states have that sort of money, and should use it to tempt a provisionally pragmatic Iran to pull in its regional horns. More Syria edges towards partition \nThe agreement struck by Iran with the US and five other world powers, which trades verifiable curbs on Tehran’s nuclear programme for a phased relaxation of draconian sanctions on the Iranian economy, still has to be ratified by fragmented political establishments on both sides. Yet US President Barack Obama, as well as the Europeans, Russia and China, are heavily invested in this deal. It is just possible this resolution of a dangerous international stand-off by diplomacy could catch on. The alternative, after all, is war in a region already being ripped to shreds by the conflict between Sunni and Shia, with Saudi Arabia and Iran leading the proxy contest from their respective sides of the schism, and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) that menaces them both gorging on sectarian grievance and serial state failures. \nThese negotiations have boosted Iran’s credibility as the regional power it wants to be. One Sunni Arab veteran is in awe of how Iran has managed to manipulate fear it might develop a nuclear bomb. “They have managed to trade an imaginary asset that does not exist for hundreds of billions of dollars in real assets [which] they’ll use to reinforce all their bridgeheads in our [Arab] lands.” \nIran has won in so far as its right to enrich uranium has been recognised, albeit under invigilation. It has won, too, in helping drive a wedge between the US and its main allies in the region, Israel and Saudi Arabia. But it still needs to turn its regional advances into sustainable advantage — to get on with its Arab neighbours. \nIran needs to refocus from its war of position in the region and reconnect to the world economy, to transform itself into an economic powerhouse — not least for its restive young population. The vast investment the country so badly needs — a succulent honeypot for global and regional companies and lenders — could help glue things together.
