Access to private equity, strategic and institutional investments made the world of difference to help us achieve our business goals. New York, NY\nMadison Ventures’ website was launched Tuesday, June 23, 2015, with two paying customers—one of which has already seen great success.\nThe New York based company is a unique business geared toward marketing startups to raise money and gain exposure in front of hundreds of thousands of qualified investors. With an atypical business model, Madison Ventures does not take commission or equity, but instead, calls for a cheap and fixed marketing fee.\nSince its first week of launching, 15 startups have subscribed to Madison Ventures. T-List, a company featured on the website, has already raised $550,000 with the help of Madison Ventures.\nInvestors should expect to see companies with high potentials for success, vetted first by a panel of accomplished professionals: Tomer Dicturel, Ryan Kim, Mitesh Lakhani, Matt Weiss, Henry Kasindorf, Veerai Lakhani, Erik Moore, and Ryan Hickman.\n“Madison Ventures connects you to a powerful network across the industry.
