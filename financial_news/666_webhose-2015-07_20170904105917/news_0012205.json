After trilateral talks including the European Commission broke down, European Parliament President Martin Schulz told Ukraine's parliament that Russia should quickly return to negotiations with Ukraine to hammer out a long-term gas deal, according to Russian newswires. \nGazprom cut off gas delivery to Ukraine's Naftogaz on 1 July after Kiev's attempts to receive a larger gas discount from Moscow proved a spanner in the negotiation works. \nThe Russian state gas giant, which said the valves had been shut off as Ukraine had not paid in advance for July's gas supplies, refused to budge from offering the same discount to Ukraine as was in place for the second quarter of 2015. \nRussia has offered to keep the price it charges Ukraine through the end of September at $247 per thousand cubic metres of gas, which represents a $40 discount from the maximum price under the terms of a prior agreement. \nHowever, Kiev, which has begun to increasingly rely on supplies from European countries such as Norway, has demanded at least a 30% discount for the third quarter. \nRussian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said earlier that Ukraine should pay the same price for gas as its neighbours do. \nGazprom has previously insisted that the gas pricing formula for Ukraine will not be changed until late 2019, with gas supplies only made after prepayment, irrespective of the price. \nUkrainian gas pipeline operator Ukrtransgaz recently said over the past six months Ukraine has imported 6.3bn cubic metres of gas from Europe and 3.7bn cubic metres of gas from Russia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T17:26:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
