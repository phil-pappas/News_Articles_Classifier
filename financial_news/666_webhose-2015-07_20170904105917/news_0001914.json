(Submitted image) Top Projects: Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building By: Dan Heilman July 10, 2015 6:50 am 0 \nBishop Henry Whipple Federal Building restoration \nAddress: One Federal Drive, Fort Snelling \nProject cost: $154 million \nProject size: 688,800 square feet \nOwner: U.S. General Services Administration; Public Buildings Service; Property Development Division (5PC), Great Lakes Region \nContractor: Ryan Cos. US Inc. \nArchitect: Hammel, Green & Abrahamson (HGA) \nEngineer: HGA \nEditor’s note: This is the second installment in Finance & Commerce’s Top Projects of 2014 series, which recognizes outstanding construction throughout the state. The previous installment is available at finance-commerce.com. \nHow do you rehabilitate a 700,000-square foot building, all the while keeping the 1,200 employees inside working smoothly? Very carefully. \nThe Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building restoration at Fort Snelling was unusual in that it was financed under the U.S. General Services Administration’s use of stimulus funding to enhance energy efficiency and generally upgrade older federal buildings. That led to standards that were beyond exacting, said Hammel, Green & Abrahamson architect Mia Blanchett. \n“The trickiest thing was meeting the very strict, highly efficient energy goals set by the stimulus package,” she said. “They called on us in some cases to beat code by 40 percent.” \nThat meant complete replacement of the mechanical, electrical, plumbing and life safety systems in the building, along with an overhaul of its entries, signage and public spaces. \nAlready, the energy-efficiency measures, which included geothermal heating and cooling, have resulted in a 40 percent reduction in energy use and a 53 percent reduction in water use compared to record in the old building – and a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold certification. Among other achievements, 89 percent of the construction waste from the project was salvaged or recycled. \nDuring the design phase, the use of models dramatically reduced field work and made time for prefabrication of the main mechanical and electrical systems. Meanwhile, a facilities management database streamlined operations and maintenance functions. \nIn Blanchett’s mind, the project’s success had everything to do with having architects and engineers integrated under one roof. \n“In the case of this project, it was all about total system replacement in order to do the work in the time frame of the stimulus package,” she said. “It was about delivery and HGA’s ability to make complex projects work.” \nThe 1960s-era building has lots of granite touches and other distinctive features, so another challenge was preserving the building’s character. \n“We feel the best about preserving the building and meeting all the energy goals – and doing it in a way that was beautiful,” said Blanchett. “There are a lot of agencies in that building, and we’re happy about giving them a healthy work environment for the next 50 years.” \nLike this article?
