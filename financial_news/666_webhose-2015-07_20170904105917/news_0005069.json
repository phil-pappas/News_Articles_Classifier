This year we are looking at providing Rs 10,000 crore of loan for this purpose and I am happy to inform you that we have already sanctioned Rs 1,000 crore so far,” Nabard Chairman and Managing Director Harsh Kumar Bhanwala told reporters here on Sunday.\n“Rather than merely creating capacity we are looking at help improve irrigation efficiency,” he added.\nSpeaking at the 34th Foundation Day of Nabard, Bhanwala said, “the bank has been accredited by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) as the national implementation agency for climate change at the rural level.”\n“The idea is to create a Green Climate Fund with a commitment of USD 100 billion against the present commitment of around USD 10 billion. So, for this USD 10 billion fund, they want a proposal to be routed and implemented with chosen entities who are good in procurement, sensitive to gender issues and who have transparency mechanism,” he said.\nThere are 20 such entities like the World Bank and Asian Development Bank among others which have already been shortlisted. And from the entire South Asia, Nabard is the only one which has been shortlisted for the purpose.\n“Our endeavour would be to source around USD 500 million worth of projects from within the country in the next three years,” he said.\n 13, 2015 6:00 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T08:58:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
