But setbacks at Citroen and DS, the embryonic premium marque, underscore the challenges after years of under-investment.\nThe group's sales edged 2.9 percent higher in Europe, underperforming a recovering market that likely expanded about 7 percent, based on industry data for January-May.\nThe group's market share fell to 10.5 percent in the period from 11.1 percent, according to the same data.\nWith few recent models barring its C4 Cactus compact, Citroen's European registrations rose just 0.5 percent in the first half, drawing little benefit from the recovery.\nThe brand's global sales fell 2.7 percent, while deliveries of DS cars tumbled 16.2 percent.\nCollapsing demand in Latin America also took its toll, yielding a 28.6 percent drop in sales for the French carmaking group.\nRegistrations rose 2.17 percent in China and Southeast Asia, where Peugeot sees its biggest future source of long-term growth with Chinese partner and shareholder Dongfeng.
