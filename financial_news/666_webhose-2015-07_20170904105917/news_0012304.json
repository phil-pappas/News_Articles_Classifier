Jessica Hromas Share on twitter by Anthony Macdonald Fund manager Michael Glennon's small caps education started when he left school and went to work for his family's commercial tile business.\nIt was hard work – selling the types of tiles you would see in public toilets and gym change rooms, which he now describes as a commodity-type product.\nThe 65-year-old business was started by his grandfather and is still run by his dad. Glennon lasted only six months, before he and his dad decided it was better that he try going to university.\n\"I think he fired me actually,\" Glennon laughs.\nBut it was six months well spent. He learned a lot about the hard work required to make a small business successful and how hard it is selling an undifferentiated product in an industry where there are few or no barriers to entry.\nGlennon has taken the key lessons and applied them to picking stocks. And it turned out to be a solid foundation.\nThe Glennon Capital Small Companies Portfolio has returned 84.4 per cent since it was set up in July 2010, while the S&P/ASX All Ordinaries Accumulation Index is up 11.4 per cent.\nHis secret? \"I don't think about investing any differently to owning the whole business,\" he says. \"You need to view yourself as an owner of the business. I don't have a price on it every day. As long as you are happy with what management is delivering – you are investing in a business not trading shares. You have to detach yourself from the share price.\"\n And he starts by looking for good management teams.\nGlennon specialises in picking the next generation of small caps stars, which may repeat the share price rises that have already occurred at companies like Greencross, G8 Education, PIPE Networks or iiNet.\nAbout one-third of the stocks in his portfolio will be microcaps, worth less than $150 million.\nHe listens to ideas from his network of current and former chief executives and business owners, and trawls downloads showing all ASX-listed companies at the smaller end of the market, all in search for the hidden gems.\nAnd then it is all about getting out and meeting management teams.\n\"So much of it is a people thing,\" Glennon says. \"Going out and seeing the people, talking to them, getting an idea about their passion for the business and how they want to drive the business.\"\nAssessing management teams isn't easy for large, well-researched and well-understood companies, let alone forgotten-about micro-caps.\nBut the former Adam Smith Asset Management and Paradice Investment Management stockpicker reckons you need to find passionate chief executives and keep in touch. \"You just ring them; get them on their mobile. A lot of time they don't answer but at least they see your call,\" he says.\n\"You can do a 10-year [discounted cash flow valuation] on the business but what you are modelling is management's ability to do something three or four years out.\"\nGlennon has turned his hand back to public markets and is seeking to raise up to $50 million for a new listed investment company.\nRaising LICs is never easy – and the market has been inundated with offers from well-established fund managers such as Wilson Asset Management, Ellerston Capital, Perpetual Investments and Investors Mutual over the past 12 months.\nBut only a handful specialise in the smaller end of the market, such as NAOS Emerging Opportunities Company and Contango Microcap.\nGlennon reckons it is a good time to be investing in small and microcaps. \"I think the bigger end of the market probably is expensive; the smaller end hasn't moved and there are always cheap businesses out there,\" he says.\n\"The other nice thing about small caps is you can get [price-to-earnings multiple] expansion. So the business doesn't have to start making any more money, it can just start trading at a higher multiples as the market becomes more familiar with the stock.\"\nThe Glennon Small Companies fund is scheduled to start trading trading on a normal basis on August 4.\nPAC Partners, State One Stockbroking and Shaw Stockbroking are handling the deal.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/amacfirst"], "published": "2015-07-05T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:11:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
