The BOE has been in “almost continual contact with our European colleagues” on Greece in the last two weeks, he said.\nThe comments come hours after Greece, which introduced capital controls on Monday, missed a payment to the International Monetary Fund. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has offered to accept proposals from the nation’s creditors to end a standoff over its bailout program, subject to certain conditions.\nThe BOE noted that U.K. banks’ direct exposure to Greece is “very small,” though added that policy makers are alert to the potential ripple effects on the U.K. if the crisis worsens further.\nKnock-On Effects “The United Kingdom is relatively well insulated from the direct consequences of events in Greece,” Carney said.\nThe central bank said it has has “worked closely” with the U.K. Treasury, the Financial Conduct Authority and European counterparts to put in place contingency plans, without providing details. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has said that no one should underestimate the knock-on effects that a Greek exit from the euro would have on Britain. In a statement on Wednesday, he said “we hope for the best; but we prepare for the worst.”\nThe FPC also noted risks related to liquidity. A shock from Greece or elsewhere could lead to a repricing of risk in markets. In its analysis, that could freeze markets, create illiquidity and undermine lending to the real economy. It would also threaten the resilience of banks.\nThe FPC previously raised concerns about liquidity at its March meeting and is awaiting a report in September. On Wednesday, it announced it’s planning a “regular deep analysis” of non-bank activities, including hedge funds, investment funds, derivatives transactions and insurers.\n‘Liquidity Risk’ “The compensation for bearing credit and liquidity risk in some markets has declined by more than may be warranted by the future economic and financial environment,” it said. “Market participants should be alert to these risks” and “price liquidity appropriately.”\nWhile Greece dominated the FPC’s report, the committee also highlighted risks related to a slowdown in emerging markets, particularly China. Domestically, it noted the current-account deficit, the housing market and potential cyber attacks on financial institutions.\nIn relation to property, it said while debt to income levels have declined, they remain high compared to historical norms. In that context, the FPC said the measures introduced a year ago to curb riskier mortgage lending remain warranted.\nOn the current account, the BOE tempered its warning by saying that while the deficit is large, there are no additional risks related to how it’s financed. It also noted the flexible exchange rate could act as a stabilizer in the event of a shock.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T13:24:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
