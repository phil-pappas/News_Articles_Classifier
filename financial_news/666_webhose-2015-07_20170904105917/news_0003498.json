Oil prices fell again Wednesday, with the North American benchmark trading below $50 per barrel.\n“The economy is in a technical recession,” said Mazen Issa, senior foreign-exchange strategist at Toronto Dominion Bank, by phone from New York. “As the data continued to unfold, it became increasingly obvious the economy is continuing to struggle with an oil shock that is much deeper and much more prolonged than previously anticipated.”\nThe loonie, as the currency is known for the image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, was trading at C$1.3031 per U.S. dollar at 3:25 p.m. in Toronto, or 76.74 U.S. cents. If it stays near that level, it would be the lowest close for the currency since September 2004.\nEarlier it fell as low as C$1.3053 per U.S. dollar, which was still short of the intraday low point of C$1.3065 per U.S. dollar briefly touched in March, 2009, when the economy was last in recession.\nWith data already showing the Canadian economy shrank 0.6 percent between January and March, the Bank of Canada’s forecast last week calls for a 0.5 percent contraction in the three months ending in June.", "external_links": ["http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mpr-2015-07-15.pdf\\"], "published": "2015-07-23T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T23:03:03.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
