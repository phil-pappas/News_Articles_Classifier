However, in the past year he has transferred production to Hampshire, to a facility with the capacity to make 10,000 bikes a year. \nMr Akily's factory is currently making 3,000 but he expects to hit peak production in the next three years. \nCycloTricity has already launched an office and warehouse in Sweden, and plans to set up a subsidiary in the US next year. European markets including Germany and Italy are expected to follow. \n“E-bikes have always been niche but they have started to reach mainstream,” said Mr Akily. \n“In the Netherlands, one bike in every five sold is electric. That proportion is gradually coming to the UK.” \nElectric-powered bikes, or e-bikes, became popular in China in the 1990s with the number there recently passing 200m. They started to arrive in Europe around a decade ago and around 25,000 are sold in the UK each year. In Holland, it is closer to 120,000 and in Germany 400,000 were sold last year, industry figures suggest \n• Charging ahead: the electric bike revolution has arrived in Britain", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T20:50:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
