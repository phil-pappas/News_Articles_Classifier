I will take care of that,\" Rajoy added in a Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) message. \nThe government says the Spanish economy will create more than 600,000 jobs this year and start to chip away from next year at its debt mountain. \nIt has forecast the jobless rate to sink to 21.1 percent in 2015 and dip just below the symbolic 20 percent level in 2016. \nIt has raised its economic growth forecast for this year to 3.3 percent -- more than twice the 1.5 percent average rate forecast by Brussels for the eurozone. \nRajoy's conservative Popular Party is touting the recovery ahead of an election due from November, in which it faces a tough challenge from new anti-austerity parties. \nHe has warned Spain could tip back into crisis if rival parties force a change of course on the economy after the election. \nRajoy's government imposed tough spending cuts and tax rises from 2012 that it said were necessary to stabilise the public finances. Spain formally exited recession in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T13:07:55.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
