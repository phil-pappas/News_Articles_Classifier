Protesters lowered themselves with ropes to prevent the ship from passing under the span, forcing the vessel back to port. \nBy late Thursday morning, more than two dozen kayakers were also on the river flanked by protesters dangling from ropes with large red and yellow banners chanting \"Shell No\" as a Coast Guard boat stood watch. The bridge has been opened to road and water traffic, and protesters are letting all other vessels pass under the bridge. \nOnlookers sympathetic to the protests, including a young woman playing a piano, filled a nearby park and occasionally cheered in support. \n\"When that ship turned, that was history,\" said kayaker Michael Foster. \nThe U.S. Coast Guard issued warnings to the protesters, saying they were unwelcome, trespassing and violating the safety zone. \n\"Our primary concern is for the safety of the individuals on the water,\" Coast Guard Petty Officer George Degener said. \"We want them to understand we want them to exercise those First Amendment rights but we want them to be safe.\" \nShell spokesman Curtis Smith said the company respects the rights of individuals to protest. \"We just ask that they do so safely and within the boundaries of the law,\" he said. \nShell hopes to return to the Arctic for the first time since 2012, when it experienced a series of mishaps including the grounding of an oil rig.
