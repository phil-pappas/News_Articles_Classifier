There were steep slides, stunning recoveries; it was all enough to leave investors' heads spinning.\nThe time to get worried is when nobody else is worried.\nAMP's Nader Naeimi There are many theories on why the markets behaved so wildly, what it means at street level and where we might be headed. What is not disputed is that a large amount of money was tossed onto fear-fuelled bonfires.\nGreece's fortunes are flagging. Photo: Getty Images\nThe Asian region markets have shed more than $1 trillion this week alone, led by the giant bear that is China, where panicked retail investors sold off stocks at an astonishing rate when their margin lenders came knocking.\nIn response the government pulled out all stops to prop up the market. A tumble of 30 per cent in the space of three weeks was enough to prompt drastic action as retail investors pondered the stock tips they lapped up from hairdressers and taxi drivers.\n\"In the past three weeks, the Chinese stockmarket has shed over $US3 trillion [$4 trillion] in value – which is more than double the value of the overall Australian stockmarket,\" Fidelity portfolio manager of Australian equities Kate Howitt said.\nIs volatility the new normal? Photo: Tanya Lake\n\"It seems that despite numerous government interventions, high levels of margin lending – which peaked around 9 per cent of market value – have created a self-reinforcing slide.\"\nGlobal drama played out on all sides. Early in the week – feeling so long ago by Friday – it was all about Greece, a long and drawn out drama, toying with tragedy, and then China loomed into view, a fast and mesmerising thriller.\nDefiant but defaulting While Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis rode into the sunset, panicked investors hit the sell button. Photo: Reuters\nAt home the Australian sharemarket, already volatile as it hung on every twist and turn in the tense negotiations between a defiant but defaulting Greece and its indignant creditors over whether they would and should remain in the eurozone, has swung beyond even seasoned market analysts' expectations.\n\"The Grexit [Greek exit from the eurozone] is creating uncertainty and the market is having a hissy-fit,\" Equity Trustees head of asset management Paul Kasian said.\nThis was a prophetic assessment. He was commenting after the late June dress rehearsal for the July turmoil, on a day when the ASX shed $38 billion upon realising that Greece would miss its $2.3 billion loan payment to the International Monetary Fund, due June 30.\n \"It will be jumping at the shadows until something sorts itself out,\" Mr Kasian warned.\nHe was right. A rough start to the week was thus expected, with the Greeks voting in a referendum on Sunday night Australian time.\nOn Monday the Asian markets, including Australia, were the first with the opportunity to react to the results of a snap referendum called by Greece's five-month-old anti-austerity Syriza government on whether Greece should accept Europe's debt bailout conditions.\nIllustration: Simon Bosch\nThe result of the plebiscite was a resounding \"no\", which at the same time dramatically increased the odds of a Grexit.\nPatersons research and strategy co-ordinator Andrew Quin said the \"no\" vote had shifted the Australian market's view of the crisis from the political sphere into the real world. The world where real money is lost.\n\"Greece's debt problems are not over; this is just the beginning,\" he said.\n\"They owe a lot more money to other creditors, and because of the banking structure being closed at the moment, it adds up to hard times ahead and less ability to pay its debt position.\"\nThe ASX fell 1.1 per cent in Monday trading, but as the European and US markets opened it became apparent it had over-reacted, because while global markets did fall, the US markets were down just 0.3 or 0.4 per cent, while the FTSE, closer to the action, shed 0.8 per cent.\nThe sun came up on Tuesday. The ASX saw a spectacular bounce – a 2 per cent gain, or more than 100 points, were added to the sharemarket, while trading in more than half of all Chinese shares were halted.\nThe fact that the price of iron ore had not only crashed below a psychologically important milestone of $US60 a metric tonne, it had shed 11 per cent in just two days went almost unnoticed. Nickel, aluminium and copper also hit three-year-lows.\n\"It just goes to highlight the flaky nature of this market,\" Australian stock report head of research Chris Conway said on the Tuesday.\nWednesday brought a hump-day hangover. Mining stocks were hit hard. When the Chinese markets opened an hour and a half later, plunging 8 per cent within minutes, the ASX promptly handed back all the previous day's gains.\nThat night, iron ore's benchmark price fell 10 per cent in one session, down to $US44.59 a tonne, its biggest one-day decline since the spot markets were established in 2009. Something approaching $1 trillion was wiped from markets around the region in one day.\nThe pain looked set to continue on Thursday. The ASX dipped below 5400 as the mining stocks again bore the brunt of the sell-off.\nThen the Chinese markets rallied, and so too the local sharemarket. By Friday, some resilience had set in, helped by a 10 per cent bounce in the iron ore price on Thursday night. Optimism returned as Greece's revised reform proposals showed it had bowed to many of the demands from its creditors.\nStability returns? By Friday lunchtime it looked as if the market had stabilised, and Chinese markets rallied as the Chinese government's exhaustive list of stop-gap measures seemed to kick in, or at least temper the selling sentiment.\nNow whiplashed market watchers are trying to figure out what it all means.\n\"It's hard to disentangle the various effects these events have on each other,\" QIC chief economist Matthew Peter said.\n\"We're seeing the price of iron ore fall below $50 a metric tonne – that has gone from $60 at the end of financial year – and that has coincided with the dramatic sell-off in the Chinese equity market,\" Dr Peter said.\n\"Are the two things related? It's probably partly a coincidence.\n\"The downturn in the Chinese economy is certainly a factor, that's partly what is happening in the iron ore market, partly a reduction in the demand for steel from mills in China. At the same time we've also had a ramp-up in supply of iron ore coming out of both Western Australia and Brazil.\"\nUntil this week the gyrations of China's sharemarket were not taken seriously by the developed markets as it was considered largely unlinked to the rest of the economy.\nIG chief market strategist Chris Weston remarked during the week \"it does feel that moves in Chinese equities are having a bigger impact on regional sentiment than they did say a week ago or so\".\nDeveloped markets after all aren't accustomed to seeing company price-earnings ratios balloon to as much as 200 times, and daily peaks and troughs swing as much as 10 per cent.\nBefore China's equity markets came off a 12-month bull run in mid-June, US-based index provider MSCI even pushed back the timing on including selected China A-shares – those traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen indices – until \"issues with accessibility and liquidity can be resolved\".\nThis is despite a growing appetite for traders to get in on the Chinese action. Trading in A-shares is heavily restricted for foreigners, but there are some exchange-traded funds and investment firms that give investors access.\nThe Chinese market's 150 per cent rise over 12 months was a background act to the Greek drama. Even traders, including Morgans' Alistair McCorquodale and HC Securities' Mark Lennox, said the real effect on the Australian sharemarket was minimal.\nIt's clear now, though, that Australian investors are jittery and willing to sell when the chips are down.\n\"People who are playing in the financial markets, the investors can create [a self-fulfilling prophecy] and they could push it that way if they want to,\" AMP Capital head of dynamic asset allocation Nader Naeimi said.\n\"If you think it's going to be a bear market, there's no point buying now.\n\"But on the fundamentals side, we have economic recovery ticking up, we have very little in terms of inflation, and central banks are very supportive in the market.\"\nThe central banks, were, unlike in previous financial crises, including that of 2008 and in Europe in 2012, \"on the same page\", Mr Naeimi said, and prepared to do whatever needed to avoid another collapse.\n\"The time to get worried is when nobody else is worried,\" he said.\nThe shakedown was a good thing, Mr Naeimi said, because the market needs to reset itself from its mindset.\n\"Markets need a real shake-out. We need to recalibrate the market sentiment,\" he said.\nThere are the doomsayers. Jeremy Warner, the Telegraph in London's assistant editor, drew parallels with the 1929 Wall Street crash that sparked the Great Depression.\n\"Borrowed money, or margin investing, played a major role in both these outbreaks of speculative excess,\" he wrote.\nBut the majority called it a \"normal\" correction with little effect on the wider economy, primarily because the average retail investor has only 10 per cent of their assets in shares, compared with the US, where the number is closer to 50 per cent.\nMr Naeimi notes that the Chinese sharemarket is still up 70 per cent overall, but its rise was \"too far, too fast\".\n\"The reason it has become very dramatic is what drove it up was a lot of Chinese retail investors, which make up 80 per cent of the market, borrowed money and got involved in margin debt,\" he said.\n\"What the Chinese authorities lost sight of was the need to control that at an earlier stage.\"\nMr Naeimi said those investors who came in well before the \"bubble\" were still well up on their returns on investment. It was those coming in at a late stage – many of them on margin loans – that had to quickly sell off their shares when the market dipped and the margin calls came.\n\"The whole thing became a snowball and self-fulfilling, as they tried to sell their stocks to pay their margins, and the whole thing unravelled very quickly,\" he said.\nMr Naeimi said he believed the market would find a bottom, because much of the margin calls had been paid.\n\"It seems like the panic stage is over, we've still got a sharemarket freeze but what is reassuring is the stockmarket hasn't impacted financial conditions,\" he said.\nCorporate bond markets and interbank liquidity had improved, which Mr Naeimi said are key indicators of financial system health.\n\"Iron ore has got its own issues – it's not just the fact that Chinese shares are falling, miners are still digging and increasing supply, but at the same time the Chinese sharemarket falls would have amplified things,\" he said.\nBut the Chinese economy is a concern, and GDP growth is tracking below the 7 per cent expectations of its government.\nThe slowdown in construction has made the price of Chinese steel cheaper per tonne than cabbage, but Australian miners are still producing iron ore, creating the supply and demand imbalance.\nAt home, the real story is the transition in the economy away from the mining boom, and the big miners – which along with the banks make up more than half the market capitalisation of the ASX 200 – looking for ways to remain profitable while satisfying their yield-hungry investors.\nAtlas Iron founder David Flanagan told Fairfax Media on Thursday that \"the new normal was volatility\". He was referring to the price of iron ore, whose price swings are heading into unprecedented territory. But it could apply to all asset classes in the present environment.\nEven if the Chinese government has managed to stop the panic and its measures work to return the market to its upward trend, investors still have global concerns.\nThe volatility is casting a shadow on the timing of the long-awaited interest rate rise from the US Federal Reserve, the first since 2006. Investors have been hesitant to close their positions until they know that timing, which would place a seal of approval on the state of the US economy.\nMeanwhile, Europe is gearing up for yet another week beginning with a deadline from eurozone leaders to Greece to bring forward more reforms or face expulsion and ending on the cusp of another. This is for its €3.5 billion debt payment to the ECB.
