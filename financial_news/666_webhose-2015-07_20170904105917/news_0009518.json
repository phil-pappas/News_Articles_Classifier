Photo: Bloomberg\nListed mining companies have had a dismal week, with falling commodity prices dragging down most of the sector and little hope of a significant rally in the short term.\nBHP Billiton plummeted this week, losing almost 7 per cent to $25.10, taking it very close to lows last seen during the global financial crisis.\nBut the mining giant wasn't the worst hit. Newcrest Mining has lost 15.4 per cent this week to trade at $11.19, while Paladin Energy lost 13.5 per cent and Evolution Mining lost 12.33 per cent.\nFortescue picked up a little on Friday, trading 0.8 per cent higher at $1.65, but it's still down 3.5 per cent for the week - and on track for its sixth week of losses, its longest stretch in the red since 2006.\nIron ore slipped only slightly overnight, and is holding above $US50, but the bulk commodity's price has nearly halved over the past year.\nMeanwhile, copper hit a six-year low of $US5235 a tonne and the ongoing oil rout has pulled both Brent and WTI back into bear market territory - down more than 20 per cent from recent highs - putting the commodity on track for its worst slump of the last three decades . Another major Australia export, coal, is hovering around 10-year lows.\nAnalysts are warning there was no immediate relief in sight for Australia's beleaguered mining stocks, with global growth slowing and the US dollar rising.\n\"As long as the US dollar is rising and there is no global growth acceleration to rebalance the market, commodity prices will stay low,\" EIM Capital's John Robertson said.\nWhile most commodity companies slumped, Mr Robertson said the notable drop in BHP Billiton's value was also due to the sharemarket finally recognising the mining giant was overvalued.\n\"BHP's value proposition has always been overestimated. It was in almost every fund, individual and institutional, and this demand saved it from the reckoning when the sector repriced, but now it's day has come,\" Mr Robertson said.\nEIM Capital's strong suit has been commodity companies, and the predicted long-term decline has the fund searching for more tailored, pre-listed company opportunities.\n\"We're trying to find new ways of doing things. There are a lot of capital-hungry smaller companies trying to develop mines so we're looking at structuring deals with companies that you can't get at on the ASX yet,\" Mr Roberston said.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/markets/commodities/energy/oil-crash-could-be-far-worse-than-1986-says-morgan-stanley-20150723-gijfc8"], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:34:53.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
