Central Bank of India has also announced plan to sell its housing finance business. Punjab National Bank has already sold part stake in its housing finance arm.\nAs per the latest annual report of ICICI Housing Finance Company, the mortgage market continues to grow, especially in Tier III & IV cities, driven by primary consumption.
