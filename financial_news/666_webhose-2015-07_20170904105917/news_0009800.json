Katherine Griffiths Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro The Australian Securities and Investment Commission has laid down a blueprint for banks to fix the way they set key benchmark interest rates or face further punishment.\nThe corporate watchdog released a detailed report on Wednesday identifying the issues it sees with the setting of key benchmark rates used in financial markets as its investigation into potential manipulation of the bank bill swap rate is frustrated by banks.\nThe report said benchmark rates were manipulated to increase the value of positions held by a certain bank, to trigger stop losses among clients and force them into losses, by sharing confidential client information and submitting low rates to force down an institutions cost of funding.\nPoor oversight, bad culture or incentives that encouraged such actions had contributed to misconduct that had resulted in client losses, while undermining confidence in financial markets, the report said.\n\"Poorly-designed incentives are central to misconduct. However strong the compliance structures that are put in place, poorly-designed incentives will inevitably increase the risk of non-compliance with legal requirements at the individual level,\" the report said.\nBanks must improve \"compliance systems, controls, procedures, policies, governance and senior management oversight arrangements, as well as incentive structures,\" ASIC said.\nDealers should also review past conduct and report any findings to ASIC while wealth managers and other investors should engage with dealers to make sure they are handling orders appropriately.\nThe detailed report, however, offered little guidance as to the progress of the multi-year investigation into manipulation of the bank bills swap rate that being headed by commissioner Cathy Armour. ASIC has devoted unprecedented resources to the complex investigation which ASIC said was \"ongoing and no conclusions have been drawn yet\".\n Last month, ASIC chair Greg Medcraft expressed his frustration that some \"appalling\" banks were deliberately delaying the corporate watchdog's investigation through an \"overly legalistic approach\" in responding to requests for information.\nThe bank mentioned is understood to be ANZ, which stood down seven traders on full pay due to the investigation. While other major banks are understood to be investigated and have handed over years of chat room data and phone conversation recordings, there have been no further developments this year.\nBenchmark interest rates are set daily by market participants through various mechanisms and are used to determine interest rates on billions of dollars of bonds. Australia's bank bill swap rate is also used by the banks to set lending rates on home loans and commercial loans.\nArmour said ASIC was looking into the conduct of both domestic and foreign banks and has already accepted enforceable undertakings from three foreign banks – UBS, BNP Paribas and Royal Bank of Scotland – totalling $3.6 million.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-07-08T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T04:10:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
