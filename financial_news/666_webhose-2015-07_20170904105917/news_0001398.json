The incident had no environmental repercussions. \nEnvironmental watchdog Greenpeace, in its 2012 Nuclear Stress Test report, called for the plant to be phased out due to its age and danger that a large earthquake could represent for the reactor core.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T22:14:23.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
