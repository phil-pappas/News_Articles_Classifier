Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Ky Chow Few office wisdoms are discussed more than the wrongs of our sedentary lifestyles. A rub of the eyes or back so often triggers a two minute anthropology conference on the office floor, covering topics such as vitamin D deficiency, mammoth-hunting ancestors and even a dystopic future full of blubbery bed-bound organisms.\nUnfortunately, we all then promptly return to our eye watering monitors and back bending chairs, any irony swept below the next wave of emails, deadlines or YouTube funnies.\nIronically, your saviour could be an app. Activity tracking apps such as Apple's Health, Google Fit, Pedometer++ and our favourite, Jawbone's UP, are digital guardian angels who seek to harness our screen addictions for good rather than evil.\nYou don't even need those black rubber bracelets, instead these apps use your smartphone's inbuilt accelerometer (the thing that automatically rotates the screen) to tally your steps each day with an eye to hitting the 10,000 step target recommended by the National Heart Foundation and World Health Organisation.\nApps such as Apple Health, Steps and Pedometer++ show your steps as a simple colourful graph or meter, and chasing the 10,000 line might be enough to shame many into moving. It's Jawbone's UP, however, that can take your activity level to the next level, thanks to a social media activity feed, a \"Smart Coach\" guide full of personalised tips, and a \"gamification\" element that makes walking much more exciting than it should be.\nUP's activity feed is much simpler and cleaner than Facebook's so you won't feel too bad about yet another social media temptation.\nUP posts not only your step tally, but also those of your friends with the app, with scope to comment or if you prefer a light touch, click on a happy or sad yellow emoji to encourage each other.\nThe friendly Smart Coach posts advice and encouragement in your feed, and thanks to partnerships, you'll also see Strava cycling workouts and meals via the MyFitnessPal food diary app.\n As I've mentioned before , a 3.1/10 score on your sneaky burger lunch from UP hurts enough to make you think twice the next time the aromas tempt you on the footpath.\nMaking a game of it One of my favourite features in UP is its \"gamification\" of fitness, which lets you challenge friends to \"duels\" to see who can walk the most in, say, three days. Unlike Strava challenges that are confined to hard core runs and bike rides, walking is a universal playing field.\nAfter falling behind in a 3 day challenge, I pushed myself to extra lunchtime walks and even started to plan walks to a further train station, particularly after receiving a little trash talking from my friend. I'm a little competitive.\nWithout UP's banter, tips and guidance, other apps seem almost dull. Steps, Pedometer++ and Apple's native Health app aren't much more than attractive graphs of your step tally, though that may be enough motivation for some.\nSame goes for Apple Watch's Activities app, to whose coloured progress dials I've become a little indifferent.\nWearable benefits Wearable trackers such as the Apple Watch and Fitbits do have other advantages, of course. Some buzz on your wrist to remind you to stand once an hour and the more advanced wearables connect you to the many non-fitness related parts of your life such as emails and phone calls.\nThey also go where phones often can't - while the latter are fine for tracking everyday activities around town and the office, an iPhone-only app won't track your gym workout unless you're the type who is happy to strap a phone to your arm.\nMore puzzling is that UP won't give you credit for climbing stairs or hills, even though the iPhone's sensors records such data and pipe it through to Apple Health and even Pedometer++.\nHopefully an app update will fix this because a Duels and Smart Coach kudos based on stair climbs actually sounds like fun.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/kybusiness", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/106721669287068280637"], "published": "2015-07-17T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T14:06:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
