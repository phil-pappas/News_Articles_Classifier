They just want the unearned things to keep falling from the sky, so I think that I've been the fortunate one.\"\nIn May, Mrs Rinehart's two eldest children, John Hancock and Bianca Rinehart, successfully stripped control of a $4 billion-plus family trust away from their mother. The trust was established by Mrs Rinehart's father, the late Lang Hancock, for his grandchildren.\nAmong the claims in separate Federal Court proceedings, the two eldest children allege that Lang Hancock left exploration leases that underpin the soon-to-be completed Roy Hill iron ore mine to his grandchildren, not his daughter.\nThe construction of the Roy Hill project has been depicted as the fulfillment of the Hancock dream of becoming a mine owner-operator; although Mr Hancock was involved in running asbestos mining operations for some years.\nMrs Rinehart's wealth has largely been derived from joint venture profits from the Hope Downs mines that involved exploration and evaluation under her chairmanship of Hancock Prospecting, although they are built on inherited ore deposits.\n Australia's richest person defended her own legacy in the ABC series, where she spoke at length about the state of the company following the death of her father in 1992.\n\"The business was in a very difficult state when I first took over the company,\" Mrs Rinehart said.\n\"You know I walked into a situation where cheques were getting written, popped in drawers so that when people phoned up they could honestly say, look, we've signed the cheque ... you'll get it ultimately.\"\nShe said that Hancock Prospecting had to get out of an \"arrangement with Russia\" that could have killed the company.\n\"So I had to go to Russia and get out of that commitment, that was not easy. I took with me somebody who was supposed to stay in the meeting with me and was so frightened his hair was up and he kept going off to vomit or whatever in the bathroom. It was a very frightening experience because I wasn't sure about getting out of the country after delivering a very difficult message to deliver – we can't do this.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:08:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
