However, its new revision lowers the forecast to 3.5%. \nThis is based on sales having grown 2.9% during the first half, and an expectation they will grow at a more positive pace of 3.7% over the next five months. The estimates include general retail sales and non-store sales, and exclude automobiles, gas stations and restaurants. \nRevised non-store sales, the NRF says, are now expected to grow between 6% and 8%, still within the 7% to 10% range originally forecast. \n&quotFor years consumer spending has been hampered by lackluster growth in our economy,\" said NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay. &quotMuch of that blame can be shifted to Washington where too much time has been spent crafting rules and regulations that almost guarantee negative consequences for consumers and American businesses alike. Until the government and our elected leaders get serious about enacting policies that lift consumer confidence, create economic growth and spur investment, we will continue this trend of solid, but not exceptional, performance in the economy.\" \nDespite this, Shay says he is optimistic consumer spending in the second half will benefit from recent housing and labour market improvements and lower energy costs, and that consumer confidence will grow enough to bolster retail purchases for the year. \n&quotA confluence of events, including treacherous weather throughout the US through most of the winter, issues at the West Coast ports, a stronger US dollar, weak foreign growth and declines in energy sector investments all significantly and negatively impacted retail sales so far this year, and thus have changed how future sales will shape up for the rest of 2015,\" said NRF chief economist Jack Kleinhenz. \n&quotAdditionally, household spending patterns appear to have shifted purchases toward services and away from goods, though this may be transitory. Additionally, a deflationary retail environment has been especially challenging for retailersâ€™ bottom lines.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T19:42:26.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
