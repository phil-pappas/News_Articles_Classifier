Looking at everything from the levels of equity in homes to the size of down payments and years left on a mortgage, it gives a complex picture of where the U.S. housing markets strengths and weaknesses lie in the 25 biggest metro areas.\nHere are 5 of the biggest strengths (and weaknesses) among these metro areas:\nBloomberg Slide 2 of 7 Highest level of home equity\nNew York: 47%\nNational average: 30%\nResidents in the New York metro area have the highest amount of home equity (47%), nearly four times more than the metro area with the least amount of equity (Las Vegas with 12%). A high level of home equity — which represents the current market value of a home after the remaining mortgage — is a sign of rising house prices. New York was followed by Boston. (43%), Rochester, N.Y. (38%) and Northern New Jersey (38%). Few markets had so little home equity as Las Vegas: Homes in Jacksonville, Fla. (20%) had the next the lowest percentage of home equity, which was nearly double the home equity of Sin City.\nRead: Where urban planning turns towns into ‘private country clubs’\nShutterstock Slide 3 of 7 Fewest underwater mortgages\nRochester, N.Y. (6.1%)\nNational average: 15%\nRochester, known for iconic American companies including Xerox XRX, +2.18% , Kodak and Bausch & Lomb, had the lowest percentage of underwater mortgages (6.1%) — where the value of the home is worth less than the actual mortgage — followed by Boston (6.7%), Austin, Texas (7.3%) and Oklahoma City (7.3%). But housing markets that still have yet to recover from the Great Recession have a long way to go: Once again, Las Vegas was at the bottom of the list (39% of homes in negative equity), followed by Orlando, Fla. (32%), Detroit (31%) and Jacksonville, Fla. (30%).\nRead: ‘Underwater’ American homeowners still drowning in mortgage debt\nBloomberg Slide 4 of 7 Down payments from zero to 10%\nNew York: 34.1%\nNational average: 49.8%\nJust 34.1% of home buyers in New York had a down payment of zero to 10% at the time of closing, followed by Northern New Jersey (32.8%), Boston (34.8%) and Hartford, Conn. (37.5%). Some 62.4% of homes in San Antonio had such a low down payment, followed by 54.3% in Austin, 58.6% in Nashville and 50.2% in Orlando. “Lower down payments suggest riskier loans, says Stanley D. Smith, professor of finance at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. For example, with a sharp drop in house prices, those mortgage holders own less of their home outright, have less incentive to pay off their loan and may be tempted to strategically default on their mortgage, he says.\nRead: Buying a home is getting easier – at least in one way\nShutterstock Slide 5 of 7 Shortest time until mortgage is paid\nRochester, N.Y.: 17 years\nNational average: 21 years\nGiven that the housing boom ended in 2008, most homeowners who bought during that time could hardly expect to be free of their mortgage (or mortgages) anytime soon. The lowest median number of years left until the mortgages are paid off for homes was in the Rochester, N.Y., metro area (17 years), according to the WalletHub survey, followed by Hartford, Conn. (19 years), Oklahoma City and San Antonio, Texas (19 years). Most residents of the Seattle metro area will have to wait 25 years before they own their home outright, followed by Las Vegas (24 years).\nRead: Most Americans can’t afford their house\nShutterstock Slide 6 of 7 Lowest percentage of ‘easy’ mortgages\nBoston: 9.2%\nNational average: 17%\nThere is still a hangover in some markets from the looser pre-recession financial standards and rampant subprime mortgage lending. The percentage of total mortgages obtained with no proof of income, assets or debt was the lowest in the Boston metro area (9.2%), followed by Orlando, Fla. (20.6%), New York (19%). Northern New Jersey (18%) was the easiest to get a mortgage with spotty qualifications, and highest in Tampa, Fla. metro area (24%). Also with more stringent lending standards were the metro areas of Chicago (10%), Jacksonville, Fla. (11.1%) and Oklahoma (11.3%).\nRead: A lower homeownership rate is the ‘new normal’\nMarketWatch Slide Shows\nFOOD & DRINK Getty Images • How much it costs to shop at Whole Foods\n• 7 reasons some shoppers hate Costco\n• 5 things NOT to buy at Costco and Sam’s Club\n• Trying to avoid trans fats?
