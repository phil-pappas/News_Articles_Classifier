In May, the retailer of sporting goods said underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) would match analysts' forecasts but pre-tax profit and earnings per share would be marginally ahead. \n\"Despite the governance-related concerns of the market (reduced disclosure, Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) /Debenhams (Other OTC: DBHSF - news ) stakes, zero hours contracts, USC administration) and a slower than expected progression into Europe, we remain confident that Sports Direct can drive greater profitability from its leading UK position and replicate its successful model across the continent, supporting a substantial long-term growth opportunity,\" said Numis analyst Andrew Wade in a note issued on Wednesday. \nNumis predicted EBITDA of £379m, compared to the previous year's £331.4m. The brokerage recommended a 'buy' rating on Wednesday. \nDixons Carphone (LSE: DC.L - news ) also releases its annual results with UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) predicting pre-tax profit of £377.5m, earnings per share of 24.4p and a dividend of 8p. \nThe company has reported a strong fourth quarter, driven by the UK, raising its pre-tax profit guidance to \"slightly above the opt end of a previously guided range of £355m-£375m. \n\"The recent performance in terms of profitable market share gains and new contract wins clearly shows the success of the merger last summer, despite the fact that most of the merger benefits are probably yet to accrue,\" said UBS analyst Andrew Hughes. \n\"Looking ahead, the key focus will likely be on any final comments on the scale and timing of these benefits (both sales and margin related), the shape of the group going forward following the exit from Germany and Holland, and whether the group decides to accelerate the space change programme from a position of P&L and balance sheet strength.\" Away from companies, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will be in the spotlight again on Thursday, which will be the last day of her two days on Capital Hill to discuss monetary policy. Yellen is expected to say that an increase in short-term interest rates is likely to come at some point this year, according to prepared remarks ahead of the testimony. \nShe will reiterate the stance she set out on 10 July in a speech in Cleveland, with traders expected to tune into the question and answer session scheduled after her speech. \nThursday 16 July INTERIM EX-DIVIDEND DATE Crystal Amber Fund Ltd., Sanderson Group (LSE: SND.L - news ) , WH Smith (LSE: SMWH.L - news ) QUARTERLY EX-DIVIDEND DATE Merchants Trust, Middlefield Canadian Income PCC, TwentyFour Select Monthly Income Fund Limited INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ANNOUNCEMENTS Balance of Trade (EU) (10:00) Consumer Price Index (EU) (10:00) Continuing Claims (US) (13:30) ECB Interest Rate (EU) (12:45) Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (EU) (10:00) Initial Jobless Claims (US) (13:30) New Car Registrations (EU) (10:00) Philadelphia Fed Index (US) (15:00) Q2 Schlumberger Ltd. \nGMS (Taiwan OTC: 6481.TWO - news ) Plus500 Ltd (Stuttgart: P55.SG - news ) (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) FINALS Dixons Carphone , Sports Direct International (Other OTC: SDIPF - news ) IMSS Experian SPECIAL DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE Jarvis Securities (LSE: JIM.L - news ) SPECIAL EX-DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE Homeserve EGMS Aer Lingus Group AGMS Aurora Investment Trust, Burberry Group (Other OTC: BBRYF - news ) , Caledonia Investments, Dekeloil Public Ltd, FirstGroup (LSE: FGP.L - news ) , Hansa Trust, Hansa Trust 'A' Non Voting Shares, Infinis Energy (LSE: INFI.L - news ) , LondonMetric Property (LSE: LMP.L - news ) , Mckay Securities (LSE: MCKS.L - news ) , Octopus AIM VCT, RAB Special Situations Company Limited, Telford Homes (LSE: TEF.L - news ) , Wynnstay Properties (LSE: WSP.L - news ) TRADING ANNOUNCEMENTS Hilton Food Group FINAL DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE Aberdeen Japan Investment Trust FINAL EX-DIVIDEND DATE Anpario (LSE: ANP.L - news ) , Bacit Limited (LSE: BACT.L - news ) , Downing One VCT , Energy Technique (LSE: ETQ.L - news ) , F&C Global Smaller Companies, Halma (LSE: HLMA.L - news ) , Invesco Asia Trust, IS Solutions (LSE: ISL.L - news ) , Martin Currie Pacific Trust, Quantum Pharma (LSE: QP.L - news ) , Walker Crips Group, Walker Greenbank (LSE: WGB.L - news )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T19:01:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
