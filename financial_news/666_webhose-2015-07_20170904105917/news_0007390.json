Proponents argue that it will raise the standard of living for workers on the low end of the income spectrum. That sounds logical. Detractors say that it will hurt small businesses and lead to increased layoffs. That also sounds right. Who is correct? I realize some of you will agree with me and others will not. Whatever your view, that’s fine. After all, this is an ongoing debate and America is still the land of free speech (sort of).\nA Brief Update\nSeveral cities have already passed legislation to raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour, phased in over a few years. The list includes Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. In addition, at least 25 states have established a minimum wage which is higher than that set by the federal government. Finally, other cities and states are considering raising their minimum wage. Actually, this issues should be decided by cities and states rather than the federal government since the cost of living is so varied. How will this impact the U.S. economy? The answer is part educated guess and part empirical data. Let’s begin with the latter.\nThe fact is, many workers who earn the minimum wage are also receiving some form of federal assistance. If their income rises as a result of a law requiring a higher minimum wage, they could lose their assistance. To avoid this, some workers in Seattle have requested fewer hours from their employer. There is another consequence to the higher minimum wage. That is higher prices. Again in Seattle, some restaurants have raised their prices by 15 percent to cover the higher wage. Some of these establishments are asking patrons to not tip, since prices have been raised. However, this reduces the income of the servers who depend heavily on tips. These are facts.\nWhat can a business do to keep expenses low and stay profitable? Here are five options.\n1) Raise Prices\nIf a restaurant is located within a city with a higher minimum wage, and they raise their prices, customers may decide to patronize a competitor located outside the city limits. This would apply to any type of retail business. A higher minimum wage could also reduce a municipality’s tax collections if it drives business to another locality. If the price increase doesn’t make the businesses significantly less competitive, then this scenario is less likely. Much of this depends on the profit margin of the business. Some have more flexibility than others.\n2) Reduce Staff\nThe largest expense in business is often the cost of labor. Reducing costs by cutting staff solves one problem but may create another. That is, if this creates a lack of workers to adequately serve its customers. Therefore, simply cutting staff will only work if the business can operate with fewer employees. However, if this was a viable option, they probably would have already done so. One way to make this work is to increase efficiency, which brings us to the next item.\n3) Incorporate Technology\nThis has been a trend for decades and will certainly continue, even if the minimum wage isn’t raised. However, if a business’s labor costs rise as a result of this law, it could accelerate the investment in (or conversation to) technology and replace workers. Although this requires a capital outlay (which is likely tax deductible), in the long run, technology saves money. It will reduce employee benefits, doesn’t call in sick or show up late for work, or talk back to the boss. In addition, technology can work 24/7, without a vacation.\n4) Move to a Different Locality\nIf you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. If a city government places too much of a burden on a business, the owner may decide to relocate. With a small business, this is more likely if the move isn’t too far from their customer base. This could prompt businesses to move outside the city limits. A larger business may decide to move to another state. Of course, America’s mega corporations can move to a different state or to another country. The latter could be accomplished with a literal move or through a tax inversion. For smaller companies with fewer options and narrow profit margins, the last option may be their only choice.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T19:23:16.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
