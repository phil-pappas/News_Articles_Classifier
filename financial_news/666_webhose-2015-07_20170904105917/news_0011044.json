Glenn Hunt by Lucille Keen Implicit physical and industrial threats from the militant construction union make it extremely difficult to reach reasonable agreements, an industrial relations director for the Master Builders Association told the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption.\nJohn Nikolic said negotiations with the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union over workplace agreements were \"extraordinarily difficult\".\n\"There's always a gun in the back of the room which is the threat of disruption to people's sites and livelihood if people don't agree to get inside the loop and enter into the EBA,\" he said. \"The concessions that are offered are ridiculous in many ways.\"\nMr Nikolic told the Canberra hearing the union used physical and verbal intimidation to pressure companies into signing workplace agreements.\nHe began detailing an incident he was told about, but was stopped by the CFMEU's lawyer, John Agius.\n\"Well, the threats come in a range of forms,\" Mr Nikolic said. \"Primarily, it is to disrupt the business and disrupt the sites that they're working on, but, well, I suppose, I mean they come within a package of threats.There's going to be interference with clients and tendering and regrettably there is also physical and verbal intimidation.\"\nMr Nikolic said the CFMEU had not responded to any correspondence from the association since the industry group made a submission to the commission.\nCFMEU ACT officials are expected to appear before the commission later this week, but it is unclear if organiser John Lomax, who was arrested on Friday and charged with blackmail , will be called.\n The former NRL Canberra Raiders player had been expected to give evidence at the hearing this week.\nMr Lomax's arrest came a week after former CFMEU organiser Halafihi \"Fihi\" Kivalu was arrested on two charges of blackmail after leaving the commission hearing. Mr Kivalu has pleaded not guilty and was freed on bail last week.\nReappearing on Monday, formwork subcontractor Elias Taleb, who previously told the commission he had paid bribes to Mr Kivalu, said he recorded conversations he had with union officials because \"they always tell me things then lie about it\".\n\"I recorded almost every single conversation with the union,\" Mr Taleb said.\nMr Taleb said he did not know where the money he was paying Mr Kivalu was going and did not go above the organiser as he was the only man he knew from the union.\nHe said he started paying Mr Kivalu money from May 2012 and he did not go to the police about it because he was new to Australia.\n\"Every one is scared of the union,\" Mr Taleb said. \"People were talking about the likes of Hindmarsh, for example, a big building company. It tried to do something against the union; they almost bankrupted them. Every one scared of the union. I didn't think it was a good idea to even go to the cops and say anything to them.\"\nThe hearing will continue in Canberra Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T11:04:31.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
