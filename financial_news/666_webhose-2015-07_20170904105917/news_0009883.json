The yield on 10-year government bonds climbed 14 basis points to 9.9 percent, headed for the highest since Sept. 30. Kurdish PKK rebels in northern Iraq were hit as F-16 warplanes took off late Friday to bomb Islamic State positions in Syria. \nTurkey’s military offensive last week followed a suicide bomb blamed on Islamic State that killed more than 30 people in a border town July 20. The latest strikes have raised concerns that they may further endanger the government’s stalled peace talks with the PKK to end an insurgency that has spanned three decades. The violence comes during a period of political instability as the ruling AK Party struggles to find a coalition partner and as investors prepare for the U.S Federal Reserve to raise rates. \n“Given that emerging market currencies are broadly under pressure from fears about the impact of a U.S. rate hike and concerns about global growth and global trade growth, the fact that Turkey has the additional problem of renewed conflict with the PKK, as well as fighting IS in Syria, the lira could be faring a lot worse,” Marc Ostwald, a global strategist at ADM Investor Services International Ltd. in London, said by e-mail. The lira is likely to be “at the back of the queue” for bargain hunters given “the adverse political backdrop,” he said. Citigroup \nCitigroup Inc. is betting the lira will drop to 3.02 against a basket of dollars and euros, according to an e-mailed note. The lira was trading at 2.9094 against the currency basket. \n“Intensifying noise in the Syrian border is making coalition talks more difficult,” Citigroup’s London-based currency strategist Luis Costa wrote in an e-mailed note. “Real money and leveraged investors started to close many of the lira longs established in the previous weeks. We believe this process is not over yet.” \nThe North Atlantic Council will meet on Tuesday after Turkey requested a meeting to discuss its crackdown on militant groups and jihadists. Turkey sees both the PKK and Islamic State as a threat, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in Istanbul on Saturday, Hurriyet newspaper reported.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T14:55:41.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
