Employment For Past Little While \nHow do we compare to our friends down south? \nIn June, the employment rate in Canada (adjusted to US concepts) was 61.9%, compared with 59.3% in the United States. On a year-over-year basis, the employment rate was unchanged in Canada, while it increased by 0.3 percentage points in the United States. \nSo in terms of jobs, this talk of recession in Canada might be premature, but then again, recession has little to do with jobs (directly). \nSome disheartening news in the report was: \nEmployment declined for youths aged 15 to 24 and increased for men aged 55 and over. There was little change among the other demographic groups. \nYouth unemployment is still running at the 12% range, and for men 55 and over my concern is, that is me! Unemployment for Past Little While \nThe graph keeps showing no change in unemployment for a good long while, is the Canadian economy stuck? The Big Table \n\nThe big report this time is from Employment by class of worker and industry (based on NAICS1) â€“ Seasonally adjusted , and Stats Canada is now making it easily changed for your needs:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T04:54:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
