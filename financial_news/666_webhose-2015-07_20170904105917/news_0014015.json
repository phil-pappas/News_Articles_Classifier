(AP) -- A Shell Oil icebreaker has retreated after a showdown with environmental activists dangling from Portland, Oregon's tallest bridge. \nEnvironmental activists on St. Johns Bridge and kayakers on the water below have been blocking the icebreaker from heading to the Arctic for a drill operation. \nThe icebreaker Fennica arrived in Portland for repairs last week. The vessel was damaged earlier this month in the Aleutian Islands when it struck an underwater obstruction, tearing a gash in its hull. \nIt started its journey to the Arctic early Thursday before stalling in the face of 13 dangling activists linked by ropes. It then turned around to the delight of protesters gathered in a nearby park. \nThe U.S. Coast Guard warned the activists they were breaking the law, but took no action.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T19:37:49.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
