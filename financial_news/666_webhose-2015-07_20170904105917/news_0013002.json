Darrian Traynor Share on twitter by Lucille Keen Luxury Hotel Group The Langham is looking at more properties in Australia as it tries to grow its brand to capture North American baby boomers, its global chief executive says.\nLangham Hospitality Group global chief executive Robert Warman said the company would love to have a property in north Queensland and Perth.\n\"I'd love to have a resort up near the Great Barrier Reef because we have a huge market from China and we hope to have something there very soon,\" Mr Warman said.\n\"We've also been looking in Perth. We would very much like to grow in Australia. It's a matter of getting the opportunities.\"\nOccupancy rates for the group's two hotels, Melbourne and Sydney, have doubled in the past year, Mr Warman said, boosted by the local market looking for weekend \"staycations\".\n\"From an economic point of view, generally hotels in Melbourne and Sydney do very well from that Sunday through to Thursday because they have strong national and international business travel,\" Mr Warman said.\n\"But the beauty in Melbourne and Sydney is that there is a strong support from the local market in the food and beverage business, as well as coming to stay for the weekend.\"\nShift from owner-operator Mr Warman said the company was shifting away from the owner-occupier model to managing hotels under The Langham brand.\n\"Up until a few years ago we really were mostly a company that owned and operated. We have found that over the past couple of years more and more of our customers have asked us to get in more locations so it wasn't feasible at growing at this rate owning all our hotels. For the first time in the last 12 months we have managed a few hotels in China for someone else using The Langham name.\"\nHe said this is particularly the case with the group's new brand of hotels, Cordis, which will open its first hotel open in Mongkok, Hong Kong in August, in what was the Langham Place, with another five to be announced.\nMr Warman said the brand was less rigid and formal than The Langham offering, aimed at the business traveller and families.\nHe said the new brand, which is yet to be launched in Australia, had the ability to grow faster than The Langham.\n\"It's a little more accessible to more people,\" he said.\n\"Once we open the Mongkok Cordis we will actively pursue opportunities outside the Hong Kong and Chinese markets.\"\nAnd while the Chinese tourist remains vital to the Australian operations, the brand is bracing itself for the influx of American baby boomers it tips will be the next growth market for the Australian tourism sector .\nMr Warman said the trick for creating a successful hotel in Australia was to develop a seven-day-a-week product. He said hotels around the world deal with the fluctuation in currencies and it was just part of doing business.\n\"We find that it goes in cycles,\" Mr Warman said.\n\"It's just something you deal with as an international business. Some years we get a benefit doing business in Australia; sometimes it hurts us a little bit.\"\nDollar lures boomers Mr Warman said with the dollar dropping below US74Â¢, the next target market for the tourism sector was the baby boomers from North America.\n\"I think with the dollar so high, there has been an enormous pent-up demand from North American baby boomers who traditionally haven't taken long vacations because of the culture,\" Mr Warman said.\n\"Taking a trip to Australia, because of the distance and time it takes to get here, was very difficult for Americans.\" But Mr Warman said as the baby boomers reached retirement and scaled back on work commitments, they have more time and the financial resources to travel to destinations like Australia.\n\"If there is any negative from the currency, there is a positive from this market which has a strong dollar.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/lucillekeen"], "published": "2015-07-30T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:52:03.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
