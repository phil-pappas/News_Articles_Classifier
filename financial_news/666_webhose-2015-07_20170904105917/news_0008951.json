Jessica Hromas by Sue Mitchell Richard Wilson is looking forward to the day he can go off the grid – not at his Sydney home but at homewares chain IKEA.\nAs sustainability manager for IKEA Australia, the 43 year old is spearheading arguably the nation's most ambitious private sector renewable energy project.\nThe world's biggest furniture retailer, which has annual sales of €30 billion ($44 billion), is aiming to be energy neutral by 2020, with 100 per cent of its energy needs coming from renewable sources.\nIKEA's Australian business took the first steps last year, installing 16,000 solar panels on the roofs of six stores, including almost 4000 panels at its flagship store at Tempe, near Sydney Airport.\nThe panels are now generating just under five megawatts of energy a year – enough to power air conditioning systems and low-energy lighting in stores and distribution centres during the day.\n\"It's really cool,\" says Wilson, who gave up his job running Randwick Council's Sustaining Our City program almost three years ago to join the Swedish retailer, attracted to the company by its ambitious long-term environmental targets.\n\"When they do have bold ambitions it makes things happen,\" says Wilson. \"It was the 100 per cent renewable energy targets that got me excited about working for IKEA – I want to be on that journey.\"\nIt's a journey that may not have got off the ground if not for Labor's now defunct carbon tax. When electricity was cheap and solar panels expensive, the business case simply did not stack up.\n \"But we just kept recalculating it,\" says Wilson. \"We managed to get it in with the carbon tax and panels kept coming down in price.\"\nThe company pressed ahead after the carbon tax was scrapped by the Abbott government last year and now expects to achieve payback in less than 10 years, in line with its parent's relatively generous return on investment hurdles.\nWilson and his boss, IKEA Australia country manager David Hood, are reluctant to criticise the federal government's attitude towards renewable energy policies.\n\"It's not so much the government's policy; it's that we, as businesses and as companies, when we talk about social conscience, we have to be doing more when it comes to waste and everything to do with energy and resources,\" said Hood.\n\"So whatever the government does and whether the government decides to do something with solar panels is not so relevant for us because we've decided to do it anyway,\" he said.\nHood concedes that if IKEA was a public company it could not have set such ambitious targets, but hopes its investment in solar will inspire other companies to follow its lead.\nLast month IKEA's global CEO, Peter Agnefjall, announced the company would commit another €1 billion to fight climate change, on top of the €1.5 billion invested since 2009.\n\"It would be great if any government around the world was to mirror or improve on that,\" said Wilson, who believes companies and countries need to set ambitious targets to achieve results.\n\"If you set a target of 50, 60 or 70 per cent, there's always someone who will think 'well, I'll be in the 50 or 40 per cent that does not have to do it',\" he said.\n\"By saying we're going to be 100 per cent [energy neutral] we go all in and do our best to make it happen,\" he said.\nRecycling and repurposing IKEA is not only generating its own power but reducing energy use by replacing halogen and fluorescent lighting with LED and changing the way it makes products such as Billy bookcases and mattresses to reduce the materials that go into their construction and the resources required for shipping and distribution.\nIn the last few months, for example, IKEA has started selling mattresses that can be rolled into bundles, taking up less space in shipping containers and making it easier for customers to take them home in their cars rather than delivering them in trucks.\nThe company is also striving towards zero waste to landfill, recycling food waste from its cafes and restaurants, scrapping plastic bags, using recyclable cardboard rather than wooden pallets and fixing rather than discarding damaged furniture.\nIKEA recently established a joint venture with Mission Australia to create jobs by recycling mattresses – turning foam fillings into carpet underlay and linings into the innards of punching bags.\nGlobally, IKEA is investing $US1.9 billion in wind farms, using sustainably grown cotton and recycled timber, and working fast-growing bamboo into salad bowls, chopping boards and bathroom accessories.\n\"We see us transitioning into less of a linear model – take, make, dispose – and more of a closed loop,\" says Wilson, who practices what he preaches by riding his bike to work and making compost at his home in Sydney's east.\nHowever, Wilson is under no illusions about the task ahead if the company is to achieve its 100 per cent energy neutral goal within five years – especially if it proceeds with plans to double its store footprint by opening more mega-stores, a couple of smaller format stores, as well as parcel pick-up points and online collection depots.\n\"2020 is still a few years away but the days go quickly and so do the years,\" Wilson said. \"To meet our goal to be 100 per cent energy neutral we're going to need some help. The stores only have so much footprint. We need different types of renewable technology to help us meet that goal.\"\nWilson is also keeping a close eye on recent developments in battery technology for storing renewable energy.\n\"That's the next step. Storage would be great because then we could smooth out [production] and start using it morning and evening, and go off the grid eventually,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:09:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
