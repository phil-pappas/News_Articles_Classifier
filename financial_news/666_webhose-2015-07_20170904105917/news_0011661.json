That is the fastest pace recorded in June since 2005. \nSales for the first half of the year were up four percent at 8.5 million vehicles. \nCarmakers were cashing in. Average new car prices in June were $209 higher than in May and $821 higher than in June 2014, according to Kelley Blue Book. \nStrong demand for trucks and sport utility vehicles, low interest rates and incentives continue to drive consumers into showrooms, said Mark Williams, an analyst at Kelley Blue Book. \n\"Auto sales continue to push higher and are slated to have one of the strongest years ever, at a forecasted 17.1 million,\" he said. \nGM reported June sales fell three percent from a year ago to 259,353, largely as a result of a drop in fleet sales to rental-car companies.
