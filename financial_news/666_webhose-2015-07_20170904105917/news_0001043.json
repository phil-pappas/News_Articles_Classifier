At a later stage, the foundation plans to tour the country, reaching out to students in schools and universities and consumers in the malls to help spread the message. \nSheikh Sultan bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, managing director of the Emirates Foundation for Youth Development, says: “Financial literacy has emerged as an increasingly important issue notably in light of the global recession, where managing debt effectively emerged as a very salient subject. We want to be able to help young people in the UAE learn how to avoid excessive debt and manage their finances such that they can provide for themselves and their loved ones throughout their lifetime.” \nFollow us on Twitter @TheNationalPF Pages:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T22:26:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
