Louise Kennerley by Lucille Keen The former head of the Health Services Union Kathy Jackson used members funds on a shopping spree of items such as a Hairspray - the movie DVD, a Sony Playstation and a $3800 Charles Blackman portrait, but she attempted to hide a \"false trail\" of spending, court documents show.\nIn the second day of the trial against Ms Jackson before Justice Richard Tracey, the Federal Court heard Ms Jackson created false entries into union records in order to hide where money she was using was being spent on.\nThe HSU is suing Ms Jackson for $2.5 million claiming during her time as branch and national secretary she misused more than $1.4 million of members' funds.\nMs Jackson has not appeared, nor has she defended the proceeding since declaring bankrupt over 10 days ago.\nIt has been alleged Ms Jackson established a bank account, under the name of the National Health Development Account, using a $250,000 payment from a Melbourne Cancer Centre for members' back pay .\nNot for the benefit of the union Lawyer for the HSU, Mark Irving, SC, told the court Ms Jackson's spending on union credit cards and cash withdrawals from the NHDA account were not always for the benefit of the union.\nCourt documents show Ms Jackson used the account to pay for a $3800 portrait, at auction, by renowned Australian artist Charles Blackman.\n It also includes receipts in which Ms Jackson spent $2684 on a Canon camera and accessories, $1650 on a \"Monaco\" entertainment unit and $538 of a wire table lamp.\nRecords also show the account was used to shop at JB Hi-Fi, were it is alleged she spend $1070 on a Sony Playstation, games including the Need for Speed and DVDs such as Hairspray , Life is Beautiful and The Breakfast Club .\nOver her time at the union records also show Ms Jackson used union funds at bulk supermarket Costco, where she spent $2139 on items such as a $349 Wustof knife block, Disney children's luggage, books and food including 1.3 kilograms of ravioli bolognaise and 1.4 litres of Hershey's chocolate syrup.\n\"It's quite clear Ms Jackson [was] purchasing the family's shopping on the union credit card,\" Mr Irving said.\nJustice Tracey said \"it makes you wonder what the (union) auditors were doing\", after hearing the evidence.\nHowever, the union have revised down their estimation of $350,000 over the misuse because in some cases it was difficult to ascertain whether or not some of the dining and entertainment bills were for work purposes.\n'Hatted restaurants' not work He did say the union did not believe the \"hatted restaurants\", award-winning venues, qualified as work.\n\"If one is in the top restaurant in Melbourne with union members funds, one is the wrong place,\" Mr Irving said.\n\"This is the union, not BHP.\"\nThe court heard about an $2200 \"Greek feast\" Ms Jackson paid for with union funds at celebrity chef George Calombaris' restaurant the Press Club.\nGuests drank more than $1000 of alcohol including a $152 bottle of Veuve Y Label champagne, Frangelico, ouzo and two $77 bottles of Seppelt Shiraz.\nJustice Tracey noted the occasion \"partied on 'til the early hours of the morning\".\n\"A lot of scotch drunk,\" he said.\nMr Irving told the court on a number of occasions Ms Jackson withdrew money from a union account before a branch committee of management meeting, gave each attendee $100 and pocketed the balance.\nA claim she has previously denied and said the money was kept in a \"kitty\".\nThe court has previously heard evidence of which Ms Jackson withdrew thousands of dollars from the account that allegedly was transferred to pay for her divorce from her ex-husband and former union official Jeff Jackson as well as holidays and retail spending.\nThe hearing continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T00:55:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
