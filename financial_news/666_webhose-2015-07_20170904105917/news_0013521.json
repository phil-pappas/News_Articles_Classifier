Piquet started 16th on the grid on Sunday, but managed to fight his way up to seventh in the final timings to clinch the title by just a single point ahead of Sebastien Buemi. \n“It was an incredible finish to an incredible year,” said Todd McAtee, Mouser Vice President for Business Development, Americas. “We could not be more pleased and proud to be partners with Piquet and the entire China Racing team. \n“In tandem with our supplier partners, we are excited that we could be a part of this high-tech sport that is paving the way for future automotive technologies,” McAtee added. “High-tech auto racing provides the perfect platform to raise awareness for Mouser and our industry-leading partners.” \nMouser is sponsoring the China Racing Formula-E Team this year in partnership with its valued partners Molex and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. \nFormula-E is a new FIA global racing series featuring cars powered exclusively by electricity.
