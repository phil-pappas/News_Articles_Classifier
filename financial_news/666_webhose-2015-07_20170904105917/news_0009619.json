That takes its total mortgage book to £23.6bn, up 8pc on the year. \nThe pace of this increase means the bank has a market share of 3.8pc of gross lending and 20.5pc of net lending that is, Virgin Money is responsible for one-fifth of the increase in outstanding mortgage loans in the UK so far this year. \nRetail deposits rose 3pc to £22.8bn. The bank made up some of the gap between deposits and loans with a £750m securitisation , in which it bundled up a portfolio of mortgages and sold them on to investors, freeing up more funds to lend on once more. \nVirgin Money said intense competition in the mortgage market will be a challenge for the rest of 2015, but said that its margins should improve in part because it has moved its credit card business onto a new IT system to keep costs down. \nThe bank said it remains on track to cut its cost to income ratio to below 50pc by 2017, a move which would make it one of the most cost efficient banks in the UK. \nChief executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia announced a 1.4p dividend for shareholders, to be paid next month. \nMeanwhile, Shawbrook Bank, which floated on the stock market in April , reported underlying profits almost doubled in the first half of the year, rising 94pc to £34.8m. \nThe challenger bank’s loan book grew by 38pc on the year to £2.3bn, as the lender originated £812m of new loans in the six-month period. \nIt plans to increase new lending volumes to more than £2bn per year by 2017, and wants to cut its cost-to-income ratio from 48.9pc currently to below 40pc in the coming years. \nShawbrook also stressed the difficulties of operating in a very competitive mortgage market, but said there is still room to grow. It offers commercial and buy-to-let loans, as well as secured loans rather than retail mortgages. \n\"We saw some uncertainty running up to the election, which impacted the property business and commercial side. It translated into a reduction in activity, but that has largely worked its way through the system,\" said interim chief executive Tom Wood. \n\"Into the third quarter the lead indicators are trending more positively than we saw three, four, five months ago, and as we look around the table at our lending businesses, they are approaching the second half within renewed energy and vigour, and we expect to see further positive growth.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:48:04.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
