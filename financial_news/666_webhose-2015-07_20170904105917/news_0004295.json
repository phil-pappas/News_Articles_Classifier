A day earlier, London appeared to rule out lending to Greece from the EFSM, run by all 28 EU states not just the 19-member euro zone.\nOne EU official said a possible solution was to give Britain, and other non-euro zone states like Poland, guarantees of repayment on their contribution to the EFSM from money held at the European Central Bank related to past purchases of Greek government bonds. This money is known as Greece's SMP profits.
