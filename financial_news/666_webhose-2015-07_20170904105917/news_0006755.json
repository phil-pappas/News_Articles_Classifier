Its revenue rose almost 6 percent to C$3.4 billion.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned 80 Canadian cents a share, down from 84 cents a year ago.\nRBC Capital Markets analyst Drew McReynolds said the results came in \"slightly above expectations on higher wireless margins while key operating metrics were largely in line,\" in a research note, and suggested a neutral reaction from investors.\nRogers gained 24,000 net postpaid wireless subscribers after two quarters of declines. These customers typically spend much more than those who prepay for service.\nIt also gained 8,000 prepay customers.\nThe company said a rise in postpaid churn, the portion of those valuable customers leaving each month, and a smaller gain in customers than in the year-ago period were expected as the company moves customers off discounted plans and the industry deals with a regulatory move that makes it easier for customers to switch to rivals.\nRogers shed 32,000 cable-TV subscribers and 11,000 landline telephone lines in the period, but gained 4,000 Internet customers.
