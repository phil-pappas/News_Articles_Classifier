However, as Corporate Insight notes, investors and Millennials in particular are skeptical of the ambiguous fees that traditional advisors charge. \n“Investment fees can have a significant impact to an investor’s total net returns over long periods,” says Anthony D. Criscuolo, certified financial planner and portfolio manager with Palisades Hudson Financial Group in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. “The hard part is often trying to quantify how much in fees you are paying. Many of the compensation structures for advisers is complex and often purposely so.” More Headlines Shop Red, White & Blue: The Best July 4th Sales 2015 \nThere are are a few tiers to the advisor fee structure that can help investors get the most out of their money without costing them a whole lot in fees. The digital advisory options, or “ robo advisor ,” uses a computer algorithm to build a low cost portfolio that charges fees as little as 0.5% of total assets a year. Greg Vigrass, president and chief executive of Folio Institutional, notes that investors focused on simply the end result can be well-served by easing into advised investments through a robo advisor . \n“Those offerings tend to be lower cost, somewhat education-based and still ultimately guide you towards and advised solution,” Vigrass says. “The ongoing updates and maintenance of the portfolio strategy is still under the direction of of advisors, so what you end up with a lower-cost, easier access point for investment advice. The downside is that you don't get some of what comes with an advisor relationship: the hand-holding, the personal relationship, and the safety net aspect of it.” 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T16:11:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
