(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma) \nBEIJING—China’s Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. has submitted a bid to buy out U.S. memory chip maker Micron Technology Inc. for $23 billion, people familiar with the matter said.Tsinghua Unigroup, China’s largest state-owned chip design company, offered $21 a share for Micron, a 19.3% premium over its Monday closing price, one of the people said.Shares of Nasdaq-listed Micron have fallen by nearly half in the past year and closed up 0.2% at $17.61 Monday.Beijing-based Tsinghua Unigroup already has several links to major U.S. companies. It acquired a controlling stake in Hewlett-Packard Co. ’s China networking equipment unit in May. Intel Corp. bought a 20% stake in Tsinghua Unigroup last year for $1.5 billion.Tsinghua Unigroup, which was founded in 1988 by China’s elite Tsinghua University, became China’s largest chip design firm in 2013 after acquiring two of the country’s largest mobile-chip firms, Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics.Micron, based in Boise, Idaho, is the last remaining U.S. maker of the widely used chips known as dynamic random access memory, or DRAMs. It is No. 2 behind Samsung Electronics Co. in that market, and makes the NAND flash memory used to store data in mobile devices such as smartphones.The company’s stock surged last year on stronger prices of memory chips and signs the market was consolidating to a smaller number of players. But Micron’s stock, which closed 2014 at $35.01, has slid lately on worries about the health of the personal-computer market, a major user of DRAMs.Micron in June reported a 39% drop in profit for the third fiscal quarter ended June 4.—Don Clark in San Francisco contributed to this article.Write to Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.com \nMore From The Wall Street Journal", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T04:28:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
