Usually they pay an entry fee and become eligible to win cash. \nAs real games are played, a fantasy team competes and is ranked against others based on the actual-game performance of its players. \nThe activity has been embraced by sports leagues and broadcasters because fantasy sports players watch more live sports and consume more sports news than the average fan. \nThe hobby is popular with the coveted 18-34 age demographic, who often use a smartphone or tablet to track their performance in the fantasy league while keeping an eye on a broadcast of a real-life game. \nEarlier this month, Yahoo (NasdaqGS: YHOO - news ) became the first larger technology company to enter the business, unveiling a fantasy sports program with cash prizes that is playable on smartphones. \nDraftKings is estimated to be worth at least $1 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T22:19:55.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
