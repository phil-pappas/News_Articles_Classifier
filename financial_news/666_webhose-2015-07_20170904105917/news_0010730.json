Return to start of sidebar.\nThe government is currently considering splitting the state into two time zones as part of its plan to switch to eastern states time.\nDeclaring a preference to move clocks half an hour forward, Premier Jay Weatherill on\nTuesday said adopting a local, unofficial time zone would be considered for the West Coast in a bid to soothe intense opposition there.\nThe impact on Adelaide Airport operations, particularly the 11pm-6am curfew, will also be considered before any time switch proposal is taken to State Cabinet and Parliament.\nThe State Government revealed it favoured moving to eastern-states time, despite the majority of submissions received during public consultation opposing the shift.\nNearly half of people who responded to a poll on Advertiser.com.au favoured keeping the current time zone, while about a third supported a shift half an hour forward to eastern states time, about 15 per cent favoured a shift 30 minutes backwards, and just 8 per cent favoured the split option.\nShould SA's time zone\nThe pros and cons of changing our time. Source: The Advertiser\nMr Weatherill said more work needed to be done before a proper judgment could be made, particularly on the airport and the operation of an unofficial West Coast time zone. “I do think there are some good prospects for looking at different opening times for businesses and government agencies, who can rearrange their affairs so it’s more in sync with the daylight hours that they’d like to work to,” he said.\nMoving 30 minutes forward would jeopardise a late-night Emirates’ flight by pushing it to 11.05pm departures during daylight savings — outside the curfew.\nThe Government is not proposing to interfere with the curfew, but does not want to disrupt existing arrangements.\nFifteen American states have more than one time zone and Broken Hill, in New South Wales, uses SA time.\nBut most of the 2000 submissions received during public consultation were from the West Coast and expressed strong opposition, particularly about the impact on children of having to wake before sunrise and travel to school during semidarkness.\nRegional councils on Yorke Peninsula and in the South East also expressed concern, opening up a potential city/country divide.\nThis might force the Liberals to choose between country and business supporters, who mostly favour a switch to eastern states time\nLiberal leader Steven Marshall said Labor should focus on lowering the state’s 8.2 per cent unemployment rate and commission detailed economic modelling to determine whether a time zone change would create jobs. A shift to eastern states time is now the favoured option for the State Government.

Source: News Corp Australia\nA University of San Diego study, reported in The Advertiser last week, suggests that moving to eastern states time would lead to a fall in wages and productivity , and make us sleepier than people in the east.\nMoving a time zone forward - and therefore pushing sunset later - leads to people going to sleep later, and consequently getting less sleep, the study says.\nMr Weatherill on Tuesday released two reports, including an SA Centre for Economic Studies estimate of $2.5 billion in net benefits from a shift to eastern time, but conceded the estimate was “based on very substantial assumptions”.\nThis report found shifting clocks 30 minutes backwards, to so-called true Central Standard Time, would produce net economic benefits of $300 million. It also cautioned that more consultation with business was necessary to get a better idea of the real benefits of a shift to eastern time.\nAnother public consultation report details significant advantages pushed by business, including better communication with east coast suppliers and less disruption for computer systems, such as online diaries.\nOther advantages included overcoming a perception that SA’s half-hour time difference meant the state was out of touch, greater convenience for tourists, a permanent 30 minutes of sunlight at the end of the working day and the end of delayed TV and radio broadcasts.\nBusiness SA backs a switch, as does the Council for International Trade and Commerce SA and Coopers Brewery.\nBut the Master Builders Association and Civil Contractors Federation oppose change, because construction industries typically start about 7am, creating safety risks due to less light if eastern time was adopted.", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/28/1227460/130589-e01e0bc0-34ce-11e5-b1c6-fce245fdac3f.jpg", "http://polldaddy.com/poll/9000148/", "http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9000148.js", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/28/1227460/797270-9ff054ae-350f-11e5-a865-966b1ff02c53.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227461/609379-55e3f156-3521-11e5-a865-966b1ff02c53.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/28/1227460/849372-6c2c64d8-3509-11e5-b1c6-fce245fdac3f.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/28/1227460/792474-8d12f82a-3512-11e5-a865-966b1ff02c53.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-29T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T18:57:48.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
