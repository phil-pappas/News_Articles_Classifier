Sean Davey But he did say some perspective was needed about the wild fluctuations in the Shanghai stock exchange over the past few months, pointing out it was still in a stronger position than 12 months ago.\n\"Although the past few weeks we've seen a flurry of volatility on share markets in China, we've seen many such flurries over the past 10 years or so. And we tend to forget the Shanghai market remains well above the levels of a year ago, to put it in context,\" Mr Fraser said.\n\"We are monitoring these developments closely. But you need to keep it in perspective. It's a stock market fluctuation. The government has reacted to it, that's interesting in itself. It's a stockmarket which is heavily traded, it's hard to get a read on it. I don't see any particular concerns at the moment.\n\"I'm not surprised there's a lot of volatility. I think the long-term story in China remains the same. Perceptions will be important, but I'm not stepping away from my longer term belief in China.\"\n Mr Fraser also used his speech to warn against complacency after 25 years of economic growth saying Australia still faced key challenges to lift productivity or it risked a fall in living standards, as well as facing up to tough decisions on tax and workplace relations reform.\n\"It's hard to say we've got to address longer term things because all of us can procrastinate. I'm not saying we have a crisis but we have issues that are better addressed earlier rather than later,\" Mr Fraser said.\nMr Fraser also defended Treasury modelling which has also wildly fluctuated given plummeting iron ore prices over the past 12 months.\n\"The modelling we do is essentially based on models developed in the 1970s. but there is no magic black box and it's an issue we have to keep looking at time and time again,\" he said.\n\"Treasury had an internal inquiry a few years ago in 2011 or 2012, but we don't just crank up the machine and a number comes out. There is a lot of judgement. But one thing is clear there is no one model.\n\"We will be look at getting input from around the world, but you are always going to be getting it wrong. But you have to do forecasts and I will have to put my right hand into the brazier. But we are alive to the facts of the uncertainties and to be fair we have been publishing those uncertainties the past few budget papers.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T13:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:05:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
