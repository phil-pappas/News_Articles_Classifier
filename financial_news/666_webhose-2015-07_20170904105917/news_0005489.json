On Monday Greece was granted €86bn in aid but some economists say the money will not address the country’s solvency issue. Picture: BLOOMBERG/KOSTAS TSIRONIS Related articles Furious Greeks accuse Germany of splitting Europe yet again Knives out for Tsipras after cave-in EDITORIAL: Torrid time ahead as Greece caves in VRROOM WITH A VIEW: This rock-solid drive offers all that you need SO THE Greece crisis is over? Not according to Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase experts.\nRisks to the country’s euro membership still fester even after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras surrendered on Monday to European demands for austerity to win as much as €86bn of aid.\nWaving red flags were economists from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America (BofA) Merrill Lynch as well as those at Citigroup, who coined the term Grexit three years ago.\n\"To avoid Grexit, Greece would require some degree of political stability and economic recovery, which the current proposal may fail to deliver,\" the team led by Willem Buiter, Citigroup’s chief global economist, told clients in a report after news broke of a deal. \"We maintain that Grexit remains the most likely outcome over the next one to three years.\"\nThe analyst community split the risks two ways. First, the immediate political problem of pushing an accord through Greece’s parliament and the national legislatures of some creditors. That is needed to seal a bail-out and, most pressingly, avoid the country defaulting on a July 20 payment to the European Central Bank (ECB).\nAfter that, the longer-term question of Greece’s ability to grow its way out of debt servitude will determine if it sticks with the single currency in the absence of easier terms from its neighbours.\n\"It is hard to be at all optimistic about the prospects for Greece remaining in the euro area on economic grounds, and the political dynamic has a significant component of unpredictability,\" says Malcolm Barr, an economist at JP-Morgan Chase in London.\nWhile the timetable for the coming weeks is not yet fully clear, it is starting to form. Greek legislators will be asked on Wednesday to pass into law key creditor demands, including streamlining value-added taxes, broadening the tax base and curbing pensions. Mr Tsipras will need the support of opposition politicians.\nAfter that, eurozone finance ministers will confer by phone and, once they rubber-stamp the agreement, other national parliaments, including Germany’s, will start their procedures over the rest of the week. That may be enough to allow Europe to provide the Greeks with enough temporary cash to avoid defaulting to the ECB.\nThen attention will switch to a longer-term aid package.\nThe latest plan is \"not an actual deal\", says Moritz Kraemer, MD of sovereign ratings at Standard & Poor’s. \"The negotiations will drag on, there will be a lot of nitty-gritty discussion,\" he says.\nEven if aid is forthcoming, Greece is facing long-term questions about its economic future, all of which may sow social unrest and antagonism towards the euro project. Fresh austerity could end up making it even harder to repay its debts, unemployment may rise and banks are still on the drip-feed of support from the ECB, so have limited capacity to lend.\n\"The money Greece will receive will not address the bigger issue facing the nation,\" says Jim Leaviss, portfolio manager at M&G Investments, which oversees $400bn. \"Greece’s longer-term problem is not about liquidity. It’s about solvency, which is more difficult to solve.\"\nSome say Greece can remain in the eurozone for this year at least. Ladbrokes cut the odds of Greece keeping the euro this year to a record low of 1/12, meaning a bet of £12 is required to win £1.\nThe confusion around Greece’s prospects is illustrated by Citigroup’s own gyrations. Three years ago, its economists put the probability of a Grexit within 18 months at 50%. They later raised it to 90% by 2014.\nProved wrong, the economists said at the end of last month they were assuming Greece would stay even as Mr Tsipras announced his referendum on austerity. A week ago, they revived the Grexit call.\nOthers agree scepticism is needed. \"We remain in the path of Grexit,\" say BofA Merrill Lynch economists.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T09:39:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
