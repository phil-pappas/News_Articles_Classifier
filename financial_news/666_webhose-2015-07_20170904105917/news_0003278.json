Because crude is sold in dollars on global market, the commodity becomes more costly for buyers using other currencies when the greenback strengthens. \nThe drop in oil below $50 a barrel could have \"a psychological impact\" leading to further selling, according Tim Evans, analyst at Citi Futures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T22:54:50.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
