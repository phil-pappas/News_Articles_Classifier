Here we look at the big changes affecting your pocket. \nIncome tax \nThe “personal allowance” — the threshold at which most taxpayers start paying income tax — will be raised from £10,600 in the current tax year to £11,000 from next April. This fits with the government’s goal to increase it to £12,500 by 2020. \nThe threshold for higher rate tax of 40 per cent will also rise, from £42,385 to £43,000 from next year. From 2017-18 this threshold will rise to £43,600. \nInheritance tax \nFrom 2017, there will be a new £175,000 allowance on homes left to children or grandchildren, allowing £1m to be passed on tax-free. \nThe new allowance is in addition to the existing £325,000 threshold that will be fixed until the end of 2020-21. Both allowances can be transferred to your spouse or partner. \nThe new threshold means couples can pass on estates worth more than £1m free of inheritance tax but it will not apply to estates worth more than £2m. \nMr Osborne said the cut in inheritance tax is to be paid for by changes to pensions tax relief to highest earners. \nPensions tax relief \nIn a widely expected move, Mr Osborne announced a cut to the amount that higher earners can pay annually into their pension and still qualify for tax relief from £40,000 to £10,000, for those making £150,000 a year or more. This was promised in the Conservative manifesto. \nMr Osborne also announced that a green paper is to be published on proposals for “a radical change” to the pension saving system. This paper will look at the point at which pensions are taxed. \nBuy-to-let \nBuy-to-let landlords face cuts in the amount of tax they can claim on mortgage interest relief. The current relief allows landlords to put the cost of the interest on a buy-to-let mortgage on their self-assessment forms, offsetting the income they receive in rent from tenants. \nThe system of mortgage interest relief will be retained but restricted to the basic rate of tax, with the change introduced over a four-year period from April 2017. \nCurrently, investors can claim tax relief on their monthly interest repayments at the top level of tax they pay, meaning some are benefiting from relief of up to 45 per cent. \nNimesh Shah, partner at Blick Rothenberg, said: “What’s interesting is that the restriction applies to individuals owning properties and companies are not affected. With a further reduction in the main rate of corporation tax, companies may become even more popular structures for buy-to-let landlords.” \nRent a room \nThe Chancellor has announced that the amount that householders can earn by renting out a room will rise to £7,500 a year tax-free. \nThe Rent a Room Scheme previously allowed a householder to earn up to £4,250 a year tax free from letting out furnished accommodation in their home. \nJo Bateson, private client tax partner at KPMG in the UK, said: “The new measures mean a householder could let out a room for £144 a week before becoming liable to any tax on the income. This is a whopping 76 per cent increase on the old allowance of £4,250. With the growth of the ‘sharing economy’ and a rising number of people seeking Monday to Friday rentals in city centres, this could prove a very valuable break for householders on a tight budget lucky enough to have a spare room.” \nNon-doms \nNon-dom status will be scrapped for people born in the UK to parents domiciled in the UK, and permanent non-dom tax status will be abolished for those living here for more than 15 of the past 20 years.
