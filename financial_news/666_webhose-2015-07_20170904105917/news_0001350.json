Although he sent a letter saying he would have voted in favour had he been present, it could not be counted among the ‘yes’ votes under parliamentary rules.\nAll opposition parties except the Nazi-inspired Golden Dawn and the Communist Party voted in favour.\nThe proposed measures, including tax hikes and cuts in pension spending, are certain to inflict more pain on a Greek public who just days ago voted overwhelmingly against a similar plan.\nBut the new proposal, if approved by Greece’s international creditors, will provide longer-term financial support for a nation that has endured six years of recession.\nWithout a deal, Greece faces the immediate prospect of crashing out of Europe’s joint currency, the euro. It would be the first nation to do so.\nIf the proposal is approved, Greece would get a three-year loan package worth nearly USD 60 billion (53.5 billion euros) as well as some form of debt relief. That is far more than the 7.2 billion euros left over from Greece’s previous bailout that had been at stake in the country’s five-month negotiations until last month.\nFor Updates Check Economy News ; follow us on Facebook and Twitter\n 11, 2015 9:07 am", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress", "http://twitter.com/financialxpress"], "published": "2015-07-11T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T04:46:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
