Banks have often discussed cases of borrwers using money for purpose other than farming. However, the information is sketchy. There is need for further systematic assessment of it, top RBI executive said. \"The Central bank has already done preliminary work on flow of loans to agriculture and intends to carry out detailed examination,\" he said. According to RBI data the credit to farming and allied areas grew by 11% to Rs 7, 77, 900 crore in 12 months ended May 2015. The growth rate in agriculture credit was higher at 16.8% in previous 12 months. with outstanding amount of credit was Rs 7, 01, 100 crore in May 2014 and Rs 6, 66, 600 crore in May 2013. Public sector bank executives said prima-facie the high overall subsidy, repayment to money lenders and weak monitoring of credit usage at ground level seem to contribute to such diversion. The gold loans, which are categorised under farm loans is also one gray area. Interest subsidy- a lure to direct money to deposits, earn rentals The crop loans get central govt' subsidy (interest subvention) of two% and over and above it some state goverments provide upto four%. The interest subsidy on farm loans intended to reduce financial burden on farmer. In many instances, Instead of using that for agriculture work, borrower puts that money in fixed deposits. \"It is win-win situation for borrower and branch. Borrower gets cheap money which is parked for interest income and branch gets to book loan and also raise liabilities. This is a business done without serving the purpose and that too at cost to exchequer- - public money from budget of governments\", said senior official working with National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). Top executive of public sector bank said there are also instances where banks have given loans to buy tractors to be used for farm activity. But tractor gets deployed for construction activity (renting for transportation). Money lender's obligations Senior manager with State Bank of India said many a times farm loans (from banks) are inadequate to meet requirements. So farmers are forced avail loans from informal source (money lenders) at very high rates and on stiff terms. When it comes to repayments, money lenders often apply pressure to clear their dues first. Farmer often uses partn of funds from bank loans to payback money lender, SBI executive said. Weak monitoring remains challenge Agriculture lending is essentially being done through branches in rural areas. With large number of customers spread over vast expanse, branch staff also is pressed for time to do detailed scrutiny, PSB exexutives pointed out. All commercial banks are now on Core Banking System (CBS) platform which captures information on transaction. A analytic software could be used for tracking nature of disbursements of farm loans. This could throw up clues on usage, said NABARD executive. Gold loans- a surrogate for consumption credit Bank executives said loans extended against gold and gold jewellery by banks are categorised as farm credit and forms about 30% of agriculture and allied sector credit. RBI executive said the gold loans are prominent in the Southern states. As a thumb rule about 50% of gold loans are presumed to used for consumption needs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T18:47:31.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
