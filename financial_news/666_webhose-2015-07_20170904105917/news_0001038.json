The park is now scheduled to have a grand opening in spring next year.\nThe firm's park and resorts segment brought in $15.1 billion globally last year, around a third of its total revenues. Disney is also tapping into China's film market, with the latest outing of its \"Avengers\" series taking the number two spot in country's 20.4 billion yuan box office for the first half of the year.
