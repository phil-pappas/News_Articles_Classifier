AP by Trevor Hoey The deterioration in consumer and business confidence has placed a considerable drag on the IT sector in recent years. Smart Investor identifies two companies that had a tough start to 2014-15, but are benefiting from strategic industry positioning and their unique technological capabilities, factors that have been instrumental in driving their share prices higher in the first half of calendar 2015.\nEmpired Diversified IT services provider Empired's price slumped from 80¢ in October to 60¢ in December – a drop of 25 per cent. The start of the decline coincided with the acquisition of Intergen, a top tier IT services group with annual revenue of about $60 million.\nAs a global organisation, Intergen had historically generated compound annual revenue growth of about 25 per cent and its contribution in 2015-16 was expected to result in Empired achieving income between $145 million and $165 million.\nThe $17.4 million consideration for the acquisition was to be paid over three years through a combination of cash and shares, which may have caused some concern due to earnings per share dilution. But there was no doubt in brokers' minds that the medium-term impact was positive. For example, Bell Potter downgraded earnings per share by 4 per cent for 2014-15, and increased forecasts for the following two years by 13 per cent and 15 per cent respectively.\nThe broker has a \"buy\" recommendation on the stock with a 12-month price target of $1.10, implying a price-earnings multiple of 12.9 relative to 2015-16 forecasts. This multiple appears conservative given that the company is forecast to generate earnings per share growth of 114 per cent in 2015-16, followed by 29 per cent in 2016-17.\nBetween May and June, Empired secured $45 million in contracts, including a five-year, $20 million agreement to provide IT and project services to Rio Tinto.\n Melbourne IT Though the first-half decline in Melbourne IT's share price was much steeper than that of Empired, its recovery, particularly in recent months, has been extremely strong. The $67 million acquisition (based on Melbourne IT moving to 100 per cent ownership) of a 50.2 per cent interest in privately owned Outware Systems resulted in the company's shares increasing from $1.50 on the day before the announcement to an intraday high of $1.69.\nTrading as Outware Mobile, the company is the leading mobile application developer for the enterprise and government markets. In recent years, Outware Mobile has generated compound annual revenue growth of 70 per cent. In 2014-15, it is expected to contribute earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $5.1 million from revenues of $15.6 million.\nMelbourne IT has moved from being dependent on domain sales to a business that provides software-enabled cloud solutions to the corporate and government sectors.\nThe manner in which consideration for the acquisition has been structured, as well as the implementation of staggered payments, has resulted in Melbourne IT being able to maximise earnings per share upside.\nBell Potter has increased earnings per share forecasts for 2015-16 and 2016-17 by 17 per cent and 29 per cent respectively, as well as increasing the 12-month price target from $1.75 to $1.95.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T12:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:56:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
