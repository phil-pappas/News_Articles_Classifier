John Veage Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey The chances of Tony Abbott allowing his MPs a conscience vote on gay marriage have diminished further because of the push by the ALP Left faction to force all MPs to vote for the change.\nSocial Services Minister Scott Morrison, one of the most senior opponents of gay marriage within the Coalition, said it made no sense for Labor to be demanding Coalition MPs be given a conscience vote when the ALP National Conference passed a rule on the weekend to bind all Labor MPs to vote for gay marriage from 2019 onwards .\n\"After [Bill] Shorten and Penny Wong were cheaply trading conscience vote futures on the ALP conference floor, they can hardly claim any credibility on lecturing the Coalition of the virtues of conscience votes,\" he told The Australian Financial Review.\n\"For them to now be lecturing others about conscience votes I think makes a complete mockery of the whole argument that Bill Shorten is trying to make.\"\nSeven News reported Monday that Mr Abbott was canvassing as a delaying tactic holding a plebiscite after the next election. His office could not confirm or deny this. The Australian Christian Lobby belives a plebiscite poses the best chance of killing of gay marriage.\nDespite Mr Shorten pleading with the Left to leave Labor MPs with a conscience vote, the faction and elements of the Right combined at the ALP National Conference to force a compromise in which Labor MPs would have a conscience vote for the remainder of this parliamentary term and for the next.\nAfter that, all Labor MPs would be bound to vote for gay marriage.\nMr Morrison said it made no difference whether the binding vote applied to Labor now or in four years because it was the principle that mattered.\n Mr Shorten had warned the conference before the debate that if the vote were bound, it would weaken Labor's argument to pressure Mr Abbott to allow his MPs a conscience vote when Parliament resumes in August.\nLiberal MPs in favour of gay marriage were also upset by the Labor Left, saying the faction had made their job tougher.\nSome warned, however, that the Labor move had not dented resolve within the party and should Mr Abbott renege on his pledge to allow the party room to debate its policy position, he risked reopening the leadership issue.\n\"They just had a discussion in the ALP,\" said one MP.\n\"We are not seeking to destabilise but this will become a leadership issue if it is not handled in a sensitive and empathetic way.\n\"People need to let off steam.\"\nOther MPs said the Labor Left motion had been \"unhelpful\".\n\"It's given them an extra argument to mount,\" he said of the gay marriage opponents inside the Coalition.\nMr Shorten promised that if Mr Abbott does not address the issue as he has forecast, then Labor would propose at the election to hold a vote on the matter within 100 days if it forms government.\nNot 'just a metrosexual issue' One Liberal MP said the Coalition would lose votes in any such battle.\n\"This is not just an issue for latte-sipping metrosexuals care about. That's bullshit, read the f---ing the polls,\" he said, in a reference to numerous opinion polls showing about two-thirds of voters support gay marriage.\nHe said Mr Abbott \"will blow the show up\" if he does not allow a free vote but said the Prime Minister was beholden to the hard right.\n\"Tony is concerned that the hard right that supports him, his base in the party, will give up on him,\" he said.\n\"They were behind the [February leadership] spill in the first place.\"\nCommunications Minister Malcolm Turnbull reiterated his support for gay marriage.\n\"If there is a free vote, I will vote in favour,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-27T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:47:43.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
