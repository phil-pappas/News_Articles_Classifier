If some random event (occurs), then it propels us into a failed state. The chances are that much greater.\" \nFailed state (10%): \"(In this scenario), the wheels come off,\" he said. \"We give it a very minor probability of 10%, because we've got such strong institutions in South Africa to act as a check and balance to the government.\" \nSunter, who has authored 17 books, spent much of his career in Anglo American's gold and uranium division, serving as its chairperson and CEO from 1990 to 1996. He was until recently chairperson of the Anglo American Chairman's Fund, which in a recent survey was rated South Africa's premier corporate social responsibility fund. \nHe was recently awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Cape Town for his work in the field of scenario planning, and was also voted by leading South African CEOs as the speaker who has made the most significant contribution to, and impact on, best practice and business in South Africa. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T20:14:58.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
