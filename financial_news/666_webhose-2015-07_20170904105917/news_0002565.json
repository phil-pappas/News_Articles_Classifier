Operating profit also fell due to higher costs.\nIn the past year, America Movil, which controls 70 percent of Mexico's mobile market, was banned from charging national roaming fees and a new law said it could not charge competitors for interconnection to its network.\nThe measures are part of a sector overhaul spearheaded by President Enrique Pena Nieto, who said in January that it was already bringing benefits to Mexicans.\nThe company said revenue growth rates in Mexico continue to slow, but the number of wireless clients still rose 1.9 percent compared with a year ago.\nEarlier on Thursday Chief Executive Daniel Hajj said the company would offer some subscribers free calls to, and data in, the United States as well as invest $6 billion in its network in Mexico.\n($1 = 15.695 pesos at end June) (Reporting by Christine Murray ; Editing by Alan Crosby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T02:10:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
