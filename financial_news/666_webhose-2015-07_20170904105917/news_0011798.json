Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! NEW DELHI: Kotak Mahindra Bank's proposal to raise foreign investment limit in the lender to 55 per cent was cleared by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) today. After deferring a decision on the proposal in the past, the FIPB cleared the application during today's meeting after the Department of Financial Services gave its opinion on the matter, sources said. FIPB is headed by Finance Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi . Kotak Bank had approached the Board after the Reserve Bank barred overseas investments in it as foreign shareholding hit the permissible threshold following the merger of ING Vysya Bank with Kotak Bank. Investments from FIIs , FPIs and foreign banks had reached 48.55 per cent in the merged entity. The clearance comes days after Kotak Bank's shareholders gave approval for issuance of bonus shares. The annual general meeting of the bank held on June 29 had approved issuance of \"bonus shares in the proportion of one equity share for every equity share of face value Rs 5 held by such person on the record date.\"   DON'T MISS any stories, follow us on Twitter Follow", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T16:37:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
