Bloomberg Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Greg Earl Business is pressing the Abbott government to overhaul Australia's existing trade agreements after the likely completion of new Pacific trade deal this weekend to ensure companies are not confronted with a new noodle bowl of conflicting rules about whether their products are covered by the trade deals.\nThe Business Council of Australia has told the government that it should harmonise existing agreements with the rules of origin adopted under the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as a priority if trade ministers reach an agreement on the 12 nation wide-ranging pact at a meeting in Hawaii.\n\"This reform would enable Australian companies to adopt standardised approaches to rules of origin, and minimise the ability for them to fall foul of rules contained within FTAs,\" the BCA says in a submission to be published on Wednesday.\nThe BCA move coincides with rising concern within other business groups that the TPP will complicate the short-term goods trading environment by adding to the rules on whether products are covered even though it is intended in the longer term to be a crucial stepping stone to a wide-ranging open market across the Asia Pacific.\nThe BCA has also called for the government to produce country-specific information on the different rules for operating in each country under different agreements and to allow more companies to do their own self-certification of whether they meet these rules which examine the source of compoens within a product.\nAustralia already has bilateral trade deals with eight of the countries in the TPP group, including a regional agreement with south-east Asia. Whether products qualify for tariff concessions gets even more complicated when companies are manufacturing across borders in global supply chains.\nAmerica makes its move The Obama administration underlined its determination on Monday to cut a deal in Hawaii after five years of negotiation over the TPP by moving to keep Malaysia in the group by improving its status on a ranking of countries which allow people trafficking.\n Malaysia is one of the nations which analysts say could drop out of the group during the last-minute negotiations because US labour rights activists say it breaches labour rules and because its politically government may not accept TPP rules to rein in the power of state-owned enterprises and government procurement schemes.\nThe BCA submission to the parliamentary committee inquiry into business experience with trade deals says the government should focus more effort on removing non-tariff barriers after trade deals are done, it should do more work on whether hidden obstacles remain to Australian services exports, it should reconsider its position on lower foreign investment thresholds for agriculture and it should work more with its industry growth centres to make the most of trade deals.\nStressing the need for action on the rules of origin which determine whether products are covered it says: \"Depending on the country of origin of inputs used to make a good, an exporter may qualify for preferential treatment under an FTA. Rules of origin can therefore impose a cost.\n\"Often the cost of changing existing suppliers to comply with an FTA's rules of origin outweighs the benefits of a tariff reduction.\"\nIt says that in many cases companies which operate in global value or supply chains will not use trade agreements and this could be a large number of companies because up to 70 per cent of world trade involved global supply chains.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/100440329083596928444/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Greg__Earl", "http://www.aigroup.com.au/portal/site/aig/template.MAXIMIZE/mediacentre/releases/?javax.portlet.tpst=576c3f2a4adc0f512aec2f100141a0a0_ws_MX&javax.portlet.prp_576c3f2a4adc0f512aec2f100141a0a0=index%3D4%26docName%3DAi%2BGroup%2BOpening%2BStatement%2B%2BTo%2BCommittee%2BOn%2BFTAs%26folderPath%3D%252FLIVE_CONTENT%252FMedia%2BReleases%252F2015%252FJuly%252F%26viewID%3Dcontent&javax.portlet.begCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken&javax.portlet.endCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken"], "published": "2015-07-28T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:47:34.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
