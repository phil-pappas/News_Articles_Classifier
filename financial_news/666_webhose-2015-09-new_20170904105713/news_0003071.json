Electricity Company of Ghana is demanding over 100 percent increase and the Ghana Water Company is demanding an increase of its basic rate from Gh¢ 1.70 per a unit of water to Gh¢ 4.00. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T19:42:35.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
