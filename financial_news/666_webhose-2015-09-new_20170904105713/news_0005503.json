KMG EP made a tax provision of 16.7 billion tenge ($68.5 million) for the period ended June 30, 2015. The company has stated that it is currently preparing its appeal to the claims and will further evaluate the adequacy of its provisions as the case progresses through the court system. \nKMG EP’s net profit for the six months of 2015 was 2.9 billion tenge ($11.9 million), which was significantly lower than the net profit of 210 billion tenge ($862 million) reported for the same period in 2014. The company is currently operating with an interim CEO following the resignation of Abat Nurseitov, which was announced by KMG EP on September 8, 2015. KMG EP’s Chief Financial Officer Dastan Abdulgafarov commenced his interim CEO duties yesterday and will continue to undertake tasks associated with the role until the appointment of a new CEO.
