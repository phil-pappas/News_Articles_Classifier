Congress leader and senior lawyer P. Chidambaram represented ANI technologies (Ola cabs) in the high court and promised that diesel-based vehicles of the taxi service will be taken off the roads within two weeks. Respecting the court's order, Ola Cabs on Thursday said: \"We respect the orders and will continue to be committed to building mobility for a billion people. \"We have introduced a technology that will help distinguish CNG and diesel vehicles on its app, which will help the company keep track of the drivers' compliance with the cleaner fuel norms in Delhi. It will also enable users to choose only CNG vehicles for usage within Delhi. Meanwhile, another leading player, Meru Cab service has also introduced a new ride-sharing service, named \"CarPool\" for its customers across India. In a release, Meru Cabs CEO Siddhartha Pahwa said the service will enable personal vehicle owners and city commuters to reduce their daily travel costs, get an opportunity to meet new people and simplify their commute in safe and secured environment.
