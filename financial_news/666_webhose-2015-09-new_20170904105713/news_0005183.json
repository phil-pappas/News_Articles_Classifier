Regrettably, the current Finance Minister, Mr. Seth Terkper, has gone back for the discarded idea - forcing the DVLA to pay all revenues into the Consolidated Fund. This is surely going to be a recipe for disaster. \nAs we write this editorial, certain components of taxes collected by the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) to fund the Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETfund), National Health Insurance (NHIS) and the district assembly common fund, which are all paid into the CF, are in arrears for several months. \nInstead of promptly releasing these funds to the recipients to fund the numerous projects being executed by the GETfund, pay the NHIS service providers, the government apparently diverts the money for different purposes. It is trite to see NHIS service providers threatening not to attend to NHIS card holders because the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) has not paid them for the services they had already rendered. \nSimilarly, some of the projects the GETfund Secretariat had embarked upon in our tertiary and Senior High Schools have all come to a standstill, due to lack of funds, even though the Ghanaian taxpayer had already paid the money through the Value Added Tax, to fund the projects. \nAlso every electricity consumer in Ghana pays a levy to fund street lightening in our towns and cities. Readers will again bear with us that almost all our streets are in darkness and thus giving armed robbers the freedom to operate. Meanwhile, the power consumer had already paid for the street lightening. \nAll these things are happening because the moment the money hits the CF, releasing it back to those it is meant for becomes a Gordian knot that one has to untie. It is based on above issues we have raised that The Chronicle finds it weird, the directive from the Finance Ministry that DVLA should no more retain the 15% revenue they generate to fund their operations, but direct all the money into the CF. \nAlmost all our major roads are tolled and paid into the CF, but the Tema Motorway, which generates the chunk of these revenues is now a death trap. If the Motorway is allowed to retain a percent of the revenue it generates on Daily basis, we are sure they road wouldn't have been as it is today. \nThe Chronicle can bet on its last pesewa that if the DVLA is forced, as Seth Terkper is trying to do, to pay all the revenues it generates into the CF without the retention of the 15%, it would also find itself in the same mess as GETfund, NHIS and the Common Fund among others. \nThe Chronicle is, therefore, cautioning the Finance Ministry and the Mahama government to immediately discard the policy they are trying to introduce because it would not help the nation. No cogent argument has been adduced to support this new directive to the DVLA. \nIf the government is trying to track state funds and ensure that they are properly utilized, that is a fine idea, but one may also ask the relevance of both internal and external auditors who are constantly auditing the accounts of the DVLA, if their work is not satisfactory. \nThe country is already facing numerous challenges in the financial sector of the economy and the government should not be seen trying to exacerbate the situation. The directive to the DVLA must be reversed now!
