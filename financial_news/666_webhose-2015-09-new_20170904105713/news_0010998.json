Louie Douvis Share on twitter by James Eyers Westpac Banking Corp's chief executive Brian Hartzer has been urged to set out a plan for cost reductions at the bank's strategy update on Monday, including reducing the number of branches, which has been inflated since the acquisition of St George during the financial crisis.\nMonday morning's briefing will be Mr Hartzer's first public fronting of the market since the disappointing first-half results in May , which missed expectations for dividends and profits. Westpac shares closed at $30.19 on Thursday, 11 per cent below their level in May; they are down 4.5 per cent this week in a banking sector that remains volatile.\n\"The Westpac strategy day [on Monday] couldn't come at a better time to address the market's emerging performance concerns,\" Citi analyst Craig Williams said in a note to clients on Thursday.\nHe pointed to Westpac's cost-to-income ratio, which is between 5 and 7 percentage points above its competitors and a function of its larger branch network. \"Despite having a smaller mortgage, household deposit and small business books, Westpac has 10 per cent more branches than Commonwealth Bank,\" said Mr Williams, who has maintained a \"neutral\" recommendation.\nBut in recent days, other leading bank analysts have upgraded their recommendations on Westpac to \"outperform\", pointing to potential for Mr Hartzer to close branches and announce other initiatives to boost productivity and to slice costs in order to sustain dividends.\nCredit Suisse upgraded Westpac to outperform on Thursday, saying the bank was now its top pick among the majors (where previously it was ranked four) due to the potential for \"productivity-based restructuring\".\n\"Notwithstanding capital raising risk, we see a sector-leading productivity story unfolding,\" said Credit Suisse analyst Jarrod Martin.\nSimilarly, Macquarie upgraded Westpac to outperform on Monday, pointing to the potential for an earnings uplift from branch closures in response to a dramatic decrease in bank branch transactions across the sector, a function of more customers using online and mobile channels.\n Westpac has 1276 branches around the country, compared to CBA's 1026, ANZ's 851 and National Australia Bank's 783. Westpac's numbers are higher because it runs a multi-brand strategy that includes St George, Bank of Melbourne, BankSA and RAMS.\nWhen Westpac bought St George at the end of 2008, then Treasurer Wayne Swan placed a condition on the deal that the existing number of Westpac and St George branches and ATMs be maintained. But the conditions lapsed three years later. Nevertheless, Westpac's branch numbers have been rising gradually each year since 2010, while its competitor's branch numbers have been flat or slightly declining.\nMacquarie said Westpac could lift its earnings by 2 per cent if it closed 9 per cent of branches, rising to an 8 per cent earnings increase if 37 per cent of its branches were closed. (The range was produced after a scenario analysis that reviewed demand for branch services by postcode and examined where Westpac and other branch brands overlapped in various geographies.)\n\"We suspect there will be elements of the update pointing towards a de-emphasis on the sub-brand strategy, which in our view has already begun, with the previously announced reporting changes consolidating the sub-brands into the Westpac brand,\" said Macquarie analyst Brendan Carrig.\nIn June, Mr Hartzer announced a management restructure that saw former St George chief George Frazis promoted to the key job of running a new consumer banking division under which all the brands have been consolidated. The new organisational structure makes determining the performance of sub-brands more opaque and could potentially hide underperformance, analysts have suggested privately.\nDespite the pressure to highlight productivity savings, analysts are not expecting Mr Hartzer to swing the axe on Monday with any lock-step reduction in branch or staff numbers. \"The days of mass branch closures and restructures – the 1990s – are not here again,\" Mr Williams said.\nHowever, across the sector Mr Martin said branches were \"a meaningful source of medium-term productivity savings\", with a 30 per cent reduction in branch cost bases equating to a 4 per cent to 6 per cent increase in net profit after tax. \"It is time for banks to intensify their productivity efforts,\" he said.\nThe market will also be watching the Westpac update for an explanation of the slowdown in revenue in its core Australian retail and business banking units, Mr Williams said. In the retail bank, revenue growth is more reliant on investor mortgages than peers, but investor lending growth has been capped by the prudential regulator.\nWestpac will report its full-year profit on November 2.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/eyersj"], "published": "2015-09-03T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T15:05:24.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
