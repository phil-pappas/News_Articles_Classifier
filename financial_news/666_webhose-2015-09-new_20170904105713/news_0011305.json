However, things are a little different this year. Amid the scams and lack of IRS resources, you can breath a little easier because your chances of being audited have dropped to record lows.”\nThe lowest audit rates in a decade may give some taxpayers cause for celebration. Willis turns to U.S.A. Today for recent statistics, “According to some recent data U.S.A. Today obtained from the IRS, “Your chances of facing an IRS audit rate dropped to the lowest level in at least a decade in 2014 and are expected to fall further this year.”\nWillis adds, “Anyone who has ever been audited probably doesn’t give a hoot as to what has caused the decline. As I mentioned before, one cause is the lack of resources, which U.S.A. Today confirms. “The audit declines coincide with recent drops in IRS funding and a steady falloff in revenue agents.”\nThe entire article can be read at: http://www.irsallstar.com/articles/relax-your-chances-of-being-audited-by-the-irs-have-never-been-lower.php\nABOUT JOHN WILLIS\nMr. Willis believes strongly in supporting and representing the “underdog” and has devoted his entire professional life to protecting and defending those who need it most.
