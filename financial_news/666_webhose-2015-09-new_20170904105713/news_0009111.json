It has grossed $81 million at the box office since then and become a classic.\nIn the nearly four decades since that premiere, audiences have seen plots from the story play out in numerous sequels, crossovers and adaptations, including Scott’s 2012 iteration “Prometheus.” On Thursday, Scott revealed in an interview with HeyUGuys.com that there will be a “Prometheus” sequel, titled “Alien: Paradise Lost.” Including a potential untitled Alien 5 project slated for 2017, there will be nine “Alien” films, crossovers and adaptations.\nSome people think Hollywood has a sequels problem.\nIn a recent note, CLSA media analyst Vasily Karasyov wrote, “Hollywood is headed for a cliff.” After analyzing 20 years of box-office data, Karasyov determined that Hollywood’s reliance on sequels and pre-existing intellectual property is at a near record level. He forecasts that by the end of the year, only four original titles will be among 2015’s top 20 highest-grossing films.\nCLSA “We think, however, the cycle has played out now and Hollywood’s continuously increasing reliance on non-original titles and sequels presents growing risk to film industry profitability,” Karasyov wrote.\nWith a little more than three months left in the year, year-to-date box office revenue is up 5.6% over 2014, according to data collected by Box Office Mojo. Looking at the past five years, revenue has only underperformed 2013, and by just 0.2%. There are a number of box-office blockbusters still waiting for release, including Sony Picture’s SNE, -4.10% latest 007 installment “Spectre” and the rebirth of the “Star Wars” franchise from the Walt Disney Co. DIS, -0.39%\nIndeed, the movie expected to top the box office this weekend is Sony Pictures’ “Hotel Transylvania 2,” a sequel to a 2012 movie . And come Halloween , expect to see trick-or-treaters dressed as some familiar movie characters.\n“As soon as people stop lining up to see those movies Hollywood will stop making them, but I don’t see that happening,” said Rentrak media analyst Paul Dergarabedian. “It’s a chicken-and-egg kind of situation: Are we getting these films because it’s all Hollywood has to offer, or is it because this is what audiences are clamoring for? I think it might be a bit of both.”\nEven “Straight Outta Compton,” which cruised to a surprising $60 million in its debut in August, is an adaptation of a story that is already known, even if it hadn’t previously been turned into a film, Dergarabedian pointed out. The N.W.A. biopic has grossed $159 million in the U.S and Canada, according to Box Office Mojo.\nDergarabedian noted that when Hollywood takes chances on new, fresh and interesting ideas, the payoff typically isn’t there. He pointed to M. Night Shyamalan’s $60 million domestic gross for Sony’s “After Earth” and the $47 million draw for the Wachowski siblings’ “Jupiter Ascending,” from Time Warner Inc.’s TWX, -1.41% Warner Bros.\n“When that happens, studios go back to what’s proven,” Dergarabedian said. “Discovering something new and falling love with a film is one of the experiences you can have in theaters, but that really only happens in the indie world.\n“No matter how much people complain about the number of sequels and franchises in Hollywood, it’s because they typically don’t show up and support new ideas in film.”\nAlso read: 10 biggest plot twists in movie history\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/DGAHtWV7Ua8"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:14:32.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
