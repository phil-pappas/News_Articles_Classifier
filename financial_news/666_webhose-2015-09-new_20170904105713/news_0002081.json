The focus has to date been on Fintech with the bank or Reinventure taking stakes in a range of organisations including peer to peer payments business SocietyOne, online payments company PromisePay, bitcoin startup Coinbase and security specialist QuintessenceLabs.\nHowever David Lindberg, chief executive of Westpac's commercial and business bank, who awarded the prize to AgTasker said that, while fintech was appealing in a short investment window, Agtech was a better long term bet, and had already demonstrated its value to the market.\n\"Over the last decade which has brought drought, the GFC, live export bans and the high dollar the Australian productivity of farmers has still risen almost 50 per cent,\" Mr Lindberg said. \"Australia is now probably the most productive country by hectare.\"\nDavid Lindberg, chief executive of Westpac's commercial and business bank said that while fintech was appealing in a short investment window, Agtech was a better long term bet. Jim Rice AgTasker founder Ella Shannon, a former consultant and analyst with Macquarie Bank's Agricultural Fund, said farmers were eager to ramp productivity in order to meet rising Asian demand, but said poor infrastructure was a huge constraint, which would \"cap Australia's productivity for the future,\" unless fixed.\nGovernment plans In June the Federal Government introduced its Agricultural Competitiveness Whitepaper which outlined the $4 billion of investment plans for the sector, including a range of \"farm smarter\" initiatives, the continued rollout of the NBN, and $160 million to plug mobile blackspots.\nSubmissions to an inquiry into agricultural innovation under the stewardship of South Australian MP Rowan Ramsey close on the 25th of September. That inquiry will explore how farmers are adopting new technologies, identify scope for improvement, and identify emerging technologies and also the barriers to adoption which plague the sector.\n Westpac's Agtech innovation challenge demonstrated the depth of talent in this area with 130 entrants applying, five of which were selected to spend two weeks' intensive training with technology incubator Blue Chilli.\nAgTasker is developing an online jobs market matching farmers' seasonal workforce needs with casual farmworkers, backpackers, grey nomads and university students. Ms Shannon received a $40,000 cheque from Westpac and will take up a six month placement with Blue Chilli to further the development of the system which she hopes to launch in the New Year.\nOther finalists included Livestock Connect, an online marketplace designed to directly link farmers and abattoirs, cutting out agents, which founder David Gregory said currently cost the $9 billion livestock industry around $360 million in annual fees. Currently being tested with 67 organisations, once launched farmers will be charged a flat fee of $240 a year to use the system, with plans for a transport plug in to allow trucking companies also to offer their services directly through Livestock Connect.\nDrones for Vineyards, founded by a team led by Dr Bertram Ostendorf of the University of Adelaide, won the people's choice award. The startup envisages using inexpensive drones armed with cameras and precise filters to fly over and capture images of vineyards in leaf, then upload that data to a secure site which can detect viruses through leaf colouration.\nVirus infection currently costs the industry $12 million a year according to Dr Ostendorf who said that the technology could also be applied to other crops, particularly coffee. He said that traditional techniques could cost $100 per grapevine to detect a virus, where the drone solution would charge on a per hectare basis and be able to access even challenging terrain.\nOther finalists included FarmChem a smartphone app used to capture and record chemical and medicine use on farms, and Smart Shepherd an on-farm tagging system to link ewes and lambs in an attempt to reduce the rate of stock loss which currently costs the industry $500 million a year.\nAwaiting the NBN Georgie Aley, chief executive of the Australian Institution of Food Science and Technology and chair of the Future Farmers Federation applauded the innovation in the sector but said access to the internet remained a major frustration, with many farms still reliant on dialup connections or satellite access.\nShe said that the step changes which were achieved through farm practices innovation in the 1970s, 80s and 90s had been replaced by more incremental benefits delivered by IT solutions such as online farm management, paddock management and crop production systems.\nBut Aley noted; \"The biggest limitation is getting access to data,\" with blackspots around the country continuing to plague farmers.\nMs Shannon, who grew up on a sheep property in Yass, NSW, said that if farmers came in from a day in the paddock and had to wait three seconds for a website to load, they simply would not use online solutions.\nMs Aley however said that young farmers in particular (the Future Farmers Network has a 20,000 strong community of farmers under the age of 35) were eager to deploy IT solutions to improve productivity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T04:13:45.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
