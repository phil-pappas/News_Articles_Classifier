Helen Hawkes Editor The Word Agency ABN: 32 641810403 Tel: 0403 805 001 This email has been checked for viruses by Avast antivirus software. www.avast.com FINStewartWhite.jpg hawkeshelen@bigpond.com by Helen Hawkes In the vanity cupboard of property manager Mark Telley you'll find a selection of high-end grooming products to rival a supermodel's.\nThe tip of the iceberg is Origins Make A Difference Plus Rejuvenating Moisturiser – \"I have dry skin and this product really keeps me feeling fresh\"; Malin + Goetz Vitamin E Shaving Cream – \"it comes in two different sizes meaning I can take it in carry on when I head overseas\"; and Byredo Parfums' Sunday Cologne – \"one of my two go-to fragrances; Frederic Malle French Lover is the other\".\nMore luxe products, such as Aesop Resurrection Aromatique Hand Balm, are secreted in places including his laptop bag – \"the balm smells good and keeps my hands in great shape, especially after a flight, or if I've come off a construction site or the golf course,\" says the 26-year-old.\nTelley admits he's ahead of his girlfriend in grooming/cosmetic product purchase and use, but he does work for a cosmetic retailer, MECCA Brands, and says he has been educated about product and results.\nSkinn men's products. \"I now spend up to $500 every three to four months,\" he says. \"Moisturiser daily, cleanser four days a week, face scrub three days a week, with my list of products geared towards my lifestyle.\"\nTelley is one of a new breed of image-conscious, metrosexual males whom the cosmetics industry is pinning its hopes on for healthy future profits.\nBut young, hipster-types are not alone in growing use of skincare. There's an equally sophisticated, more mature market too, like Stewart White, director of Whiteworks PR, who uses Pro Lab Series All In One Face Treatment – \"it hydrates, reduces crows feet and is matt\"; Kiehls Facial Fuel – \"an invigorating morning after facial jolt\" and Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream at night – \"it's light and non-greasy\".\nMen want to look their best \"Men are beginning to broaden their horizons with skincare and are more concerned than ever with looking their best,\" believes Ben Ferguson, National Education Manager, Australia, for Kiehls.\n\"Currently the skincare market is growing at around 10 per cent a year and Kiehl's men's enjoyed 25 per cent growth last year. The men are definitely purchasing.\"\nJuliet Connell, Molton Brown Australia brand manager, says: \"Since we rolled out the new look men's skincare range in early 2014 we've seen a 23 per cent uplift in sales\"; while Nathan Jancauskas, the creator of high-end grooming store Men's Biz in Melbourne and soon to open in Sydney, reveals: \"Our sales have grown about 400 per cent in the last five years.\"\nMen's Biz 1500 products range includes globally sought after brands such as Jack Black skincare and Penhaligon's fragrances, with a vintage barber service as well as ipads on which shoppers can access online product ratings offered on-site.\nSays Jancauskas: \"There is greater pressure on men to look their best today than at any time in recent history.\"\nIn the past five years, there has been a flood of new products specifically targeted at men from companies such as L'Oreal, Clinique, Clarins and Nivea, according to IBISWorld's latest Cosmetic and Toiletry Retailing in Australia Industry Report.\nRyan Lin, IBISWorld Senior Industry Analyst, estimates annual sales of total men's grooming products in Australia now exceed $500 million a year.\n\"Recent developments within the sector include the introduction of male-specific lines and multi-functional products,\" he says. \"These trends are expected to continue over the next few years.\"\nGrowth outstrips industry average At the same time the men's grooming products industry is predicted to post growth rates in excess of that of the wider cosmetics/personal care industry over the next five years, says Lin, although in the low single digits.\nYes, despite the sound of men slapping on moisturiser or handcream, male only skincare products are still a small segment of the total toiletries market in Australia which is currently worth $3.6 billion.\nDavid Olsen, global vice president of beauty and grooming for The NET-A-PORTER Group, a retail website selling more than 300 leading international brands to 170 countries, has been in the industry for 15 years. \"Every year it's 'the year men's grooming is going to explode',\" he says.\n\"I personally think it is a slow burn, but it is definitely increasing. Education is key. We need to teach men why it's important to take care of your skin, along with the basics.\"\nThe opportunity to increase awareness among Australian men – especially 35-plus, affluent, educated, confident and skincare-savvy – is enormous, agrees Catherine Biedermann, managing director of Advanced Cosmeceuticals, which bought the SKINN Range for men in 2009.\nHowever, the sales pitch needs to differ substantially from that to skincare-savvy females.\n\"Men are practical in their purchasing decisions and this extends to skincare,\" says Biedermann. \"They tend to be wary about products that add too much time to their routine and are also less driven by marketing messages.\n\"They look for products that are compatible for their skin and they tend to prefer fragrance-free but if there is a fragrance it needs to be subtle and perhaps more citrus that floral.\"\nEye cream no, moisturiser yes Right now most men won't use an eye cream or night cream, says Charlotte Turner, head of training for Clarins, yet they are enthusiastic users of moisturising products such as Clarins Super Moisture Balm.\nWhile Ferguson agrees men like \"a simple but effective regimen\", he adds \"never say never\".\n\"Our top Kiehl's products for men are Facial Fuel Energising Scrub, Facial Fuel Moisturiser and the White Eagle Ultimate Brushless Shave Cream.\n\"But concentrates and treatment products are rising in popularity.\"\nAt Men's Biz, undetectable concealer and anti-shine powder for men have recently been introduced while at mrporter.com, more men are willing to experiment with treatments, brighteners and specialised creams.\nE-commerce has also removed some of the cringe factor for men in what may previously have been seen as female-orientated products – no more having to front the retail counter.\n\"It's also the age of the selfie,\" adds Olsen. \"Why walk around with dark circles under your eyes or an oily face when you can easily solve these problems?\"\nWhat men want Men's products need to be multi-taskers. While there are men who are just as obsessed with new products and grooming in general there are also men who would prefer to have one product that does four different jobs, according to Molton Brown. Men prefer lightweight, fresh-smelling products that disappear into the skin, leaving no residue, says Turner. \"They like simple routines and products that are quick and easy to apply.\" They are results-orientated, not necessarily price-driven. Because they have thicker, oilier skin so formulations need to be a bit different in order to effectively penetrate the skin, says Olsen. \"I think a masculine scent (or no scent at all) is important.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:05:30.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
