The following weekend the victors will head back to the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\nAs a result, hoteliers on the east and west coast are set to benefit from an influx of AFL fans for these finals games for the next two weeks.\nMantra Group hotels director of revenue and distribution Luke Moran said unlike the high-flying action of AFL, managing hotel room inventory during footy finals season was more like a game of chess.\n\"It's literally a week-by-week equation balancing the wins and losses of the teams with demand for rooms – and, from a tourism perspective, we certainly hope for interstate teams to feature,\" Mr Moran.\nHe said with the AFL action in Perth, Mantra's two hotels had quickly filled all 263 rooms as North Melbourne and Hawthorn fans flock across the Nullarbor.\nOther hoteliers have also said the same issue has occurred and are trying to accommodate all requests.\nIn Melbourne, where Mantra offers seven CBD hotels, interstate bookings spiked once it was confirmed Perth teams had secured two chances of making the Grand Final. Optimistic Perth fans have all but filled the 1080 Mantra hotel rooms, with the hotel group reporting one of the most successful Grand Final weekends to date.\nMantra Group will add another 86 rooms to the mix next year when it opens the new Peppers Docklands hotel adjacent to Etihad​ Stadium.\nSavills Hotels valuations and consultancy director Adrian Archer said property investors should play close attention to hotels' key performance indicators because hotels are able to react to market forces daily and can be one of the earliest indicators of a change in market conditions due to the number of meetings, conferences and movement of corporate clientele through their doors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T10:27:04.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
