For some, it is a conscious strategy.\nHe says when men make jokes and women laugh, they may be performing a script in courtship.\nPrevious studies have suggested women's brains show greater activity than men's in reward-related regions in response to humour.\nThis suggests women are genetically hardwired to find a sense of humour attractive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:03:19.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
