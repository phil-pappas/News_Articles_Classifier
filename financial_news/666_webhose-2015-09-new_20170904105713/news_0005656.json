He had been in preventive detention pending the verdict. \nAlso sentenced Monday was a former Petrobras director, Renato Duque, who was given a sentence of 20 years and eight months for taking bribes. \nContractors are alleged to have paid off certain Petrobras directors in return for inflated contracts, which they divided up among themselves. \nSome of the kickbacks were alleged to have been paid to prominent politicians, most of them members of President Dilma Rousseff's governing center-left coalition in Congress. \nPetrobras estimates it lost about $2 billion in the scheme, which ran from 2004 to 2014. \n- 'Sophisticated' money-laundering - \nIn detailing Vaccari's crimes, the judge said the bribes were laundered in an \"especially sophisticated\" manner. \nThey were reported as legal campaign contributions, a subterfuge the judge said was largely unknown in Brazil until now. \nThe judge said that of greater concern than the illegal enrichment was the \"contamination of the political world\" and the damage done to the democratic political process. \nThe scandal has dealt a major blow to Rousseff, whose approval ratings have plummeted to eight percent, just eight months after her re-election to a second four-year term. \nWhile Rousseff has not been personally implicated in the scandal, she was chair of the Petrobras board from 2003 to 2010. \nThe opposition is pressing for her impeachment, alleging she knew about the corruption and used illicit Petrobras funds to finance her 2014 re-election campaign -- accusations Rousseff denies. \nOther prominent Brazilians have landed behind bars, including executives of some of Brazil's biggest construction companies. \nOne of those implicated was Jose Dirceu, the powerful former chief of staff of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. \nDirceu was found guilty in a previous corruption case, known as the Mensalao, which involved payments to members of Congress for their votes. \nProsecutors allege that even after his conviction in that case he continued to receive payments from the diversion of funds from Petrobras. \nAlso under criminal investigation are the president of Brazil's lower house of Congress, Eduardo Cunha, and Senator Fernando Collor, who resigned as the country's president in 1992 amid a corruption scandal that led to his impeachment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:23:43.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
