The current tax expires in 2017, and development corporation volunteers and others are hoping voters will renew the tax to continue economic development projects for another 15 years. \nSupporters say renewal of the city sales tax would generate about $8.1 million between 2017 and 2032. \nInformation from: Kearney Hub, http://www.kearneyhub.com/ \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T19:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T21:35:53.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
