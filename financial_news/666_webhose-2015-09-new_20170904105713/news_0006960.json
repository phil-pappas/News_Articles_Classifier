They must take personal responsibility,\" Olaf Lies, a Volkswagen board member and economy minister of the northwestern German state of Lower Saxony told broadcaster the BBC. \n\"Huge damage has been done because millions of people have lost their faith in VW. We are surely going to have a lot of people suing for damages. We have to recall lots of cars and it has to happen really fast.\" \nThe German government has given Volkswagen until October 7 to explain how it will resolve the scandal, which has wiped 29 billion euros, or 38 percent, off the company's market value in 10 days. \nThe controls fitted in up to 11 million diesel cars worldwide switch off when the vehicles are on the road, allowing them to emit harmful levels of emissions. \nLies said that the Volkswagen board had only found out about the issue shortly before the scandal broke this month when US officials publicly accused the company of cheating, and wanted to know why the board wasn't informed earlier. \nHe said that restoring trust and ensuring that ordinary Volkswagen workers were not blamed was the company's priority. \n\"I'm ashamed that the people in America who bought cars with complete confidence are so disappointed,\" Lies said. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T05:46:05.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
