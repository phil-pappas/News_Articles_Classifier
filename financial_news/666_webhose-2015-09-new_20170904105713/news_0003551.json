Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Robert Harley An increase in the rate of GST, strongly endorsed by NSW Premier Mike Baird and seemingly supported by Prime Minister Tony Abbott, would hit some property sectors particularly hard.\nA rise in the GST, from 10 per cent to say 15 per cent, would have a significant negative impact on housing developers and retirement village operators. And that could mean less supply.\nNothing will change soon in this interminable tax debate. But in the wake of Abbott's comments, several of nation's top property executives called for their tax advisers.\nDespite its seeming simplicity, the GST has a complex interaction with property and a range of impacts, on sales and leasing, depending on the sector and the nature of the participants.\nOne expert, the GST partner at lawyers DLA Piper, Matthew Cridland, has recently circulated a six-page briefing with a matrix of GST impacts depending on the transaction.\n﻿ A possible benefit The briefing actually raises the possibility of one beneficial impact. As the GST threshold on imported purchases is dropped, a 2017 commitment, some of those Australian operations with warehouses offshore may bring their logistics back on shore, with a consequent increase in the demand for warehouse facilities.\nBut that is a rare one-off. In most cases, the impact would be, at best, a benign flow through of input tax credits.\n Sometimes even within one class of property the impact varies. Tenanted office buildings are sold GST free as going concerns. Empty buildings can be taxable.\nIt is also possible that a rise in GST costs could be offset by a fall in other imposts such as stamp duty or land tax – though on the current rhetoric, that seems to be less and less likely.\nCridland signals out the shopping centre industry as a potential victim because many of its rents are linked to turnover, which could fall, at least temporarily, in the wake of an increase in the GST or a broadening of the tax base.\nClear losers The big losers are clear – new housing and new retirement villages – because unlike second-hand housing, sales of new residences are subject to GST. Leases of new retirement units are also caught.\nThe Housing Industry Association has warned that the rise in GST, along with the cascade effect on stamp duty, would see a dramatic rise in costs for home buyers.\n\"Modelling conducted by HIA indicates that a 5 per cent increase in the rate of the GST would see the final cost to the consumer of a house and land package go up by around $30,000, which would add $62,000 to the total repayments over the life of a loan,\" the HIA has warned.\n\"If the decision is to increase the rate of the GST, the only answer is to exclude new housing if the nation is serious about addressing housing affordability.With new housing having likely peaked and recent national accounts figures indicating slowing GDP growth, introducing new measures that may further reduce new home building would be unwise.\"\nProperty Council chief executive Ken Morrison says any increase in the GST needs to be offset by the abolition of bad economic taxes such as stamp duty.\n\"Recent modelling by ACIL Allen Consulting shows that switching the tax mix to replace highly distortionary taxes with more efficient revenue sources would boost the economy and can still raise more revenue for governments,\" he says.\n\"But a GST increase without any offsetting stamp duty cut – as some premiers are arguing – would certainly add to the cost of new homes. This runs the risk of reducing housing supply when the economy and housing affordability desperately need it.\"\nrharley@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@RobertHarleyAFR"], "published": "2015-09-09T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:02:07.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
