Based on 1,491 repeat sales in July 2015 and more than 145,000 repeat sales since 1996, the CCRSI offers the broadest measure of commercial real estate repeat sales activity.\nSeveral charts accompanying this release are available at http://media.globenewswire.com/cache/9473/file/37303.pdf \nCCRSI National Results Highlights \nNATIONAL COMPOSITE PRICE INDICES POST MODERATE GAINS IN JULY. Both the equal- and value-weighted national composite price indices advanced in July 2015 as a combination of strong market fundamentals, low interest rates and improving market liquidity continued to support conditions for CRE price growth. However, the pace of price growth cooled slightly from that of the previous six months ending in June 2015. MODERATION IN PRICE GROWTH MOST EVIDENT AT HIGH END OF THE MARKET. The moderation in the rate of price growth was especially evident at the high end of the market where pricing has already exceeded prior peak levels. CoStar's value-weighted U.S. Composite Index, which is influenced by high-value trades, advanced 0.3% in July 2015 compared with a 1.1% average monthly pace from January 2015 through June 2015. The value-weighted U.S. Composite Index is already more than 13% above its prerecession peak level. The equal-weighted U.S. Composite Index increased 0.9% in July 2015, down slightly from the 1.1% average monthly pace from January 2015 to June 2015. It has now advanced to within 7.5% of its prerecession peak, supported by increased investor interest beyond core properties in primary markets. GENERAL COMMERCIAL SEGMENT LED GROWTH IN EQUAL-WEIGHTED INDEX. Pricing in the General Commercial segment, which is weighted toward the sale of smaller, lower-end properties, has continued to gain momentum from improving market fundamentals and increased capital flows across the size and quality spectrum of commercial property. The General Commercial segment increased by 1.3% in July 2015 and 12.2% for the 12 months ending in July 2015, while its Investment Grade counterpart fell 0.9% for the month, but still grew 9.6% for the 12 months ending in July 2015. The General Commercial Index has moved to within 8.1% of its prerecession peak. While recent price growth has decelerated in the Investment Grade segment, it is still within 5% of its prior peak. SALES ACTIVITY IN JULY 2015 SLOWED FROM STRONG PACE SET IN FIRST TWO QUARTERS OF 2015, SALES VOLUME REMAINED ROBUST ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. Composite pair volume in July 2015 declined 7.4% from the robust monthly pace set from January 2015 to June of 2015. However, repeat-sale deal volume of $119 billion for the 12-month period ending in July 2015 marked a 29% increase from the previous 12-month period ending in July 2014, indicating continued strong deal volume. Consistent with recent pricing gains, sales volume increased faster at the low end of the market as investors broadened their search for investment yield. Transaction volume in the General Commercial Index for July 2015 increased 3.2% from the pace set from January 2015 to June 2015, while in the Investment Grade segment repeat-sale deal volume fell 12.4% during the same period. LIQUIDITY METRICS SHOW MARKED IMPROVEMENT. The average time on market for for-sale properties fell 9.9% in the 12-month period ending in July 2015, the largest annual decline in this metric since the current recovery began. Meanwhile, the sale price-to-asking price ratio narrowed by 3.4 percentage points to 92.4% and the share of properties withdrawn from the market by discouraged sellers receded by 5.2 percentage points to 33% during the 12-month period ending in July 2015. Taken together these improving liquidity measures indicate a continued positive environment for sellers. \n\n\n\n\nMonthly CCRSI Results, Data Through July 2015 \n\n\n\n\n1 Month\nEarlier 1 Quarter\nEarlier 1 Year\nEarlier Trough to\nCurrent Value-Weighted U.S. Composite Index 0.33% 1.87% 12.93% 81.55% 1 Equal-Weighted U.S. Composite Index 0.89% 3.74% 11.67% 44.51% 2 U.S. Investment Grade Index -0.91% 1.62% 9.62% 56.17% 3 U.S. General Commercial Index 1.28% 4.18% 12.15% 43.86% 4 1 Trough Date: January 2010 2 Trough Date: March 2011 3 Trough Date: March 2010 4 Trough Date: March 2011 \n\n\n\n\nMonthly Liquidity Indicators, Data Through July 2015 \n\n\n\n\nCurrent 1 Month\nEarlier 1 Quarter\nEarlier 1 Year\nEarlier Days on Market 371 376 384 412 Sale Price-to-Asking Price Ratio 92.4% 92.1% 91.5% 89.1% Withdrawal Rate 33.0% 33.3% 33.5% 38.2% Average days on market and sale-price-to-asking-price ratio are both calculated based on listings that are closed and confirmed by CoStar's research team.

About the CoStar Commercial Repeat-Sale Indices \nThe CoStar Commercial Repeat-Sale Indices (CCRSI) is the most comprehensive and accurate measure of commercial real estate prices in the United States. In addition to the national Composite Index (presented in both equal-weighted and value-weighted versions), national Investment Grade Index and national General Commercial Index, which we report monthly, we report quarterly on 30 sub-indices in the CoStar index family. The sub-indices include breakdowns by property sector (office, industrial, retail, multifamily, hospitality, and land), by region of the country (Northeast, South, Midwest, West), by transaction size and quality (general commercial, investment-grade), and by market size (composite index of the prime market areas in the country).\nThe CoStar indices are constructed using a repeat sales methodology, widely considered the most accurate measure of price changes for real estate. This methodology measures the movement in the prices of commercial properties by collecting data on actual transaction prices. When a property is sold more than one time, a sales pair is created. The prices from the first and second sales are then used to calculate price movement for the property. The aggregated price changes from all of the sales pairs are used to create a price index.\nMore charts accompanying this release are available at http://media.globenewswire.com/cache/9473/file/37304.pdf \nFor more information about the CCRSI Indices, including the full accompanying data set and research methodology, please visit http://costargroup.com/costar-news/ccrsi .\nABOUT COSTAR GROUP, INC. \nCoStar Group, Inc.
