The grant, awarded by the foundation earlier this year, provided funding to help rebuild a primary school in Coyuca de Benitez, Mexico that was previously damaged by local flooding. \n\"The MoneyGram Foundation is excited to continue working with Ninos en Alegria and rebuild a school for a community in need,\" said Robert Burford, MoneyGram's senior regional director for Mexico. \"The foundation works to ensure all children have access to education, and without the help of MoneyGram and the United Way, these children would not have a sufficient school building to go to everyday. We hope this new school will inspire minds and improve lives for years to come.\" \nThis is the second grant by the MoneyGram Foundation to Ninos en Alegria, an organization that aims to improve the educational conditions of children in marginalized areas of Guerrero, Mexico. The United Way co-sponsored the Cuilahuac School, which will serve over 150 children in the community of El Conchero in the Municipality of Coyuca de Benitez. The Cuilahuac School is the tenth school in 9 years built in the area by Ninos en Alegria, offering more than 11,000 children the opportunity to develop their full educational and social potential. \nThe MoneyGram Foundation is focused on improving the access and quality of children's education around the world, and has previously funded school construction and teacher training with Ninos en Alegria. \nTo learn more about the MoneyGram Foundation and the projects it supports, please visit moneygramfoundation.org . \n#moneygramfoundation \nAboutMoneyGram Foundation \nMoneyGram established the MoneyGram Foundation in 2012 to help children around the world gain access to educational facilities and learning resources.
