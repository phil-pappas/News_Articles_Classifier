China's Ministry of Finance said it will roll out \"more forceful\" fiscal policy to boost the slowing economy. Measures include more funds for infrastructure projects, tax cuts for small businesses, debt quotas for local governments and speeding up the approval process for duty-free stores to stimulate construction activity. \n\"This seemed to confirm the hopes of some kind of further Chinese stimulus, hopes that were ostensibly behind the large gains made by the Western markets on Tuesday,\" said Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell. \nChina premier Li Keqiang, meanwhile, tried to soothe markets following the central bank's decision to devalue the yuan on 11 August, which had set off volatility in global stocks. \nSpeaking at the summer World Economic Forum held in the Chinese port city of Dalian, he said: \"There's no basis for persistent depreciation of the renminbi. We will not want to stimulate exports through depreciation. China will not want to see any currency wars. Currency wars would only hurt China.\" Japan also heard good news from its leader. Prime minister Shinzo Abe said the government aims to lower the corporate tax rate by a cumulative 3.3 percentage points over two years through the next fiscal year starting in April 2016. \nJapanese stocks posted the biggest one-day gain since the height of the global financial crisis following the announcement. \nOn another positive note for Japan, data from the Cabinet Office showed consumer confidence rose more than expected in August. The sentiment index climbed to 41.7 last month from 40.3 in July, beating forecasts for a reading of 40.5. \nUK and US data UK industrial production contracted 0.4% in July compared with a 0.4% decline in the previous month and short of expectations for a 0.1% increase. On a year-to-year basis, industrial production grew 0.8%, short of analysts' expectations for a 1.4% reading and smaller than the 1.5% increase registered the previous month. \nThe manufacturing sector suffered a 0.5% decline year-on-year, also falling short of the expected 0.5% increase. \n\"Although UK data has generally been positive over the past few weeks, today's poor manufacturing production figures will make British manufacturers feel very gloomy,\" said Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com. \n\"The recent economic crisis in China is already having a big effect on output and exports, while significant concerns remain about the long-term health of the Eurozone.\" In the US, job openings rose from 5.32m in June to 5.75m in July, comfortably beating expectations for a 5.30m reading and the highest figure since record began in December 2000, the Labor Department revealed. The job openings rate rose to 3.9% after staying at 3.6% throughout the previous quarter. However, despite the surge in job openings, hiring declined to 4.98m from 5.18m in June, as did the number of separations, which fell to 4.72m from 4.91m, while the quits rate - a gauge of worker confidence - remained at 1.9% for the fourth consecutive month. \n\"More openings suggest that wage pressures will start to build, giving some more ammunition to those that think a September move from the Fed is still a necessity,\" IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) analyst Chris Beauchamp said on the likelihood of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve this month. \nThe Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of applications for US home mortgages, which covers home purchase demand and refinancing demand, declined 6.2% in the week ended 4 September. \nCompany news Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) jumped after announcing its wholly-owned subsidiary Anglo American Platinum has reached an agreement to sell its loss-making Rustenberg mining and concentrating operations to Sibanye Gold (Other OTC: SBGLF - news ) for at least ZAR4.5bn. \nOther miners, including BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) and Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) , rose on the back of China's policy announcement and as metal futures were in positive territory. \nHargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) advanced as it posted a 5% drop in operating profit for the year ended 30 June, although revenue nudged up and assets under administration rose 18%. \nRyanair flew higher after raising its full-year net profit outlook by 26% following a strong first quarter of traffic and profits. \nPrudential (HKSE: 2378.HK - news ) and Standard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) , which both have varying but strong degrees of focus on Asia, continued their strong runs this week, after sentiment towards the sector and emerging markets improved somewhat. \nGlaxoSmithKline (Other OTC: GLAXF - news ) was in the red after initial results of its study with Theravance (NasdaqGS: THRX - news ) to understand mortality on the Breo Ellipta inhaler for the treatment of chronic obtrusive pulmonary disease showed that it failed to prolong the life of patients. \nAhead of its results on Thursday, Morrisons was lifted by anticipation of an encouraging strategic update from new chief executive David Potts, who took the reins in March this year. \nLooking ahead, Chinese inflation and the Bank of England will be the centre of attention. \nCapital Economics ' Chang Liu noted: \"We expect consumer price inflation (due 0230 BST on Thursday) to have risen to a 12-month high in August on the back of a continued pick-up in food price inflation. Both pork and vegetable prices, which together have a large weight in the index, rose much faster last month than in August a year ago. \n\"In contrast, non-food CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) inflation ought to have been broadly stable as continued downward pressure on transportations costs and household utility bills due to further falls in energy prices should have been offset by a pick-up in housing cost inflation.\" The markets also expect the Bank of England to maintain UK interest rates following the conclusion of its Monetary Policy Committee meeting on Thursday at 1200 BST. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,110.39 +0.62% FTSE 100 6,229.01 +1.35% FTSE 250 17,153.28 +0.90% FTSE 100 - Risers Hargreaves Lansdown (HL (Shenzhen: 002105.SZ - news ) .) 1,193.00p +7.00% Anglo American (AAL) 742.90p +5.54% Glencore (GLEN) 144.20p +4.80% BHP Billiton (BLT) 1,127.00p +3.68% Morrison (Wm) Supermarkets (MRW) 175.90p +3.47% Standard Chartered (STAN) 744.00p +3.16% Prudential (Amsterdam: PD8.AS - news ) (PRU (HKSE: 2378-OL.HK - news ) ) 1,428.00p +3.07% Coca-Cola HBC AG (CDI) (CCH) 1,341.00p +3.07% Schroders (SDR) 2,918.00p +3.04% Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) (RIO) 2,377.50p +2.94% FTSE 100 - Fallers GlaxoSmithKline (Amsterdam: GO8.AS - news ) (GSK) 1,312.50p -1.24% Mondi (MNDI) 1,472.00p -1.01% Randgold Resources Ltd.
