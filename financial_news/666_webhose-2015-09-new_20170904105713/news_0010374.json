INTEREST RATES\nMany home loan customers have no idea what their interest rate is so phone your bank, look online or pull out your latest home loan statement.\nFigures from comparison website RateCity show the average standard variable rate on a $300,000 30-year home loan is 4.67 per cent and the monthly repayments are $1550.\nOn the same loan the average three-year fixed rate is 4.46 per cent and the monthly repayments are $1512.\nSo if you are paying more than this then you can quickly work out whether you are paying too much.\nMORE: What first home buyers need to know\n2. OFFSET ACCOUNT\nThis is an everyday transaction account that is linked directly to your home loan and is common among most variable rate loans.\nIt allows the customer to park excess cash in their day-to-day account and reduce their monthly interest bill — so if you don’t have one of these accounts make sure you phone up your bank and see if you can get one.\nIt will shave your interest costs dramatically. For example on a $300,000 loan if you have $10,000 in an offset account you will only pay interest on $290,000.\n3. FEES\nHome loans usually come with multiple fees that often secretly sting customers.\nThis includes annual fees, application costs, redraw fees and exit costs.\nReview all your fees on your account and always look at the comparison rate on rival products as this rate factors in all the additional fees and charges associated with the loan.\n4. EXTRA CASH\nFor those lucky enough to have a bit of extra cash, think twice before spending it.\nMany Australians are receiving their tax returns at this time of year so seriously consider tipping those additional funds into your mortgage.\nBy paying off your home loan debt faster you’ll significantly save on interest costs and own your home sooner.\n5. FIX?\nLenders are continuing to drop their rates so there are plenty of good deals to be had on both fixed and variable rate loans.\nThe lowest rate on a $300,000 30-year home loan for both fixed and variable is 3.89 per cent and the monthly repayments are $1413.\nSo shop around for a better deal but make sure you contact your lender first to see if you can get a better offer from them as it will be much easier and sometimes cheaper than refinancing.\nThis reporter is on Twitter: @sophieelsworth\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Spring+clean+your+mortgage&c=NOW+is+the+perfect+time+to+check+in+on+your+home+loan+and+give+it+a+spring+clean+to+save+yourself+some+serious+dollars.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/five-ways-to-give-your-mortgage-an-overdue-spring-clean/story-e6frfmcr-1227507411233?sv=d42e694e2fc52f5f4c47b6fbaa2e66a1", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/five-ways-to-give-your-mortgage-an-overdue-spring-clean/story-e6frfmcr-1227507411233?sv=d42e694e2fc52f5f4c47b6fbaa2e66a1&title=Spring+clean+your+mortgage", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/five-ways-to-give-your-mortgage-an-overdue-spring-clean/story-e6frfmcr-1227507411233?sv=d42e694e2fc52f5f4c47b6fbaa2e66a1&title=Spring+clean+your+mortgage", "https://twitter.com/sophieelsworth", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/five-ways-to-give-your-mortgage-an-overdue-spring-clean/story-e6frfmcr-1227507411233?sv=d42e694e2fc52f5f4c47b6fbaa2e66a1", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/five-ways-to-give-your-mortgage-an-overdue-spring-clean/story-e6frfmcr-1227507411233?sv=d42e694e2fc52f5f4c47b6fbaa2e66a1", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/home-loans#itm_t=story&itm_l=homeloans-elsworth", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/guide/first-home-buyers#itm_t=story&itm_l=mortgagesavings-elsworth", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/five-ways-to-give-your-mortgage-an-overdue-spring-clean/story-e6frfmcr-1227507411233?sv=d42e694e2fc52f5f4c47b6fbaa2e66a1&h=Spring+clean+your+mortgage"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T21:10:47.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
