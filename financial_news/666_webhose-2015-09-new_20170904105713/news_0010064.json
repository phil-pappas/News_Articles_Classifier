At the behest of the Nationals, it has also lowered from $252 million to just $15 million the threshold at which the Foreign Investment Review Board would have to approve the purchase of agricultural land. It was dropped to $53 million for an agribusiness.\nDavid Rowe As Mr Ferguson hit out, former Labor trade minster Craig Emerson turned on his former cabinet colleague Bob Carr, accusing him of pushing the federal Opposition to unquestioningly back the FTA without having studied the actual documentation, which explicitly rules out safeguards for Australian jobs.\n\"Bob Carr is reading from a briefing note, I'm reading from the primary source,\" said Mr Emerson.\nHe Quote: d the Memorandum of Understanding signed between Australia and China which allows for Infrastructure Facilitation Arrangements for projects valued at $150 million or more.\n\"There will be no requirement for labour market testing to enter into an IFA,\" the MoU says.\n As The Australian Financial Review revealed last month, Labor does not want to alter the FTA per se, it just wants the government to back its rhetoric about Chinese companies being forced to first look for Australian workers by enshrining such requirements in legislation, by amending the Migration Act for example..\nMr Ferguson strongly backed the Chinese FTA and said the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union, which is leading the trade union campaign against elements of the deal, would be one of the beneficiaries.\n\"It's almost as if the CFMEU, in a sector that is benefiting from Chinese investment â€“ be it apartments or hotels or commercial buildings in the city - wants to hold the rest of the nation in terms of lower paid jobs such as agriculture, tourism, education for their short term political gain,\" he said.\n\"The message to Canberra's got to be fix this and fix it quick because we actually need the jobs and we need them now, we cannot afford to put them at risk.\"\nTony Abbott and Bill Shorten continued to bicker. The Prime Minster said Mr Shorten had become a CFMEU puppet who was \"playing squalid politics\".\nMr Shorten said the Prime Minister was \"feeling very defensive because he knows that the trade agreement he's asking the Parliament to rubber-stamp doesn't do enough to safeguard Australian jobs\".\nTreasurer Joe Hockey used a speech to business leaders at the Group of 20 finance ministers meeting in Turkey to give Labor a blast.\n\"Those that stand in the way of free trade are standing in the way of higher growth and job creation,\" he said.\n\"It is up to the B20 to hold us to account. I urge you all not to shrink away from continuing to promote the benefits of our trade links in the face of the loud but narrow self-interest of detractors.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:55:29.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
