Additionally, the aircraft on this route has the capability to carry more than 17 tons of cargo in each direction every day, which will support Florida’s export market.” \n“Florida is on a mission to become the global leader in job creation and we are excited about the new Emirates nonstop flight between Orlando and Dubai,” said Florida Governor Rick Scott. “We welcomed more than 97 million visitors to our state last year and every 85 tourists creates another Florida job. We know our tourism industry helps grow our economy and that is why we are investing $145 million at the Orlando International Airport to expand the South Terminal Complex so we can continue to increase domestic and international air service, like the new Emirates flight.” \n“Emirates’ nonstop service to Orlando opens a new world of opportunity for us to pursue tourism and business exchanges with the Middle East, Africa and Asia,” said Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer. “Business and leisure tourism is critical to Central Florida's economy and this new direct service will make it easier for travellers to get to and from Orlando, creating new jobs and opportunities for our residents.” \nEmirates’ daily flight EK219, will depart Dubai at 3:50 a.m. local time and arrive in Orlando at 11:40 a.m., a flying time of 15 hours and 50 minutes.
