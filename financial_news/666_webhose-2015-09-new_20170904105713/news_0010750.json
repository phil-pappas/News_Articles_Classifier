Economists say the devaluation may give a mild boost to Chinese exports eventually, but most did not expect it to have any impact on the August data.\nChina's top economic planning agency said on Monday that exports from some sectors had seen improvement in August.\nThe National Development and Reform Commission also said the economy will grow steadily and meet the government's annual 7 percent growth target, as the effects of supportive policies, including local government debt swaps, rate cuts and real estate market stimulus, feed in over the next few months.\nChina's top financial officials told the meeting of the Group of 20 leading economies late last week that the yuan is not on course for long-term devaluation. They have described the August move as a free-market reform.\nIn recent years, the stronger yuan has hurt China's exports while helping make imports more affordable for Chinese firms and consumers.\nHowever, some economists believe current economic growth rates are already much weaker than official data suggest, and many traders believe there is political pressure to allow a deeper depreciation in coming months as the economy slows.\n(Reporting by Winni Zhou and Kevin Yao; Editing by Pete Sweeney and Jacqueline Wong)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T07:14:33.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
