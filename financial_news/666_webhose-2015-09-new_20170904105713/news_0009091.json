The 2015 finalists, chosen from nearly 200 nominees from nearly three dozen nominating countries and representing 4 continents, were announced today by program host Platts , a leading global provider of energy, petrochemicals, metals and agriculture information. \nEstablished in 1999 and often described as \"the Oscars of the energy industry,\" the Platts Global Energy Awards highlight corporate and individual innovation, leadership and superior performance in 17 categories that span the entire energy complex. \n\"Asia's ongoing advancement in the global energy arena is nowhere more evident than this year's CEO of the Year category, where nearly 75% of the Finalists are from the Asia Pacific (APAC),\" said Murray Fisher, Platts senior manager of strategic media and head of the Platts Global Energy Awards program. \nNot only are these APAC Finalists in the running for the global CEO of the Year Award to be announced in December, but they are also in the running for Asia CEO of the Year , a regional award now in its third year -- the winner of which will be unveiled October 27 at the Platts Top 250 Asia Awards Dinner* in Singapore. \nWhile the U.S. has made a strong showing in this year's Platts Global Energy Awards nominations and Finalists, some 45% of the 2015 Finalists hail from outside the United States. India and U.K. also made notable showings. The mix of nominations and Finalists not only reflect a wide but changing geographic footprint, but also reflect several changes to long-standing Awards categories and the addition of new categories. \nMore than 30 Finalists are from the new or refined categories of 2015, including the following: Grid Edge Award \nWith the addition of Financial Deal of the Year Award, the Platts Global Energy Awards program for the first time in its 17 years is specifically showcasing performance from private equity, hedge funds and other investment groups and the vital role they are playing amid the energy industry's consolidation and low oil price environment. \nThe new Industry Leadership Award – Downstream, where 7 finalists are named, is designed to capture a broadening array of refined products entrants, including makers of petrochemicals and liquefied petroleum gas. \nIn power, the program has named 18 Finalists in the combined categories of: Industry Leadership Award for Power and Grid Edge Award. Both categories are evolutions of previously existing Awards, which now recognize performance not only in power generation, but also storage, load management and distributed generation on both sides of the meter. \nThe program's independent panel of judges will select winners for each Award category from its corresponding group of Finalists. The Energy Company of the Year will be chosen from the entire list of finalists, regardless of original category. Winners will be announced at the 2015 Platts Global Energy Awards black-tie dinner on December 9 in New York City.
