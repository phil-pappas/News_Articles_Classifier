(Nasdaq GS: CKSW), the leading provider of automated mobile workforce management and optimization solutions for the service industry, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015.\nFirst Quarter 2015 Highlights\nRevenues of $26.7 million, down 6% year-over-year; Recurring revenues from cloud subscriptions and support reached 52% of total revenues; 82% of new customers purchased cloud solutions; Non-GAAP net loss of $3.7 million, or $0.11 per fully diluted share; Cash increased to $46.5 million, from $45 million at the end of the last quarter; As announced on April 30, 2015, the Company signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by Francisco Partners, a private equity firm. Upon closing of the transaction, ClickSoftware will become a private company. \"Our quarterly results were disappointing due primarily to lower than expected revenues which were caused by slippage of key contracts to the second quarter. By now, the majority of these contracts have already been signed or are in their final contract stages. This slippage, coupled with currency weakness of the Euro and a decrease in consulting revenues, accounted for most of our reported softness for the first quarter,\" said Dr. Moshe BenBassat, ClickSoftware's Founder and Chief Executive Officer. \"The trend of large enterprises shifting to the cloud keeps intensifying, as reflected in our new deals. We are excited to report that 82% of our new enterprise customers in the first quarter were cloud customers.\"\n\"We are very pleased to have announced our recent decision to be acquired by Francisco Partners, a private equity firm. The firm has an outstanding industry reputation, and we are confident that their expertise together with our highly capable employees and management team will position ClickSoftware for long term growth,\" concluded Dr. BenBassat.\nFirst Quarter Results\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, 2015, total revenues were $26.7 million, down 6% from $28.4 million for the first quarter of 2014. Net loss on a GAAP basis for the quarter was $4.7 million, or $0.14 per fully diluted share, compared with net loss of $2.0 million, or $0.06 per fully diluted share, for the same period last year. Non-GAAP net loss for the quarter was $3.7 million, or $0.11 per fully diluted share, compared with Non-GAAP net loss of $1.0 million, or $0.03 per fully diluted share, for the same period last year.\nSoftware license revenues for the first quarter of 2015 were $4.3 million, down 39% compared with $7.0 million for the same period last year. Cloud subscription revenues were $5.6 million, up 145% compared with $2.3 for the same period last year. Support revenues were $8.4 million, up 1% compared with support revenues of $8.3 million for the same period last year. Consulting revenues were $8.5 million, down 6% compared with consulting revenues of $10.7 million for the same period last year.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2015 was $13.7 million, or 51% of revenues, compared with $16.5 million, or 58% of revenues, for the same period last year. The decrease in gross profit margins was primarily due to the decrease in consulting revenues and lower license revenues.\nCash and liquid investments at the end of the first quarter of 2015 were $46.5 million, an increase of $1.5 million, compared with the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 million during the first quarter of 2015.\nIn light of the pending acquisition by Francisco Partners, ClickSoftware no longer intends to issue updates to its 2015 annual guidance regarding revenues and earnings per share.\nInvestors Conference Call\nClickSoftware will host a conference call today at 9:00 a.m. ET to discuss its financial results and other matters discussed in this press release, as well as answer questions from the investment community.
