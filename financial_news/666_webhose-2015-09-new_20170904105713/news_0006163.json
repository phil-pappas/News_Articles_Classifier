If it doesn’t have “http” in the url and a padlock sign on the site then it’s likely to be a scam.\nIt is common these days to be bombarded with dodgy emails pretending to offer you some enticing deal or a monetary win such as a gift card or store voucher.\nLook for errors in these emails — often they’ll be littered with spelling mistakes and incorrect English that should set alarm bells ringing.\nFor example if a retailer is offering you a $1000 voucher, question why they would be doing this and if you’re unsure contact the retailer direct to work out whether it’s legitimate.\n“If in doubt don’t click on it as it can download malware,” Rickard says. “Call the company direct and find out if it is from them.’’\nIf you have been scammed it’s not too late to take action.\nIf you have given away important details to do with your bank account, Medicare information or your driver’s licence contact the relevant authorities immediately.\nIf you do find you have used your credit card for something that is a scam, contact your financial institution and you may have rights to get your money back.\nRickard urges consumers who want to learn more about scams to visit www.scamwatch.gov.au\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.scamwatch.gov.au/", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/guide/credit-cards#itm_t=story&itm_l=online_scam_elsworth", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-avoid-been-scammed-online/story-e6frfmcr-1227510526875?sv=57d80a3146f950b4b5a96224717f854a", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-avoid-been-scammed-online/story-e6frfmcr-1227510526875?sv=57d80a3146f950b4b5a96224717f854a&title=Detecting+an+online+scam", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-avoid-been-scammed-online/story-e6frfmcr-1227510526875?sv=57d80a3146f950b4b5a96224717f854a", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/credit-cards#itm_t=story&itm_l=shopping_fraud_elsworth", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Detecting+an+online+scam&c=WHEN+it+comes+to+email+offers+if+it+seems+too+good+to+be+true%2C+it+is+probably+a+scam.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-avoid-been-scammed-online/story-e6frfmcr-1227510526875?sv=57d80a3146f950b4b5a96224717f854a", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-avoid-been-scammed-online/story-e6frfmcr-1227510526875?sv=57d80a3146f950b4b5a96224717f854a&h=Detecting+an+online+scam", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-avoid-been-scammed-online/story-e6frfmcr-1227510526875?sv=57d80a3146f950b4b5a96224717f854a&title=Detecting+an+online+scam"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T21:11:33.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
