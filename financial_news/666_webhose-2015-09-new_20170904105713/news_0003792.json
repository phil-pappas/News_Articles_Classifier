This Corporate Philanthropy programme is of unprecedented scope, running in 26 countries on five continents, in close liaison with the BNP Paribas Group network. Dream Up will enable 30,000 children and teenagers from underprivileged backgrounds or living with a disability to receive training and guidance in an artistic activity through projects run by local charity organisations. \nDREAM UP: SUCCESSFUL PILOT TEST NOW GOES FORWARD! In 2012, the BNP Paribas Foundation began a test phase of this Corporate Philanthropy programme under the name Smart Start. Running in eight European and four Asian countries, Smart Start provided assistance to 7,000 youngsters over a three-year period (2012-2014). Following the success of the pilot phase, the BNP Paribas Foundation has now decided to make this educational programme the flagship of its international Social Inclusion policy, extending it to 26 countries 1 all over the world under the name \"Dream Up.\" \nDREAM UP 2015-2017 Budget over EUR 1.6m Around 30 projects in 26 countries across Europe, Asia, the Americas, Africa and the Middle East EUR 20K annual grant per project \nBNP Paribas Foundation Chief Executive Jean-Jacques Goron underlines : \"Practising an artistic discipline, of whatever kind, enables children and adolescents to become more aware of their own abilities. It's an excellent way to help them make sense of the world around them and find their place in it. Theatre performance for instance gives them a chance to face the public and experience practical coexistence with others in a collective project that requires both personal involvement and respect for others if it is to succeed. Art is a wonderful means of personal development for these young people.\" \nFINANCIAL GRANTS TO SOME 30 CHARITY-RUN PROJECTS IN 26 COUNTRIES OVER 3 YEARS TO FURTHER THE EDUCATION OF OVER 30,000 CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS \nThis Arts-based education programme will enable more than 30,000 youngsters all over the world to receive training and practice over three school years in such disciplines as music, dance, theatre, circus arts, the plastic arts, photography and video-making. BNP Paribas staff working in each of the countries where the Group has an establishment have selected some thirty projects run by non-profit organisations. They identified local charities running the most suitable activities, i.e. those which demonstrate a close fit with the aims and objectives of Dream Up. The basic aims of the programme are: to promote equality of opportunity; to offer young people the chance to learn -- or further develop their skills in -- an artistic discipline; and also to encourage BNP Paribas staff to get involved in the projects on a volunteer basis. \nTo be eligible for a Dream Up grant, a project must be designed to benefit children or teenagers, 5 to 18 years old, who come from an underprivileged background, live with a specific handicap or are failing in their schooling, and must be running in a town or neighbourhood close to a BNP Paribas Group establishment so as to give local Group staff the opportunity to get involved in the project activities. Jean-Jacques Goron points out: \"It's part of BNP Paribas Foundation policy to provide support to each project for at least three years. We believe that Corporate Philanthropy should take a long-term approach. It takes time to get to know the organisations, find the right ideas and set up the necessary procedures. This is about real partnership.\" As with the pilot phase, each of the selected projects will receive a grant of EUR 20,000 per year over three years. \nARTISTIC DISCIPLINE: AN EXCELLENT EDUCATIONAL TOOL Priority has been given to projects likely to have a positive impact on the youngsters' schooling, especially in terms of improving their school attendance and helping them to make real progress. All the projects being supported under the Dream Up programme will enable the young participants to learn about and practice one or more Arts activities on a regular basis. They will also put on at least one public showing or performance, such as a video screening, a concert, dance or circus arts performance or festival, in front of their families, friends and loved ones, plus sometimes also artists or professionals in the chosen field. \nWIDE DIVERSITY OF PROJECTS The projects being supported under Dream Up include, among other initiatives, music lessons culminating in a public performance by children from the Monte Azul favela in Sao Paulo, Brazil; training in understanding visual imagery for French youngsters; singing lessons for Turkish teenagers; and learning to act Shakespearian plays for young South Africans in Johannesburg, but the basic objective is always the same: to open new horizons for underprivileged or marginalised youngsters, encourage them to pursue a dream and build a life for themselves. \nThe lessons and workshops may take place in school hours, at weekends or during the vacation and may be held at the school or college, on the premises of the charitable organisation running the project, or even in the paediatric department of a hospital. Explains Jean-Jacques Goron: \"We've given priority to projects that focus on getting the youngsters to open up to arts and culture. To take an example, in Singapore we came across a non-profit called the Little Arts Academy, which offers children multi-disciplinary artistic training. The approach -- giving kids the opportunity to 'try out' different activities before deciding what they like best and where their talents lie -- really appealed to us. We'll also be supporting, under Dream Up, a San Francisco ballet school project that enables young people threatened with social marginalisation to train in modern dance.\" \nAlmost all the Dream Up projects will commence simultaneously this month. \nAbout the BNP Paribas Foundation Under the aegis of the Fondation de France, the BNP Paribas Foundation has been playing a key role in corporate philanthropy for 30 years.
