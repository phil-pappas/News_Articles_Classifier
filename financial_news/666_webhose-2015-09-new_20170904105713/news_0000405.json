The auto giant has even created an autonomous driving feature, dubbed SuperCruise, which will utilize the 4G LTE data.\n\n\n\nThis connectivity concept is similar to that of the Internet of Things, an idea that harnesses the power of the Internet to unite people and technology. Currently, it’s mostly used in connecting household items to a wireless network; think of Amazon’s (AMZN) Dash button, which lets customers order home goods on Amazon.com by pressing a button, or Google’s (GOOG) Nest product line, a smart home appliance line that includes a camera, thermostat, and smoke and CO alarm. Most recently, Netflix (NFLX) is in the process of developing a “Netflix and Chill” button that has the capability to turn on the TV, bring the viewer to the Netflix homepage, dim your lights, silence your phone, and even order food, all with the press of a button.\n\n\n\nIf GM can successfully implement smart links between vehicles, then the auto company is on its way to creating a strong presence for itself in the changing transportation industry, as tech companies like Apple (AAPL), Google, Uber, and electric car maker Tesla (TSLA) are rewriting what it means to make and drive a car.\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
