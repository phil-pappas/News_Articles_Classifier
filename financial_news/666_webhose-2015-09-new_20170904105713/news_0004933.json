This alliance will allow companies to easily integrate Prevedere’s sophisticated external insights, correlations and predictive models into their existing SAP systems for a holistic view of performance. Combining historical corporate data with external factors, this enhanced predictive analytics solution will enhance decision-making through accurate forecasting and ultimately improve profits.\n“Our alliance with TekLink will empower corporate executives to have a better understanding of the critical factors that truly impact their businesses, beyond their own four walls – directly within their existing SAP system,” said Rich Wagner, President and CEO of Prevedere. “This integration offers unmatched forecasting capabilities, utilizing real-time external data sets that are paired with existing internal company data to give executives a much clearer view of their business so they can plan accordingly to improve their bottom lines.”\nPowered by Prevedere’s proprietary cloud-based, software-as-a-service (SaaS) correlation engine, this new offering will identify external leading indicators that significantly impact business performance. Companies will gain a competitive advantage from the ability to take early action to mitigate negative elements that diminish performance with the power of big data and predicative analytics directly at their fingertips. By integrating the solution directly into their existing system of record, companies can immediately take into account macroeconomic factors such as weather data, global manufacturing activity, consumer behavior and more, when making business projections.\n“It is common industry knowledge that 85 percent of a company’s success depends on external factors. Given this, it behooves corporations to not fly blind. The repercussions are too prohibitive for corporations to ignore such external factors anymore,” said Douglas Heck, Senior Vice President of TekLink International. “Just take a look at the impact of low oil prices or the drought in California. These are key events critically important to the financial planning community and office of the CFO. We have now embedded such predictive forecasting ability into SAP Business Planning and Consolidation. With this product, corporations can now leverage the effect of external leading indicators to their advantage. That is unbelievably powerful.”\nPrevedere and TekLink will showcase this integration capability at TekLink’s Innovation Day, September 18th in Lisle, Illinois.
