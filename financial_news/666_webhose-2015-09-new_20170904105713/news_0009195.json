But consumers still need to go find a better deal rather than expecting their fund to offer them one,\" Rainmaker Group boss Alex Dunnin​ says.\n\"It is one of the best kept secrets of the industry that most people with a large balance don't pay an entry fee to switch funds, and that high value clients can negotiate their fees on a case by case basis if they or their planner take the initiative to ask for a discount\".\n\"Super fees can seem a bit abstract but if you lost a couple of thousand dollars behind the couch every year you would bother to clean it occasionally,\" AMP financial planner Andrew Heaven✓ says. Tanya Lake Similarly, existing members can ask for a better rate to stay put.\n\"Some funds will start to negotiate fees for people with balances as low as $100,000,\" Dunnin says.\n\"Super fees can seem a bit abstract but if you lost a couple of thousand dollars behind the couch every year you would bother to clean it occasionally,\" AMP financial planner Andrew Heaven says.\n\"First make sure you know what fees you are paying and what you're getting for them, then consider getting some advice to find out if you'd be better off in another fund\".\nRainmaker Group boss Alex Dunnin: \"Anyone still complaining about super fees being too high has only themselves to blame.\" Regulators turn up heat Ahead of the government's formal response to last year's financial system inquiry, chaired by former Commonwealth Bank boss David Murray, funds face increasing pressure from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to show they are achieving economies of scale and passing these benefits onto members via reduced fees .\nThe good news is that on average super fund members are already paying less as regulatory reform, increased competition, and technological change have driven down costs.\n\"On average the fees charged by super funds have fallen by 40 per cent over the past five years, which is an absolutely tremendous result from the industry,\" Dunnin says.\nBut while the industry-wide trend is positive, some funds have still done little or nothing to reduce costs.\nFurthermore, because fees are charged on a percentage basis, the total fee-take by the industry has soared in dollar terms as the size of the industry has increased.\nRainmaker's 2015 Super Fund Fee Survey found Australians paid $23 billion in fees back to their super funds in the year to 30 June 2015, a figure equivalent to 1.3 per cent of gross domestic product.\nThe total dollar value of fees collected by the super sector grew 7 per cent last financial year, a rate of increase that outpaced inflation by three times, as the country's compulsory retirement savings pool swelled to $2 trillion.\nPeople with $50,000 in their super account paid on average $2000 in fees last financial year, while those with a balance of $250,000 typically lost $3000 to fees.\nAll the more reason to shop around.\n\"Consumers need to do some research and take action to get a better deal. With plenty of low cost options now in the market, anyone still complaining about super fees being too high has only themselves to blame,\" Dunnin argues.\nA phone call to a financial adviser or a super fund might work wonders.\nDiscounted fees are now easier to come by after both the industry and retail arms of the super sector have been forced to respond to sweeping regulatory change in the past couple of years.\n\"The MySuper reforms introduced in 2014 have produced a market shock that has brought down average fees for people in workplace funds by a whopping 20 per cent,\" Dunnin says.\nMeanwhile the Future of Financial Advice (FOFA) reforms, also implemented in 2014, have led to the unbundling of previously embedded adviser commissions within retail products, creating an environment ripe for the development of fee-for-service products.\n\"That is why product innovation has been led by the bank-backed groups able to supplement their offerings with advanced technology, broadened distribution platforms, and low cost investment options such as exchange traded funds,\" Dunnin says.\nIndustry v retail funds People who work at one of the handful of large Australian companies that still operate a retirement scheme for employees can access some of the lowest fees. Low balance members of corporate plans can often pay fees as low as 0.4 per cent and some may even have their fees fully subsidised by the employer.\nThe ANZ Australian Staff Superannuation Scheme has the lowest total expense ratio (TER) of any corporate fund in the country at 0.46 per cent, followed by the BHP Billiton Superannuation Fund, which charges 0.57 per cent.\nTER is a simple measure used by Rainmaker to benchmark the average percentage of fees charged to members with a particular balance.\nWorkplace default funds also typically include a fee discount, with bigger employers able to strike better deals for their staff.\nFor working Australians with $50,000 in a managed fund at 30 June 2015 the average TER was 1.43 per cent, 80 per cent higher than the average SMSF solution, according to Rainmaker.\nThe non-profit fund sector still tends to charge lower fees than the retail fund sector.\nThe average TER on a $50,000 account across industry funds was 0.99 per cent last financial year, compared to 1.76 per cent from retail funds.\nStandard fee discounts start seriously kicking in once balances top $200,000.\nThe average total expense ratio for members with a $250,000 balance in a managed superannuation account at 30 June 2015 was 1.2 per cent. The average TER on a $250,000 account across industry funds was 0.9 per cent last financial year, compared to 1.4 per cent from retail funds.\nBanks lead price charge But the headline averages belie the fact that bank-owned funds now offer some of the lowest fees in the market, with retail funds topping the list of cheapest public offer super funds.\nIt is a trend that tipped to continue.\n\"It's game on from the big banks, which have much more established infrastructure for online service delivery and greater access to low cost investment products than the industry fund sector,\" Dunnin argues.\nING DIRECT Living Super is a no-frills retail product that charges zero fees, propelling it straight to top spot on Rainmaker's list of cheapest public offer funds for 2015.\nANZ Smart Choice Super is also among the cheapest public offer products available, charging 0.6 per cent on a $50,000 balance and 0.52 per cent on a $250,000 balance.\nBendigo SmartStart Super is another retail super product topping the charts for low fees, charging 0.64 per cent on a $50,000 balance and 0.49 per cent on a $250,000 balance. Bendigo's \"responsible investment\" option The Emerald SuperWrap also made the list, with fees of 0.7 per cent for both low and high balance members.\nAMP Flexible Super is another retail product to rank among the top 10 cheapest funds, charging 0.77 per cent on a balance of $50,000 and 0.62 per cent on a balance of $250,000.\nNot surprisingly non-profit funds – notably Club Plus Super, AustralianSuper, EISS Super, and First State Super – still dominate the cheapest fund rankings.\n\"Three years ago it was unimaginable that a bank would be providing the lowest cost MySuper product in the market, but the fact that has happened so quickly shows how competitive the retail sector can be when pushed,\" Dunnin says.\nThe Netflix effect \"That in turn is putting competitive pressure on the industry funds, which is only going to intensify as more robo-advice platforms roll-out\".\nMajor industry funds are all investing in technology as are a handful of tech-savvy smaller funds.\nThe top performing balanced MySuper product last financial year, Queensland public sector superannuation fund QSuper, was one of the first non-profit funds to launch personalised online advice for its members. Equipsuper is due to unveil a major project to improve its online services soon.\n\"As competition and product innovation continues, fund members should expect a further reduction in average fees. It's like the uberfication of super,\" Dunnin says.\nBut unlike the taxi industry, which has been disrupted over the past couple of years by scrappy start-up app-based car ride service Uber, the superannuation industry is being disrupted from within by big well-financed incumbent players.\n\"If super funds follow the 'Foxtel-Netflix' effect the pace of fee reduction could increase at a surprising speed,\" Dunnin says, referring to the margin squeeze hitting the subscription entertainment business.\nBNP Paribas local head of securities services David Braga​, who counts major super funds as clients, says the industry's transformation is well underway.\n\"Improving online services and learning how to harness big data is one of the biggest areas of focus across the industry, all the major funds are working on it,\" Mr Braga said.\nHistorically the lower fees facilitated by operating under a non-profit model have been a selling point for the industry funds, but now the banks are competing hard on price.\nFor consumers, scanning product disclosure statements or comparison websites, such as Rainmaker's SelectingSuper portal, to save a few basis points in fees can feel like a lot of hassle. But small savings can stack-up over time making it worth the effort.\n\"It is projected that for the average 25-year-old a 1 per cent reduction in fees would add $97,000 to the balance at retirement, but likewise an extra 1 per cent of investment performance would generate the same result,\" AustralianSuper group executive membership Paul Schroder says.\nBut Schroder cautions investors against simply hunting for the lowest fees.\n\"Finding a strong performing fund with an appropriate strategy for you, that also has low fees, is a much more robust strategy than just picking the lowest fee fund,\" he said.\nWhat represents good value will depend on a number of factors including how high the individual's account balance is, the type of asset mix held by the fund, the quality of its investment managers, and what services the member wishes to pay for.\nIFM Investors chief executive Brett Himbury​ said it was dangerous to select a super fund based on cheap fees.\n\"Some of the new MySuper products being spruiked as ultra-low cost with fees of less than 0.5 per cent sound really cheap, but when you look at the value of the underlying assets they are offering exposure to, the fees should really be closer to 0.1 per cent\".\nMr Himbury has criticised the retail fund sector for its lower allocation to more expensive alternative asset classes, such as unlisted property and infrastructure .\n\"Too much focus on fees can risk long term returns,\" Himbury says.\nDunnin disagrees.\n\"There is no clear relationship between higher fees and better returns, so people may as well pay low fees,\" he said.\n\"People shouldn't pick a fund just because it is cheap, but there are now plenty of good low-cost options in the market and not just from the non-profit funds, he says\"\nPlenty will argue that it is worth paying more for a fund because it has a stronger track record or uses more sophisticated active asset managers.\n\"If you pay nothing you get nothing, but it is also very easy to pay too much in fees and not get enough value in return for it,\" Macquarie Bank senior wealth adviser Noel Yeates says.\nA popular theory goes that passively managed assets have outperformed over the past five years as the central bank-fuelled recovery from the global financial crisis has acted as a rising tide to lift all boats, but that in heading into tougher financial markets in the years ahead active managers will really start to earn their crust.\n\"That remains to be seen,\" Dunnin argues.\n\"Financial markets are impossible to predict, so why not start saving on something you can control\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/sallymrose", "https://plus.google.com/115164720240377561218/about?hl=en"], "published": "2015-09-25T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T00:06:01.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
