For instance, with IoT, street lights will automatically go off when they sense no traffic on the roads and consequently, save power. \nAnother application could be a smart band that will automatically alert a physician when body vitals go to abnormal levels. \nThrough the joint efforts, the two companies will enable seamless integration of device, connectivity, data platform and analytics for organisations globally to address complex enterprise and industrial IoT challenges, the statement said. \n\"The intersection of employees, data and technology enabled intelligent machines is creating fundamental shifts in enterprise business models, leading to not only increased productivity and efficiency but also opening a plethora of new revenue opportunities for companies,\" HCL technologies EVP (Engineering and R&D services) and Head (IoT Business) Sukamal Banerjee said. \nThe partnership with IBM will provide replicable use cases for companies and enable accelerated adoption of IoT within and across industries, he added. \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T04:28:25.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
