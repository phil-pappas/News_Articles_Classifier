U.S. crude was up 0.1 percent at $44.96 a barrel, while Brent was slightly up at $48.19. \n(Additional reporting by Swati Pandey in Sydney; Editing by Eric Meijer)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T06:47:47.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
