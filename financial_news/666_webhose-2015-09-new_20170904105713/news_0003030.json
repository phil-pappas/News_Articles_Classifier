Ananthalakshmi \nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Gold added to overnight losses on Thursday, hurt by a stronger dollar and as investors awaited a key U.S. jobs report to gauge the timing of a Federal Reserve rate hike. \nSpot gold had eased 0.1 percent to $1,132.30 an ounce by 0318 GMT, after dropping 0.5 percent on Wednesday. U.S. gold slipped about $1 to $1,132.40. \nU.S. private payrolls data on Wednesday suggested that labour market momentum likely remained strong enough for the Fed to consider an interest rate hike this year. The nonfarm payrolls report on Friday will be eyed for more clues. \n\"Gold is awaiting the payroll data for indications of Fed intentions at the September FOMC meeting. So the market may move sideways until the numbers are released,\" said HSBC analyst James Steel, referring to the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee. \nThe U.S. central bank has pegged the likelihood of a rate increase to the strength of economic data. A strong jobs report could prompt the Fed to increase rates sooner than later. \nBullion traders remain wary of taking up fresh positions until they receive more clarity on whether the Fed will raise rates at its next meeting on Sept. 16-17. \nLow interest rates cut the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. \nAlso weighing on bullion was the absence of Chinese buyers. Markets in China, a major gold consumer, are closed on Thursday and Friday for public holidays. \nTepid Chinese demand during the holidays will also keep gold prices capped, along with the uncertainty over a U.S. rate hike, HSBC's Steel said. \nThe dollar climbed against the euro and yen on Thursday as global investors tentatively stepped back into riskier equities, hurting bullion. \nThe technical picture for gold looks bearish with near-term support at $1,117, ScotiaMocatta analysts said. \n\"We are bearish gold so long as it trades below the recent high of $1,170,\" they said. \nOther precious metals were also under pressure on Thursday. Palladium was down nearly 1 percent at $577.47 an ounce. Silver and platinum was lower by about 0.4 percent. \n(Reporting by A.
