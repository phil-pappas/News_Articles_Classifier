China was home to the world’s most active equity-index futures market until policy makers raised margin requirements, tightened position limits and announced investigations into “malicious” short sellers to combat a $5 trillion selloff in shares.\nThe tumble in volumes has wrong-footed an industry that expanded its registered staff by 50 percent since 2011 to 50,895 last year, according to data compiled by the China Futures Association . The slump may accelerate industry efforts to expand beyond just handling client orders into other businesses such as asset management, according to Cai Luoyi, the vice general manager of Shanghai Cifco Futures Co.\n“The current standoff in the index futures market will speed up the changes in futures brokerages and companies may cut more staff in the so-called traditional brokerage business,” Cai said. He added that the slump in index futures volumes may not last “long” as restrictions will be eased after the market stabilizes.\nThe benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.7 percent at 10:22 a.m. local time, paring this week’s gain to 1.9 percent. The measure has slumped 38 percent from its June 12 high.\nAuthorities are targeting futures because selling the contracts is one of the easiest ways for investors to make large wagers against stocks. It’s also a favored product for short-term speculators as the exchange allows participants to buy and sell the same contract in a single day.\nYet futures are also a popular tool among sophisticated investors with longer-term horizons. For hedge funds, they provide an easy way to adjust exposure to market swings. And large institutions use them to make cost-effective asset-allocation changes.\nThe most pressing task for the industry right now?\n“Proving that futures are innocent,” said Dai Shenshen, a trader at SWS Futures Co. in Shanghai.", "external_links": ["http://www.cfachina.org/\\"], "published": "2015-09-10T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T11:01:07.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
