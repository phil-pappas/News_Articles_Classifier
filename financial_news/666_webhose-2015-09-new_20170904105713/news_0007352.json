It's just that Hine says he couldn’t be happier thanks to the freedom and time savings provided by mobile and online technology.“I take full advantage of the available technology, ranging from online bill pay to making deposits using my smartphone,” the Gen-X Tampa Bay resident says. “I don't have to carve out time to stand in line at my bank and can handle quick financial transactions any time that is convenient to me. Honestly, if my bank closed locations in my area, it wouldn’t impact me whatsoever.” Hine shares this opinion with a growing number of consumers as trends point to a pronounced decline in branch locations, which has impacted how customers interact with their bank. In fact, Data from the latest Sageworks Bank Information report show that U.S. bank branches have dropped to an all time low, going from more than 98,000 branches in 2010 to fewer than 95,000 in 2014. \nBank Location Numbers Make a Significant Slide More Headlines 10 Best Tailgating Vehicles for The 2015 Football Season \nJim Norris, president and CEO of Montgomery County Employees Federal Credit Union says that branch transactions at his credit union decreased by over 60% since 2009 and continues to drop by 5% per year. \n“In person transactions have been replaced by online banking, mobile banking, credit and debit cards , all more convenient services for consumers,” Norris says. “I believe this trend will continue and may hasten with new payment technologies like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay, again very convenient ways to pay. Also the advent of P2P is important, because it allows people to exchange funds without using cash.” \nNorris believes the voracious appetite for technology has accelerated due to rapidly evolving consumer behavior. “It is our job to make sure members get what they want – when they want it,” he says. The recent Sageworks report that correlates with what Norris and other financial executives are saying. James Noe, Sageworks analyst says that branches have dropped by 3.5% over the past five years as the advent of mobile and electronic products have persisted. \n“The landscape of the banking industry has changed where we have a growing access to technology, but we’ve also seen a profusion of mergers and acquisitions, which is driving down the number of institutions,” Noe says. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T21:12:05.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
