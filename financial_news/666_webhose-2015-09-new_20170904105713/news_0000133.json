A photo with Ivan the Terrible, for instance, can cost anywhere from 200 rubles (around $3) to 1,000 rubles, depending on the visitor’s negotiating skills.\nENLARGE Sergei Solovyov The dispute between the two leaders of the global proletariat late June ended in a scuffle, according to city officials and other impersonators, exposing the seamier side of capitalism around Moscow’s main tourist site.\nLenin impersonator Igor Gorbunov said the Stalin look-alike, Latif Valiyev, followed him into an underpass near Red Square and jabbed him in the back with an umbrella. Mr. Gorbunov went to a first-aid station before filing a complaint to police. Law enforcement looked into the incident, but Mr. Gorbunov later said that he had forgiven Mr. Valiyev and withdrawn his complaint.\nMr. Valiyev denied having a conflict with his fellow dictator—and demanded payment to answer any further questions.\nLook-alikes began to appear on Red Square in the mid-1990s as capitalism took hold and Russia opened up to tourists. “Fat Lenin” was the first, according to Sergei Solovyov, a 57-year-old Lenin impersonator, aka “Tall Lenin.” Six Stalins and eight Lenins, mostly known by their nicknames, now work the square.\n“White Lenin” has a pale face; “Wooden Lenin” doesn’t say much; “Gay Lenin” stands with an impersonator of the poet Alexander Pushkin; “Drunk Lenin” likes a tipple.\nOther famous political figures, such as Tsar Nicholas II, Karl Marx and even a President Barack Obama , have come and gone. But the favorite Bolsheviks have staying power.\n“It’s hard work to be on your feet all day,” said Mr. Solovyov. “It’s also morally hard. People shout: ‘Burn in hell! What have you done with Russia?’”\nLike the Bolsheviks warring over ideological deviations, the impersonators have their internecine battles. They form temporary allegiances to share territory and earnings, while sniping behind each other’s backs about their rivals’ poor resemblance to their heroes.\nMr. Solovyov used to work with a Nicholas II, whose original was murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918. But the ersatz Romanov czar used to clash with police over where he stood, so Mr. Solovyov left him for a Stalin. “It was easier to work with Stalin,” he said.\nMr. Valiyev, a rotund man in a formal military jacket with a bushy mustache, was plying his trade on a sunny afternoon in late July outside Kazan Cathedral, torn down on the orders of his doppelganger some 80 years ago and rebuilt after the Soviet collapse. He was working the crowds along with a menagerie of impersonators that included another Stalin and a wannabe Putin in a suit and shades.\nA woman in a flowing dress impersonating Catherine the Great thrust her ample bosom toward male tourists. “Verrr arrre you frrrom?” she asked, placing a light hand on one man’s shoulder.\nNearby, a young Ivan the Terrible stood quietly, his fake beard slipping to reveal a poorly shaved face. “It’s my first day on the job,” he said.\nStanding much taller than the real Lenin, Mr. Solovyov started working here a decade ago after he trimmed his facial hair and both his wife and his boss at an auto repair shop told him he looked like the Bolshevik leader.\nNow semi-retired from his main job as a mechanic, he makes around 12,000 rubles a month working odd days. He recently doubled his price to 200 rubles per photo after the country’s currency crashed.\nMr. Solovyov sought to paper over the cracks in the look-alike fraternity.\n“We are Russians; we don’t fight,” he said.\nBut even the amiable Mr. Solovyov scoffed when asked about a competitor with a resemblance to Putin who stands nearby with two Russian flags planted in front of him.\n“That guy in the jacket? If you think that person is similar to Vladimir Vladimirovich,” he said, using Mr. Putin’s first name and patronymic, “then you are similar to Obama.”\nMr. Solovyov’s companion, a 56-year-old Armenian named Arsen who bears a passing resemblance to Stalin, said they were a team, not rivals. The Stalin-alike unleashed a torrent of good-natured invective when his comrade chided him for being drunk.\n“Arrest him and send him to the front!” he said, stumbling as he advanced in mock aggression.\nArsen, a taxi driver from a southwestern city who wouldn’t give his last name, said friends have called him Stalin for half his life. Three years ago, a different Lenin impersonator happened to be a passenger in his cab and told him: “Get your things. We’re going to Moscow.”\nThe body of the real Lenin lies in a mausoleum on Red Square a few hundred yards away. Some communists say the carefully preserved communist would be spinning in his grave at the impersonators’ behavior.\n“No one has the right to ape Lenin and Stalin!” said Sergei Malinkovich, the head of a radical communist group, in a statement last year.\nSome lawmakers say the impersonators are operating in a legal gray zone and should be obliged to purchase licenses for 1,000 rubles a month.\nMr. Solovyov, though, isn’t too worried. In capitalist Russia, this Lenin says he’s legit.\n“I pay my taxes,” he said. “I’m a private entrepreneur.”\nWrite to James Marson at james.marson@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/HC-GT900_Solovy_G_20150927171016.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-28T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T05:51:24.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
