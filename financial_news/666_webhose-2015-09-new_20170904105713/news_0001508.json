PUBLISHED: 16:29, Tue, Sep 29, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:06, Tue, Sep 29, 2015 GETTY Sainsbury's is giving drivers a nectar point boost in October \nUsually the supermarket only offers one point per litre, with the promotion giving customers 5p worth of points for every litre.There is no limit to the number of times a motorist can fill up, but the promotion will only run for one month.The promotion is just the latest move in the fuel price war between the big four supermarkets - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - who have been cutting prices since the summer. Data from the AA showed the average price of petrol fell back below 110p a litre yesterday for the first time since March, having been as high as at 117.28p in June.It means that petrol drivers typically saved £7.50 to fill up their tanks in the second quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2014.There are even some suggestions that the price of fuel could fall to as low as £1 a litre. Sainsbury's head of fuel Avishai Moor said: \"This is one of the biggest points giveaways we have ever done and will really boost our customers' Nectar balances in the run-up to Christmas.\"We know that fuel can be a big expense, so we are happy to be able to reward motorists in this way.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T20:24:28.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
