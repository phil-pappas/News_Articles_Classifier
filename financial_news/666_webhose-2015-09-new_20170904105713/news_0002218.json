MaxLinear (NYSE: MXL ), which makes chips for broadband communications, Pay TV and other telecom applications, recently posted a 62% jump in Q2 profit, ending a three-quarter stretch of declines, thanks to its April acquisition of Entropic Communications. Sales for the period nearly doubled to $70.8 million.\nThe stock is working on a consolidation with a potential buy point at 13.43. But it's thinly traded, with an average daily dollar volume of just over $7 million, which makes it risky.\nThe Carlsbad, Calif.-based company on Sept. 16 revised up its Q3 outlook, citing \"strength across our business .\" In response, Deutsche Bank reiterated its buy rating and said the improved forecast \"reinforces our belief in MXL's ability to benefit from the secular shift toward higher-channel-count cable data solutions.\"\n\nMaxLinear is expected to post a 209% profit increase for the full year, followed by a 16% increase in 2016.\nMaxLinear and Dycom Industries (NYSE: DY ) both have best-possible Composite Ratings of 99. That puts them atop the Telecom-Infrastructure industry, which has jumped 39 places in the past six weeks to No. 6 out of 197 as of Monday.\nDycom provides engineering, construction and other services to telecom companies in the U.S. and Canada.\nProfit has risen at a triple-digit pace the past two quarters, while sales growth has picked up for three straight quarters in part due to acquisitions.\nProfit for fiscal Q1, which ends in October, is expected to climb 69% to $1 a share. The result will include earnings from its Aug. 7 acquisition of Minnesota-based TelCom Construction.\nProfit for the fiscal year ending next July is forecast to rise 38% to $3.32 a share, followed by a 14% gain the following year. Dycom is 11% past a 70.90 buy point, out of buying range.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:30:18.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
