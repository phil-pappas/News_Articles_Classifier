Whatever has been offered is nothing new but a modified version of old schemes for the economically backward category.”\n“However, we will make our stand clear after discussing the scheme with members, workers and leaders of PAAS and the Patel community…Our agitation is on…As our demands are not mentioned in the special scheme, the agitation will not be either stopped or postponed,” he had said.\nGujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel has announced a special scheme with substantial fee waiver for students across communities. The ‘Mukhyamantri Yuva Swavlamban Yojana’ (Chief Minister’s Youth Self-Reliance Scheme) will benefit the students, irrespective of caste whose family income is not more than Rs 4.5 lakh per annum.\n 25, 2015 9:37 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T22:23:52.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
