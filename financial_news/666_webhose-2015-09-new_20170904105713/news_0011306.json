Share on twitter by Jamie Freed Qantas Airways could return another $1.5 billion to investors through share buybacks over the next two financial years before resuming dividend payments as a result of its improved financial position, according to broker UBS.\nThe airline last month announced plans to return $505 million, or 23Â¢ a share, to investors in November after it reported a $975 million pretax underlying profit .\nBut the carrier's financial position is forecast to improve even further in the current financial year, with UBS analyst Simon Mitchell forecasting it will report a record underlying pretax profit of $1.8 billion as a turnaround in the domestic market continues to show improving momentum.\nQantas on Tuesday said yields, or returns on fares, along with the percentage of seats filled on each aircraft improved for Qantas domestic and Jetstar domestic in the month of July. In the international division, more seats were filled, but yields fell. Overall, Qantas's capacity grew by 2.1 per cent and the percentage of seats filled rose to 82.4 per cent, up 1.6 percentage points from the same month last year.\nMr Mitchell said he expected a 3 per cent rise in unit revenue in the domestic market this year, but a contraction in the international market as Qantas and its competitors added capacity.\nAs a result of its stronger balance sheet, he expects Qantas will announce a $500 million buyback at its annual meeting in October or at the latest, at its half-year results in February, as well as a further $1 billion in FY17.\n\"This could still see gearing settle at two times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation versus the targeted three to four times,\" Mr Mitchell said. \"This could provide for a further $2 billion of surplus capital beyond our existing capital management assumptions.\"\nHe estimated each $500 million share buyback would be 6 per cent accretive to earnings per share and would take around six months to complete.\n Qantas does not have enough franking credits to pay out fully-franked dividends as a result of it reporting major bottom line losses in recent years.\nMr Mitchell expects it could take until FY18 before the carrier resumes dividend payments. The $505 million capital return already announced is structured to effectively reimburse shareholders for a 2009 equity raising, and as a result, tax payments by investors are not expected to be made until they sell their Qantas shares.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Jamie_Freed"], "published": "2015-09-01T08:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:29:39.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
