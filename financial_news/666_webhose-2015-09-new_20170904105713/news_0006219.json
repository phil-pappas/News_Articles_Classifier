Aria hotel. Electric violins. Strobe lights. Frank Bisignano takes the stage. A woman in silver leggings struts down the aisle. She’s delivering what the audience really came to see: a new system for accepting credit-card payments.\nThat November 2014 extravaganza was Bisignano all over: a heap of dazzle and a dash of self-promotion to make what could be boring fun. Now Bisignano, a 56-year-old who’s spent 30 years cleaning up messes at Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., faces what may be his biggest challenge yet: taking First Data Corp. public for Henry Kravis and George Roberts, co-founders of KKR & Co. It’s a tall order for the man colleagues call Wall Street’s Mr. Fix-It, especially with world financial markets in one of their most volatile runs in years. KKR took the payment-technology firm private in 2007 in a top-of-the-market purchase that loaded the company with $22 billion in debt. First Data’s finances are in better shape now, but it’s still debt-saddled, and revenue is growing slower than rivals.\n“He’s going to have a tough job convincing investors that First Data’s growth can be a lot faster than it is now,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. “The business is what it is. There’s only so much he can do to make it look better.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T05:34:43.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
