After all, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, a worker with a bachelor's degree or higher typically earns 79% more than someone with just a high school diploma. But not all college degrees are created equal. \"There are more opportunities for those with more education, but it's not just for any degree,\" says Joshua Wright, of Economic Modeling Specialists International (EMSI), a labor market research firm. \"It's really what you major in that makes a big difference.\" \nTo determine which majors typically come with the best hiring prospects and pay, we analyzed data for 128 popular college majors. We looked for courses of study that tend to lead to fat paychecksâ€”both right out of school and farther along your career path. We also sought out majors that are in high demand based on recent online job postings as well as long-term growth expectations for related occupations. \nOur top 10 majors present interested scholars with the best shots at success in the workplace, complete with generous incomes and an abundance of job opportunities. Check out the best college majors for a lucrative career. For each of the 128 college majors, compensation research firm PayScale provided median annual salaries for entry-level workers (with five years or less of work experience) and mid-career employees (with at least 10 years of experience).
