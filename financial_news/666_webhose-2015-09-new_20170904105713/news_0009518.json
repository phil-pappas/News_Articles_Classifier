Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Australian airstrikes inside Syria are expected within weeks as is a significant increase in the intake of refugees from the conflict , following deliberations on Tuesday night by the National Security Committee of Cabinet.\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott is expected to announce on Wednesday the extension of airstrikes by the Royal Australian Air Force from Iraq to Syria, as well as one-off plans to accept thousands more refugees from Syria.\nAs revealed by The Australian Financial Review, the extra refugees would be mainly from such religious minorities as Christians and Yazidis on the basis they are being persecuted the most and have the least chance of ever returning.\nAccording to sources, the National Security Committee discussed accepting as a one-off and on a permanent basis, at least an extra 10,000 refugees as already being called for by Labor which would be in addition to the nation's overall annual humanitarian intake of 13,750 people.\nA boy holds a sign in support of refugees in Sydney.

Getty Images The decision to ramp up the refugee intake has the full support of the opposition and the states, but has caused divisions within the federal Coalition.\nThe issue dominated Tuesday morning's party room meeting of Coalition MPs and views ranged from there should no expansion to the annual 13,750 quota, to letting in tens of thousands more.\nTensions were raised ahead of the meeting after conservative Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi found himself the subject of scorn for saying said Aylan Kurdi, the drowned Syrian toddler, was not a legitimate refugee, because he and his family had already fled to Turkey and were at no risk there.\nAnd government whip and Tasmanian Liberal MP Andrew Nikolic accused colleagues calling for Australia to expand it refugee intake were trying to \"out-compassion\" each other.\nWest Australian Luke Simpkins likened Australia's role to putting a bucket under a leaking roof and said it was more important the roof was fixed.\nQueensland Senator Ian Macdonald likened the situation to climate change and said Australia should only do its proportionate share.\nOthers, such as Tasmania's Brett Whitley, argued a compassionate line. He said Australia should do more, contending that the debate has changed \"and if we don't change with it, we'll be left looking reactionary\", a source said.\nMr Whitley was Quote: d as saying Australia \"needed to move with the heartbeat of our communities\" and even those who backed the Coalition in \"stopping the boats\" were \"now calling for us to more in relation to Syrian refugees\".\nNon-permanent solutions Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said European nations trumpeting their additional refugee intake, were not necessarily taking on permanent refugees, with the UK only handing out five-year visas and Germany processing rather than resettling 800,000.\nWhile Coalition frontbenchers such as Senator Eric Abetz have argued for Christian minorities to be prioritised, NSW Liberal Premier Mike Baird signalled he thought there should not be discrimination and \"everyone has the same value\".\nOne unnamed Liberal MP said outside the party room that Australia did not need any more \"Muslim men\".\nThe Coalition has been able to accept more Syrian refugees within the existing 137,450 quota in recent years because it has stopped the boats and freed up more places.\nIt has taken more than 3200 people from Syria in the past two financial years compared with 107 during Labor's final two years in power.\nIn a speech to Parliament on Monday night, Senator Bernardi attacked the Greens and others for citing the image of the dead Syrian boy as reason Australia and the world had to act.\n\"I find it a bit sanctimonious for [Greens leader Richard] Di Natale to bring in these emotive arguments, and particularly to characterise this as some sort of humanitarian mission by using the terrible image of that young boy who was picked up from the beach after having drowned at sea,\" Senator Bernardi said\n\"The facts remain that that terrible image was not brought about by recent events in Syria or Iraq. That boy and his family had lived in Turkey for three years.\n\"The money for that boy's father to pay the people smugglers was sent from Canada. The father sent them on that boat so the father could get dental treatment. They were in no fear, they were in no persecution and they were in no danger in Turkey.\"\nQueensland Liberal MP Ewen Jones, who has called for Australia to take as many as 50,000 refugees from the crisis , was openly scornful of his colleague.\n\"Do you really expect anything other than that from someone like Cory?\" he said.\nCabinet is expected to meet Wednesday morning the ratify the decisions of the NSC. The NSC was briefed via video link on Tuesday night by Immigration Minister Peter Dutton who was dispatched to Geneva on the weekend to discuss the issue with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n-with Primrose Riordan", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-08T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T17:28:17.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
