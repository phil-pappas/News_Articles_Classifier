Bloomberg Share on twitter by Amanda Saunders Ivan Glasenberg might be down, but such is the aura around the famous corporate raider and deal maker, no-one is prepared to count him out.\nWhile another tilt at Rio Tinto seems to be off the table following Glencore's announcement of a $US3.5 billion ($5 billion) capital raising and its promise to cut its debt by $US10 billion, not everyone believes big deals are beyond Glasenberg.\nAnd the newly minted South32 could be the target.\nGlencore is fighting to protect its investment grade credit rating, which is needed to support its trading business. Its rating, two notches above junk status, is threatened by a big pile of debt.\nThis means mergers and acquisitions will largely be sidelined as Glencore works to cut up to $US10 billion from its $US29.6 billion net debt pile in the next 18 months – a target it set on Monday under pressure from investors.\nBut Bernstein analyst Paul Gait says there is one deal Glencore might consider that could actually help with the task of deleveraging.\n\"South32 would be about the only one [acquisition] and it is just about possible. It would be a backdoor equity placement in essence and would de-gear Glencore,\" he said.\n\"The issue is the time to get it done and the premium you have to pay make it hard as a fix to immediate short-term problems. But as an aggressive move by Ivan, I am sure he has thought about it.\"\n Investor confidence in Glencore has been shaken in the three weeks since Glencore stressed at its interim results in that it was comfortable with its balance sheet, and failed to satisfy that is was managing leverage or debt.\nIn an embarrassing backflip, Glencore said on Monday it would raise up to $US2.5 billion in equity, suspend dividends for at least a year, sell $US2 billion in assets and make further cuts to capex and working capital, as part of a $US10.2 billion savings grab that will reduce debt to \"the low $US20 billions\" by the end of next year.\nPlan should appease debt holders It is also cutting at least 300,000 tonnes of high-cost copper production in order to boost the price, which Glencore is very exposed to. The copper price fell to a six-year low of $US4855 a tonne last month, despite many commentators predicting the price would rise this year.\nHowever, Goldman Sachs says the copper cuts may have had the significant affect on price that Glencore wants.\nWhile the move should boost short-term sentiment around the copper price – copper rose 0.6 per cent overnight to $US5148 a tonne – Goldman \"remain cautious as these mines were producing high up the cost curve and hence were not required by the market. As such, their temporary closure should not impact the price in a significant way\".\nBut analysts at both Deutsche Bank and Goldmans say while Glencore's plan is a positive and should appease debt holders and rating agencies, it's a short-term fix because at current spot prices the trading group is likely to find itself facing a credit downgrade again by late next year.\nWhile the debt target was \"a significant step in the right direction\", if the remaining business cannot service the $US20 billion debt, in about8-months Glencore may be back in its current position\", Goldmans said.\n\"The key uncertainty for investors is whether the revised portfolio of assets can adequately support the new lower net debt after these measures [asset sales, production and capex cuts].\"\nEven at net debt in the low $US20 billions, Deutsche analyst Rob Clifford says \"the balance sheet remains relatively stretched at spot prices for the medium term\".\nThe key question Glencore management still needs to answer is what the longer-term equity investment case for the company is over the other miners, he said.\nGlencore has been the most aggressive resources major on M&A post the boom, using it as its key growth strategy.\n'Battening down the hatches' \"You can't really be in a position of trying to fix your balance sheet, get your capex down and sell assets, and at the same time say you are actively pursuing an M&A agenda,\" Bernstein's Gait said but South32 was a possible exception. \"This is Glencore battening down the hatches.\"\nAs for Rio, that's \"definitely off the table for now\", he said.\nIf almost any other executive had put a merger of equals offer to bigger rival Rio Tinto, as Glasenberg did in July last year, most would have dismissed it. It was the $US60 billion float of Glencore in 2011, followed by the $US29 billion takeover of coal major Xstrata that turned Glasenberg into something of a hero in London.\nBut it is a very different picture 12 months after Glasenberg's Rio pitch.\nGlencore is trading at about 130 pence, less than a quarter of its listing price of 530 pence. It has only traded above its listing price for two hours, on the day it debuted.\nDeutsche's Clifford said the Glencore float was pitched on capital discipline, a stable marketing division, the ability to make opportunistic acquisitions and operate tough assets well. Four years on, it is the first of the major miners to raise equity in the current hostile environment.\nGait thinks Glasenberg's \"backflip\" may have cost him some of his mystique but his very strong reputation, particularly in London, \"remains intact\".\n\"Perhaps it humanises Ivan but it really depends what your expectations of him were.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mandaksaunders", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/glencore-forced-to-raise-us25b-suspends-dividend-20150907-gjgyze.html"], "published": "2015-09-08T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T16:04:14.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
