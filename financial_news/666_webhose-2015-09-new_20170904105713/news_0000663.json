Government-run companies in competitive sectors must seek more diversified ownership by selling stakes to state and non-state investors, the document showed.\nThe government also plans to create special investment vehicles to manage state-owned capital and may merge or restructure state companies, according to the document. They also will promote cross-shareholding and “blending” between state-owned capital and private investments.\nWith the world’s second-largest economy posting the slowest growth in a quarter century, China’s government branches will next start to map out detailed plans that potentially affect tens of thousands of companies with estimated assets of about $16 trillion. A quicker pace of reform may spur speculation over which ones will be reorganized, potentially fueling further volatility for stocks in Shanghai and Hong Kong.\nTwo Categories The new guidelines for state companies include splitting them into two main groups -- those that are commercially oriented, and others that are focused on not-for-profit operations, the document shows.\nChina has approved the basic SOE reform guidelines and seeks basic completion of the plan by 2020, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday.\nState-run companies have been a drag on economic growth. Their output slumped in July to the lowest level since December 2008, National Bureau of Statistics data show.\nSeparately, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission -- the agency overseeing the government’s companies -- said the reform guidelines will be released soon. SASAC didn’t reply to a faxed request for comment.\nCommunist Leadership Current state owned-asset supervisors should shift from managing individual enterprises to state-capital management, according to the proposal. As part of the reforms, one principle is to enhance leadership of the communist party in the state-owned enterprises.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. estimates there are more than 150,000 SOEs across the country, accounting for 17 percent of urban employment and almost 80 percent of the CSI 300 Index in China.\nThe last time China made a big push to reform its industries was in the 1990s under then-Premier Zhu Rongji. That drive resulted in more than 60,000 business closures and 30 million layoffs, according to JPMorgan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T12:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T08:18:25.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
