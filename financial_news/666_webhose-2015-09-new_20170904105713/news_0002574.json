In the first six months of 2015, the Russia-focused miner posted a 43.5% year-on-year decline in pre-tax profit to $16.6m (£10.88m), while revenue fell 8% to $130.7m (£85.2m). \nAs a result, the group slashed its interim dividend by 20% to 0.020p per share. \nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 13.4% year-on-year to $54.9m, driven higher by an increase in margin, which rose from 34% to 42%, and by the devaluation of the rouble. \nGold (Other OTC: GDCWF - news ) production increased 1% to 121, 242 ounces, while sales rose 2.3% to 119,277 ounces, but that was offset by a 10% year-on-year decline in the price of gold, which fell to $1,088 per ounce. \nHighland shares were down 3.15% to 53.75p at 1536 BST on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T19:15:30.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
