Daniel Munoz Share on twitter by Sue Mitchell When New Zealand food retailer Dave Chambers arrived in Sydney earlier this year to take the helm of Woolworths Supermarkets he was shocked by what he saw in stores.\nShelves were low on stock, the trolleys had seen better days, floors were in disrepair and customers were forced to queue at the checkouts.\n\"Customers were saying service wasn't good enough and availability wasn't good enough,\" recalls Chambers, who replaced Tjeerd Jegen​ as director of supermarkets in February.\nWoolworths had been reducing staff hours in a vain attempt to achieve its profit guidance and the lack of staff had taken a toll on on-shelf availability and checkout queues.\nAnd while Woolworths had been opening new stores at a record rate over the past few years, the number of store refurbishments had slowed and it was starting to show.\nCustomers were voting with their feet.\nChambers, the former managing director of Woolworths' Progressive Enterprises' supermarkets business in New Zealand, is getting back to basics to ensure customers choose Woolworths ahead of rivals Coles, Aldi, IGA and Costco .\n\"What we're after is having a great store every day for our customers,\" Chambers tells Fairfax Media in his first major interview since taking the role.\n \"We need to have stores in the right place, we need to have a great network looking forward, we have to have the right price and we have to have a great experience for the customer,\" he says.\n\"All those elements need to be working very well – this is the last piece,\" he says.\nIn moves reminiscent of the early days of the turnaround at Coles seven years ago, Woolworths is investing $65 million over the next 12 months upgrading its fleet of shopping trolleys, fixing rusty shelves and holes in floors, improving lighting and signage and removing gates to open up the front of its stores to make them appear more welcoming.\nThe retailer has increased labour in its 950-odd supermarkets by 56,000 staff hours a week and plans to add another 63,000 hours next year to improve on-shelf availability, especially in key areas such as fruit and vegetables and checkouts.\nAs part of changes implemented by Woolworths' new Food Group managing director, Brad Banducci, the retailer is surveying customers daily about their shopping experience, including on-shelf availability, fruit and vegetables, checkout queues, trolleys and baskets and staff attitude.\nCustomers' fast feedback The so-called \"voice of the customer\" results are available a day later, rather than weeks later, allowing store managers to take swift action to remedy problems.\nWhile same-store sales in the first few weeks of fiscal 2016 declined 0.9 per cent, in line with the drop in the June quarter, Chambers says customers have started to notice the improvements in stores and service.\n\"We are starting to do better on trolleys and baskets and staff attitude,\" Chambers says.\n\"Fruit and vegetables, queue time and out-of-stocks are the three [areas] we have the most opportunity in.\"\nStaff morale is also improving, he says, even if store managers have been forced to forgo bonuses.\n\"The enthusiasm of our team to focus on customers and be empowered to focus on customers has been rewarding,\" he says.\nWoolworths is also making greater use of data analytics from its Everyday Rewards loyalty program and half-owned research firm Quantium to improve store formats.\nConsistent with Woolworths' shift to a 'leaner\" business model, Chambers is considering replacing the nine store \"clusters\" or formats with four types of store – premium, mainstream, mainstream rural and budget – to better reflect demographic and geographic differences in shopping habits.\n\"We need to think about [how customers are shopping] not just today but where customers will be,\" Chambers says. \"We might see more value-oriented stores that have more space given to good products but in affluent communities more space given to best products.\"\nChambers, 52, has spent his entire career in food retailing, starting work when he was a high school student at Progressive Enterprises' Foodtown supermarket in Glenfield, Auckland, more than 30 years ago.\nHe is excited but undaunted by the challenge of restoring Woolworths' reputation as Australia's leading food retailer.\n\"To come to Australia and see the opportunities we have here to improve the business … we're still number one but to make sure we resonate as number one in customers' minds is really exciting,\" he says.\n\"In retail you don't get many opportunities to … take the market leader and re-establish the credentials in the mind of the customer.\"\nAnalysts believe Woolworths' same-store sales growth could move back into positive territory during 2016, as Woolworths will be lapping soft comparable store sales growth in 2015.\n\"We think it will not be long before Woolworths will be cycling soft, like-for-like sales, on which to be able to deliver some positive momentum,\" says Merrill Lynch analyst David Errington, who has a buy rating and $40 a share price target.\nHowever, the $65 million investment in stores and $500 million investment in grocery prices will come at a cost to margins.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath​, who has a sell rating and a $19 price target, said last week that Woolworths' food and liquor margins could fall from 7.8 per cent in 2015 to 5.5 per cent by 2020.", "external_links":
