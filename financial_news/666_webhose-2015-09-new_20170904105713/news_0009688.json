The hip, neighborhood-lifestyle brand can once again look forward to accompanying a longtime colleague along the next step of his career. \nDirk Lobowsky has been highly instrumental since 2007 for the success of the young hotel group. Most recently as Director of Sales for Germany and Austria, the Heidelberg native mainly shaped the German market for pentahotels. Before that, the 44-year-old father of two worked for many years at Queens Moat Houses Holding GmbH as National Account Manager for MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions). \n\"Dirk Lobowsky laid the cornerstone for a highly successful European-wide sales structure,\" says Alastair Thomann, Managing Director of pentahotels. \"With his know-how and commitment, he has contributed enormously to our positive results.\" \nThe pentahotels brand, introduced in Europe, is known for its design and neighborhood lifestyle, offering individual travelers comfort and ambiance in modern rooms. The pentalounge – a combination of lobby, reception area, bar, and café, designed as a lively meeting place for both hotel guests and locals – is a pentahotels trademark.
