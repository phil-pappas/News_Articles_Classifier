Cameron Spencer Share on twitter by Joanna Mather The main union for finance workers is headed for a meltdown after national secretary Fiona Jordan claimed her attempts to restructure the organisation have been sabotaged.\nMs Jordan was elected to the Finance Sector Union 13 months ago with a reformist agenda but has clashed with the union's national executive.\nIn an \"urgent message\" to members on Wednesday, Ms Jordan said the council interfered with the day-to-day running of the union.\nThis included countering staff appointments and terminations and replacing minutes of meetings she had circulated with their own amended versions.\nShe also accused the council of \"appointing their own sub-committees to investigate complaints made against themselves\".\nThey were planning to use use a national conference to \"promote a strategy paper to hijack my mandate as your elected leader\".\nUnions are structured such that she is effectively the chief executive and the national executive is her board.\n\"The truth is, attempts to change our union, to restore confidence in it, to pursue the agenda of making us a more professional organisation equipped to deliver on member needs, have been blocked,\" Ms Jordan said.\n \"The efforts have been deliberately undermined by a series of extraordinary actions designed to stymy change.\"\nThe national council is comprised of employee representatives from banks, credit unions and superannuation funds, along with the national assistant secretary, state secretaries and the national president.\nMs Jordan said the union had lost 8000 members since 2010. Upon being elected, she promised an audit of the union's finances and membership assessment.\n\"Many members of the current national executive were the same people who supported selling the union's key property asset for $17.45 million in November 2013 – a property now guesstimated by the same agency who sold the property to be worth north of $30 million,\" she wrote on Wednesday.\nThe FSU negotiates pay and conditions for workers across banking, insurance and finance. In late August, the union reached an in-principal agreement for pay rises for 30,000 employees of the Westpac Group.\n\"To be blunt, if we witnessed similar behaviour amongst finance employers we would rightly be taking action – and that's exactly what members need to do,\" Ms Jordan said.\n\"The question for you, as a member of the union, is whether you accept that your vote, your decision, can be simply disregarded by people with no mandate to do so.\"\nComment is being sought from members of the national executive.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather", "http://www.fsunion.org.au/News-Views/Urgent-message-from-your-National.aspx"], "published": "2015-09-09T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:17:04.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
