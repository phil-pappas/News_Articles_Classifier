An increase in commodity price would be beneficial for the company, which has been grappling with a fall of over 50% in oil prices since last summer. Such a drastic plunge in crude has triggered huge layoffs and budget cuts across the industry. EOG Resources too has cut its spending and lowered the number of drilling rigs to 15 from 50 in Jan 2015.\n\nThe breakeven price for oil producers differs according to geography.
