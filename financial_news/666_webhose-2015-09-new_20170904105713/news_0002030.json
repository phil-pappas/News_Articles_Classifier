Photo: Glenn Hunt\nJB Hi-Fi's loyal middle managers are proving to be a roadblock on the path to greater gender equity for the music and electronics retailer.\nDespite recruiting former Pacific Brands and Just Group executive Wai Tang to the board in August – a move which doubled the number of women on its six member board – JB Hi-Fi is still battling to increase the representation of women across its business.\nJust two of JB Hi-Fi's 24 senior management roles are filled by women, according to its 2015 annual report.\nNew JB Hi-Hi chief executive Richard Murray has helped cut the company's wages bill. Photo: Pat Scala\nThe percentage of female senior managers has gone backwards in the past three years, from 9.5 per cent in 2012 to 8 per cent by the end of fiscal 2015.\nAdvertisement This means JB Hi-Fi has failed to achieve two of its four self-imposed gender equity targets, which it set out in March 2012.\nAnd on the sales staff measure, it's only improved the representation of women by a meagre 1 per cent in three years.\nHowever, the group can finally report an improvement in the recruitment of women to regional and area manager roles. This has flatlined at zero since 2012 but it jumped to 9 per cent in the 12 months to 30 June.\nJB Hi-Fi points to the low turnover in middle management roles like regional managers as a major obstacle in its push to improve the number of women in the business.\nMale dominated \"In the context of an historically male-dominated consumer electronics industry (this) has posed challenges for achieving change in the short term,\" JB Hi-Fi said.\nIn response to these challenges the retailer says it has drawn up an action plan, including the creation of part time and flexible work practices and regular pay reviews to \"consider whether any gender-based disparity exists\".\nThe executive wage bill went backwards at JB HI-Fi in 2015, despite outgoing chief executive Terry Smart collecting a $1 million bonus on his way out the door .\nThe new JB Hi-Fi boss Richard Murray can take some credit for reducing the executive pay bill, which fell from almost $11 million in 2014 to $8 million for the 12 months to June 30 this year.\nMr Murray joined the electronics group in July 2014, along with chief financial officer Nick Wells and their remuneration packages are \"significantly lower than the packages for their predecessors.\"\nJB Hi-Fi has also made some alterations to its remuneration packages for this financial year, including the introduction of a share component to the short-term incentive\nTo start with, 10 per cent of the executive bonus will be paid in shares, held in escrow and JB HI-Fi plans to increase this \"deferred\" proportion over the next few years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T06:10:08.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
