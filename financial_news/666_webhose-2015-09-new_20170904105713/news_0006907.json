While doing so, he also promised that what other governments did not manage to do in 50 years, he will achieve in 50 months. Here are top 5 points raised by Narendra Modi in his speech:\n1. PM Narendra Modi: How to make the poor of India self-reliant, that must be our focus. Our efforts to remove poverty over the years have not yielded the results we desired. The speed (of removing poverty) needs to improve.\n2. PM Narendra Modi: Every person wants his or her child to lead a life better than what they led. Every person wants his or her child lead a life of dignity. I urge all of you (in this gathering), whatever circumstances are, ensure that your children receive education. Education is the best (and even the least expensive) way to fight poverty.\n3. PM Narendra Modi: Taking a swipe at the ‘garibi hatao’ campaign of Congress , Narendra Modi said, “Those who could not bring any real change in the lives of the poor or even open bank accounts for them during their five-decade rule were now questioning his government.”\n4. PM Narendra Modi: Enhancing skill development, one can earn better livelihood and bring a change in their life. Our thrust on skill development and the use of modern technology becomes important.\n5. PM Narendra Modi: I got a chance to speak to some of those who have been given e-rickshaws today. They have been imparted proper training to drive the vehicle, which they would own within a year or two after repaying loans that have been made available to them on low interest rates.\nFirst Published on September 18, 2015 3:21 pm © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T18:26:10.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
