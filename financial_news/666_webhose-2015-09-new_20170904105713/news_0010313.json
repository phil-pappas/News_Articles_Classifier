It is a similar story for Banco do Brasil 8.5% perps, which were being offered at around 96.00 today.\nOil company Petrobras's curve was also another 20bp wider on Friday, with the 2023s being Quote: d at a wide bid-offer spread of 640bp-605bp.\nElsewhere, Chilean copper giant Codelco was enjoying a rare rally amid what one trader thought was a short squeeze on its bonds. Its 2022s, for instance, were trading at a spread of 218bp over US Treasuries, marking a 26bp tightening since August 26.\nMeanwhile, the short-end of the Venezuela curve continued to catch a bid earlier this morning on rumors that the government was buying back debt on the cheap to reduce upcoming maturities.\nThe sovereign's 2016s were being Quote: d earlier today as high as 84.75-85.75, advancing another two points from Thursday's levels.
