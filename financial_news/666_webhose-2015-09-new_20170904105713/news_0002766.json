While it is legally permitted to rectify inadvertent errors in punching the orders, there were concerns that such modifications could be misused for manipulative activities in the market.\nThe probe also showed that the quantum of such modifications was much higher during March, compared to the other months, which hinted towards the tax evasion angle due to it being the last month of the fiscal.\n 20, 2015 12:53 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T02:05:06.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
