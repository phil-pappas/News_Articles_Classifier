They can volunteer their time. They can donate money to a charitable organization.\nOr, if they are especially passionate and ambitious, they can start a charity.\nBut passion and ambition are only part of the battle. Starting and running a nonprofit is a complicated business, and one that nonprofit experts say individuals all too often seriously underestimate—from raising money and choosing the right board members to filing paperwork correctly. Such shortcomings can lead to costly mistakes, ultimate failures, and sometimes even personal lawsuits against well-meaning but nevertheless unprepared philanthropists.\nHere are four common mistakes people make when they start a charity—and how to avoid them:\nThe Mistake: Not doing your research Desiree Adaway, a nonprofit consultant in Asheville, N.C., worked with a woman who wanted to start a charity to help “baby animals.” The woman’s intentions were good; she felt passionate about the animals and wanted to give back. But three similar charities already served the area, not to mention the national charities doing the same work. The woman also knew nothing about running a nonprofit.\nRunning a charity requires a lot of time and some specific skills, Ms. Adaway says. “You don’t get to play with the baby animals every day when you’re the executive director.”\nThe Fix: Find out if there are charities with similar missions and research them thoroughly before deciding there is always room for one more. There may not be a need for yours, says Ms. Adaway.\nBefore launching, get the kind of work and management experience you will need, and be aware of the time commitment that will be necessary. Volunteer at a similar organization, especially on critical tasks such as fundraising and event planning. Try to serve on a nonprofit board and speak to other nonprofit founders about the challenges they’ve faced, she says. Have a business plan and a mission statement for the charity, too.\nThe woman who thought about starting her own charity for animals decided in the end not to proceed, Ms. Adaway says, after she eventually realized that “passion for a cause isn’t enough.”\nThe Mistake: Underestimating the paperwork A lot of people don’t understand how much paperwork is required to start and run a nonprofit, says Rich Dietz, senior manager for digital fundraising at Abila, a software company for nonprofits and associations.\nTo gain official, tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, groups must register with state, and in some cases local, agencies, and the Internal Revenue Service, says the Austin-based Mr. Dietz. The IRS alone can take six to nine months. And until that status is official, it can be difficult to raise money, he says, since donors can’t be guaranteed that they’ll be able to write off their gifts.\nENLARGE Lack of proper insurance is another issue that can cause nightmares for the ill-prepared. Mr. Dietz recalls a startup charity that hosted a bicycle race in which a participant was seriously injured and the charity didn’t have proper insurance. The charity was sued. All the board members had to help pay the legal fees and had liens on their homes while the suit was pursued.\nThe Fix: “Proper planning,” Mr. Dietz says. Realize it may take much longer than you expect to receive the tax status you desire. Make sure that you’ve got the proper insurance right away and that you’re not cutting costs now that will cost you dearly in the long run. Keep good records to track where money is coming from and how it is being used to keep donors happy, he says.\nWhile waiting for 501(c)(3) status to be granted, Mr. Dietz adds, a startup charity can in some cases find another charity that will accept donations on its behalf until official status is granted.\nThe Mistake: Picking the wrong board members Many individuals choose relatives as board members for their charity startups, often just because it’s easy or because they think it would be fun to involve family.\nThis is a mistake, consultants say: Your relatives may have no interest in being involved in the charity, they may know nothing about the cause, and they may not be able to help raise funds. It can also pose a problem if the founder leaves the charity and the relatives don’t want to continue, says Ms. Adaway, the nonprofit consultant.\nThe Fix: Find board members with skills that can advance the organization. Attorneys, accountants and fundraisers can help a startup that may not have the funds to hire such experts, she says.\n“Make sure they have a real passion for your organization and understand they are the fiduciaries who steer the organization toward a sustainable future by adopting a sound, ethical and legal governance and financial management structure,” Ms. Adaway says.\nAll board members also should be expected to donate to the charity. “Many foundations won’t even make a grant to a nonprofit if all the board members aren’t giving,” she says.\nThe Mistake: Discounting the need for fundraising Many new organizations spend a majority of time on programming when they need to spend at least an equal amount of time raising money, says Suzanne Culhane, a fundraising consultant in Greenwich, Conn. Without proper fundraising there won’t be programs, she says.\n“They should have at least one year of operating funds in place before implementing programs,” Ms. Culhane says.\nMany also mistakenly target foundations as the major source for their funding, she says. “Individuals are the largest source of charitable contributions,” she says, citing a recent study by the Giving USA Foundation, a Chicago-based nonprofit.\nThe Fix: Startup nonprofits should cultivate a donor base starting with their own individual contacts, she says. They also need to understand the organizations they are competing with for donor dollars, and understand how those charities are funded. This knowledge will help them identify prospective donors and help them avoid untested fundraising strategies, Ms. Culhane says.\nMs. Dagher is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.
