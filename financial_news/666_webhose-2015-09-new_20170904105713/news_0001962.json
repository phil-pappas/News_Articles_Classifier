A disciplined approach towards smelter ramp-up in light of current market volatility, it said in a statement.\nThe ramp up of the first line of the 312 kilo tonne capacity at Jharsuguda will commence in the second quarter (July-September) this fiscal, it added.\nThe London-based minerals major further said the start up of additional pots is on hold and it is shutting down its rolling business at Balco.\nThe firm has also resorted to partial capacity reduction at its Lanjigarh Alumina refinery, it said in a presentation.\nTo deal with the current market conditions, Vedanta said it has resorted to “aggressive cost reduction drive through operational efficiency, workforce reduction, product mix optimisation, procurement and synergies across locations.”\nIt added that the industry body Aluminium Association of India is engaging with Indian government on increasing import duty in light of surging imports.\nVedanta said it will “…continue to focus on optimising assets, maintaining positive free cash flow and delivery of strategic priorities” through a “series of initiatives to reduce costs, maintain financial strength and complete debt refinancing well in advance.”\nLast month, Vedanta Aluminium said it had started the closure process of one of its production stream, which would lead to the Lanjigarh facility’s output declining to half and impacting up to 2,000 jobs.\nThe mining giant attributed the closure to the collapse in aluminium prices and lack of bauxite availability from Odisha.\nVedanta Resources’ Indian arm Vedanta Ltd last month also announced that aluminium prices globally had collapsed in the past few months and the current indications were that the trend would continue.\nAs per Aluminium Association of India data, in last three years, LME prices have come down by 35 per cent to USD 1,660 per tonne in June, 2015 from a peak of USD 2,555 a tonne in June 2011.\nShares of Vedanta Ltd today fell by 0.20 per cent to settle at Rs 99.65 apiece on the BSE.\n 10, 2015 10:21 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T12:46:42.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
