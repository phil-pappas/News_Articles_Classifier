Photo: Glenn Hunt\nWoolworths and its home improvement partner Lowe's Companies have injected another $90 million into their loss-making joint venture – the fourth capital injection this year – even though Woolworths has cut back spending on Masters stores.\nDocuments lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission this week show that the Hydrox Holdings joint venture issued 90 million new shares at $1 each – 60 million to Woolworths and 30 million to Lowe's – on August 28, the same day that Woolworths revealed that losses from home improvement jumped 33 per cent to $224.7 million in 2015 .\nLosses at Masters blew out from $176 million to $245 million, while profits at Home Timber and Hardware rebounded 198 per cent to $20.9 million, boosted by recent acquisitions.\nAnnual accounts lodged by Hydrox Holdings show that while revenues rose 22 per cent to $1.87 billion in 2015 as Woolworths opened new Masters stores, the cost of sales rose at a similar rate, and operating costs including administration and wages rose 24 per cent, leading to mounting losses.\nAdvertisement The joint venture has now lost $604 million over the last four years, prompting analysts and investors such as Magellan Financial Group founder Hamish Douglass to urge the Woolworths board to pull the plug .\nNo return on investment for many years Woolworths and Lowe's have invested $3.22 billion into the joint venture, up from $2.9 billion last year, but the pair are not expected to see a return on their investment for many years. Most analysts believe the business will not break even until 2020 at the earliest.\nHowever, Woolworths insists the chain has future and says it is a patient investor –pointing to the many years it waited for BIG W to become profitable.\nLast month Woolworths' outgoing chairman Ralph Waters defended the move into home improvement, saying Woolworths had the courage to invest in new growth businesses.\n\"I'm yet to be convinced there's not an opportunity here for this business,\" Mr Waters said. \"I suspect some years down the track this will be a thriving business, and people will look back and wonder what all the news was about.\"\nHome improvement managing director Matt Tyson, who took the helm in January last year, said a new Masters format was showing encouraging results, generating sales 30 per cent higher than the original format.\nMasters has nine stores trading under the new format, which features new north-south layouts and a wider range of kitchen and bathroom products, and hopes to retrofit about half its 58 stores by the end of 2016.\n\"It's early days, but I'm optimistic about the progress that's been made and I'm optimistic we can make a real difference in 2016,\" Mr Tyson told investors.\nHowever, analysts say sales per store would have to rise 50 per cent to 100 per cent before Masters stores broke even. Masters is generating sales of less than $20 million a store, compared with estimated operating costs of $26 million a store, so losses have increased as more stores have opened.\nEarlier this week hardware consultant Geoff Dart, a director of DGC Advisory, said accumulated losses could reach $1.3 billion by 2020 unless Masters radically changed its format.\n'Model doesn't work' \"I'm not anti-Masters but the model just won't work,\" said Mr Dart, who was accused by Woolworths of a \"dirty tricks\" campaign when he forecast in 2012 that the home improvement business could lose $151 million in 2013.\nMr Dart believes Masters should shrink its stores from 13,500 square metres to between 6000 and 8000 square metres, move out of garden and trade categories such as timber and tools, and focus on the $38 billion home decoration and lifestyle market, which includes products such as kitchens, flooring, window coverings, bathrooms and outdoor furniture, and services such as design and installation.\nUnlike the $46 billion home improvement market, which is dominated by Bunnings, there are no major national retail chains in the so-called \"finishing \" market.\n\"They could reach $1.5 billion to $2 billion in revenues and have a very profitable business,\" Mr Dart said.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/woolworths-confirms-gordon-cairns-as-new-chairman-profit-falls-125pc-20150826-gj8ofx", "http://www.afr.com/business/woolworths-urged-to-dump-lossmaking-masters-for-home-20150908-gjhmxi"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:45:21.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
