Britain’s involvement began last November when BT’s takeover talks with the owners of EE and O2 emerged , triggering a domino effect that continues today. Vodafone’s ongoing talks on asset swaps or other potential deals with Liberty Global (NasdaqGS: LBTYA - news ) , the owner of Virgin Media, is one such example. \nOne player in the UK market has remained on the sidelines as the complicated dances have been performed, however. TalkTalk, the value broadband operator, has failed to attract a buyer, despite what multiple industry sources say is the apparent willingness of Sir Charles Dunstone, its chairman and biggest shareholder, to sell. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) , as the market is transformed, a still-independent TalkTalk is facing major questions about how it can continue to compete against bigger rivals who are getting even bigger. \nMost immediately, the company’s status as the bargain broadband provider is under unprecedented threat as BT and Sky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) compete more intensely than ever before. As BT attacks the television market, where Sky makes its money, Sky (Amsterdam: BK8.AS - news ) is attacking the broadband market, where BT makes its money. \nThe result is that some price-conscious customers coming up for contract renewal are looking at Sky as a competitive alternative provider for the first time. Pleading with them to stay is a costly business for TalkTalk, or any telecoms company, as investors are well aware. The admission this summer from chief executive Baroness Harding that the company was seeing “quieter demand” helped precipitate a 15pc two-day slide in its share price , and analysts adjusted their forecasts accordingly. \nTalkTalk is not only caught in the crossfire of Sky’s heavy discounting of broadband, however. As highlighted by Jefferies analyst Jerry Dellis in a recent research note, its success in selling \"pay-lite\" television on top of broadband is facing a more direct attack. \nSky is now more confident that its internet streaming service, Now TV, which offers much the same content as a satellite subscription for less and without a lengthy contract, is not cannibalising its traditional pay-TV business. The company is therefore marketing more aggressively, targeting the price-conscious segment of the market that is TalkTalk’s stronghold. \nTalkTalk has a tightrope to walk through this period. On the one hand it needs to maintain its position and brand as the low-price operator, while on the other continuing progress towards its ambitious 2017 underlying profit margin target of 25pc. \nSo far, the company appears to believe it can pull it off, partly by raising prices in line with BT. Last week it announced its fourth rise in 18 months, including a 50pc rise in the headline cost of its Simply Broadband package to £7.50. Each turn of the screw makes customers more likely to shop around when their contract comes up for renewal, however. \nBut despite the recent dip in the share price, to date Sir Charles and Lady Harding have done a fine job anticipating the market. In fact, one senior executive of a company seen as a potential buyer of TalkTalk told me that their pushes into television and mobile have almost been too successful, inflating the company’s valuation beyond what a rational rival might pay for it. \nIn any case, more than any other player except BT itself, the value of TalkTalk is dependent on the outcome of Ofcom’s once-a-decade review, which is looking at whether to spin off BT’s network infrastructure. Until that question is resolved early next year, UK telecoms investors are flying blind to a significant extent. \nTalkTalk is of course campaigning for BT to be broken up, but has a decent plan B. Another option Ofcom is considering is more incentives for investment in rival infrastructure, which could offer the company an exciting route to an independent future. \nThe company’s new ultrafast network fibre-optic in York, a joint investment with Sky and based on a network backbone owned by CityFibre, is due to go live soon. Lady Harding has already courted City investors over financing similar infrastructure independent from BT in towns across the country; a regulatory boost from Ofcom’s review could help put cash on the table and turn TalkTalk into a long-term viable player able to maintain its challenger pricing. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) might not be the takeover payday the company has sought, but as Lady Harding has pointed out, consolidation is not always good for consumers. \n= Uber’s legal barriers are no brake = \nIf it turns out that Uber is never able to justify the $40bn (£26.2bn) valuation its investors have awarded it, at least lots of lawyers will have been made rich by the billions they have pumped into the taxi app. \nThe latest battle of the company’s never-ending legal world war is more risky than most; a California court has decided drivers can sue to be considered as employees rather than contractors . It raises the risk Uber will have to pay the costs employers face. Now, there are those who say Uber in its current form is basically regulatory arbitrage; a company able to undercut the opposition because it does not have to, or refuses to, pay the costs faced by its rivals. \nI tend to agree, but suspect that in the end, it will not matter. While the world scrambles to catch up, Uber is losing money fast to ingrain itself in users’ lives, Amazon-style. By the time it is brought to heel by the courts, rivals will have been crushed. And if there is one thing lawyers are good at, it is stalling for time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T01:16:10.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
