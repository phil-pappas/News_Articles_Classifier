He said higher debt levels would imply costs to society.\n\"Younger workers (and those who are yet to be born) have to pay the taxes to fund this extra debt issuance,\" he said, adding that \"balancing these gains versus losses is clearly a job for the fiscal authority, not for monetary policymakers like me.\"\n\"I am simply pointing to two key benefits associated with such an increase,\" Kocherlakota said, referring to more effective monetary policy and less risk of financial instability.
