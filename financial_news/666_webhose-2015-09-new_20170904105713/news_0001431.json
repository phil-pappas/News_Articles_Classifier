The trade body has warned that with so few new projects gaining approval, capital investment is expected to drop from £14.8bn last year to between £2bn and £4bn in each of the next three years. \nDecommissioning is already underway in more ageing fields in the North Sea. Royal Dutch Shell is planning the decommissioning of the Brent field. Four Brent platforms Alpha (Shenzhen: 002292.SZ - news ) , Bravo, Charlie and Delta have generated £20bn of tax revenue since they were brought into production in 1976. \n\"We expect around £54bn (in nominal terms) will be spent on decommissioning on the UKCS and anticipate it to be completed in the early 2060s. Decommissioning spend is expected to increase by over 50pc by 2019 and will overtake development spend in the same year,\" said Ms Legate. \nLower oil prices are forcing companies to review their operations around the world. New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) basins opening up in the Arctic and Brazil mean that the UK Government will have to provide more incentives to drillers to keep working in the North Sea.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T15:26:35.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
