Hardy has a 7-year-old son from a previous relationship. \nThe couple has yet to confirm the pregnancy, but Riley’s baby bump was on full display as they walked the bright blue carpet for the London premiere of his latest film, “Legend.” Also accompanying them was Hardy’s dog, a yellow lab mix named Woody. \nHardy and Riley met in 2009 while shooting a “Wuthering Heights” miniseries, reports the Los Angeles Times. The couple got engaged in 2010 and were married in the South of France in June last year. This is Hardy’s second marriage, as he was previously married to Sarah Ward from 1999 to 2004. \nRelated: ‘No Escape’ Movie: How Will It Boost Pierce Brosnan’s Net Worth and Owen Wilson’s Net Worth? Tom Hardy Net Worth: $15 Million \nTom Hardy’s net worth is $15 million, according to CelebrityNetWorth . The heartthrob got his big break in 2001 as Pfc. John Janovec on the TV mini-series “Band of Brothers.” Since then, he’s worked on dozens of big and small-screen projects, such as “Inception,” “The Dark Knight Rises” and “The Drop.” \nThis year has proven to be a busy one for Hardy. In addition to “Legend,” which hits theaters on Oct. 2, he has also starred in three other films, including “Child 44,” “Mad Max: Fury Road” and “London Road.” His next film, “The Revenant,” hits theaters Dec. 25. He’s also slated to star in the upcoming film “Mad Max: The Wasteland” and the TV miniseries “Taboo,” which will likely increase the actor’s net worth. ‘Legend’ Movie Trailer ‘James Bond’ Role Could Catapult Tom Hardy’s Net Worth \nHardy might also be a contender to fill Daniel Craig’s shoes as the next James Bond, reports Variety. Craig is expected to reprise his famous role for at least one more sequel following the upcoming “Spectre” but seems to be planning his exit strategy. \n“I have a life, and I’ve got to get on with it a bit,” Craig told Esquire . \nIf Hardy is selected for the role of James Bond, he could become one of the highest-paid actors in the business like Craig. “It sounds awful, but I’ve been left a wealthy man by doing this,” Craig said in his Esquire interview. “I can afford to live very comfortable … I’m very fortunate.” \nThe James Bond franchise is one of the most successful in film history with more than 20 movies and more than $6 billion in box office profits. The latest Bond film, “Skyfall,” grossed an impressive $1.1 billion worldwide. Craig reportedly earned at least $17 million for “Skyfall,” and Forbes reports the actor made a total of $27 million from June 2014 to June 2015. Can Tom Hardy Afford the Cost of Raising a 2nd Child? \nHardy probably won’t want to slow his work schedule down anytime soon, as the average cost of raising a child is more than $245,000, according to the most recent report from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). \nThis number doesn’t include inflation, and any costs after age 18 — including college tuition — are not included. When inflation is added in, the USDA expects the average cost to rise up to $304,000 per child. \nThe cost per child decreases as families have more children. Since the new baby will be Hardy’s second, his total costs might be less. But even if not, Hardy’s $15 million net worth will surely cover all of his child-related expenses and then some. \nShare This Article Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T23:06:47.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
