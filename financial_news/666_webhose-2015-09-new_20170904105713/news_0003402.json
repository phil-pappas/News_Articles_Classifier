We understand the intrinsic link between a healthy environment and human health,\" said Alex Gorsky, CEO of Johnson & Johnson, whose products range from bandages to pain relief capsules.\nRenewable energy sources such as the sun and wind result in no emissions of carbon dioxide, the key factor behind the planet's rising temperatures that scientists fear will cause worsening scarcities and disasters.\nThe Climate Group's initiative, dubbed RE100, does not set a deadline for companies to meet the goal or spell out consequences if they do not.\nEuropean firms in particular have faced legal requirements to curb emissions under the Kyoto Protocol, which the United States shunned.\nSeveral companies that joined the RE100 initiative have faced criticism for aspects of their businesses. \nWalmart is known for its hostility to labor unions but has been active on climate change, saying that environmental efforts are critical to maintaining low costs.\nWalmart has already set a goal of shifting entirely to renewables, which it says now supply about 24 percent of the retailer's electricity.\nThe Climate Group said that 36 major businesses now belong to the initiative.\nCompanies that previously joined include food giants Mars and Nestle, Ikea, H&M, electronics maker Philips and Indian software company Infosys.\nThe announcement comes on the heels of a study that found that institutions worth $2.6 trillion have renounced fossil fuels, sharply up from a year earlier.\nBut national plans submitted ahead of a year-end conference in Paris, which is aimed at drafting a new global climate agreement, show that the planet remains well off from a goal of limiting temperature rises to 2.0 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T12:13:28.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
