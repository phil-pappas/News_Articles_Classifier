It dropped by $1.99 a barrel earlier in the session.\nU.S. crude for October delivery dropped $1.49, or 3 percent, to $47.71 a barrel, after it settled up $3.98, or 8.8 percent in the previous session. It earlier dropped by $1.97 a barrel.\nInvestors will be watching key U.S. data, including oil stocks, manufacturing and vehicle sales figures, later on Tuesday to give further direction to prices.\nThat came after official data from China on Tuesday showed its manufacturing sector contracted at its fastest pace in three years in August, reinforcing concern over the health of the world’s second-largest economy.\nFirst Published on September 01, 2015 9:09 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:50:44.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
