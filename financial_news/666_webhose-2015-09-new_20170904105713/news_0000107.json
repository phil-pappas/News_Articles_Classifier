Rather than a small cut, at least a 50 bps reduction in Repo with a clear message to the banks to pass on the same, should be pushed,\" ASSOCHAM Secretary General Mr D S Rawat said. \nIndustrial production decreased 0.4 percent in August after increasing 0.9 per cent in July. \"Thus there is a strong case for a rate cut,\" the chamber said. \nIt said the RBI has been rather conservative and remained too much focused on inflation while growth in the industrial production, infrastructure and services is required for a real push to economy. \n\"The other area, which is highly job oriented is the merchandise export sector which remains in a shambles. The exporters must also be supported by a lower interest rate regime. As it is, the ASSOCHAM does not expect the exports to go beyond USD 268 billion in the current fiscal as against USD 310 billion. \nGoodReturns.in", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T13:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:21:14.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
