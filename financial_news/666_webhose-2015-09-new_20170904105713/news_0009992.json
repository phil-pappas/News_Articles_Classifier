On Valentine’s Day this year, Clar was turning left out of a plaza when another driver slammed into his car without warning.\nThe collision totaled his car and even though he survived it, he received multiple serious injuries. Due to the accident, he was left with several herniated and bulging disks in his neck and spine, his spinal cord was compressed and developed spinal stenosis which causes him severe pain every minute of the day.\nHis hip was rotated backwards and also damaged nerves in his right arm as a result of which he can’t bend, lift, reach, or even sit up for long periods of time. The accident has changed his life upside down and now he can’t work at any traditional job or live a normal life.\nBefore the accident, Clar used to participate in sports while studying for a BS in Holistic Medicine and Major in Alternative Health but after the incident, his life revolves around therapy sessions, visits to the Doctors and having more than 10 medications a day.\nHe has the support of their family but the treatment is too expensive for them to afford and they are running out of money. All the funding received from Indiegogo campaign will be utilized in his treatment and once it is over, he plans to start out a normal life.\nHe wishes to work as a freelancer on Ebay or Fiverr to earn his living and cover up the money spent treatment.\nHis situation is truly horrific and he has urged people to help in whatever manner they can. If not contribute, people can share the campaign on social media and spread through word of mouth. He is left with no other option but to seek help from masses and truly appreciates any kind of support received from people.\nPlease visit this page to donate and share.\nhttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-with-paying-medical-bills/x/11458565#/story\n ###", "external_links": ["https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-with-paying-medical-bills/x/11458565#/story"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T10:41:10.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
