Help you maximize your retirement savings and reach your financial goals by offering a free, personalized investment plan. \nEase of use (5/5): FutureAdvisor starts off by asking for your age, when you would like to retire, risk tolerance, marriage status and household income. Then, you link your investment account(s) to the app. Using that info, FutureAdvisor calculates what you're on track to have at retirement, as well as what you could have if you make some adjustments along the way. \nFeatures (3/5): FutureAdvisor breaks your portfolio into 9 steps to show what you're doing right and how you can improve. My analysis indicated that I was doing 3 things wrong and could have an additional $255,025 by age 65 if I diversified my portfolio better and minimized investment fees. \nIn addition to showing you where you're coming up short, the app offers advice on improving your portfolio. Not only did FutureAdvisor tell me I wasn't properly diversified, it showed me which sectors I was missing out on and provided stock trades that would improve my allocation. \nIf you want your portfolio to be actively managed, opt for FutureAdvisor Premium. It charges a flat annual management fee of 0.5% of assets directly managed. There are also other varying fees and tax considerations you can check out on FutureAdvisor's FAQ page . \nEffectiveness (3/5): This was my first time venturing into robo-advising , and it was a cool experience. I like getting a different view of my portfolio and seeing moves I can make to have a bigger nest egg once I call it quits. However, I was a little surprised by my portfolio analysis. My investments are skewed heavily toward stocks (balanced across sectors) -- a good thing for my age -- and the fund I invest in has an exceptionally low expense ratio. So I was a little skeptical of FutureAdvisor's analysis of my portfolio. \nValue (4/5): Even though I was skeptical of my portfolio analysis, it made me take a closer look at my retirement plan. FutureAdvisor's value is in its quick analysis of your portfolio and the steps it provides for you to fix them. If you're telling me I could have a quarter-million dollars more in retirement by making a few small changes to my portfolio, you have my attention. \nVerdict (15/20): FutureAdvisor is definitely worth a shot. Getting a new perspective on your portfolio could add thousands to your nest egg and maybe even help you retire a few years early. \nIf you're nervous about getting into investing, here are 6 reasons to get over your fears . \nRelated posts:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T00:18:05.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
