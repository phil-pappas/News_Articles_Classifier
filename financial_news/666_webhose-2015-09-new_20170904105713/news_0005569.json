Peter Rae \"Based on the amazing sales around here, and demand we have seen for unique apartments like ours, it's a great time now. Who knows what will happen in the future.\"\nThe Hills, who are upgrading to a house for their growing family, already have a few offers at the price guide of over $1.4 million through Ray White's Seaton Jones.\nTips for buyers Byron Rose of Sydney buyer's agent Rose & Jones said buyers in Potts Point should \"bid really strongly\".\n \"Potts Point has all the hallmarks of a great location and you are going to have a competitive market,\" he said.\n\"It's important to stamp your authority straight up that says 'I'm here and I'm going to buy'. That would create a psychological shift and send a message that you are going to stick with it and scare away others from the property.\"\nBut buyer's agent Simon Cohen of Cohen Handler cautioned buyers – particularly of first homes – at their first auction to bid calmly and research well.\n\"Sit back and let everyone else push the price up. Once the auction starts to wind down, then start to bid,\" he said.\n\"Don't get involved in bidding until you know the property is actually on the market. Stick to your limit. Make very quick, small bids. It makes the competition think you will keep on bidding until you get the property.\"\nLouis Fourie, head of buyer's advocacy Propell, said buyers should not only inspect properties numerous times before auction but go through contracts beforehand and prepare a 5 to 10 per cent buffer in their budget.\n\"In a fast-moving market, probably unlikely this weekend, you will need a buffer to manage a difference in valuation. The auction might go off, especially in areas where the rate is 100 per cent,\" he said.\nDingley a seller's market Dingley Village, near the Melbourne beachside suburbs of Mordialloc and Sandringham, is such an area, where buyers like Monique Wendler have already been knocked back before auction.\nMs Wendler put in a pre-auction bid of $880,000 on a weatherboard home on a big plot of land at 182 Spring Road, but Ray White's Dora Kambouris did not entertain the offer.\nDingley has become the gateway to the beaches for people who cannot afford top waterfront prices.\n\"I knew it was a bit cheeky since the Quote: was more than $850,000, but it gives me an idea where they would like it to land,\" she said.\n\"In this area today, it is definitely a seller's market. I bought a home in 2012. That was my market but this is definitely not.\"\nThe story was different in Sydney's middle and outer suburbs, where clearance rates have fallen more steeply.\nJittery vendors are accepting pre-auction offers, sometimes under the Quote: d price guide. In Port Hacking in Sydney's Sutherland shire, vendors accepted a $1.55 million offer on their four-bedroom home that had a price guide of $1.65 million.\n\"It would have been a terrible auction,\" Raine & Horne's Anthony Bouteris said.\n\"I told the owners, if we take this to auction, we'll only have one buyer turning up.\"\nCoogee and Bondi competitive Things were even more competitive in Sydney's Coogee and Bondi Junction. Desperate buyers got away with properties successfully before auction.\nRay White's Simon Platt sold two homes this week ahead of auction, with one, a three-bedroom weatherboard home in Botany, selling just seven days into the marketing campaign for $960,000.\n\"The buyer had missed on two previous auctions and had engaged a buyer's agent. He literally came in all guns blazing with a very strong offer,\" Mr Platt said.\nMcGrath's director of sales Matt Lahood predicts mixed results for Super Saturday.\n\"There will be normal bidding on most properties but some areas will be better than others. It's still a stable market, with interest rates the biggest driver,\" he said.\nMelbourne auctioneer John Bongiorno of Marshall White said a weak area for auctions in Melbourne is the under-$1 million, second-hand apartment market.\nFor those who miss out on Super Saturday, Michael Banks of property website LocalAgentFinder said it will not be the last big selling day, as property registrations on its site are already 40 per cent higher than in other spring seasons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:04:29.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
