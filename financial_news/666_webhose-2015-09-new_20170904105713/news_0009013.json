And Marley is one such name in the world of music. Created by his son Rohan Marley, the House of Marley aims to make good use of the good name and also give people access to top draw audio devices. The company launched in India some months back, and we are hearing only good things about the brand.\nFor Marley fans, Get Up Stand Up will ring more than a bell. It was one of the iconic songs from the master, one that became an anthem for many movements across the world. For the House of Marley, Get Up Stand Up might not be all that revolutionary. But it is the kind of revolution we should be seeing in technology, one that makes life simple for the users.\nThis is the simplest Bluetooth speaker you can encounter, at least in this price range. The controls are limited to power, volume and a Bluetooth pairing button. After all, isn’t that all you need? It is also the most sober, almost handsome, speakers I have seen in a while. There is a certain understated class when you use wood so effectively. Nothing can beat that. You can connect to the speakers wirelessly, also using auxiliary cables and even play music\ndirectly from a USB drive.\nHow good is the audio?\nGet Up Stand Up is meant to get a pride of place in your living room, or sit on a mantle in your bedroom, and fill the air with all the right notes. It is loud and can more than fill room, but the loud here is not a noisy kind of loud. It is the sort that makes you feel warm, cuddled. Almost like soul food.\nPersonally, I thought it was a bit too partial to bass. Almost going flat when I needed it to stand up. But my love for low bass is a personal choice that finds few bedfellows. As a ritual I started my review with a Bob Marley classic, Buffalo Soldier. It was as if this speaker was made to play Marley and his kind of music.\nEverything was near perfect, so much so you could feel the sea breeze of Caribbean brushing your hair. The wood so gives these speakers a natural sound.\nI also tried a lot of other genre of music from Carnatic to Country and AR Rahman to Reggae, and there were occasions where I felt my strong dislike for heavy bass crept into the mix. But no this speaker will not\ndisappoint many. I love it too, it’s just that I love my music to be a bit more sharp. And though I love the fact that there are no unnecessary controls, there is also nothing on the set to adjust the bass.\nShould you buy it?\nIf you love music and like to keep you style very woody, then the Get Up Stand Up is a great choice. It can\nreplace that old music system in your house and be much more classy than whatever its replacing. This is not cheap at over Rs 40,000, but it is worth every penny.\n** Estimated street price: Rs 39,990\n 10, 2015 12:05 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T20:13:07.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
