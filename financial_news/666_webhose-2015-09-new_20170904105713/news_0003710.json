Notes are now an even better way to write a longer post and share with anyone - whether it's a small group of friends or everyone on Facebook. \nWith this update, you can add a cover photo that represents what your note is all about. You can caption and resize photos, and format your text into headers, quotes or bullets. \nFor instance, you can recap your summer vacation or an important time in your life to update the people you care about. You can voice your opinion on something you saw in the news or write an open letter you want to share with the world. You can share a special recipe with a bulleted list of ingredients and photos of each step. \nFacebook has always been a place to share your thoughts with friends, and notes are a meaningful way for people to do that. For example, Jeff Nunokawa enjoys creative writing, and every day since 2007, he has written a note inspired by a different quote. With this update, Jeff has a better way of bringing his words to life and connecting with his friends on Facebook. \nYou'll be able to create these new notes on the web, and they're fully viewable on mobile. \nTo see notes your friends have written or write your own, visit Facebook.com/notes or search 'notes' on mobile.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T22:40:49.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
