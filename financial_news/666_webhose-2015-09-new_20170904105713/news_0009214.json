Bruce Rauner , a Republican, and the Democrat-controlled Legislature have not agreed on a state budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1. While much state money is being spent through state laws and court orders, without a budget there isn't authority to make other payments. \nWhite sent Rauner a letter last week outlining issues related to missed payments, including his concerns that utility companies might shut off service at the Capitol and other facilities. \nThat includes bills owed to computer and software contract vendors, utility companies, a trash pickup vendor and the armored truck company that picks up millions in cash each day from secretary of state facilities. White said many companies have threatened to shut off service — including the company that picks up state Capitol garbage — and end leases at other facilities statewide. In Illinois, the secretary of state oversees driver services, maintains state records and runs security and maintenance at the Capitol. \n\"Unfortunately, my office is getting to the point where our bills are no longer being paid, and this will directly impact office services to the people,\" White wrote in the letter. \"The situation has grown critical, and we are seeking a solution to this problem.\" \nRauner and White spoke last week, according to both offices. \nRauner spokeswoman Lyndsey Walters said in a Monday statement that there are similar operational issues throughout state government and the governor's office is willing to help find solutions. She didn't specify further. \n\"We hope he will also join us in encouraging his friends in the legislature to fulfill their constitutional obligation to pass a truly balanced budget,\" she said of White. \nOvertime legislative sessions on the budget have been ongoing in Springfield with little accomplished. Democrats want the first-term governor to agree to raise taxes to help close a multibillion-dollar deficit, but the governor has said he won't do so until legislators sign off on pro-business changes he wants. \nThis story has been corrected to show the first name of Rauner's spokeswoman is Lyndsey, not Lindsey. \nThink your friends should see this?
