In addition to this, he was sentenced to a further prison sentence of 12 months, suspended for five years on condition that he is not convicted of fraud during this period of suspension. He also has to perform 100 hours of community service at the SPCA on Saturday mornings. \n'Playground dare' \nFollowing Stoychev's guilty verdict, Outa's John Clarke, who describes himself as a law-abiding citizen, openly invited the South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) to charge him for refusing to pay e-tolls. \nOuta said the Stoychev verdict is seen by many as an attempt by Sanral to further intimidate Gauteng road users into acceptance of the e-toll scheme. However, in actual fact they have eroded the state's legitimacy to create good order in society, according to Outa. \nClarke said in the video that he openly invites Sanral to charge him for refusing to pay e-tolls. \n\"Sanral has amplified the prosecution of Stoychev in the media as much as possible. It may have been successful in extorting money from a hapless offender, but it was the result of a plea bargain. Sanral, therefore, still has to prove the lawfulness of e-tolls in court,\" said Clarke. \nIn response to Clarke's video challenge, spokesperson Vusi Mona told Fin24 that Sanral is not a law enforcement agency and that the SA Police Service or the National Prosecuting Authority would be better placed to respond \"to this playground dare\". \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T19:32:18.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
