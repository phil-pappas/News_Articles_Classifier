Share on twitter by Karen Maley How long will it be before Australia's property market feels a chill wind as Beijing moves to stop wealthy Chinese funnelling their savings offshore?\nThe question has become increasingly urgent in the wake of Beijing's surprise move last month to relax its grip on the Chinese currency, the yuan . Since then, the yuan has dropped by almost 5 per cent against the US dollar, with many experts tipping it will decline much further.\nBut the prospect of a further fall in the value of the Chinese yuan is only likely to spur wealthy Chinese investors to send money offshore , intensifying the downward pressure on the currency.\nWealthy Chinese, unnerved by the problems in the Chinese property market and erratic sharemarket, as well as Beijing's crackdown on corruption, have responded by sending a large portion of their savings offshore.\nA survey by the Financial Times suggests almost half of high net worth individuals in mainland China plan to invest more than 30 per cent of their assets overseas.\nJust under two-thirds of those surveyed said they planned to increase their overseas investments in the next two years. Most preferred \"safe\" investments such as property, even though prospective returns are low.\nAccording to the survey, the United States is the preferred destination, followed by Hong Kong, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.\nThis desire on the part of affluent Chinese to find offshore havens for their savings is only likely to increase as a result of Beijing's latest efforts to penalise individuals charged with disrupting the country's sharemarket.\n Beijing appears to have abandoned its efforts to use state-owned funds to prop up the sharemarket, which has fallen by almost 40 per cent since its peak in mid-June.\nInstead, it wants to reduce the information available to investors and is targeting people it blames for destabilising the market.\nJournalists and traders in firing line In a confession on state-owned television, Wang Xiaolu, a leading Chinese financial journalist at Caijing magazine, admitted causing \"panic and disorder\" in the sharemarket and to \"inflicting enormous losses on the country and its investors\".\nState-owned media also reported that four senior executives at investment bank Citic Securities had admitted insider trading.\nBeijing's policy of targeting financial journalists and traders is only likely to further erode confidence in China's shaky sharemarket and encourage even heavier capital outflows.\nLarge capital outflows from China put downward pressure on the yuan and this creates a problem because Beijing wants to stop the Chinese currency falling too steeply. In the past fortnight alone, Beijing has spent an estimated $US150 billion ($210 billion) propping up the yuan.\nOf course, China has plenty of firepower to support its currency in the form of a massive $US3.5 trillion in foreign currency reserves. The risk is that Beijing tires of running down its foreign currency reserves to support its currency.\nInstead, it could decide that a far easier means of supporting the currency is to clamp down on capital outflows. Because China doesn't have a completely open capital account, Chinese investors either need Beijing's blessing to move funds offshore or find ways around the restrictions by inflating the value of offshore invoices.\nBeijing's decision to stop using its foreign currency reserves to support the yuan and instead to clamp down on Chinese trying to funnel funds offshore would be consistent with its decision to stop using state-owned funds to support the markets and instead target journalists and traders.\nBut it would be a major setback, both for wealthy Chinese investors and those in countries such as Australia who are counting on a continued inflow of Chinese savings to buoy up inflated asset prices, particularly for property.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-09-01T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:29:24.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
