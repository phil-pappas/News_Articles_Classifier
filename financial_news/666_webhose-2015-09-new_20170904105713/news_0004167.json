In Kenya, 95 percent of the 4.5 million monthly active users did so via mobiles.\n\"Mobile is not a trend; it's the fastest adoption of disruptive technology in history of communication,\" said Nunu Ntshingila, Facebook's head of Africa, in a statement.\nSouth Africa has 12 million monthly active Facebook users, the data showed, and Facebook says with its strong advertising partnerships in Africa it would use the new office in Johannesburg to expand its business across the continent.\nFacebook said its active user population in Africa grew 20 percent to 120 million in June from 100 million in September last year. A large portion of these users were in North Africa.
