Here is how it works. \nFirst, the user downloads and executes the mobile banking application which communicates with the bank server. \nDuring transactions, the mobile application acquires disposable credit card numbers from the bank server, generates a wave file, plays the file to generate electrical current and then drives the magnetic card chip via an audio jack or Bluetooth \"With SafePay, disposable credit card information expires after a limited time or number of usages. \nSo, even if the information is leaked, it cannot be used for future transactions,\" the authors pointed out. Its has a magnetic credit card chip that makes it completely compatible with existing readers. \nIt also features a mobile banking application that automates the process making and makes it extremely user-friendly. \nCao and his colleagues conducted real-world experiments with the SafePay technology performing transactions with a vending machine, a gas station and a university coffee shop. \nIn all three scenarios, the SafePay method worked and the transactions were successful. The research is set to be presented at the IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security from September 28-30, in Florence, Italy. \nIANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T10:34:11.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
