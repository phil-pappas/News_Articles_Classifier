People's living standards will get better. Income will rise,\" he said.\n\"Luxury items may not sell all that well but we ... sell clothes that are made for all.\"\nThe Japanese company is expanding rapidly in China as it aims to become the world's biggest apparel retailer ahead of Zara-owner Inditex SA, Hennes & Mauritz AB (H&M) and Gap Inc by 2020.\nGrowth in the world's second biggest economy is expected to slow to its lowest pace in over 20 years in 2015 with sales growth in areas such as autos and luxury goods slowing markedly.\nWhen asked about the impact of the slowdown on the firm's business, Yanai said: \"Absolutely none.\"\nYanai has said Uniqlo aims to have 1,000 stores in Greater China in about five years -- more than its Japan total -- and eventually as many as 3,000.\nIt had 442 in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan as of end-May.
