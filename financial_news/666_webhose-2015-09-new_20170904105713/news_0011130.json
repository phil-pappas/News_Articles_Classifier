No, it's not your father's retirement planning experience, not for younger Americans who are increasingly distrustful of Wall Street and, in particular, financial advisors . A new report from Chicago-based Spectrem bears that notion out. According to Spectrem, a quarter of Millennials, those Americans born between 1981 and 1997, do not use a financial advisor to manage their long-term savings, and 40% say they will likely turn to a so-called \"robo-advisor\" in the near future. This, at a time when more than 60% of Millennials with less than $1 million in assets say they are concerned about having enough retirement income to live comfortably. That will be a challenge for financial planners and advisors looking to plug into the next generation of U.S. demographic wealth, where Americans between the ages of 21 and 31 will control $9 trillion in assets by 2018 and will inherit $36 trillion by 2061 . \"Millennials are the next great challenge for the financial provider industry, but they are a different breed of investor than the older generations,'' says George H. Walper Jr., president of Spectrem Group. \"Understanding how they built their wealth and their specific designs for what to do with their investable assets will benefit providers and advisors looking to create a new business relationship.\" That may be easier said than done, Millennials tell MainStreet . 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T16:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T17:34:48.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
