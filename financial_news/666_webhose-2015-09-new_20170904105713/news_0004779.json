The three universities are to share in $15 million from the Financial Markets Foundation for Children. Ben Rushton by Tim Dodd The Financial Markets Foundation for Children, chaired by Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens, has given $5 million each to two top universities – Sydney and UNSW – to fund new chairs in child health, following up on a similar $5 million gift to the University of Melbourne.\n\"We are confident that the world-class research at these universities will have a significant impact on child health,\" Mr Stevens said as he signed off on the donations in the RBA boardroom on Monday.\nThe $5 million donation to the University of Sydney fills a gap that remained after a 2010 gift of a $20 million Picasso painting, Jeune fille endormie , paid for several new chairs in the university's new Charles Perkins Centre, which brings together multi-disciplinary researchers to combat the growing incidence of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular problems.\nThe money from the financial markets will fill the missing link, a chair of translational childhood medicine to oversee an Australian-first project to apply big data techniques to a study of 10,000 children, which follows them and their families from conception into adulthood, looking for clues to identify the source of health problems.\nUniversity of Sydney chancellor, former QBE chair Belinda Hutchinson, said the donation was critical for the Charles Perkins Centre, which was \"about trying to solve the critical medical issues of today\".\nSharp rise in risk factors The centre said that one in four Australian children were overweight and warned of a sharp rise in diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk factors in young children, with new evidence pointing to poor diet and lack of physical activity by parents as contributing causes.\nUNSW will use its $5 million donation to found a chair of paediatric population health, which will investigate the factors influencing the health problems of disadvantaged children and look for ways to change them.\n UNSW chancellor, ANZ chairman David Gonski, welcomed the gift saying: \"Investing early on in future generations ... was the most equitable way of improving future outcomes across whole populations of children.\n\"The financial markets are often seen as hard, not giving. That's changed,\" he said.\nThe University of Melbourne has already used its $5 million gift to appoint David Coghill to its new chair of developmental mental health.\n'Real-world solutions' The founder of the Financial Markets Foundation for Children, Paul Robertson, said the three gifts went beyond theoretical research to deliver real-world solutions for child health.\nThe foundation was established 25 years ago and has funded more than 220 individual research projects in that period. But now it plans to fund a series of permanent university chairs and the three at Sydney, UNSW and Melbourne are the first.\nIn total, the foundation has donated more than $32 million to research into children's issues, more than $17 million to research projects plus $15 million to the three new chairs.\nIt's major fundraising event is the Financial Markets Ball, held annually in Melbourne, this year on November 20.\nThe foundation says it meets all administrative costs using volunteer time, meaning that every dollar donated is allocated to children's health and welfare.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T12:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:07:29.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
