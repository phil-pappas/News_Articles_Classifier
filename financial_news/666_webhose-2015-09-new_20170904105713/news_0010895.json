Orietta Gaspari Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jill Margo At the beach this summer there will be more to worry about than sharks and contaminated water.\nSand on recreational beaches has come under the microscope and has been found to be a potential source of illness.\nWhile we are used to monitoring sea water for unwanted microbes, there is a strong push now for sand to be monitored too â€“ particularly in the swash zone, the area between high and low tides.\nLate last year, an international panel of scientists recommended monitoring sand at recreational beaches. The recommendation was made at an international conference in Lisbon called \"Trends in Environmental Microbiology and Public Health\".\nNow their landmark study has just been published. It shows beach sand contains many microorganisms, including some harmful to human health.\nPublished in the Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, it is based on data from beaches in Britain, the United Kingdom, Portugal and the United States.\nPrevious research isolated the swash zone as a problem because it gets wet and dry, has seaweed, algae and sargassum and is prone to regrowth of disease-causing microbes, including unhealthy bacteria, viruses, nematode larva and eggs, yeasts and fungi.\n Since 2003, the World Health Organisation has recommended the sand be studied so the impact of swimmers' health can be monitored and surveillance strategies put in place. But so far no country has implemented this recommendation.\nThe new paper recommends studies to assess exposure to microbes in the sand by contact, ingestion and inhalation.\nIt wants indicators to determine the presence of sewage and human waste, tools to identify the sources of other pathogens, reliable collection methods and contamination standards agreed upon.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110990585086401178539/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/jillmargo1"], "published": "2015-09-01T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T03:09:08.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
