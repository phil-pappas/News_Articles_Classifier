Strategize a plan to defeat student loans now. Ever see those late-night commercials touting \"programs the government doesn't want you to know about?\" This pitch could almost apply to college loan repayment options.The Department of Education has several ways that federal loan borrowers can save money. But they do an awful job telling people about it.In a recent Government Accountability Office study , the agency found that even though some 51% of federal loan borrowers qualified for lower, income-based repayments, only 13% were participating through last year.Why don't the majority of graduates get this information? You have to dig deep through dense Department of Education (DE) Web sites and almost no counseling is provided to get you into the right program.Other than that, there are numerous programs available if you need to reduce your loan repayments.All told, more than 80% of those surveyed were in standard, non-income based repayment programs. These are the default modes of repayment the DE sticks you in when you start loan repayment.With more than 40 million holding some $1.2 trillion in student loans, this is essential information.Here's what you need to know. 1) There's a loan forgiveness program, but it's for those in non-profit public service. Covering mostly teachers, first responders and military personnel, the DE can wipe your loan balance clean if you meet certain requirements.Loan forgiveness, though, only applies to some 4 million borrowers who qualify and have been making payments. Despite advertisement for the \"Obama Loan Forgiveness\" program on the Internet -- there is no such thing -- the rules are very specific.Doing part-time charity work, for example, won't qualify. The program covers full-time workers. For more information, go here. 2) You can gauge your repayments based on income. This is the best part of the federal loan program that the government fails to communicate. If your income is low relative to your repayments, you can get a break.There are several forms of income-based repayment . One of them is called PAYE, which will gradually step up repayments as you earn more money.Let's say you graduated and your starting salary was not what you expected. Combined with living expenses, you can't afford the standard repayment plan.Ask the DE for a more favorable plan. There's paperwork involved, but it's worth the effort. Just keep in mind that you'll be stretching the loan out over a longer period of time; that will add to your interest payments. 3) You can get a temporary break from repayments. Let's say you want to go back and get another degree or you're unable to find a job right after graduation. The DE can grant you forbearance or deferment. This means that you don't have to pay right away, although you still have to pay back your loans at a later date. You're not getting off the hook.How do you get the ball rolling on these repayment plans? First check out the DE Websites. They are not user friendly, but will supply you basic information.Then contact your loan servicer. This is the company holding your loans and handling repayments. You can ask them at any time to change repayment plans and they have to do the paperwork.Although there have been thousands of complaints regarding poor loan servicing, stick with it. The federal program is fairly flexible -- once you get into it.Keep in mind, though, that none of this applies to private loans held directly from banks. For those loans, you'll need to contact them directly or exploring refinancing through other lenders.", "external_links": ["https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service", "https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven", "https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/deferment-forbearance", "http://www.finaid.org/loans/privateconsolidation.phtml", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B015NLA8BQ", "http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-15-663"], "published": "2015-09-25T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T15:13:44.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
