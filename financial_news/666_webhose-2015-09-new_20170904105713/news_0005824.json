At present, the minimum wage is between VND2.15m and VND3.1m per month. \nA spokesperson for the ILO in Vietnam said the wage will now be recommended to the Prime Minister and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vietnam to sign off. \nThe country's textile and apparel industry, however, has voiced concerns over the agreed rate, with the Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association calling for a lower increase of 6-7% given the “labour intensity” of the sector, which employs around 2.5m people. \nThe export turnover of the sector reached around US$24bn in 2014 and is expected to reach $27.5bn for fiscal 2015. \nThe Association argues that a 10% rise will increase total labour costs by over $23.2m, while insurance premiums will go up by $8.7m, and union fees by $530m, thereby reducing corporate profits. \nFigures from the group show that from 2010 to the present day, the minimum wage has increased from 2.15 to 2.3 times for FDI; from 2.95 to 3.16 times for domestic firms, and employer insurance from 18% in 2010 to 22% in 2014. \nThe Association has written to the country's Prime Minister recommending that the Government reduces the percentage of insurance payments, and reduces funding for trade unions by 10%, giving businesses more power to look after workers with regard to housing support and childcare, for example. \nA number of textile associations have voiced support for the Textile and Apparel Association, with Tran Phuong, chairman of the Phu Tho Textile and Garment Association, saying that wage growth should be \"voluntary\" so businesses don't lose competitiveness and an ability to reinvest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T08:42:13.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
