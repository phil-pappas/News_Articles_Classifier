That matched a median market forecast and followed flat growth in July.\nIt was the first decline since April 2013, when BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda launched his massive asset-buying programme, a sign his sweeping campaign has yet to reflate the economy enough to accelerate inflation toward his price target.\nThe data adds to a recent run of poor indicators that showed the world's third-largest economy struggling to emerge from a second-quarter contraction as China's slowdown and slow wage growth hurt exports and household spending.\n\"Further monetary easing is necessary sooner or later,\" said Junichi Makino, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. \"If so, there's not much point delaying it,\" he said, adding that he expects the BOJ to ease either next month or in April next year.\nCore consumer prices in Tokyo, available a month before the nationwide data, fell 0.2 percent in September from a year earlier, data showed, matching a median market forecast.\nJapan's economy shrank in April-June and some analysts warn of the chance of another contraction in the current quarter as fears over China's slowdown jolt markets.\nMany analysts expect prices to slide in coming months due largely to a renewed drop in oil costs. Kuroda has said the BOJ will look through the effect of the oil price rout and won't act as long as a steady economic recovery keeps prices in an uptrend.\nWith the recovery itself under threat, however, the BOJ is under pressure to expand monetary stimulus as early as next month, when it is set to cut its long-term economic and growth forecasts.\nA majority of economists surveyed by Reuters this month expect the BOJ's next policy move to be an expansion of stimulus. Twelve of 18 economists said further easing would likely come some time next year, while five said the central bank might ease at its Oct. 30 meeting.
