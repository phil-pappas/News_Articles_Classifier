In other words, a large portion of stocks bought this year would qualify for a taxable loss if sold now.\nAnd that is exactly what many mutual funds will do over the next two months, predicts Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors, an independent asset manager and investment advisor.\nSelling underperforming positions at the year-end isn't a new practice. It is referred to as “window dressing” when fund managers are unwilling to be caught holding unpopular stocks. Poor performance of stocks this year, however, might exacerbate both window dressing and tax-loss selling.\n“This year a lot of equity funds will have losses, whereas over the last four to five years, rising tides and low volatility ensured there were mostly steady gains,” Ogg said in an interview.\n“We booked taxable gains this year and already sold some of the stocks that did not perform well to offset those gains, and I suspect a lot of funds will do the same. This means that stocks that have been battered are likely to fall further,” Ogg said.\nAmong mutual funds, value-oriented funds and funds with heavy exposure to the energy and mining sectors are likely to execute tax-loss selling in the coming months, according to James Abate, chief investment strategist at Centre Asset Management.\n“Value funds who bought energy stocks at the beginning of the year are probably going to take advantage of tax-loss selling,” Abate said in an interview. But that selling pressure from those funds is unlikely to have big impact on broader markets, he said.\nHowever, it isn’t just the energy and materials sectors that are likely to fall more or see the most intense tax-loss-fueled selling.\n“While energy companies are the ones that are down a lot, there are companies like Michael Kors KORS, +1.07% Ralph Lauren RL, +1.95% or Yahoo YHOO, +1.40% that have fallen nearly 40% since the start of the year. Any fund that owns those will want to sell them for tax purposes,” Ogg said.\nIt’s unclear just what investors might do with the money they get from any tax-loss selling. They could keep much of it in cash, of course. Or they could buy other stocks, which could reduce the pressure on the overall market.\nAnd if the broader market stages a big rally over the next several weeks, there likely will be fewer opportunities for tax-loss harvesting.\nSince hitting a bottom in late August, the S&P 500 had recouped nearly half of the losses by midday Monday .\n“If markets rally strongly over the next few weeks, we are likely to see less impact from the unloading of so-called losers,” said Nick Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, a global brokerage company based in New York.\nAnd that is a big “if” given that the Federal Reserve sawed more uncertainty into the markets last week by choosing to leave its key borrowing rates unchanged. In recent days, three Fed officials have indicated they are on board for raising interest rates by the end of the year, although not all will have a vote at this year’s meetings.\n“Markets will trade sideways until we have a clearer sense about global growth. Volatility will remain higher as momentum from rally since end of August appears to have lost steam,” said Albert Brenner, director of asset allocation strategy at People’s United Wealth Management.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:26:04.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
