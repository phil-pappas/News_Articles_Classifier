The growing Information Technology sector has attracted a pool of migrant population which has led to the city becoming a robust rental market. And with the city offering a perfect blend of both traditional and modern housing options, Pune is attracting both families and bachelors. With the rental market burgeoning, there are several neighbourhoods in the city that offer homes at affordable prices. Below are a few localities that offer apartments for rent at economical prices. \nUndri \nUndri is said to be an active residential hub. Its rapid infrastructure developments and proximity to SP industry, Magarpatta and several IT hubs has attracted a pool of skilled and unskilled population from across the country. IT professionals from neighbouring IT Parks too have shifted their base here thus converting the area from an end user market to a region favourable for investors. And with migrants showing a keen interest in renting spaces here, second time home buyers and off shore investors are stocking up inventories and are offering endless housing options for rent at affordable prices. \n2 BHK apartments that are sized between 450 and 1,000 square feet can be rented at an average rent of INR 8,000. \nWagholi \nWagholi is a locality that has caught the eye of both builders and investors. The availability of land in large parcels has enticed many developers to enter the market, thereby creating an active residential hotspot. And with the locality being dotted with many affordable and mid-segment homes, home buyers are now flocking to this area. \nRentals here begin at a minimal of INR 5,000 per month for a smaller apartment that spreads over 500 square feet. 2 and 3 BHK homes that range over 1,000 square feet are cited to hover between a price band of INR 8,000 and INR 12,000 per month. \nWadgaon Sheri \nIn the recent past, this area has caught the eye of many property developers. Cited to be an upcoming residential and commercial hub, the locality is home to several IT companies. The presence of many educational institutions and health care units has lured several families and retired personnel to shift base here. \nUrban population here is showing a keen interest in renting spaces, thus making the realty market a haven for many second time home buyers and investors. 1 and 2 BHK apartments in Wadagon Sheri are expected to generate rental yields anywhere between INR 8,000 and INR 10,000 per month. \nNidhi C Thacker for IndiaProperty.com \nImage: By Tushar (Own work) [CC BY-SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons \nBy: indiaproperty.com Don't have an account yet? - Register now Ask the Experts Get your Personal Finance queries answered Select Topic Taxation Q Interest rates are going to go down.
