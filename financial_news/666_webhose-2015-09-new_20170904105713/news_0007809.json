This was a rise of 403,000 bpd (barrels per day) compared to the prior week’s average.\nThe rise in refinery inputs caused the refinery utilization rate for the week of September 11 to rise to 93.1%. This was 2.2 percentage points more than the 90.9% utilization rate in the previous week ended September 4.\n\nCompared to last year, the current refinery input levels are ~1.3% higher. The four-week average refinery input of 16.418 MMbpd to September 11 was almost the same level as last year at ~16.402 MMbpd. The four-week average fell ~0.4% week-over-week. Looking at four-week averages gives you a smoother view of the trend for what’s otherwise a volatile number week-over-week.\nWhat this means The uptick in refinery inputs, as discussed in part 1, is likely because refineries are possibly looking to capture higher refinery margins, given the lower price of crude oil, which is a cost to these refiners. Higher crude oil inputs indicates that refiners like Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Valero Energy (VLO) as well as refining MLPs like Calumet Specialty Products Partners (CLMT) and CVR Refining (CVRR) are increasing throughputs due to the current crude oil and refined product price environment.\nMPC and VLO make up 5.5% of the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE).\nSo the rise in refinery inputs, or demand, was a major reason for the crude oil inventory decline. Supply, mainly in the form of imports, also declined for the week. Read part two of this series for more on this.\nThe surprise inventory drop caused a 5.7% increase in WTI crude oil prices on Wednesday, September 16. Later in this series, we’ll look at other reasons for the rise in WTI crude oil.\nYou can follow our weekly recap of crude oil prices on Market Realist’s Energy and Power page.\nRefinery demand Refineries are the main source of crude oil demand. Refinery input levels affect crude oil inventory draws and builds. Refining throughputs affect inventory levels not only for crude oil but also for refined products like gasoline and distillates. We’ll discuss the inventory levels for these products later in this series.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Drop in US Crude Oil Inventories Fuels WTI Prices Part 2 - US Crude Oil Production and Imports Down: Good for WTI Part 4 - Why Cushing Inventories Helped Wednesday’s Rally of WTI Prices Oil, Gas, & Consumable Fuels", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T06:08:22.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
