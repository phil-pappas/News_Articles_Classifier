Many in the market say this unfairly focused regulatory attention purely on the sell-side rather than customers as well.\nNew York Federal Reserve official Simon Potter stressed the code aimed to provide guidance to all parts of the market, including central banks, that are key players.\nThe officials said the code would need to keep pace with a market whose structure has shifted towards high-speed, computer driven trading from the traditional transactions between banks over the telephone.\n\"This is an entirely different market than it was five or six years ago, when (bank) dealers were the only ones making prices,\" said David Pluth, chief executive of CLS, which processes almost all spot forex trades.\nDebelle said the biggest challenge was to devise ways of making banks and other participants stick to the new code.\nCritics have said the measures taken by regulators to date fail to go far enough in changing the structure of the forex market and the culture on trading floors that led to the scandals.\nThe code won't have the status of formal, binding regulation and it will be up to governments how it could be enforced.\nBritain has already made rigging of currency and other market benchmarks a criminal offence, and the European Union is also bringing in tougher punishments for market manipulation.
