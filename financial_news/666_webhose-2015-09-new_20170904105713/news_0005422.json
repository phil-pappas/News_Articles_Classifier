The devaluation of Chinese Yuan has further created a dent in the competitiveness of Indian exports,” it said.\nIt said the exports to European destinations like the UK, Italy and Turkey too recorded negative growth during August.\nThe government’s decision to give protection to the domestic steel manufacturers by way of safeguard duty too has impacted the user industries and thereby exports, it added.\nEngineering exports are the largest contributor to India’s overall outbound shipments.\n 22, 2015 10:06 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T04:36:42.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
