At least 324 flights had to be cancelled. \nSeveral airlines operating in the South American country, including LATAM, Air France (Paris: FR 31122 - news ) and Sky Airlines, had contacted affected clients to reschedule their departures free of charge. \nBut hundreds of passengers were stranded at the international airport in Santiago, the country's main hub. \n\"They told us to come three hours before our flight despite the strike, and now they tell us we'll have to change,\" said Nori Carrillo, whose flight to Colombia was cancelled. \n\"The problem is, people have hotel reservations at our destinations, and no one is taking responsibility for that.\" \nWhile many passengers were upset at the inconvenience, there were no incidents reported at any airport, officials said. \nLabor Minister Ximena Rincon condemned the strike as \"illegal,\" saying the workers were public employees. \nThe action was due to end at midnight (0300 GMT Wednesday) with flights expected to resume at that time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T06:46:28.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
