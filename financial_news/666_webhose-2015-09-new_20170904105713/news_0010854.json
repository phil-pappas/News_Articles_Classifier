As the owner of an SEO driven agency, my personal focus will be on high-level topics that offer effective solutions and actionable tactics that can be applied in the more immediate future. \nTom Anthony’s “Five Fundamental Changes in Search” peeks my interest. With some of the drastic changes we’ve recently experienced with regards to search, going back to the basics of what’s fundamental can be a huge benefit. \nSpeaking of recent changes (or shake ups rather) it’s inevitable that Google’s recent algorithm shift toward the tailoring of search to the mobile consumer will be addressed in multiple speaker presentations, but Cindy Krum’s “Mobile-first SEO and How to Prepare for the Next Mobilegeddon” looks to provide a course of action that will keep us proactive and better prepared for these types of changes in the future. I'll be taking solid notes on this one! \nContent presentation topics never fail to glimmer and catch my attention. Joanna Lord’s, “The Future of Content Creation” aims to cover past and present approaches that worked, didn’t work, and even bring to light not only some new ideas, but also talk about other practices that may be making comeback. Hmmm? \nIt’s a given that Moz’s Rand Fishkin will provide some extremely insightful information we’re all anxious to see with his presentation on “Search Ranking Factors in 2015: What Data, Opinions and Testing Reveal.” \nWhile I’ve highlighted the above four topics, that doesn’t negate my interest to see and hear all of the speakers at SearchLove San Diego. \nThe event will be a focused collective of digital marketing at its most valuable. IMHO, it’s absolutely worth the investment! \nSome Tips for Attending SearchLove San Diego \nHave at least two members from your team attend, if possible. Why? You can both share in the note taking over the two day span of the conference. Also, one can focus more keenly on connecting live with social media while the other can listen, take notes, and perhaps live blog. \nRemember to bring boost packs for back-up battery life, power chords, fully charged devices, business cards, and maybe a small snack. \nIf you’re planning to live tweet or ‘gram, make sure you follow the speakers and their associated businesses at the event so you can tag them and make connections. \nLastly, make note of the event hashtags! #SearchLove \nI’ll be live tweeting at the event so please make sure to connect with me on Twitter @Julienbrandt \nLook forward to seeing you all there!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T23:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T00:11:10.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
