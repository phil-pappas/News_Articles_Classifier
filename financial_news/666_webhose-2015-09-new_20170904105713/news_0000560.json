According to the terms of the agreement, Rentrak shareholders will receive 1.15 shares of comScore for each Rentrak share held at the close of the transaction. At least one Wall Street analyst has placed a price target of Rentrak at $100 per share, and the median target of analysts is over $73 per share, significantly more than the comScore offer price. Rentrak has traded for more than $87/share this past year. \nThe national securities firmâ€™s investigation seeks to determine whether Rentrak and its Board breached their fiduciary duties by engaging in self-dealing, failing to maximize the value of the Company, failing to disclose all material benefits and costs, and failing to obtain the best possible consideration for the shareholders. The Kendall Law Group is investigating whether Rentrak shareholders have the option to file a lawsuit to ensure the board of directors obtains the best possible price for shareholders and the disclosure of material information. \nIf you currently own shares of Rentrak and want to know more about your rights, you are encouraged to contact Jamie McKey at the Kendall Law Group at 877-744-3728 or by email at jmckey@kendalllawgroup.com to learn more about your rights as a shareholder. There is no cost or obligation to you.

The firm has been counsel in numerous merger and acquisition cases nationwide, including some of the largest transactions in the United States. \n\nView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150930006327/en/ \nCompany Legal & Law Matters Joe Kendall Contact: Kendall Law Group LLP\nJamie McKey, 214-744-3000\n877-744-3728 Toll Free\n214-744-3015 Facsimile\njmckey@kendalllawgroup.com \nwww.kendalllawgroup.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:42:38.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
