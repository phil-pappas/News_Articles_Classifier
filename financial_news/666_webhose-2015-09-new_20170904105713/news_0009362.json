Photo: Gabriele Charotte\nWestpac Banking Corp's decision to take restructuring costs \"below-the-line\" at its upcoming full year results has disappointed analysts who fear they may be recurring rather than one-off costs, while the bank's 15 per cent return-on-equity target has been greeted with scepticism given regulatory imposts being piled upon the sector.\nWestpac shares bounced back on Tuesday morning to be trading up 1.6 per cent at $30.29 at midday in a stronger banking sector, after they lost 0.5 per cent on Monday following the bank's strategy update.\nWestpac said on Monday it would lift investment spending by 20 per cent to $1.3 billion with most of this to be deployed towards technology . However, it also flagged that higher advance expenses would be partly offset by below-the-line restructuring charges in the full 2015 and 2016 years, which have not yet been quantified.\nSignificant item restructuring provisions charge the costs of restructuring to the balance sheet, which means they do not impact on cash profit. While this is appropriate for one-offs, analysts will throw up red flags if they believe the restructuring costs might be ongoing. This could potentially be the case for Westpac, some analysts have suggested, as it slowly reduces the size of its branch network and workforce over time as it drives productivity by the application of technology, the big theme of Monday's briefing .\nAdvertisement As Credit Suisse analyst Jarrod Martin noted, making a provision that is recurrent rather than a one-off creates a risk that \"cost growth re-accelerates after the restructuring provision is exhausted, because the recurrent costs continue after the provision is gone\".\nUBS analyst Jonathan Mott described Westpac's accounting treatment of the restructuring costs as a \"throw back to the 1990s\", when Westpac and other banks were criticised for boosting headline profit figures by recognising restructuring expenses as abnormal items. Back in 1998, Westpac met criticism for taking a $51 million abnormal charge after the overhaul of its branch network. The other big three banks were also put under the spotlight for putting restructuring costs into abnormals to lift reported profits.\n\"Although numbers are yet to be finalised, we are disappointed by this decision,\" Mr Mott wrote.\n \"While write-offs may support earnings for a few years, history shows expenses have a habit of bouncing back. Westpac has a track record of relatively conservative accounting. As a result, its decision to use below-the-line restructuring charges and write-offs is a concern, in our view.\"\nDeutsche Bank analyst Andrew Triggs said he was disappointed by the writedown of asset balances below-the-line although it remains to be seen how material the impact is. \"This would be disappointing, albeit we do not know the quantum of this and it may only be a modest tailwind to expense growth if useful life assumptions are also reduced,\" he said.\nAnalysts have attempted to estimate the size of the provision which might be made at the full year result. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Andrew Hill said assuming Westpac takes a software impairment charge in line with previous large scale charges – such as those made by ANZ in the second half of 2012 and National Australia Bank in the second half of 2014 – the write-down could be $325 million. Based on the four-year software life implied by the bank's recent disclosures, this impairment charge would produce an $81 million amortisation cost saving, he said – which \"would largely neutralise the cost impact of increased investment\".\nAs analysts including Mr Mott and Mr Martin probed Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer on Monday at the briefing over the accounting treatment, Mr Hartzer assured them there is nothing tricky about the policy.\n\"We are not a bank that has tried to play a lot of games with our PNL and we are not about to start,\" he said.\nROE target merely aspirational Analysts also thought the decision by Westpac to maintain a target for ROE of \"above 15 per cent\" was ambitious. Citi analyst Craig Williams described it as an \"aspirational target\" given the \"world of falling bank leverage and persistent low rates\".\nUBS's Mr Mott said the ROE target of 15 per cent was \"highly unlikely going forward\" and suggested a more realistic range is between 13 per cent and 14 per cent given the demands of regulators to hold more capital.\nMr Mott also said the plan to win 1 million new customers was an \"ambitious target\". Nevertheless, he retained a buy recommendation on Westpac and has a $37 price target on the stock. He said the $1.3 billion of investment was \"logical given the impact of technological change on the banking industry\" and suggested that this should be considered as \"staying in business capex\" rather than investment.\nOther analysts failed to get excited about the briefing and suggested Westpac needed to go harder on costs than the 2 per cent to 3 per cent cost growth cap they imposed.\n\"Westpac doesn't appear likely to become the productivity story in the sector that many investors had anticipated,\" Mr Williams said.\nJP Morgan's Scott Manning described the update it as \"a missed opportunity to remove significant cost from the duplicated structures still embedded some six years after the St George merger\" and said the new targets as \"short of what we believe is possible\". Yet he kept an outperform rating on the stock based on the discount it is trading on compared with Commonwealth Bank.\nGoldman Sachs analyst Andrew Lyons said there were no major surprises in the update and while expense growth targets are below current forecasts, he is awaiting further detail around the magnitude of any restructuring costs in FY15 and FY16 before reassessing his numbers.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/hartzer-to-slim-down-a-highertech-westpac-20150907-gjguqh"], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T08:53:55.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
