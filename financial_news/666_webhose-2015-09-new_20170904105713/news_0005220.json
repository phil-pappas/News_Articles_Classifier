Alex Ellinghausen by Jonathan Barrett The new Minister for Social Services, Western Australian MP Christian Porter, has played down his own leadership aspirations following his rapid and remarkable rise in politics .\nThe former state prosecutor entered state politics in 2008, and it took just four years for him to become the second most powerful politician in Western Australia after obtaining roles of treasurer and attorney-general.\nHe resigned state politics in 2012, despite being widely regarded as the premier-in-waiting, to contest – and win – the safe federal Liberal seat of Pearce.\nMr Porter, aged 45, said on Monday that recent events showed that being Prime Minister was not for the faint-hearted. \"It's not something any normal human being would wish upon themselves,\" Mr Porter told ABC radio on Monday. \"I've got no ambition other than to keep my head above water and do the best I can.\"\nMr Porter's father, Charles \"Chilla\" Porter, was a former Olympian and long-time director of the WA Liberal Party. His grandfather, also named Charles, set up the Queensland party branch as directed by former Prime Minister Robert Menzies.\nMr Porter has previously described himself as a market liberal, social individualist, a legal conservative and a federalist.\nIn Western Australia he earned a reputation for writing most of his own speeches, and tends to include a few jokes in any address.\nProfessor John Phillimore , from the John Curtin Institute of Public Policy, said Mr Porter's analytical and forensic approach to politics reminded him more of former NSW Premier Bob Carr, than campaigners like former Liberal leader John Hewson and former Prime Minister Paul Keating.\n \"Christian sees himself as an intellectual,\" Mr Phillimore said. \"He puts a lot of analysis and effort into his speeches. He takes a lawyer-like analytical and forensic approach to politics, rather than being an evangelist.\"\nMr Phillimore said Mr Porter had eschewed the chance to become the state Liberal leader; and so it was not clear whether the public would embrace him if he were to become party leader in the future.\nMr Porter has several degrees including a masters in political theory from the London School of Economics.\nThe former parliamentary secretary to Tony Abbott was sworn in as Social Services Minister in Canberra on Monday . His wife is due to give birth to their first child this week.\nMr Porter is one of six West Australian politicians that is a minister in the Turnbull-led government. They include Julie Bishop (foreign minister), Mathias Cormann (finance), Michaelia Cash (employment and women), Michael Keenan (justice) and Ken Wyatt (assistant health).", "external_links": ["http://oasisapps.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/J.Phillimore"], "published": "2015-09-21T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:50:23.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
