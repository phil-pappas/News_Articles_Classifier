Brendan Esposito Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires Uncertainty has been one of the key drivers of the recent global market turmoil, but there are stocks that are poised to thrive in this environment, Macquarie Securities says.\n\"Both volatility and uncertainty began to rear their heads in mid-June, when the Chinese stock market bubble unofficially burst,\" Macquarie head of Australian quantitative research John Conomos said.\n\"The VIX [volatility] index peaked on the 24th of August, as global markets were at their highest levels of distress.\"\nUncertainty, which is defined as the inability to forecast the likelihood of events happening, as opposed to risk, which has a level of measurable probability, has also spiked above average, Macquarie's global research shows.\nUncertainty indicators have spiked well above their average. Macquarie Research, the Federal Bank of Philadelphia The biggest macro and policy focus for the next few months remained the US Federal Reserve interest rates decision, Mr Conomos said.\n\"Broadly, there is an expectation that the Fed will raise interest rates. However, the timing of the increase and impact on markets remains a point of debate,\" he said.\nThe mixed reaction among asset classes in response to the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates on hold in September indicates the uncertainty around the lift-off is a hurdle markets just want to jump over.\n\"[Janet] Yellen has told us it would take something surprising to stop them hiking this year. To be honest , there are a growing majority who want the Fed to just get on with it, in order to stabilise markets and we can move on to something other than 'lift-off',\" National Australia Bank senior currency strategist Emma Lawson said.\n The delay in lift-off, and lack of consensus from pundits on when the rise is expected to occur, means uncertainty could remain for the next few months.\nBut how does uncertainty affect individual stocks?\nChanges in macroeconomic conditions could have large impacts on stocks' fundamentals, such as earnings, cash flows, financing costs, and liquidity, Macquarie said.\n\"Risk aversion induces investors to hedge against unfavourable shifts in economic conditions that reduce future investment opportunities.\"\nThree metrics Macquarie's global research team has developed three metrics to determine uncertainty. The first is through the \"dispersions\", or gaps, between professional forecasters' views on the outcome of future macroeconomic events.\nThe second is the volume of news stories on the uncertainty of economic policy, while the third is through the investment bank's financial risk index.\nUsing those measures, the Australian team has identified a set of Australian stocks with low sensitivity to uncertainty that it believes are poised to perform well in uncertain conditions.\nThe stocks with the lowest sensitivity to uncertainty are Telstra, ResMed and Aristocrat Leisure, with a score of 10 per cent or less â€“ the lower the percentage the better).\nRounding out the top 10 are TPG Telecom, CSL, Stockland, Federation Centres, Caltex, Wesfarmers and Bank of Queensland.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-09-28T10:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:03:56.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
