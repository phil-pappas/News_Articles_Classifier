I didn't buy Windows because of (former Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) CEO) Bill Gates,\" Bajarin said. \"If that would have been the case, most of us wouldn't have bought it. Not that Bill is a bad guy, but he was a geek.\" \nJobs is the subject — some would say target — of what critics say is a scathing documentary, \"Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine,\" which hit theaters Friday. \nIf Apple's reputation is going to take a hit from this film, it's going to take more time. The production from CNN Films and Magnolia Pictures was shown in only 68 theaters nationwide and turned in a mere $187,000 in receipts, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office analysis for Rentrak (NASDAQ: RENT ). \nJobs' famous temper and reportedly difficult managerial style are the focus of director Alex Gibney, who interviews a number of Apple insiders to talk about their former chief's volatile personality. Gibney has produced several hard-hitting documentaries in recent years, including \"Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room\" and \"Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief.\" \nNext month, Gibney's effort is to be followed by the simply titled feature film \"Steve Jobs,\" from Comcast's (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) Universal Pictures unit, based on the authorized biography of Jobs from former Time writer Walter Isaacson. With actor Michael Fassbender playing Jobs and Seth Rogen playing Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, it's expected to rake in more business at the box office than the documentary. \nFurther, \"Steve Jobs\" could, depending on your perspective, offer a more balanced view of Jobs, though there is talk that the film might be a bit more critical than the book. \"Steve Jobs\" is set for release on Oct. 9, four days after the anniversary of his death in 2011. \nIs this a case where the one-time face of the company and the company itself are inextricably intertwined? Jobs did, after all, preside over a 100-fold leap in Apple stock as it went from a split-adjusted price of around 58 cents when he retook the helm in early 1997 to nearly 60 a share at the time of his death.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T08:58:22.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
