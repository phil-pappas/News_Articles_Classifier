Launched in 2004, Avastin is drawing $7 billion for Roche as a treatment for a variety of different cancers, about 20% to 25% of it from lung cancer. A lower-priced biosimilar competitor would presumably be quite lucrative, but Avastin's U.S. patents aren't due to start expiring until 2017, so there's likely a legal battle ahead to get such a rival to market.\nDeveloping biosimilars is something of a defensive move for Amgen, as its legacy Neupogen/Neulasta franchise was among the first targets for biosimilar developers. Novartis (NYSE: NVS ) launched its Neupogen biosimilar Zarxio in the U.S. earlier this month, after having sold it in Europe for several years. Novartis is also working on an Avastin biosimilar, as are Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) and Boehringer Ingelheim, among others.\nAllergan has been moving its focus from generics to more specialty pharmaceuticals, and is in fact divesting its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE: TEVA ), but an Allergan spokesman said the Amgen biosimilar partnership will remain with Allergan after that deal closes. Amgen will, however, take the lead in developing and commercializing the product.\nAmgen stock closed down 0.14% Wednesday at 145.72 and Allergan stock fell 0.4% to 286.61. Roche stock lost 1.7%, closing at 31.65.\nFollow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T16:29:43.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
