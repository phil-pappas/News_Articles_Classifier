Commentators say the continent's consistent economic growth and political maturity across the last decade is a veritable pointer to the miracles that could be its lot in the coming years. But, not everyone is confident that Africa is set to truly rise. \nA major fodder for the critics is the way the continent treats women. Several studies have shown that every modern economic giant is built on the shoulders of women, as much as it built on that of men. In his groundbreaking book, The Wealth and Poverty of Nations, David Landes, surmised that leaving women out of the economic and political equation is unwise, because society will be leaving out the benefits that could be accrued from the talents, expertise, eccentricities, and genius of about half of the population. But, such mindless wastage, is akin to what's happening today, in most African societies. \nFor example, African women are one of the most illiterate people in the world. In a study published in the African Journal of Reproductive Health in 2010, it was showed that in Northern Nigeria, there is a high gender inequity in education, which places the majority of young girls at a severe disadvantage. \nThe cross-sectional study examined enrolment, dropout, and primary school completion rates in three communities in Kaduna State. It found that less than half of young people (6 - 25 years) living in northern Nigeria are currently enrolled in school and the majority of students are males (60%). The analysis indicated that there are nearly twice as many boys graduating from primary school as compared to girls, and the dropout rate for boys is close to half (3%) of the dropout rate for girls (5.4%). According to the study, no more than 20% of women in the north-west and northeast of the country are literate. \nThe statistics may be more favourable in other parts of the continent, but the average numbers still show a huge gap between educated males and females on the continent. A lot of factors, some are cultural, are responsible for this apathetic disposition towards the intellectual empowerment of African women. \nThe researchers concluded that the high level of out-of-school girls has grave implications that are detrimental to the society as a whole and will affect girls' lives negatively in all ramifications. It is true: uneducated girls can easily slip into the margins of societies, ending up less healthy, less skilled, with fewer choices, and remain ill-prepared to participate in the political, social and economic development of their communities. \"As undereducated women, they will remain at higher risk of poverty, maternal mortality, child mortality, HIV/ AIDS, sexual exploitation, and other forms of violence,\" the study opined. \nThis, the disadvantaged narrative of African women, was the underlying theme for the inaugural edition of the African Women Innovation and Entrepreneurship Forum (AWEIF), recently held at the Oriental Hotel, Lagos. \nParading a cast of high-powered speakers and panellists, including former Minister of Education, Obiageli Ezekwesili, and the Deputy, United Nations Representative for Nigeria and ECOWAS, Adjaratou Fatou, the conference explored the place of the African woman in building Africa into one of the most desirable destinations on earth. And the unanimous assessment was that the woman is an irreplaceable key to Africa's growth and development. \nSpeaking on \"Securing the Future: The Imperative for Girl Child Empowering Nation\", Ezekwesili stressed the importance of educating young girls in the society, as a strategic tool of nation building and general economic growth. \"It is only those countries that invest on and utilise both sexes in their development process that can quicker attain their development objective,\" she said. \n\"By helping each citizen - male and female - to acquire these human assets of skills, knowledge and capacities, a society secures itself and guarantees a stable future. This is because Education has proven itself as the bedrock of human progress. It improves the status of citizens of any society, providing each individual with the capacity to function and contribute to economic development with inter generational benefits that stabilises the future.\" \nAt the end of her speech, the former Minister of Education noted that \"Nigeria must become a girl child empowering nation if the trajectory and outcomes of our development process is to deliver the opposite of past and current dismal standards. The World Development Report of the World Bank concluded that 'Economic development is not enough to shrink all gender disparities-corrective policies that focus on persisting gender gaps are essential. The report points to four priority areas for policy going forward. \n\"First, reducing gender gaps in human capital, specifically those that address female mortality and education. Second, closing gender gaps in access to economic opportunities, earnings, and productivity. Third, shrinking gender differences in voice and agency within society. Fourth, limiting the reproduction of gender inequality across generations.' \n\"This fourth point holds the key to all the other points if our nation can act wisely starting from today. After all, today's girl child is tomorrow's woman. For our girl-child, today is already the Future. Empower the girl-child, Nigeria, for in her lies your greatness!\" \nThe UN representative, Adjaratou, who spoke on 'Fostering African Women Economic and Leadership Empowerment: The Business Imperative', pointed out that \"in Sub Saharan Africa more than 75 percent of all jobs are informal. In rural areas, many women derive their livelihoods through small scale farming, almost always informal and frequently without any direct pay and the majority of women-owned enterprises are micro and small scale ones.\" \nShe stressed that, \"currently, the broader global economic context is posing more constraints than opportunities for improving women's economic empowerment in many countries. Accompanied by growing income inequality, both within countries and across rich and poor countries, women are more likely to suffer from both the increased inequality and the increased economic uncertainty. \n\"Women and girls continue to perform the large majority of domestic and care work, requiring significant levels of time and energy, as well work supporting family farms. Time poverty is a major reason presence in the informal economy, leading them to choose home based work, work that does not require travel, part time or flexible work, or self-employment where they can choose their own hours. Although these strategies allow women to balance the 'double burden' of household and paid work, they also lead to lower incomes and opportunities over women's lifetimes.\" \nIn an attempt to create a framework for the way forward, Adjaratou called for an increase in \"skills and access to productive resources, improving the enabling and institutional environments, and assisting women in their ability to make and act upon decisions in order to benefit from economic growth and development.\" \nShe also said there must be support for \"the reform of laws and regulations that limit women's ability to work and to access, own and control land, property, inheritance, and other economic assets and productive resources; and promote better application and adherence to legal rights and protections supporting women's economic empowerment.\" \nFounder, Leap Africa and the Director of Sahel Capital, Ndidi Nwuneli, spoke on \"African Women Entrepreneurs: Leaving a Legacy\". Stressing the need for women to become change agents in their society, Nwuneli remarked that they should seek out opportunities for personal growth and development: take on new tasks or challenges at work, in your home and in your community. \nBroaden your conceptual thinking,\" she said. \"Read widely, study the lives of historical and current leaders; seek out mentors, role models, critics and champions who can coach, inspire and challenge you; enroll in formal leadership training programmes through which you can assess and enhance your skills. \nThe co-founder of AACE Foods also advised women entrepreneurs to have a champion, a critic, a mentor, and an accountability partner. She threw out a challenge for women to be a force of change in their society and ended with the strong admonition for women to help fellow women get to the top. \"There's a special place in hell for women who don't help other women,\" she said, quoting former United States Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright. \nThe convener of the conference, Irene Ochem, said she was honoured and delighted at conference's eventual success. \n\"More African women are becoming significant players in (entrepreneurship), and as social entrepreneurs. AWEIF will contribute in giving voice to these women and to the major role women play in Africa's sustainable growth,\" Irene said in her welcome address. \nThe conference was supported by MTN Business, St. Rita, Diamond Woman, among others, while Leap Africa, the Business School Netherlands and the International Women Society, served as strategic partners.
