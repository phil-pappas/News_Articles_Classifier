The senior executive and vice presidents were included in the additional cuts announced on Wednesday.\nThe salary cut is the latest step taken by Canadian oil and gas producers to rein in costs and weather a prolonged period of low global oil prices, which have tumbled nearly 60 percent since June 2014.\nLast week light oil producer Penn West Petroleum and oil major ConocoPhillips said they were eliminating a combined 900 jobs in Canada.
