DCN participants included Conde Nast, ESPN, Vox Media, CBS Interactive, NBCUniversal, the New York Times and more.\nThe goal was to compare fraudulent traffic to its members’ sites with that present in the wider online ad ecosystem, which was last year examined by a separate White Ops study.\nAccording to DCN’s study, “sophisticated bots” accounted for an average of 2.8% of traffic to display ads across its members’ properties, and 2.5% of traffic to video ads.\nBots are computer programs used to simulate real users. They are sometimes used by fraudsters to trigger ads illegitimately for a profit.\nBy comparison, the ANA’s study found bots accounted for an average of 11% of traffic to display ads in participating advertisers’ campaigns, and 23% of video ads.\nIn other words, traffic to DCN’S member sites is relatively “fraud-free” compared with the overall online ad market, the White Ops reports found.\n“The difference in levels was significant,” said Jason Kint, DCN’s chief executive. “From our perspective it backs up the definition of premium, and the importance of the policies and practices of our members.”\nThe two studies were conducted months apart, but White Ops CEO Michael Tiffany said he believes they still offer an “apples-to-apples” comparison, and therefore expose a material difference in traffic quality between “premium” sites and the bulk of the sites across which most advertisers now buy advertising inventory.\n“It’s interesting that these guys are now trying to define ‘premium’ as a category as ‘bot-free,’” Mr. Tiffany said. “That’s the world we’re living in; it’s a selling point.”\nDespite the results of the DCN study, Mr. Kint said he’s urging his member organizations not to get complacent.\n“The results are compelling, but this is not the finish line,” he said. “The trust that [member publishers] have in their brands and what defines premium is something they earn every day.”\nThe study found that bot rates for individual DCN member sites ranged from 1.6% to 6.9%.\nWrite to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T07:14:52.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
