Hauck was honored during the America’s SBDC Annual Conference in San Francisco this September. “During her more than fifteen years at the SBDC, Maureen has played an integral role in center management at Bucknell and has been a leader within the network through her high-quality contributions to new projects and initiatives,” said Pennsylvania SBDC State Director Christian Conroy. “Her clients and colleagues both praise Maureen for her dedication to her job and unwavering support of small businesses in her community,” added Conroy.\n“Maureen’s service to the business owners of our region is characterized by the unwavering care for and dedication to her clients; which is only matched by the depth of her knowledge of business management and finances,” said Bucknell SBDC Director Steven Stumbris. “She also serves as a tireless advocate and inspiration for women entrepreneurs: of the 23 Success Stories our center has featured over the last two years, 13 focused on women business owners served by Maureen,” added Stumbris.\nAs the lead Bucknell consultant on the Pennsylvania SBDC’s U.S. EDA Business Continuity project for the past two years, Maureen was instrumental in integrating this specialty program into First Step programming, planning templates, and client consulting. Most recently, she presented at the America’s SBDC national conference as part of the network team that carried out this critical project.\nFurthermore, over the past three years Maureen has been instrumental in developing Bucknell University SBDC’s student entrepreneurship programming, including a customized “First Step: Starting a Business” presentation featured in several management and engineering courses at Bucknell. She also serves student clients as they compete in the annual Business Pitch Competition . In 2014, the Bucknell SBDC was recognized with a Barry R. Maxwell Award, Bucknell’s premiere institutional recognition for excellence in cross-functional collaboration, given for inspiring entrepreneurship and innovation in Bucknell students.\nIn addition, Maureen also extends her outreach to younger aspiring entrepreneurs where she served as a Team Leader for the future Business Leaders of the Susquehanna Valley (BLSV), program for teams of high school students interested in economic and community development. She frequently speaks to groups of young entrepreneurs at Bucknell University and area high schools.\nEvery year, one top performer from each state within the national network of SBDCs is recognized for his or her contributions to his or her SBDC program. Each top performer is awarded the “State Star” designation for his or her state at America’s SBDC Annual Conference. Employees are chosen for their exemplary performance, making a significant contribution to their state or regional SBDC program, and for showing a strong commitment to small business.\n###\nAbout Pennsylvania Small Business Development Centers (SBDC)\nThe Pennsylvania SBDC network is the only statewide, nationally accredited program that provides high quality one-on-one consulting, training and information resources to empower new and existing businesses.
