This then increases to 30 days for each complete year of service over five years, with a cap at two years remuneration.\n“As employment tenures, salaries and benefit payouts grow, this 5-year threshold, at which point the EoSB liability immediately increases, represents an ever more important factor that companies should take into consideration,” the report said.\nA survey conducted earlier this year by Zurich found that the majority of UAE residents used their gratuity payment for a holiday, to pay off debt or for a property deposit, rather than putting it towards retirement.\nbusiness@thenational.ae \nFollow The National’s Business section on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T11:50:38.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
