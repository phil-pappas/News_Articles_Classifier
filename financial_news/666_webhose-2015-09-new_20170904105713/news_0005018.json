Let's not forget, that's where this all started last summer. Commodity price weakness led to earnings weakness on the index and that has continued over this summer,\" she said.\n‹ Bill Gross to the Fed: 'Get off zero, now!'

Quite frankly, what the Fed did this month was really muddy the works for the market,\" she said.\nLast week, the U.S. central bank kept interest rates at zero, raising the market's concerns over the U.S. economy.\n\"We have no visibility as to where the Fed is headed. We need some clarity on Fed policy just to relieve some of the concern,\" she added. \"Until those three things happen, we won't see a bottom.\"\nInvestors searching for gains in these uncertain times should look outside of the U.S., said Hayes Miller, head of global investment strategy at Barings.\n\"When we look at Europe … we see more slack in the European economy, which allows profitability to grow, the opposite of the U.S.,\" Miller said in the same interview.\n\"With Japan, it's a little different dynamic. The ability for Kuroda to initiate another round of [quantitative and qualitative easing] probably allows us to extend the Abenomics projections out another year,\" Miller added.\nEuropean equities closed higher on Wednesday, with the FTSE 100 index rising nearly 2 percent, while the German DAX closed up 0.44 percent.
