Germany's DAX was up 1.8 percent at 10,231 points, France's CAC 40 was up 1.6 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 was up 1.5 percent.\nBritish low-cost airline easyJet was the top gainer across Europe, jumping 6.7 percent after raising its full-year profit outlook.\nJapan's Nikkei rose for the first time in four days, gaining 0.7 percent, but weakness in Australia and falls in Asian currencies drove the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.2 percent.\nChina's stock markets, the root of much of the global volatility in recent weeks, were closed on Thursday.\nU.S. futures pointed to a rise of around 0.3 percent on Wall Street, adding to Wednesday's near 2 percent rise. Despite that rebound, however, shares have only recovered less than half of the losses over the past two weeks.\nIMF WEIGHS IN\nWhile global share prices may be getting some respite, any relief rallies may be brief. With uncertainty over policy in the United States and China, investors expect trade to remain extremely choppy.\nThe CBOE Volatility index is still at 26, about twice as high as its usual levels around 12 to 16, even as it has eased from a high over 50 percent hit last week.\nDraghi is expected to lower the ECB's growth and inflation outlook because of falling oil prices and China's economic slowdown, and may pledge to beef up the bank's bond- buying programme if prospects weaken further.\nMajor bond and currency markets were largely steady ahead of the ECB decision and Draghi's press conference.\nThe euro was unchanged at $1.1230, and the dollar was steady against the yen at 120.40 yen JPY=-.\nThe 10-year German Bund yield was steady at 0.79 percent , while the comparable 10-year U.S. yield was one basis point lower at 2.18 percent.\nBut emerging markets were under more pressure. The Brazilian real tumbled to its weakest level since 2002 on Wednesday as expectations of a growing fiscal deficit fed fears that Brazil would lose its investment-grade credit rating.\nThe International Monetary Fund entered the global growth and inflation debate late on Wednesday, warning of the growing downside risks to the world economy and urging central banks to keep policy accommodative and supportive.\nAs Friday's U.S. August employment report and Fed rate decision later in the month loom, the question for investors is whether the Chinese-inspired risk sell-off in recent weeks is a big enough shock to justify a delay in the Fed raising rates.\n\"The IMF clearly doesn't think raising rates against the modest global growth backdrop is a good idea,\" said Societe General analysts in a note on Thursday.\nOn Wednesday, U.S payroll processor ADP reported that private payrolls increased 190,000 last month. While that was below economists' expectations for a gain of 201,000 jobs, it was a step up from the 177,000 positions created in July.\nOil prices remained volatile after their 25 percent surge late last month from 6 1/2-year lows.\nBrent crude last stood at $50.34 per barrel, slipping further from one-month high of $54.32 hit on Monday, though it kept some distance from a 6 1/2-year low of $42.23 hit just one week before that.
