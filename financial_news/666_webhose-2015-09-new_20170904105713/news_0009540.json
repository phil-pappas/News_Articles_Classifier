Bloomberg Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Consumer confidence plunged this month after a deluge of bad news on financial markets, China, falling Australian dollar and evidence the economy slowed sharply last quarter.\nWestpac-Melbourne Institute's sentiment index dropped 5.6 per cent from August, when it enjoyed an unexpected upswing that left analysts puzzled. Sentiment has held below the level at which pessimists outnumber optimists for 17 of the last 19 months.\nThe survey suggested households were particularly focused on domestic economic concerns, as well as global news items, which were recalled by 42 per cent of respondents, the second-highest proportion recorded by Westpac since 1975.\nIn a sign that the falling dollar is weighing on sentiment – even if it helps spur the economy's competitiveness – the survey showed almost 16 per cent recalled news about the currency, the highest since June 2002, when it traded close to its post-float lows.\n\"This heightened concern around the world economy unnerved respondents about the labour market,\" Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said. \"Almost all respondents who recalled news items about the jobs market noted that the news was unfavourable.\"\nExpectations for family finances over the next 12 months fell by 1.1 per cent, but remain at a relatively high level, while confidence around the housing market continues to erode.\nThe time to buy a dwelling index fell 0.9 per cent to be 8.6 per cent lower than a year ago and 30 per cent below where it was two years ago.\nWithin that index the Sydney component is down by 46 per cent over the last year and has reached its lowest level since the survey began in 1975, supporting the view that the city's property surge may run out of steam.\n Households earning less than $20,000 a year recorded the sharpest deterioration in confidence, down 26 per cent in the month, followed by those earning between $80,000 and $100,000.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-09-09T09:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:18:18.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
