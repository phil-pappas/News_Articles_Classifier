Peter Braig Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Clancy Yeates The battle between banks to lure owner-occupied mortgage customers is heating up, with National Australia Bank offering new borrowers enough frequent flyer points for two return flights to London.\nIt is the latest and arguably most extravagant perk aimed at borrowers buying a home to live in, who are also being offered \"cash back\" deals amid a crackdown on lending to property investors.\nHowever, the savings from \"cash backs\" or other promotions can be easily outweighed by a competitive interest rate over the long term, analysis shows.\nNAB will on Saturday launch a deal offering 250,000 points with Virgin Australia's frequent flyer scheme to people who take out a new owner-occupied home loan. To be eligible, customers will need to borrow at least $250,000 and also have their transaction account and credit card with the bank.\nIt is enough points for flights for two people from Sydney or Melbourne to London and back, NAB says, not including taxes and fees of slightly less than $400 per person.\nOther banks, including Westpac, St George AMP and super fund-owned lender ME are also offering \"cash-back\" deals to owner-occupiers, brokers say. These promotions are typically worth between $1,000 and $1,500.\n\"It's a very competitive market,\" said NAB general manager of consumer lending, Angus Gilfillan. \"I think customers will value this more than a cash-back.\"\nThe promotions also reflect the regulatory landscape, as the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is forcing banks to slow their loan growth in housing-investor lending to less than 10 per cent a year. This has prompted banks to focus more sharply on owner-occupied customers.\n \"One of the unintended consequences is you can probably get an even better deal as an owner-occupier than you could before,\" APRA chairman Wayne Byres said this week.\nHowever, having a low interest rate is likely to save borrowers much more than a \"cash back\" or free plane tickets over the long-term.\nJustine Davies, from financial comparison website Canstar,​ said sign-up deals were an \"easy marketing tool\" for banks and highlighted the big gap in available interest rates – which change the price of a loan by thousands of dollars.\nThe average advertised home loan rate is 4.84 per cent, while the lowest rates in Canstar's database is 3.95 per cent.\nOn a $500,000 mortgage, a loan with the average rate would cost $250 more a month than a loan with the lowest rate, she said. Having the cheaper rate would save $3024 in the first year of the loan, and more than $9000 over three years.\n\"A home loan is likely the biggest debt that you'll ever have, and a thousand or so dollars thrown at you at the outset will mean nothing over the long term,\" Ms Davies said.\nLending to property investors has driven strong home loan growth since interest rates were slashed, but the current rate of housing investor credit growth of 10.8 per cent a year is faster than regulators would like. In comparison, owner-occupied credit is growing at 5.3 per cent.\nChief executive of mortgage broker Yellow Brick Road Matt Lawler​ said there was \"no doubt\" banks had switched their focus from property investors to owner-occupiers, and the competition was \"great for the consumer.\"\n\"Banks are becoming more aggressive to keep existing owner occupier clients and obtain new ones, by offering everything from low rates, waiving fees, to giving cash back,\" Mr Lawler said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@clancyyeates", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117021518580315645042"], "published": "2015-09-18T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T19:08:10.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
