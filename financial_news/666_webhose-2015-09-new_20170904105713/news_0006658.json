Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Geoff Kitney Australia is such a stable and peaceful society, especially the public service-dominated Canberra, that Australians have become complacent about their declining wealth, Treasury head John Fraser says.\nThe problems facing the nation are similar to the early 1980s, when Australia was falling out of the ranks of the world's richest countries, but the community didn't recognise the need for policy changes, he said.\n\"Our income per capita is falling. You wouldn't know it. Everybody is happy and, in Canberra in particular, everybody is deliriously happy and comfortable,\" he said in an interview for The Australian Financial Review Magazine's power issue.\nAustralians' disposable income fell 0.4 per cent in 2013-14 and 1.6 per cent the year before after adjusting for inflation, driven by lower iron ore and coal prices. The incomes falls are adding to pressure from economists to make big changes to the tax system.\nNew Treasurer Scott Morrison indicated this week that cutting spending would be one of his top priorities and he doesn't want a rise in the tax take from about 23 per cent of the economy.\n\"We have a spending problem, not a revenue problem,\" he said.\nAccelerate economic growth Mr Morrison said by changing what was taxed, he could accelerate economic growth and raise more revenue.\n Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen said s higher taxation was needed to balance the budget, which was $38 billion in deficit last financial year.\n\"We do need to make difficult decisions both on revenue and spending,\" he said on Lateline on Wednesday.\nOne of Mr Fraser's predecessors, Ken Henry, said this week the budget deficit could be heading to 5 per cent of the economy, which would be about $70 a week for every Australian .\n\"The reason I put it in those terms is because if we don't do something, we are going to have to raise taxes by that much over the next several decades in order to fund that increase in government spending that is being driven largely by demographics,\" he told the 7.30 program.\nMr Fraser looks likely to encourage Mr Morrison, who has never held an economic portfolio, to cut hard. Tight budgets in Ireland and Britain – which were condemned by critics as taking \"austerity\" measures – led to strong economic growth and this showed that \"tough policies can beget good growth\", Mr Fraser said.\nThe Ireland economy is now expanding at more than 6 per cent and Britain at 2.6 per cent, more than double the euro-area economy. Mr Fraser said the performance of the US economy, which has unemployment of 5.5 per cent compared with Australia's 6.4 per cent, was \"testimony to their more flexible product and labour markets\".\nMore partisan attitude After returning from overseas in January after 15 years, Mr Fraser said there seemed to be a much more partisan attitude to politics in Australia now than in the 1980s, when the Hawke-Keating governments implemented big changes with the support of the union movement, including deregulating the labour market, reducing tariffs and cutting subsidises.\n﻿ \"I think in the 80s people saw that we had imminent problems,\" he said. \"Then we had double-digit inflation. We had spending that was growing at a rapid pace. Our lack of competitiveness was evident. We even had a broader recognition about the need for labour market reform.\n\"We don't have that now. We have the feeling after 25 years of uninterrupted growth that everything is fine.\"\n﻿ The Turnbull government's primary focus for economic reform is likely to be the tax system , which is being reviewed by the Treasury Department through a \"white paper\" process under the oversight of Mr Fraser, who was a senior Treasury official in the 1980s. He returned to the public service from investment bank UBS after being picked by Prime Minister Tony Abbott to head the Treasury.\nHe said it was \"pretty obvious\" changes to the tax system were needed to encourage innovation, which would improve productivity.\n\"It's a simple proposition: if you increase the rewards for being innovative and entrepreneurial, you are going to increase the prospects that more people are going to be employed,\" he said. \"I don't think that is helped by a bigger tax burden. It is as simple as that. It's an obvious point to me.\"\nNot facing up to reality Mr Fraser said his first strong impression was that Australians were \"happy and comfortable\" and not facing up to the reality that the economy was expanding more slowly.\n\"We have to work harder for growth,\" he said. \"We are swimming against the tide now, but I think we are swimming pretty well.\n\"I am not pessimistic about our situation. I think people are too pessimistic. We have considerable capacity to lift our productivity. We have got to do everything we can to make sure we become more productive. And that comes back to the reform agenda.\n\"I do worry a little that we don't realise how fortunate we are and that the good fortune will only continue for our children and our grandchildren if we face up to a few of the issues.\n\"I am not part of those who are saying there is a crisis. I just think we need to be aware the world is moving on quickly and we have serious economic issues to address earlier, rather than later.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/4mambo"], "published": "2015-09-24T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:16:12.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
