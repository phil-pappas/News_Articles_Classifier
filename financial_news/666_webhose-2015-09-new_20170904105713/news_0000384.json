Slide 1 of 12 This week is National Banned Books Week, which the American Library Association says “promotes the freedom to express one’s opinions” even if that opinion might be to request a book be banned.\nIn honor of the event — which has been around since 1982 — the ALA publishes a list each year of the most frequently challenged books nationwide. The lists are compiled based on media and voluntary reports of requests to remove titles from schools or libraries. The ALA says that the compiled reports account for only 20% to 25% of actual book challenges and bans.\nIn 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment limited the ability of a school board to remove books from school library shelves, yet the practice still remains in place today.\nThe most cited reasons for challenges to books are offensive language, sexually explicit content and material unsuitable for an intended age group, according to the ALA. Parents and schools are the most likely to request the removal of books from shelves.\nThe number of challenges reported to the organization has remained relatively consistent — at around 300 to 400 requests each year — over the past two decades, says Deborah Caldwell Stone, Deputy Director of the ALA’ s Office of Intellectual Freedom. While there is no confirmed number of challenges that have led to books being taken off of shelves, she adds, the number of challenges exceeds the number of successful bans.\nThe most frequently challenged books, Stone says, are books intended for young audiences, or books that have become a part of young adult curriculum, like “The Catcher in the Rye” or “Of Mice and Men.” “The challenges come from concern over what young people are accessing,” Stone says.\nIn a time where most information is easily accessible from the Internet, Stone says it is still important to monitor the continued existence of book bans in rural communities where information resources are scarcer. “If you live in a rural community, and the library doesn’t stock the book, it may mean you’ll never see that book,” Stone says.\nHowever, services like Amazon’s AMZN, -1.59% Audible and Kindle e-reader make millions of book titles readily available for those looking beyond the library.\nHere are 10 of the most frequently challenged books in the past decade, many of which have appeared on bestseller lists, become pop culture icons or been staples of school reading lists.\nLittle, Brown Books for Young Readers Slide 2 of 12 The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\nThis young adult novel — and the first book by author Sherman Alexie — was published in 2007 and chronicles a Native American teenager’s move to an all-white high school. Since its debut, the book has won several awards, including the National Book Award for Young People’s Literature and the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award.\nAlexie’s book has appeared on the ALA’s top-10 most challenged books for the past five consecutive years, and was the most frequently challenged book in 2014. Reasons for challenges included anti-family messages, cultural insensitivity, drug and alcohol use, gambling and offensive language.\nMost recently, the book was pulled from middle school classrooms in Waterloo, Iowa, this March in response to parent complaints.\n“The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian” is currently the number one best seller on Amazon for Children’s Books in the U.S.\nRiverhead Books Slide 3 of 12 The Kite Runner\nA father-son story set in Afghanistan, “The Kite Runner” enjoyed 103 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, and three years on the most frequently challenged books list.\nWritten by Afghan American author Khaled Hosseini, “The Kite Runner” inspired a 2007 movie of the same name and has become a part of high school literature curriculums in some U.S. schools.\nHowever, challengers take issue with the novel’s homosexuality, offensive language, religious viewpoint and sexually explicit content.\nMTV Books Slide 4 of 12 The Perks of Being a Wallflower\nThis coming-of-age story won the ALA’s Best Book for Young Adults and Best Book for Reluctant Readers in 2000 and continues to experience popularity among teen readers. The 2012 film adaptation starring Emma Watson grossed nearly $18 million in its box office lifetime.\nThough the book spent more than a year on the New York Times bestseller list, its drug- and alcohol-related and sexually explicit content and homosexuality has also kept it as a repeated feature on the most challenged list.\nThe Blue Sky Press Slide 5 of 12 Captain Underpants\nDav Pilkey’s scantily-clad superhero has been a young reader favorite since 1997, with a 12-book series and a number of spin-offs. Since the publishing of the first book, “The Adventures of Captain Underpants,” 70 million copies of the series’ books in 20 different languages have been sold.\nWith enemies that include talking toilets, “Professor Poopypants” and “Wicked Wedgie Woman,” the principal-turned-superhero-in-tighty-whities may not be every parent’s ideal literary character for their child. Yet requests for removal seek to prevent all children from reading it in the communities where it is being challenged. The requests cite offensive language and violence for the reasons they should be removed from shelves.\nVintage Slide 6 of 12 The Bluest Eye\nToni Morrison’s first novel explores beauty and race through the eyes of a young African-American woman.The book has been a recurring part of Advanced Placement English curriculum.\nThough the book was first published in 1970, it continues to appear on the most frequently challenged books list for its scenes of violence, sexuality and offensive language.\nScholastic Press Slide 7 of 12 The Hunger Games\nOne of the most popular young adult series in the past decade, “The Hunger Games” trilogy has become both a literary and cinematic success. The series topped “Harry Potter” as Amazon’s biggest seller in 2012, and had sold more than 65 million copies as of 2014. The film adaptation of the first installment grossed nearly $410 million in box offices in 2012.\nThe series chronicles a dystopian society that keeps order through violent tradition, and a young woman’s attempt to buck the system. Despite its widespread popularity, Suzanne Collins’ series have been called anti-ethnic, anti-family, insensitive, violent and satanic by those who challenge its presence on library shelves.\nVintage Books Slide 8 of 12 Fifty Shades of Grey\nThe one exception to Stone’s identified trend of challenges to books intended for younger audiences is the “Fifty Shades of Grey” series, which gained notoriety for its “mommy porn” classification.\nWhat began as “Twilight” fan fiction ended up selling more than 100 million copies worldwide, and its film adaptation grossed more than $150 million at the box office. The series also sparked a pop culture fascination with BDSM practices, leading to an increase in sales of BDSM equipment and fitness classes .\nWhile the majority of its audience is more adult than young adult, there are still challenges to the series’ placement on library shelves due to its nudity, offensive language and religious viewpoint.\nPoppy Slide 9 of 12 Gossip Girl\nThe 13-book young adult series found widespread popularity when adapted as a television series in 2007. Both the books and the shows chronicle the fictional lives of elite high school students in New York City, complete with sex, drugs and alcohol.\nSince the publishing of the first book in 2002, “Gossip Girl” has found a cult following among teenage girls, but raised questions about appropriate content for young adult audiences. And some deemed it inappropriate enough to land on the most frequently challenged book list for three years.\nHarper Perennial Modern Classics Slide 10 of 12 Brave New World\nAldous Huxley’s science fiction work has been considered a classic in the genre. Published in 1932, this dystopian novel explores social stratification and the potential of technology in a futuristic London.\n“Brave New World” has been another established player in middle school and high school English class syllabi, yet has persisted to be a controversial book in some communities. It landed on the top-10 most frequently challenged list in back-to-back years in 2010 and 2011 for its insensitivity, nudity, racism, religious viewpoint and sexually explicit content.\nGrand Central Publishing Slide 11 of 12 To Kill a Mockingbird\nConsidered a critical success since its publication in 1960, “To Kill a Mockingbird” has been a must-read for literature teachers for decades. The novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was back in headlines this year when author Harper Lee published its predecessor, “ Go Set a Watchman .”\n“To Kill a Mockingbird” follows its young protagonist, Scout, as she experiences racial, class and gender issues in the American South. In a 2006 World Book Day poll of British librarians, “To Kill a Mockingbird” was considered the top book every adult should read before they die.\nNot everyone agrees, however. Offensive language and racism were cited as reasons in 2009 and 2011 to take the book off of library and school shelves.\nGrand Central Publishing Slide 12 of 12 To Kill a Mockingbird\nConsidered a critical success since its publication in 1960, “To Kill a Mockingbird” has been a must-read for literature teachers for decades.
