I will call elections... They will be in December,\" Rajoy said in an interview with COPE radio. Elections are due by year-end.\nPressing for the exact date, the journalist asked if he could conclude from the interview that the most likely date for the election was Dec. 20.\nRajoy replied: \"Use the headline you said: The most likely thing is that Spain will hold elections on Dec. 20.\"\nHis centre-right People's Party's hold on power has been loosened not only by its mainstream rival, the Socialists, but also from two newcomers, business-friendly Ciudadanos and left-wing Podemos, which have proved attractive to voters still struggling in the aftermath of economic crisis and what many view as a corruption-tainted establishment.\nA strong economic turnaround, which is set to make Spain one of Europe's fastest-growing economies this year, has seen Rajoy's party extend its lead in the polls.\nBut it remains well short of an absolute majority and the question for many Spaniards is whether the improving economy is filtering down to their daily lives. Unemployment is falling but remains above 20 percent.\nIn the interview, Rajoy also reiterated his implacable opposition to Catalan independence, saying: \"Catalan independence will never happen. It's nonsense.\"\nCatalan President Arturo Mas has scheduled regional elections for Sept. 27, portraying them as a proxy vote on independence after Rajoy's government went to court last year to block a referendum on the northeastern region breaking away from Spain.
