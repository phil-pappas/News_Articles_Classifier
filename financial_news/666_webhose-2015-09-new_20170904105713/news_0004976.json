Here's why you may want to bite your tongue.\nThink of sexual harassment and most people picture the lecherous male boss preying on a female subordinate, but that's only part of the picture.\nMore than one in 10 complaints about sexual harassment at work were made by men, according to two academics who analysed the cases from Australia's equal opportunity commissions in the six months from July to December 2009.\nIn 5 per cent of cases men complained about women and in 11 per cent men about men. Women were also accused of sexually harassing women in 5.7 per cent of cases.\nAdvertisement \"It shone a light on a very hidden phenomenon,\" says Professor Paula McDonald from QUT Business School who conducted the research with Professor Sara Charlesworth from RMIT.\nComplaints were made about a \"wide range of intimidating, offensive physical and non-physical conduct\".\nMale-to-male complaints often included homosexual slurs and the questioning of men's sexuality if they were perceived to be gay. One man alleged his male co-worker called him \"princess\", told him to \"toughen up\" and \"get a tiara\" and that he would rape him.\nAnother male complainant alleged his female manager asked him to lift his shirt and show her his muscles as well as shouting at him and humiliating him in front of co-workers.\nThe most frequent form of physical harassment reported by 40 per cent of the male-to-female group and about one-third of the female-to-female group was unwelcome touching, hugging, cornering or kissing.\nProfessor McDonald says complainants involved in atypical sexual harassment are less likely to make a formal complaint to a commission than women who experience more typical forms of sexual harassment.\nAtypical cases were also less likely to be resolved in the conciliation process.\nShe thinks this is because the male boss harassing a female subordinate is used as a \"yardstick for understanding what sexual harassment is or what is inappropriate behaviour\".\n\"Atypical cases, especially men harassing men, are seen as more transgressive or unexpected, and therefore it's more difficult to deal with in the complaints process. Also men are less likely to report it for the same reasons that they are targeted: because it challenges the dominant form of masculinity.\"\nSo how do SMEs ensure they are mindful of the range of inappropriate sexual behaviour in a workplace?\nTake the lead\nProfessor McDonald says it's very important for bosses to be role models of good behaviour and \"stamp on it quickly\" where gender-based hostile behaviours such as slurs have become normalised in a workplace.\n\"The normalisation of that gender-based hostility – be it directed towards women or men – creates the very environment in which sexual harassment flourishes and often escalates.\"\nPut a policy in place\nA policy that explicitly defines and describes sexual harassment is important. It communicates professional standards of conduct to employees and can protect the business, Professor McDonald says.\n\"Then there needs to be some training about what that code of conduct actually means in those particular working circumstances.\"\nEdward Mallett, employment barrister and managing director of Employsure, which advises about 7000 small businesses on workplace relations, agrees. \"What might be harassment in one workplace is quite commonly interpreted as banter or friendliness in another place. The way in which a workplace establishes its culture and what's acceptable and what isn't, is through its leadership.\"\nSet up a complaints mechanism\nMallett says SMEs need to recognise that if someone makes a complaint to their boss, then it is already serious. \"If they are saying: 'Oh, come on, toughen up, deal with it', it's only going to stoke the fire.\"\nThere needs to be agreement with the complaining employee about whether to deal with the issue formally or informally. A formal process, where the complaint is made in writing, should include interviewing others about the alleged incident.\nToo often people are dismissed before the facts are proven, Mallet says. \"Things happen in the workplace, sadly, where people do make things up and things get distorted and you need to maintain your impartiality as the person who has got to assess it.\"\nIt's often the failure of workplace complaints channels that leads to complaints escalating. Professor McDonald says it's often seen as an interpersonal problem between the target and the alleged harasser, or that he or she didn't react properly.\n\"So there needs to be a focus on the behaviour itself and the extent to which that is problematic in that workplace and then a timely and commensurate response to the severity of that conduct.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T00:18:28.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
