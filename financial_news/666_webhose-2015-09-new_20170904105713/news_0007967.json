VW Manipulated Tests In Europe, Says Germany By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 3 minutes 22 seconds ago View Photo \n\nVolkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) manipulated emissions tests in Europe as well as the US, Germany's transport minister has said. \nAlexander Dobrindt said: \"We have been informed that also in Europe, vehicles with 1.6 and 2.0 litre diesel engines are affected by the manipulations that are being talked about.\" \nHe added it was unclear how many vehicles in Europe were affected and confirmed random tests would be carried out on cars made by other manufacturers. \nThe VW controversy is centred on \"defeat devices\" it used to fool US emissions tests on diesel cars into believing the vehicles met environmental standards. \n:: How Would A Volkswagen Recall Work In UK? \nThe company admits the software, which switches engines to a cleaner mode during official testing, may have been fitted in 11 million vehicles worldwide. \nVW has not responded to Mr Dobrindt's claim. \nAt least 482,000 cars are to be recalled in the US and the carmaker could face penalties of more than $18bn (£11bn) there alone. \nThe Department for Transport would not immediately comment on Mr Dobrindt's remarks. \nTransport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has written to European Commission to call for a proposed new driving emissions test to be introduced as soon as possible. \n:: The End Of Europe's Love Affair With Diesel? \nCrisis management expert Quentin Langley has told Sky News the scandal is \"one of the biggest corporate scandals we have ever seen\". \nHe said: \"I think it is bigger than BP with the Gulf of Mexico, bigger than the banking crisis because this was deliberate. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) goes far wider than just VW.\" \nVolkswagen will start firing people responsible for manipulating the tests on Friday, sources told the Reuters news agency. \nThe carmaker's supervisory board will give initial findings from an internal investigation into who was responsible as well as revealing a successor to chief executive Martin Winterkorn, it reported. \nReuters later reported the research and development bosses of Audi (Other OTC: AUDVF - news ) and Porsche and its top manager in the US will be dismissed. \nAudi's Ulrich Hackenberg, Porsche's Wolfgang Hatz and US chief executive Michael Horn will be sacked, a source told the news agency. \nGerman weekly Spiegel reported that VW's brand development chief Heinz-Jakob Neusser will also go. \nVW, Porsche and Audi all declined to comment on the report. \nThe full global impact of the scandal is not yet known, with UK drivers waiting to find out if their cars are affected. \nIt has been warned the scandal could lead to Britain's biggest ever class action lawsuit. \nBozena Michalowska-Howells of law firm Leigh Day said: \"If it is shown that this piece of software defeated the European testing then Volkswagen would be in a very similar position as it is in the US and may well then have to call in their cars with all the resulting costs involved. \n\"This could well lead to one of the largest group claims ever in this country against Volkswagen for the way in which consumers may have been misled in relation to their vehicle.\" \nMr Winterkorn quit VW on Wednesday, saying he accepted responsibility for \"irregularities found in diesel engines\" but had not been aware of any wrongdoing. \nVW has set aside an initial £4.7bn to cover the fallout and \"win back the trust\" of customers. \n:: If you are worried your car could be affected by the VW emissions scandal you can contact us on news@sky.com or by text on 84501 \n:: Tell Us What You Want From The Sky News App", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T17:42:46.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
