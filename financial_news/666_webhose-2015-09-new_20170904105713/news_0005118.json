In the greater D.C. and Baltimore markets the firm has grown by 175 real estate agents in the past 12 months. According to Kevin Wiles, president of PenFed Realty Mid-Atlantic, the gains are due to increased opportunities to serve the Maryland, Virginia and Washington D.C. markets more effectively through its alignment with the Berkshire Hathaway Home Services name. “Our well respected brand reflects the company core values of trust, integrity, stability and longevity. These values are very important to all of our agents, because they know we are here for the long-term,” Wiles explained.\n“The combination of the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices brand and PenFed Realty, which is backed by the venerable PenFed Credit Union (PenFed), creates a compelling value proposition for those selling and buying homes,” added Wiles.\nAlong with being a wholly owned subsidiary of PenFed, a financial institution with $18 billion in assets, and having strong brand awareness, Wiles points to game changing innovative marketing solutions for its tremendous growth. “We have a Real Estate Rewards program that offers our home buyers up to $10,000 in closing cost savings. Our clients love this truly unique program,” he said.\n“Moving forward we will constantly innovate, improve and invest across all areas of the company to help our agents succeed and attract new clients.”\n*Graph based from January through July data.
