We've been back and forth, and we're trying to find a fair value,\" said Carl Larry at Frost & Sullivan. \n\"For every report that comes out, every prediction that comes, we're still not out of this range, between $40 and $50.\" \n\"Right now, what matters is supply, as the demand picture hasn't changed,\" he added. \nGoldman Sachs cut its 2016 price forecast for WTI to $45 a barrel, sharply lower than its May estimate of $57. \n\"The oil market is even more oversupplied than we had expected and we now forecast this surplus to persist in 2016 on further OPEC production growth, resilient non-OPEC supply and slowing demand growth, with risks skewed to even weaker demand given China's slowdown,\" it said. \nIn the worst case, the US bank projected the price of oil could tumble to near $20 a barrel if the glut breaches logistical and storage capacity. \nOn the other hand, the International Energy Agency forecast that oil supplies outside OPEC would fall by half a million barrels per day next year, with US shale producers accounting for four-fifths of the decline. \nSupporting that view, the Baker Hughes US oil rig continued its downward trend Friday. The rig count, a closely watched gauge of drilling activity, fell by 10 to 652, down 59 percent from a year ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T22:41:36.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
