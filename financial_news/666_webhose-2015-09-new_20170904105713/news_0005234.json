Nathan Lanham Share on twitter by Joanna Mather Pop into Joe's Bar for a drink and you'll be greeted by a concrete curtain. That's right, a floor-to-ceiling curtain made of concrete. It's a nod to Canberra's brutalist architecture. But thanks to soft lighting and warm colours elsewhere in the room, the drape isn't nearly as obnoxious as it sounds here. In fact, it invites touch, as does much of the highly-textured décor here.\nThe Bisa family opened East Hotel in Kingston three years ago. Joe's Bar, located on the ground floor, is the piece de resistance lovingly created by siblings Dan and Dion. The bar is named for their father, Joe Bisa, a first-generation Italian-Australian.\nNaturally, there's a heavy Italian influence, from the prosciutto hanging at the end of the bar to the Tuscan Vermenito, which the menu informs me – correctly, as it turns out - is like a \"Riesling on steroids\".\nCustom-made shelves are littered with distinctive Murano glass and a striking chandelier resembling hanging tulips - made from an empty bottle of Sambuca, that quintessential Italian spirits. Its creator is Canberra-trained artist Ruth Allen who is now based in Melbourne.\n​\nThere are half a dozen Italian cocktails on the ​Joe's Bar ​drinks menu, including the Bellini, a Venetian classic that mixes sparking wine (Prosecco) with peach purée. This version has zest thanks to a dash of lemon juice. But it's not all about drinks.\nThere are great Antipasti share plates on the food menu, along with a range of piccolo assaggi (small delicacies) including mozzarella arancini balls, pork-stuffed green olives and Gappa-cured Tasmanian trout.\nAs has been well noted, Canberra is experiencing something of a dining and drinking renaissance over the past few years. Kingston Foreshore, New Acton and Braddon are hotspots for new restaurants, bars and cafes. Maybe it's part of Canberra showcasing it's so much more than a one-horse kind of town - or maybe it's all those leadership spills. After all, five prime ministers in as many years requires a lot of celebratory toasts - or the drowning of sorrows - as the case may be.\nSalami and olives keep things spicy. Nathan Lanham At Joe's, not only can you catch up on the latest political assassination, along with other Capital Hill gossip (while trying out the cocktail list), you can plot a coup of your own behind the privacy of that handy concrete curtain. It's the brainchild of designer Kelly Ross, who has attracted attention as the creative spirit behind an opulent $5 million Surry Hills bachelor pad for appliance king John Winning​.\n\"From the very first conversation I had with Dan and Dion, I just knew that a concrete curtain was going to be woven into the details,\" Ross says. \"I saw it so clearly: a heavy, grounded element that cleverly imitated something which is usually so light and ephemeral.\"\n Arty East Hotel in Kingston, Canberra is home to Joe's.
