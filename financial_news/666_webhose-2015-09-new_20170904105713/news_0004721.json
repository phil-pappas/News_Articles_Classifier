Jesse Marlow Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Larry Schlesinger DIY giant Bunnings is facing accusations of breaching competition rules after stopping two small competitors opening in a Melbourne mall.\nFormer soldier Rob Sonogan complained to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission after Bunnings blocked his plan to open a STIHL-branded outdoor power equipment store in the Mentone centre, a day before he was due to sign a 10-year $115,000 a year lease.\n\"I am a returned soldier with war service and seven years in the army. I will not go away and intend to pursue all angles to get my business trading,\" Mr Sonogan told The Australian Financial Review.\nRetailer Allure Bathrooms had planned to open a 1300 square metre store to sell bathroom vanities in the Mentone centre. The plans fell through at the last minute when the family-run business was told it could acquire the site, but could not trade from it.\n\"We're small so Bunnings are trying to squash us,\" said Allure's Vince Luong.\nIn both cases, Bunnings exercised a provision included in its sales agreement struck with Ballarat developer H.Troon late last year when it sold the 38,000 square metre Mentone development. The provision prevents other home improvement or hardware businesses from owning or renting space in the centre for 10 years.\nFormer ACCC chairman Allan Fels told The Australian Financial Review it was \"obvious the ACCC will have to take a look\".\n\"But its not obvious what the answer is. On one hand, there are appearances of restrictions on competition. Indeed, shopping centres themselves sometimes have a vested interest in ensuring tenants maximise their profits, thereby maximising shopping centre rents.\n \"On the other hand, imposing these restrictions sometimes generates greater investment and confidence by the protected businesses,\" said Mr Fels.\nA spokeswoman for the ACCC said agreements between retail tenants and shopping centre operators that prevent competing businesses from operating in the shopping centre may raise concerns under the Competition and Consumer Act.\n\"Anyone with information about anti-competitive conduct is encouraged to contact the ACCC,\" she said.\nBunnings managing director John Gillam said the retailer was protecting its commercial investment. Bunnings is a part of the Wesfarmers conglomerate.\n\"We took a significant commercial risk spending nearly $50 million to buy the site and go through all the planning risks to build a new Bunnings store. Its totally legal and fair and reasonable that we have some protection from the commercial risk we have taken and are able to not give a free kick to a competitor,\" he said.\nBunnings has similar blocking covenants over other developments, but appears to make decisions on a case by case basis. In the Mentone centre, supermarket group Aldi and automotive retailer Repco, which compete with Bunnings in some categories, have struck leasing deals with developer H.Troon. H. Troon declined to comment.\nIn opening a STIHL store Mr Sonogan may have touched a raw nerve. The German power equipment giant, which last year earned $4.75 billion globally, has refused to stock its chainsaws and other power equipment in Bunnings or Woolworths-owned Masters stores, proudly saying so in an Australian television commercial.\n\"The reality is that Bunnings see STIHL as a risk to their profit line with a quality product that will compete directly with their offering and are acting in an anti-competitive manner,\" said Mr Sonogan.\nIn its submission to the 2013 Competition Policy Review, Wesfarmers wrote that it thrived on competition.\n\"Wesfarmers companies are ready and willing to compete against all comers in sensibly regulated markets and do not support competition policies that, in fact, restrict competition,\" the company wrote in comments that Mr Sonogan highlighted in his submission to the ACCC.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/larryschles", "https://plus.google.com/100879325589382331214/posts"], "published": "2015-09-16T12:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:12:19.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
