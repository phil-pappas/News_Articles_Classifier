The RBI has been under pressure from various quarters to give a fillip to the sagging growth by a rate cut, and itself acknowledged the need to do so when it cut its growth projection by 0.2 per cent to 7.4 per cent for the fiscal.\n“Continuing policy implementation, structural reforms and corporate actions leading to higher productivity will be the primary impetus for sustainable growth,” Rajan said.\nHe made it clear that the RBI has “front-loaded policy action by a reduction in the policy rate by 0.50 per cent”, and this action shall ensure that the real interest rates will continue to be in the 1.5-2 per cent band.\nRajan reiterated the need for banks to pass the benefits of the RBI actions to their lending rates and added that with this cut, the focus of the monetary policy will now shift to working with the government to remove impediments to pass a bulk of the cumulative 1.25 per cent cuts to borrowers.\nBanks have so far passed only an average of 0.30 per cent to the borrowers as against RBI’s 0.75 per cent cut and blame the delays in repricing of deposits for the lag. He added that deposit rates have “reduced significantly” and further transmission “is possible”.\nThe central bank is targeting to get headline inflation at 6 per cent by January 2016 and Rajan said it will reach 5.8 per cent by then. In the way forward, the focus will now shift to getting the number down to 5 per cent by FY17.\nLargely due to the base effects, the number had come at 3.66 per cent in August.\nApart from the rate action, Rajan introduced a slew of actions on the financial markets front, starting with setting the foreign portfolio investment limits in rupee terms, rather than in dollars.\nFPI investments in government bonds will be increased in phases to 5 per cent of the outstanding stock by March 2018, which can bring in an additional of Rs 1,20,000 crore, over and above the existing limit of Rs 1,53,500 crore, Rajan said.\nA majority of analysts were expecting Rajan to cut rates at the policy review, largely because of inflation being under control, and possibilities of it staying low in the immediate future on compressed commodity prices. However, more than the rate action, it was the guidance in the future stance, which the market was watching the most.\nThe Finance Ministry had also been building pressure on the RBI to cut rates, which will serve as a booster for the economy, where the GDP expansion has slipped to 7 per cent for the June quarter.\nCiting wholesale price-based inflation continuing to be in the negative zone, Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramaniam had said the economy run the risk of deflation as well.\nHowever, in its Monetary Policy Report, RBI said concerns around deflation are “overstated” and an “array of facts” like the sequential pick-up in growth can be presented to counter the argument.\n“The prescription is that monetary policy should act aggressively to pre-empt deflation,” it said, adding that the government will also have to work hard to push growth.\nAt 3.66 per cent in August, the consumer price inflation is within RBI’s comfort zone, given its stated target of keeping it at 6 per cent by January 2016.\nA week ahead of the review, Rajan had given mixed signals of the stance he will be taking at the review, saying the inflation is low due to base effects — it was very high same time last year — and also flagged worries on inflation expectations in the economy, which continue to be very high.\nThe comments had come a day after US Federal Reserve decided to delay it’s rate hike, further fuelling expectations of a rate cut in India.\nApart from the US Fed’s actions, the 13 per cent shortfall in monsoon till now, which can impact inflation going forward, is another key factor.\nThe RBI shifted its stance in January this year with the first rate cut, after picking up signals of ebbing in the inflation trajectory.\nFollowing the rate cut, the benchmark BSE Sensex was in green briefly but subsequently slipped into the red. The Sensex was trading 116 points down from yesterday’s close just half-an-hour after the announcement.\nThis is the fourth policy rate cut by Rajan this year, and takes up the cumulative rate cuts to 1.25 per cent.\nThe RBI has been under pressure from various quarters to give a fillip to the sagging growth by a rate cut, and itself acknowledged the need to do so when it cut its growth projection by 0.2 per cent.\nThe Finance Ministry had also been building pressure on the RBI to cut rates, which will serve as a booster for the economy, where the GDP expansion has slipped to 7 per cent for the June quarter.\nRajan reiterated the need for banks to pass the benefits of the RBI actions to their lending rates and added that with this cut, the focus of the monetary policy will now shift to working with the government to remove impediments to pass a bulk of the cumulative 1.25 per cent cuts to borrowers.\nIt can be noted that banks have passed only an average of 0.30 per cent to the borrowers as against RBIâ€™s 0.75 per cent cut to borrowers and blame the delays in repricing of deposits for the lag.\nHe added that deposit rates have “reduced significantly” and further transmission “is possible”.\nAs far as inflation is concerned, he said the focus will now shift to getting the number down to 5 per cent by FY17.\nLargely due to the base effects, the number had come at 3.66 per cent in August.\nApart from the rate action, Rajan today introduced a slew of actions on the financial markets front, starting with setting the foreign portfolio investment limits in rupee terms, rather than in dollars.\nHe also said that FPI investments in government bonds will be increased in phases to 5 per cent of the outstanding stock by March 2018, which can bring in an additional Rs 1.2 trillion (Rs 1.2 lakh crore), over and above the existing limit of Rs 1.5 trillion (Rs 1.5 lakh crore).\n 29, 2015 12:21 pm", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/SFP-bMNlZos"], "published": "2015-09-29T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:09:55.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
