Edwina Pickles \"Every single one of them that I've gone into has been to overcome some major adversity issue but NBN is unique of anything I've ever done before.\"\nMorrow said the construction of the NBN provided an opportunity for NBN staff to leave a legacy to their fellow Australians.\n\"Here you've got the country that is known for being early adopters with technology, who has probably one of the most distant falling behind infrastructure set-ups for broadband networks, which is the basis to do all of this new digital innovation that's occurring,\" he said.\n\"You don't have adequate competition. You don't have reasonable prices. You don't have enough demand that exists across the country to drive the entrepreneurialism, the innovation to be able to have this cyclical thing start to kick in.\n \"So here's an opportunity now, right, for all of us, anybody that's hired into the company to apply a skill that will have a fundamental affect on a nation, right, about modernising it and giving people a lifestyle change.\"\nPower to transform Morrow said that he had spent time explaining to NBN staff the power of the network to transform the country through e-healthcare, e-education and e-commerce.\nHe said one of his first challenges at NBN was to give the company a sense of direction.\n\"I think it was lacking organisation, direction,\" he said.\n\"I don't want to be too critical of the past because there was a lot of other extenuating circumstances that drove it to where it is.\n\"But if I think about the employee base, right, just starting there. Everybody had a different direction in terms of what they thought the priority was.\n\"They were really not co-ordinated amongst each other. So you had the left hand that was headed in one direction and the right hand doing something different.\n\"And when they found out that one may have been wrong they just started pointing the finger and said, 'Well, it's you'. 'No, well it's you', sort of thing. So you had further divisions that were propagating itself on the sidelines.\n\"Then you had a culture that was you show progress no matter what, you know. And it seemed as though there was this belief that all we had to do –was pressure you. All we had to do was raise our voice.\n\"All we had to do is threaten whether or not you were going to be employed here and they would get what they wanted to hear basically. And it was not the fact, right.\n\"And so two things happened, one, you start missing targets. And two, you start deflating the morale and the drive, this inspiration that makes us be better than what we are on a day-to-day basis.\nDownward spiral \"Those two things caused this to spiral even worse. Then you throw on top of that everything that you read in the press because we are a glass box in terms of what we're doing.\"\nMorrow's strategy for lifting staff morale was to provide one single slogan – \"eight million happy homes by the year 2020\".\n\"You can ask any employee, I write a fortnightly email to everybody and I've never missed an email that hasn't said, eight million happy homes by the year 2020 within that always somewhere to find within, to reinforce that,\" he said.\n\"Now it's almost a little bit of a joke. If we get into an open session with a group of employees, I'll ask now, 'tell me, remind me again what's the one goal we all share?'. And it's in unison, they're all coming back.\"\nThe latest NBN corporate plan released last month has forecast a doubling of the NBN footprint every year for the next three years and eight million homes connected by 2020. Revenue is forecast to rise from $164 million in 2015 to $1.7 billion by 2018.\nHowever, the change in the technology mix at NBN from all fibre to a mix of fibre, copper, HFC cable, satellite and fixed wireless has pushed up the total cost from $41 billion in December 2013 to $49 billion with a contingency for an additional $5.6 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T21:07:16.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
