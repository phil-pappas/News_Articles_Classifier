The combined companies have an equity value of about $2.4 billion, based on the share price at the close of trading on Tuesday.\n\nEven as Nielsen is likely to remain the industry benchmark, the Rentrak-comScore merger promises to make the heated race for an accurate and accepted means to measure mobile viewing much more interesting.\n\"We believe the industry is looking for a better/best measurement solution to its audience crisis,\" said Bernstein Research media analyst Todd Juenger in an investor note on Comcast.  \"We don't believe the industry will find that from comScore/Rentrak -- not even close.\"\n\nNielsen's strength remains its size and reach, Juenger said. Unlike Rentrak and comScore, Nielsen tracks media viewing nationally and also by individuals rather than devices. Importantly for its TV network clients, Nielsen is able to report overnight viewing numbers for most programming. Rentrak's television data is largely from set-top boxes.\n\nTo be sure, Rentrak and comScore are likely to put more pressure on Nielsen.\nThe two companies have been working together for more than two years on an effort called Project Blueprint, which seeks to combine data from the two companies -- Rentrak's TV with comScore's digital -- along with Nielsen's own People's Meter . The project, led by comScore, secured the participation of ESPN , ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and others, all of which are closely watching to see whether it can become a genuine alternative to Nielsen. \n\n\"The deal addresses an imperative need for a flexible and trusted metric for cross-platform media buying and selling, with siloed TV and digital analytics no longer adequate,\" Matthew Harrigan, a media analyst at Wunderlich Securities, wrote in an investor note.\nAnd an alternative, or at least a set of comparative data, is what the industry has said it wants.\n\n\"We are woefully behind in virtually every kind of measurement and nowhere near where we need to be in cross-platform measurement,\" Alan Wurtzel, president of research and media development at NBCU, a unit of Comcast 's ( CMCSA - Get Report ) NBCUniversal, told AdWeek back in March 2013.\n\nViacom ( VIAB - Get Report ) CEO Phillippe Dauman has been among the most vocal, in part because the viewers of his chief networks, MTV and Nickelodeon, are mostly young people who are most apt to be accessing its programming over mobile devices rather than a standard television. Dauman has often complained that Nielsen has too-often failed or been slow to track viewing on mobile devices such as Roku as well as smart phones and tablets.\n\n\"Inadequate measurement undermines innovation and disproportionately impacts those leading programmers like us who effectively provide the multiplatform experiences that viewers demand,\" he said during a spring earnings call.\nThat Nielsen's People Meter is the largest source of data providing the most extensive demographic breakdowns is widely accepted even by Rentrak and comScore. The two companies simply proclaim that they can do a better job of tracking usage on smartphones, tablets and devices such as Roku and Tivo. \n\nThe merged company will also be open to criticism about its impartiality given that the world's largest marketing company, WPP Group ( WPPGY ) , which purchased a stake in comScore in February, will own 16% of the combined company with an option to increase that position to 19.9%. WPP, headed by Sir Martin Sorrell, owns the advertising agencies J. Walter Thompson, Ogilvy & Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, among many others.\n\nBut whichever company reigns supreme among advertising buyers and sellers, the underlying issue of viewers' transition to mobile devices, away from pay-TV services, will continue to force media companies to adapt or perish.\n\"We believe a lot of the industry trash talk was simply using Nielsen as a convenient scapegoat while the TV networks figured out a strategy for dealing with their real problems,\" Juenger added.\n\n\nCheck Out Our Best Services for Investors Action Alerts PLUS Portfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.\nProduct Features: $2.5+ million portfolio Large-cap and dividend focus Intraday trade alerts from Cramer Quant Ratings Access the tool that DOMINATES the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500.\nProduct Features: Buy, hold, or sell recommendations for over 4,300 stocks Unlimited research reports on your favorite stocks A custom stock screener Stocks Under $10 David Peltier uncovers low dollar stocks with serious upside potential that are flying under Wall Street's radar.\nProduct Features: Model portfolio Stocks trading below $10 Intraday trade alerts 14-Days Free Only $9.95 14-Days Free Dividend Stock Advisor David Peltier identifies the best of breed dividend stocks that will pay a reliable AND significant income stream.\nProduct Features: Diversified model portfolio of dividend stocks Updates with exact steps to take - BUY, HOLD, SELL Trifecta Stocks Every recommendation goes through 3 layers of intense scrutinyquantitative, fundamental and technical analysisto maximize profit potential and minimize risk.\nProduct Features: Model Portfolio Intra Day Trade alerts Access to Quant Ratings Options Profits Our options trading pros provide over 100 monthly option trading ideas and strategies to help you become a well-seasoned trader.\nProduct Features: Actionable options commentary and news Real-time trading community View other subscription services that we offer comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:42:38.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
