(NASDAQ: KOOL ), an autologous cell-based regenerative medicine company, today announced the signing and initial closing of a definitive agreement on August 31, 2015, to raise $15 million in senior secured convertible debentures and warrants from one institutional investor. \nThe Company intends to use the gross proceeds from the private placement for working capital in support of its ongoing clinical initiatives. \n\"We are very pleased to have secured this additional investment,\" said Robin C. Stracey, Chief Executive Officer of Cesca Therapeutics. \"It represents a significant vote of confidence in our clinical program from a sophisticated life science investor that believes strongly in the potential of our company and our long term growth prospects. With FDA approval secured, without condition, for the initiation of our Phase III pivotal clinical trial in the U.S. for the treatment of \"no option\" patients with late stage CLI using our SurgWerks TM --CLI and VXP System, we now look forward with enthusiasm to advancing the program and beginning the trial.\" \nThe Company received $5.5 million in gross proceeds at the initial closing. At the second closing, the balance of $9.5 million will be placed into a restricted control account and will be released to the Company upon the achievement of agreed upon milestones, including approval from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (\"CIRM\") of the Company's application for matching funds in the form of a CIRM grant. \nThe debentures bear no interest, may be convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $0.68 per share and are secured by all of the Company's assets. In connection with the transaction, the Company also issued Series A warrants to purchase up to 22,058,823 million shares of the common stock at $0.68 for a period of five and one-half years and Series B warrants to purchase up to 12,132,353 million shares of common stock at $0.68 for a period of eighteen months. The Series A and B warrants are subject to vesting based upon the amount of funds actually received by the Company in the sale of the senior secured convertible debentures and are exercisable upon the earlier of the approval of the transaction by the Company's stockholders and the 6 month anniversary of the issuance date. \nThe debentures and warrants were issued to the investor in a private placement. As part of the financing, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering for resale the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures and upon the exercise of the warrants.
