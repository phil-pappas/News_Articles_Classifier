It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) underpins the board's strong commitment to maintain healthy capital buffers as we prepare for the implementation of Solvency II,\" FBD's interim CEO, Fiona Muldoon, said in a statement, referring to the European Union's new capital requirements for insurers. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in FBD, which have fallen by more than 50 percent in the last year, closed up almost 9 percent at 6.82 euros following the announcement. \nThe agreement is similar to the subordinated loan that Irish state-owned health insurer Vhi Insurance took out with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (Sao Paolo: BERK34.SA - news ) this year. \n\"We have been a long-standing follower of FBD. This investment underlines our belief in the strength of Ireland's on-going economic recovery and in FBD's core franchise in the farming and agri-business sectors,\" Fairfax Chief Executive Prem Watsa said. \nWhile Ireland's economy is growing faster than any other in Europe, FBD has said it will only benefit in the medium term because claims linked to increasing economic activity are on the rise amidst a structural change to the sector, which it said will lead to losses across the industry for 2015 and 2016.
