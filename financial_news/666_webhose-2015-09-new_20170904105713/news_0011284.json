FRAGILE CHINA\nThe latest bout of volatility had been kicked off by losses on Wall Street overnight after comments from Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer appeared to keep alive the chances of a U.S. interest rate hike in September.\nChina's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) then compounded matters, falling to 49.7 in August from the previous month's reading of 50.0, its weakest showing in three years.\n\"Recent volatilities in global financial markets could weigh on the real economy, and a pessimistic outlook may become self-fulfilling,\" said He Fan, chief economist at Caixin Insight Group. A separate survey from Fan's organisation had also shown the country's services sector slowing.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.6 percent to extend the more than 10 percent it had lost in August.\nChinese shares had remained relatively steady, with the Shanghai Composite Index down a modest 1.2 percent and the CSI300 index almost flat.\nInstead the pain was felt elsewhere. Japan's Nikkei slumped 3.8 percent after tanking 8.2 percent in August. Australian, Indonesian and Hong Kong stocks were all down by more than 2 percent.\nMetals markets were straining again too. London Metal Exchange copper fell 1 percent to $5,087.50 as markets reopened after a long bank holiday weekend, nickel slid 2 percent while aluminium and tin skidded too.\nOne of the other recent victims of the China jitters, the Australian dollar, edged up however, adding about 0.2 percent to $0.7125 after the Reserve Bank of Australia held Aussie interest rates steady.
