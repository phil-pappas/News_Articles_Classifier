Stine never wanted to be scary.\nThe author of the Goosebumps and Fear Street paperback series—which spawned a legion of young horror devotees in the late 1980s and 1990s—actually spent the greater part of his life telling jokes.\n“When I visit schools, kids are always disappointed,” said Mr. Stine, 71 years old, whose real name is Robert Lawrence Stine. “They expect some scary guy in a cape or something. And I’m like someone’s dad. They’re all horrified.”\nWhile Mr. Stine’s original readers have grown up, gotten jobs and had children of their own, a new generation of readers is about to be introduced to his terrifying tales.\nOn Oct. 16, Columbia Pictures will release “Goosebumps,” a film based on several novels from the series. Starring Jack Black as R.L. Stine, the film is the culmination of a more than 20-year effort that Mr. Stine says has involved 17 different scripts. (The author will also make a cameo.)\nAs part of the movie release, Scholastic is publishing new Goosebumps books, such as “Goosebumps the Movie: Monster Survival Guide” and reissuing classics such as “A Shocker on Shock Street.” Today, there are more than 350 million English-language copies of Goosebumps in print, with 50 million or so in another 32 languages, making it one of the best-selling children’s series ever.\nSt. Martin’s Press is also releasing new Fear Street novels after the author was inundated by Twitter requests to bring the novels back. An avid Tweeter, Mr. Stine has nearly 170,000 followers. Sample tweet: “Interesting statistic: If you all bought 1 Goosebumps book a month, it would be enough books to reach from here to my bank.”\nWatch a film clip from \"Goosebumps,\" starring Jack Black, Odeya Rush, Ryan Lee and Dylan Minnette. A 10-episode TV series based on his decade-old “Eye Candy” wrapped up this spring on MTV. In August, he published a picture book, “The Little Shop of Monsters,” with Marc Brown, the author and illustrator of children’s series “Arthur.” The playful book, which Mr. Stine says also has some “bite,” follows children as they pick out a monster of their own to take home.\nMr. Stine attributes his staying power in part to the undercurrent of humor found in all of his stories. Though there were other children’s authors writing horror in the 1980s and 1990s, Mr. Stine made his stories less scary and more teasing. He didn’t go as far.\n“The kids have to know it isn’t real,” he said while sitting in his apartment on the Upper West Side of New York. “I think I can do anything—have horrible monsters, have terrible things happening—as long as they know it isn’t real.”\nHe insists that his books don’t carry a deeper meaning. But if there were one, he says, it would be that kids are capable of solving their own problems. In his stories, kids find themselves in terrifying situations, with parents who don’t believe that the mummy is alive or the kitchen sponge evil. In the end, the kids have to use their own wit to save themselves. And they always do—or almost always.\nMr. Stine says in 1992 he wrote a Fear Street novel, “The Best Friend,” which ended with the bad character getting away with murder. His readers were outraged, and they let him know it.\n“Kids hated it, they just hated it,” he said. “They wrote, ‘Dear R.L. Stine, You moron. How could you write that? Are you going to finish the story?”\nAnd so he wrote a sequel, “Best Friend 2,” to rectify the mistake, and from then on shied away from unhappy endings.\nAt his peak, Mr. Stine says he was producing 24 books a year—a feat he says he accomplished by outlining every detail of the stories beforehand. “Then I could just enjoy the writing,” he said.\nBook Excerpt Read Chapter 1 of ‘Goosebumps HorrorLand’ More recently, he has averaged about seven books a year. He cranks out about 2,000 words a day, holing himself up in his office filled with Goosebumps and Fear Street memorabilia, a handful of vintage radios—his only real hobby—and a smattering of awards, including his Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards orange blimps.\nMr. Stine began writing at age 9 while growing up on the outskirts of Columbus, Ohio. “I always wanted to be funny,” he said. “I was the one who disrupted the class and shouted out funny things,” he recalls.\nAfter graduating from Ohio State University and moving to New York, he wrote for fan magazines and edited his own humor magazine, Bananas, published by Scholastic. “I figured I would just coast for the rest of my life,” said Mr. Stine, who went by the pen name ‘Jovial Bob Stine’ at the time.\nBut when the magazine folded a decade later, he had lunch with a Scholastic editor who was struggling with an author writing a teen horror novel. “She said, ‘You could write a good horror book. Go home and write a book called ‘Blind Date,’” he recalled.\nAnd he did. “Blind Date” made its debut in 1986 and quickly became a best seller “I said, ‘Forget the funny stuff!” He swapped the Jovial Bob pseudonym for the more menacing R.L. Stine, and turned his focus full-time to horror. In 1989, he launched Fear Street as a monthly series and, after that, Goosebumps in 1992.\nWhen he’s not writing, he is an avid reader of fiction, particularly thrillers by authors like the late Ruth Rendell and Michael Connelly. “I don’t like anything that’s real,” he says.\nWrite to Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T20:08:02.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
