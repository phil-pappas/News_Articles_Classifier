Yangian \nMonrovia — With a history of disagreements over the years with the regulatory body of the telecommunications sector, the Liberia Telecommunications Authority (LTA) Liberia giant GSM service provider, Lonestar Communications Corporation has found itself in further trouble with a huge ruling by the Tax Court against the company. At the moment, Lonestar Cell has a complaint against the LTA protesting increment on the tariff for international calls which has been proposed by the regulatory body and while the Civil Law Court at the Temple of Justice has summoned the LTA, another court has also ruled against Lonestar Cell. \nIn a ruling in the case Lonestar Communication Corporation vs BOTA for judicial review and Liberia revenue Authority vs Bota also for judicial review growing out of the case Lonestar Communication Corporation Vs Ministry of Finance/Liberia Revenue Authority, an appeal against administrative determination that found that the GSM company should pay US$19,197,903.44 as tax obligation to the government of Liberia. \nThe Ministry of Finance reported to the LCC that from a forensic audit conducted it was discovered that the GSM Company had tax obligation of US$ US$19,197,903.44 which led the Ministry to conclude that the company had \"defrauded\" the government and it was therefore demanding assessments of the company records. LCC on the overhand denied any wrongdoing and improper tax records and demanded opportunity to review a d respond to the new information but refused to grant the Ministry of Finance access to its records. \nCourt records indicate that the Ministry of Finance on April 17, 2013 issued a letter to the LCC in which it stated that based on \"new discoveries or unreported income, indistinct expenses, and unclear interconnectivity transactions\", the Ministry was attaching copy of an audit based on its \"recent re-assessment\" of the LCC for the period of 2007-2011 resulting in a tax bill of US$19,197,903.44, which amount should be paid within 30 days, after which time the MOF \"will be constrained to implement enforcement actions in keeping with the Tax Laws to ensure the recovery of this tax debt\". \nIn the background of the case contained in the ruling of His Honour Judge Mozart A. Chesson, Resident Tax Court Judge, Montserrado County stated that the LCC objected and resisted the claims by the Ministry of Finance, requesting a conference with the relevant MOF staff and ended by stating \"In the event that a resolution cannot be reached, Lonestar Cell MTN shall exercise its right of appeal in accordance with sections 59 and 60 of the Revenue Code Act 2000\". \nDuring the course of the trial, the court records indicated that both parties presented their respective contentions in which LCC contended that Ministry of Finance made an allegation of fraud but did not present evidence in support of such fraud during the hearings before Bureau of Tax Appeals (BOTA). \nThe Ministry of Finance on the other hand contended that although BOTA had compelled the MOF to participate in a 'reconciliation' exercise requested by the LCC, the BOTA had permitted the LCC to reject the results of that exercise when it proved unpalatable to it and the MOF prayed the tax court to enforce the results of that exercise, which the LCC had requested, and in which it voluntarily participated, the conclusion of which found the LCC owing the sum of US$13,146,385.21. \nIn the ruling, the Judge indicated that the LCC knew or should have known what the statute provides; it knew or should have known that the BOTA's Rule 5 misapplied that statute's provisions; it knew or should have known that BOTA's internal Rules-up and all of this should have prompted the LCC to immediately challenge that provision in order to protects its interest, something it indicated that LCC unaccountably failed to take such steps. \nJudge Chesson ruled: \"The court finds itself with no alternative but to hold that the Lonestar Communications Corporation failed to file its appeal against the Ministry of Finance's determination within the statutory time, before the determination had become final and no longer subject to challenge. \" \n\"Accordingly, the appeal filed by the Lonestar Communications Corporation to the Board of Tax Appeals, brought up to this court on petition for judicial review, must be denied with prejudice, and the determination of the Ministry of Finance that the corporation owed taxes in the amount of US$19,197,903.44, having become final and not subject to challenge before the taxpayer's appeal had been filed, must be sustained\". \nThe legal counsel for LCC excepted to the ruling and announced an appeal to the Supreme Court which was granted by the Judge. In with law, the Supreme Court is expected to hear the appeal and render an opinion in this case either confirming the ruling of the lower court judge or mandating the court to further look into the case.
