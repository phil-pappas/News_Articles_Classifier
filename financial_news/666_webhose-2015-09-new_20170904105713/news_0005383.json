Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow Canberra Press Gallery reporter (not the chef) Matt Moran quit the Ten Network on Friday. He's off to work in Malcolm Turnbull 's PMO.\nThe sandgroper came to the capital from out West, and the Australian Army Reservist is buddies with the new member for Canning, Andrew Hastie . They served together in Afghanistan in 2009.\nMoran is also a decorated journalist best known for his story in 2011 on the air force cadet \"Kate\", who was filmed (without her knowledge) having sex with/by an ADFA grub.\nThe expose rocked the Defence establishment and came about after \"Kate\" called Ten's Sydney bureau. The Sydney bureau then spoke to a producer at Ten's Canberra bureau, who set Moran onto the story for which he won the Walkley in 2011 for Scoop of the Year.\nConsider it a lesson on the importance of answering the telephone.\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow"], "published": "2015-09-28T12:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:08:40.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
