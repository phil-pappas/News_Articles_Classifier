AP Share on twitter by Angus Grigg\nKurt Campbell, American's man in Asia during the Obama Administration's first term, recently summed up the importance of a state visit.\nSpeaking before Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives in Washington later this month, Campbell said such visits were primarily about \"face\".\n\"It's all about the outward, visible display of American respect,\" he told the Washington Post .\nThis presents Obama with his best bargaining chip in years at a time when the Chinese are already looking slightly vulnerable.\nTheir vulnerability stems not only from a faltering economy, but the threat of US sanctions in retaliation for a Chinese cyber attack which stole the personal details of more than 20 million Americans.\nBeijing is expecting some push back, but does not want it to come in the days prior to Xi's visit, as this would look very bad at home and not constitute the \"American respect\" which China so desperately craves.\nFor Xi the \"face\" issue is even more acute as he has placed the \"great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\" at the centre of his quest for legitimacy. Part of this \"rejuvenation\" involves being treated as a near equal by the US.\n And so the US has two weeks of leverage before Xi arrives in Washington to extract some big concessions.\nThe main issue for Obama is Xi's increasingly muscular approach to foreign policy, particularly in the South China Sea. The US has talked tough over Beijing's reclaiming of land and building of military installations in disputed waters, but done little else.\nApart from coining the phrase \"the great wall of sand\" Washington has passively stood back and watched as Beijing created a forward operating base 350km from its coast and in doing so altered the balance of power in the region.\nAlong with the reclamation work, Chinese vessels and aircraft have been aggressively patrolling disputed waters around the islands, raising the risk of an incident which could then spiral into a conflict. This would be a disaster not only for regional stability but also the fragile world economy.\nGetting the Chinese to lower the temperature and moderate their behaviour in this area would therefore be a major win for Obama and on this front his negotiators look to be pushing hard.\nIn a series of well-time leaks, Washington has indicated sanctions might be imposed before Xi's visit, eliciting the desired response from Beijing.\nIts ambassador to the US, Cui Tianka, was out talking to the press over the weekend saying the visit might yield \"surprising results\". He said the US and China had more common interests than differences and urged the US not to impose sanctions ahead of Xi's visit.\nThis makes the next two weeks crucial for China/US relations and by extension the global balance of power.\nIf the US imposes sanctions ahead of Xi's visit then it's a sign Beijing is unwilling to budge on its activities in the South China Sea or even moderate its cyber hacking. That would be a very bad sign as economic sanctions against Beijing are unlikely to be the end of Washington's response.\nThe New York Times reported the Obama administration has been gaming out its response to the cyber attacks all summer, in discussion that have taken place in the White House Situation Room. The Times said under consideration was a retaliatory attack to bring down the Great Fire Wall, which blocks foreign websites including Twitter, Facebook and Google in China.\n\"The idea would be to demonstrate to the Chinese leadership that the thing they value most – keeping control over the country's political dialogue – could be at risk if they did not moderate their attacks,\" the Times wrote.\nSuch an attack would be a very big step for the US to take and surely trigger a new low in relations between Beijing and Washington.\nAs always Australia would find itself caught in the middle with Canberra finding it increasingly difficult to appease both sides.\nWashington would likely demand a greater show of Australian solidarity, while Beijing would ask for Canberra to remain neutral. That's a tough choice.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/AngusGrigg"], "published": "2015-09-08T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T17:27:52.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
