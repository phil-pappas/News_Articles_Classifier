So coal producers had to stay competitive to keep exporting to China. Glenn Hunt by Trevor Sykes The prices for Australia's main mineral commodities are likely to stay around present levels for the next six months.\nThat was the conclusion to emerge from a seminar held by Platts in Sydney last week. Platts, in association with Thomson Reuters, provides daily prices, news and trading information from markets around the globe for all important minerals and mine products.\nThe conference, which featured Platts specialists on China, Australia, Japan, South Korea and shipping, focused mainly on aluminium and alumina, but also provided analysis on trends in iron ore, oil, steel, coal and LNG.\nPlatts' opinions on trends are respected because, while they monitor all the important markets closely, they are observers, not traders, which means their forecasts are objective. Of course, being objective doesn't always mean you're right, but it does mean Platts' forecasts are not clouded by a trading position.\nPlatts see the markets in all the big mineral commodities as being in similar positions. Demand is broadly OK, but supply has been too strong, so prices are down and it will take some time for the markets to stabilise.\nStocks of aluminium, for example, have been flooding into North America from unprecedented sources such as the Middle East, India, China and Canada. The price on the London Metals Exchange (LME) was $US1854 a tonne at the end of 2014 and is now around $US1600. The aluminium price had already fallen before the start of 2015 and in July it cracked again.\nAluminium stocks are very high in South Korea. Users are not buying much on the open market, preferring to deal with domestic warehouses which are holding six months' supply.\nClyde Russell, Platts Asia commodities and energy columnist, said the supply of commodities to China had run ahead of demand, which meant import volumes were robust but their value had fallen.\n Meanwhile China was taking advantage of low current prices to stockpile oil. China was importing around six million barrels of oil a day, which was 600,000 more than last year and about half of that increase was going into storage. Russell said: \"We know they have more oil storage capacity coming up and they are going to fill it while oil is cheap\".\n\"Chinese iron ore imports are quite strong,\" he said. \"The trouble in the iron ore market is that [suppliers] got very optimistic.\" He tipped Chinese iron ore imports to top out at around 800mtpa, rather than the billion-tonne mark which was being tipped a few years ago. But this market might not be quite so gloomy, because iron ore prices have been modestly firmer in recent weeks.\nIn the coal market, Russell said the Chinese didn't really have to import anything if they didn't want to. The only reason coal was still going into south-east China was because seaborne coal was cheaper than the local product. So coal producers had to stay competitive to keep exporting to China.\nAll rather gloomy, but it's worth remembering that for Australia, there are several offsetting factors.\nThe fall of the $A against the $US has kept many of our mineral exporters in the game. The fall in the oil price has been a benefit to any producer except those in the oil industry.\nThis is particularly true in the aluminium industry, where the biggest cost to convert bauxite to alumina and then aluminium is energy. Aluminium smelters are increasingly located in countries where electricity is cheap, such as Greenland (hydro) and the Middle East (oil and gas).\nShipping costs have also dropped because there are too many vessels. Rates from Port Hedland to the big Chinese iron ore port Qingdao are down from $US11.75/tonne in May 2014 to around $US10 now.\nThe bottom line is that if you hold Australian resource stocks, it's probably too late to sell. Dump them in the bottom drawer and hope for a bounce in a couple of years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:53:12.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
