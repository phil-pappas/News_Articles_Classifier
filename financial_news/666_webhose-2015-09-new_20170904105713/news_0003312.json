As the equity market declined, U.S. debt prices rebounded after an auction of $21 billion in 10-year notes. \nOil prices gave up early gains, beset by ongoing concerns about oversupply. \nThe biggest equity move was in Japan, where signals from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that Japan will cut corporate taxes pushed the Nikkei 225 stock index up 7.7 percent, its biggest one-day rise since October 2008. \nChina's Finance Ministry said on Wednesday it would strengthen fiscal policy, boost infrastructure spending and speed up tax reform, helping lift Chinese shares for a second day. \nThe Shanghai Composite closed 2.3 percent higher and the CSI (Shanghai: 600158.SS - news ) 300 index rose 1.96 percent while Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 4.5 percent. China's shares rallied Tuesday on investor expectations that Beijing will add more stimulus to bolster slowing growth. \nAngus Gluskie, managing director of White Funds Management in Sydney, described Wednesday's stock rally as a \"speculative bounce.\" \n\"The market will remain susceptible to a return of negativity until we see signs of some improvement in the original causes of weakness, which were predominantly Chinese growth concerns,\" he said. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 98.81 points, or 0.6 percent, to 16,393.87, the S&P 500 lost 10.82 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,958.59 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 13.72 points, or 0.29 percent, to 4,798.21. \nEuropean shares followed Asia higher. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.4 percent. \nInvestors' increased appetite for risk saw the dollar firm against the safe-haven yen and the euro. The single European currency was down 0.2 percent at $1.1176 while the yen was 0.9 percent weaker at 120.81 per dollar. \nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.1 percent. \nGerman 10-year bond yields rose 2 basis points to 0.70 percent. Germany sold 3.2 billion euros of the paper at an average yield of 0.69 percent, attracting bids worth less than the 4 billion on offer. \nU.S. 10-year Treasury yields were at 2.19 percent, with a slight loss of 2/32 in price. \nBenchmark Brent crude was down 3 percent at $48.06 a barrel. U.S. crude fell 2.8 percent to $44.63 a barrel. \nCopper hit a seven-week high above $5,400 a tonne and was lately traded at $5356.50 a tonne. Gold (Other OTC: GDCWF - news ) fell to $1,106 an ounce.
