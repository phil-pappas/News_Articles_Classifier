First (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) synthesised by a chemist at Bayer more than a century ago, the medicine is already used to prevent heart attacks and has previously been reported to reduce the risk of bowel and other cancers. \nCaetano Reis e Sousa, senior group leader at the London institute, hopes that adding aspirin or other so-called COX inhibitor drugs will one day make a big difference to the benefits the patients get from immunotherapy. \n\"What we would like to do next is set up a clinical trial,\" he told Reuters. \"We will need to persuade a company to sponsor that and we have had some preliminary conversations.\" \nMerck (Other OTC: MKGAF - news ) and Bristol-Myers Squibb both have recently approved anti-PD-1 drugs, while competing anti-PD-L1 medicines are in development at rival companies including Roche and AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN - news ) . \nIn the experiments on mice, details of which were published in the journal Cell on Thursday, researchers used a mouse-specific anti-PD-1, but Reis (NasdaqGS: REIS - news ) e Sousa said he expected the aspirin effect to be similar with human medicines blocking PD-1, PD-L1 and another class of drugs targeting CTLA-4. \nWith future immunotherapy use widely expected to involve multi-drug combinations, adding aspirin to the mix would be one way to help keep a lid on soaring costs.
