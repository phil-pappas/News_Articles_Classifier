Tuesday’s ruling — and today’s decision to fight it — are sure to put the issue firmly on the campaign agenda.\nA spokesman for Conservative Leader Stephen Harper expressed regret Tuesday about the court’s ruling.\n“We understand the government is considering all legal options,” spokesman Stephen Lecce said in an emailed statement from the Conservative election campaign.\n“As the prime minister has said, most Canadians find it offensive that someone would hide their identity at the very moment where they are committing to join the Canadian family. Both Justin and Thomas Mulcair are offside with Canadians on this issue.”\nThe Conservatives would re-introduce a law banning face covering and their campaign will have more to say about the issue in the coming days, Lecce said.\nMore on thestar.com\nAustralia plans to withhold child care payments if children not immunized\nFariza Trinos thought her grandmother was being cared for — until she saw the sores", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T17:23:15.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
