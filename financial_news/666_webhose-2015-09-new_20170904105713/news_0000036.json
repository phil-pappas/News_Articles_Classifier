Slater placed a particular emphasis on PenFed Credit Union’s partnership with DC Habitat. “Whenever something innovative comes along that requires a sharp pencil, a sharp mind, a sharp ability to see the future, and what it could be, we call James,” she said.\nIn his remarks, Schenck said, “Over the past decade, I’ve been to twenty countries but there’s no greater country in the world than the United States of America. The reason is because of communities like this. When the mayor and other government officials, neighbors and business leaders get together and put in sweat equity, they make lives better day in, day out for the communities in which they live and serve.”\nSchenck also noted that PenFed Credit Union is a proud and enduring partner of DC Habitat. The credit union contributed $150,000 toward the construction of the homes and provided teams of volunteers who helped with construction during their off-time.\nAll of the homes feature “passive” construction. The revolutionary concept originated in Germany. Passive homes use a combination of low-energy building techniques and efficient power generating technologies, such as solar energy, so that energy consumption is much lower than that of homes built to traditional codes. As a result, homeowners will be able to consume significantly less energy overall and greatly reduce their water usage. These benefits will not only save the homeowners money, but will empower them to create a more sustainable lifestyle.\n“Habitat for Humanity DC takes a well-thought out, green approach to bring dignity and hope to those who have been marginalized by poverty and homelessness,” said Myers. “Seeing the happiness on the faces of the owners as they took possession their homes was like witnessing a big part of the American Dream come true,” she said.\nAbout PenFed Credit Union\nEstablished in 1935 as the War Department Credit Union, PenFed Credit Union is one of the largest credit unions in the country, serving 1.3 million members worldwide; with nearly $18 billion in assets.
