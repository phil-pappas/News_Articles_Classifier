Vinci has denied the allegations and sued for defamation. \nNon-governmental organisations pursued Western brands over the conditions in clothes factories overseas after the 2013 Rana Plaza garment factory collapse in Bangladesh, which killed more than 1,100 people. The campaigns helped to push companies to contribute to a $30 million a victims' compensation fund. \nFood giants have been forced to review their palm oil operations following campaigns by environmental groups warning of the dangers of deforestation. \nAfter coming under heavy criticism, Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) in 2012 asked labour watchdog Fair Labor Association to assess the conditions for workers at factories of its major Chinese supplier Foxconn. \nNon-governmental organisations, or NGOs, have also alerted national authorities to the ways multinationals such as Starbucks (Swiss: SBUX.SW - news ) or Google (Xetra: A0B7FY - news ) are able to enjoy low tax rates. \n- 'How could they miss it?' - \n\"NGOs have become more professional and stronger,\" said Oxfam charity campaigner Nicolas Vercken. \n\"Ten years ago when we asked for a meeting with the French foreign ministry they expected us to come asking for money for a humanitarian catastrophe,\" Vercken said. \n\"Today they see us for our expertise or because we are seen as a possible nuisance,\" he said. \nThe rising professionalism of campaign groups was illustrated by the Volkswagen scandal: the International Council on Clean Transportation is staffed by former automobile industry managers, bristling with diplomas and sporting ties. \nSherpa, for example, relies on its network of lawyers and legal experts to bring corporations to court with sophisticated legal arguments, said its director, Laetitia Liebert. \nLike other NGOs, Sherpa uses social networks to lend \"strength, leverage and protection\" when it targets big companies, she said. \nFor BankTrack's Louvel, the Volkswagen scandal shows the important role played by NGOs. \n\"But you also wonder how the traditional regulators could have missed it,\" he said. \n\"It's worrying given the small resources that NGOs have,\" Louvel said. \"It is a bit easy to rely on us (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:55:26.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
