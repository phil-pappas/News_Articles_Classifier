Copper is also near six-year lows.\nEnergy and commodity prices have fallen largely because of rising output following heavy investment into new assets while prices were still high, which has increasingly clashed with slowing demand in Asia, where China's economy is growing at its slowest pace in decades.\n\"Over the last month, commodities have become much more vulnerable to macroeconomic headlines,\" said Mark Keenan, head of Asia commodities research at Societe Generale.\n\"The correlation between prices of different commodities is rising because of the influences from macroeconomic data.\"\nSHIPPER FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY\nThe crisis is also hitting the shipping sector, where dry-bulk merchant Daiichi Chuo Kisen Kaisha filed for protection from creditors on Tuesday, with the news slamming shares in rival maritime firms.\nDaiichi Chuo, which has suffered four straight annual losses as Chinese demand for iron ore and coal has dropped, had liabilities of around 108 billion yen ($900 million) as of end-March. It has a market value of just $96 million.\nShares in major Japanese shipping companies tumbled on the news with Nippon Yusen losing 6.5 percent, Mitsui OSK Lines sliding 7.7 percent and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha down 3.7 percent. The falls contributed to a 3.2 percent decline in the Nikkei 225.\nWeakening commodities markets are also hitting currencies from countries that rely heavily on energy or raw material exports.\nIn Malaysia, a large producer of oil and natural gas, the ringgit currency fell 1 percent against the dollar on Tuesday to its lowest level since the depths of the Asian financial crisis in 1998, while in Indonesia - the world's biggest exporter of thermal coal - the rupiah is languishing near 17-year lows.\nAustralia's dollar, closely linked to the country's commodity exports such as iron ore, coal, oil and natural gas, has also taken a beating, losing more than a quarter of its value against the greenback since June 2014, when the current oil price rout began.
