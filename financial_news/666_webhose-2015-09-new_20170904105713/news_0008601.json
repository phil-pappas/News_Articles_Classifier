The former leader of the Texas Jewboys has been stomping on sensibilities since the 1970s. He is best known for sharply satirical, sure-to-offend cowboy songs like “Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns in the Bed” and “They Ain’t Makin’ Jews Like Jesus Anymore.”\n“The Loneliest Man I Ever Met” (Avenue A/ Thirty Tigers), due Oct. 2, is a far cry from his usual iconoclastic ditties. “This record sounds so different from anything I’ve done, you’d hardly believe it’s from the same person,” he says. The two songs with the most outrageous-sounding titles are instead quietly emotional: “A Christmas Card From A Hooker In Minneapolis” is a Tom Waits song; “ My S***’s F***ed Up ” is by Warren Zevon, who wrote it before he was diagnosed with the cancer that killed him at age 56.\nAlong with four of his own quieter tunes, the album includes songs of loss, regret and heartache, by artists he admires: Johnny Cash (“Pickin’ Time”), Merle Haggard (“Hungry Eyes”), Bob Dylan (“Girl From the North Country”) , Willie Nelson (“Bloody Mary Morning”), Lerner and Loewe (“Wand’rin Star” from “Paint Your Wagon”) and Mel Tormé (“A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square”). The album is replete with irony and dark humor—more likely to bring tears than raise hackles. He calls them “interpretations,” not covers.\nListen to Five Songs From the New Album ‘Wild Man From Borneo’ (Kinky Friedman); ‘Freedom to Stay’ (Will Hoover, for Waylon Jennings); ‘Wand’rin Star’ (Lerner and Loewe); ‘Lady Yesterday’ (Kinky Friedman); ‘Pickin’ Time’ (Johnny Cash) This is hardly the fare one would expect from the composer of “Ride ’Em Jewboy,” Mr. Friedman’s mournful cowboy lament for victims of the Holocaust.\n“The thing about Kinky, people know about him from songs like that one,” says actor and musician Billy Bob Thornton, a longtime friend whose 2012 book “The Billy Bob Tapes: A Cave Full of Ghosts,” was co-written by Mr. Friedman. “But he’s such a Renaissance man, it’s impossible to pigeonhole him.”\nDespite the lack of full-blown albums, Mr. Friedman has seldom failed to stay in the spotlight, as a novelist, nonfiction writer, pundit and purveyor of self-branded cigars. He ran unsuccessfully for governor of Texas in 2006 on a platform that promised the “dewussification” of his home state. Last year he ran for agricultural commissioner. When the man who won made headlines by calling to restore deep-fried food in schools, Mr. Friedman backed him up.\nHe has continued to perform his best-known songs in concert and never missed an opportunity to rail against what he sees as the chief evils of the modern world—racial prejudice, anti-Semitism, the Nashville music establishment, corrupt politicians, modern technology and, above all, political correctness. “That’s a term that was invented I believe by Joseph Stalin,” he says, “I’d Google it but I don’t have a computer.”\nMr. Friedman has remained a puzzle to marketing departments in both the music and the book publishing industry. He has written a series of mystery novels—all sly and ribald sendups of Sherlock Holmes narrated by a cranky, philosophizing musician-turned-private-detective named Kinky Friedman. His 20th, “The Hardboiled Computer,” is due next year.\nAnd yet, he has never had a best seller or had a hit song in the record charts. But Mr. Friedman is hoping for a change. “I want this record to be successful,” he says.\nAnd he thinks it has a chance, particularly among Americana music fans and listeners tired of overproduced Nashville fare.\n‘Ride ’Em Jewboy’ “This record is just as sparse and simple as you can get,” says Mr. Friedman. “On this album the songs are not written by a writing team of four or five people who have been associated with somebody who’s sold millions of records. The album does not sound like background music for a fraternity party, which is what’s emanating out of Nashville these days.”\nInstead, tunes like “Bloody Mary Morning,” a duet with Mr. Nelson, sounds “like you’re in a West Texas barroom with some guys who are having a good time and enjoying their lives,” Mr. Friedman says.\nThat may stem in part from the fact that Mr. Nelson catered the session. “I don’t smoke dope really and do it only as a matter of Texas etiquette with Willie. Obviously, he’s the poster boy for pot. He never forgets a lyric or misses a note but my timing gets knocked out.”\nMr. Friedman will be leaving home Oct. 9 to promote his new album. “It will be 35 consecutive shows without a night off,” he says. “It’s Willie’s idea that if you don’t take a day off, you’ll start running on pure adrenaline. I’m real excited about it. It’s great. It almost makes you feel alive.”", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHDdqubE7zQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxVo5mjK4eg", "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/info-KINKY02.html"], "published": "2015-09-29T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:17:49.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
