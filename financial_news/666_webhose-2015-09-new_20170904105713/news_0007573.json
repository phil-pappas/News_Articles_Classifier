He had come to Japan to work for a web development company in 2009 and later got involved with the Bitcoin exchange. \nBackers say virtual currencies provide an efficient and anonymous way to store and transfer funds online. But critics argue the lack of legal framework governing the currency, the opaque way it is traded and its volatility make it dangerous. \nBitcoin's reputation was also damaged when US authorities seized funds as part of an investigation into the online black market Silk Road.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T08:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T08:57:32.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
