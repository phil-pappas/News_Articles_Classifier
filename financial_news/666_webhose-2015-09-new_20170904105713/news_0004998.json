On Tuesday, the department store announced it had bought a 25 per cent share in Topshop Australia, owned by Hilton Seskin's​ Next Athleisure​. The aquisition will see Topshop and Topman concession stores rolled out in 20 Myer stores nationally.\nThe move comes just weeks after the retailer announced it was dumping 100 fashion and homewares brands to make way for new labels in a bid to restore sales. In July, it announced it had signed popular mainstream brands French Connection and Seed, as well as Australian label Aje, and international labels, Jack and Jones, Calvin Klein White Label, and Oscar de la Renta​. Retail expert Steve Ogden-Barnes from Deakin University's School of Business says the move is a positive one for the retailer, which on Tuesday posted a sales growth of 1.7 per cent (1.1 per cent on a same-store basis) for the 12 months to June to $3.1 billion.\n\"I think the problem with Myer in recent years is that it has tried to be too many things to too many people. Of course, that has been the traditional role of a department store, to be able to offer a little bit of everything in one convenient location. The problem is online shopping now offers customers that.\n\"In the past Myer has probably had too many brands that didn't necessarily have traction with shoppers. The Topshop agreement, along with their decision to streamline their fashion brand offerings, will give them a much more focused offering. Importantly, unlike many brands, Topshop has been tried and tested and they know people like it.\"\nAdvertisement Myer will condense its private label brands as part of the new strategy. On Tuesday, the store also announced it would invest $600 million over the next five years on revising its product range, improving its in-store experience for customers and expanding its online store. It hopes the investment will reverse a 20-year decline in sales and return its annual sales growth to more than 3 per cent. It wants a 20 per cent improvement in sales by 2020.\nAssociate professor Karen Webster – a former director of the Melbourne Fashion Festival and deputy head of school, fashion and textiles at RMIT – says Myer's partnership with Topshop, which opened its first Australian store in 2011, is a win-win for both retailers.\n\"Myer had to do something,\" says Webster. \"This is a brilliant move for Myer particularly because its youth brand, Miss Shop, which was really successful for Myer for many, many years has lost its way. Topshop is globally renowned and aspirational for young kids and therefore will reinvigorate that youth customer that it might have lost.\n\"It is also a very positive union for Topshop, which will benefit greatly from some Australian intelligence... I think it's a very positive union.\"\nMyer CEO Richard Umbers said the department store's new strategy was \"built on providing a more focused and relevant merchandise offer to serve a more valuable customer and a better shopping experience for everyone who comes to our stores\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-07T01:39:31.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
