It may also draw on $611 million of standby credit from the International Monetary Fund as slowing revenue from agricultural exports and tourism weigh on government finances.\nYields on Kenya’s 11 billion shilling ($105 million) of bonds due August 2025 have climbed 145 basis points this year to 14 percent. The nation’s local-currency debt has lost 13 percent in the period, compared with the average 2.9 percent loss for 31 developing nations tracked by Bloomberg indexes.\n“Government is way behind the curve on domestic borrowing, and they need the money to fund the budget,” Faith Atiti, a research analyst at CBA Capital Ltd. in Nairobi, said by phone. Higher borrowing costs “will build up fiscal pressure,” she said.\nThe shilling has fallen 14 percent this year against the dollar, reaching a four-year low on Sept. 8, as investors moved money to safer assets in anticipation of higher U.S. interest rates. Wet weather caused by the El Nino phenomenon may curb production of flowers, the nation’s biggest export after tea, an industry group said.\nThe central bank has sold dollars intermittently to smooth volatility in Kenya’s foreign exchange market, while raising its key rate by a total of 3 percentage points in June and July to 11.5 percent as the shilling plummeted.\n“They are compromising on growth to ensure stability on exchange-rate front,” CBA Capital’s Atiti said, “The central bank is now willing to accept higher yields for the sake of the shilling.”\nYields on Treasury bills at a central-bank auction on Sept. 9 rose to 14.9 percent for the 364-day paper, from 13.9 percent the week before. Yields may rise as high as 15.6 percent coming weeks, Francis Mwangi, head of research at Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said by phone. Investors would find it hard to resist yields at those levels, he said.\nFiscal Shortfall “Investors are becoming attracted to the rates government is willing to pay,” Mwangi said. The government will probably limit its domestic borrowing to short-term securities as it doesn’t want to lock in high borrowing costs for longer, he said.\nThe Treasury budgeted to borrow 219 billion shilling ($2 billion) this year in the domestic market to finance the fiscal shortfall, forecast to widen to 7.8 percent from 5.8 percent in 2014, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Last year, Kenya sold a debut Eurobond for a total of $2.75 billion. The IMF estimates that government debt in Kenya reached 49 percent of gross domestic product in 2014, up from 41 percent in 2009.\n“Government has to borrow, it’s a very difficult hand to play,” Aly-Khan Satchu, chief executive of Nairobi-based Rich Management, said in an e-mailed response to questions. “Higher local interest rates coupled with foreign-currency impairment, which makes our hard-currency borrowing more expensive,” are limiting the government’s options, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T08:54:51.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
