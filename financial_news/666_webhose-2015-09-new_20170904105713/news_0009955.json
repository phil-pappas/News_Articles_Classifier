The technological development comes as part of Great Basin Federal Credit Union’s efforts for fraud protection for their account holders.\nVisa Chip Technology is the most recent fraud protection development for the financial sector. There has been an onslaught of fraudulent activity in the state of Nevada, and Great Basin Federal Credit Union has been taking action steps to protect their account holders from fraud.\n“The majority of fraud is not caused by lost wallets. Rather, fraud is primarily caused when criminals steal databases of information and make fake cards. The Visa Chip Technology uses a rotating token so hackers cannot replicate the transaction code to make a counterfeit card,” explains Jennifer Denoo, Chief Operation Officer at Great Basin Federal Credit Union .\nThe Visa Chip Technology uses a one-time unique code for each financial transaction. Because that code is required by the merchant, the probability of hackers copying the financial information of a GBFCU credit card is exponentially less likely than a card without the chip technology.\nThis development by Great Basin Federal Credit Union comes as part of a long-term commitment to the financial safety of the account holders. Great Basin Federal Credit Union has distributed credit cards with Visa Chip Technology to account holders, and the credit union will also distribute debit cards with Visa Chip Technology within the year.\nTo learn more, call 775.333.4228 or visit Great Basin Federal Credit Union’s website at www.greatbasin.org.\nAbout Great Basin Federal Credit Union\nGreat Basin Federal Credit Union has been a member of the community since our charter on January 11, 1951.
