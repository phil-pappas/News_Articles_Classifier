Nonetheless, any rise in rates would be \"limited and gradual\". \nCunliffe pointed to strong growth in the UK to back up his reasoning. \n\"If you look around, the UK and the US seem to be the only places that are growing strongly. \n\"We've had the sharpest drop in unemployment for 40 years, we're starting to see pay come back, we're starting to see productivity come back with a couple of readings that are a bit more positive, consumer confidence is at record highs and this is not a debt-fuelled consumption boom.\" So while one cannot say \"that there's strong upward price pressure. We've got to look 18-24 months ahead but if you put that economic picture together it seems that the next move on monetary policy would be up and is also looks as if it will be a limited and gradual rise when it happens.\" Regarding the impact of sterling strength on exporters in the northeast, the rate-setter explained that what was really needed was stronger growth in the euro area's economy. \nThe external environment on the other hand, that is growth overseas, \"is a bit weaker than it was in net terms,\" Cunliffed added. \n\"On the other hand, in China the possibility of slower economic growth than we'd been forecasting is greater now after what we saw in the summer. What's happened in the Chinese stock markets is a rather different thing but there is the prospect of slower growth in China and the emerging markets look weaker.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T01:19:26.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
