This matches the decline in the ISM manufacturing index in August, as the headwind from a stronger US dollar and uncertainty on global growth seem to be holding back both production and job growth. The current pace of job growth is in our view consistent with the FOMC's condition of 'some further improvement in the labour market'. Therefore, we believe the current uncertainty on the outlook combined with increased financial market volatility and low current inflation rates is likely to sway the Fed to wait a little longer before raising rates. We believe a first rate hike will come in December this year. - Signe Roed-Frederiksen, Danske Bank (Copenhagen: DANSKE.CO - news ) The number of jobs created was less than anticipated but wasn't deemed enough by itself to delay a hike in September. The higher than expected wage growth and drop in the unemployment rate make it on balance a strong report despite the fall in the headline jobs number. - Jasper Lawler, CMC Markets UK The U3 unemployment rate fell 0.2pp, to 5.1%, the lowest since 2008. The broader U6 underemployment rate, which includes part-time workers, declined one tenth, to 10.3%, as the labour force participation rate held steady at 62.6%. We do not see this morning's employment report as changing the outlook for Fed policy; we maintain our view that the FOMC will refrain from raising rates at its September meeting, as we believe committee members will desire more time to assess the effect of the recent financial turmoil on the domestic economy. - Michael Gapen, Jesse Hurwitz, Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) August's employment report is fairly mixed and can be used to make a case for or against a rate hike at the upcoming FOMC meeting. As far aas we're concerned, the September meeting is a 50-50 toss- up. - Paul Ashworth, Capital Economics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T21:24:16.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
