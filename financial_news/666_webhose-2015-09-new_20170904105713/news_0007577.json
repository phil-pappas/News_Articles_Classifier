In his previous role as Global Head of Strategic Investments at RBS, John Davison was involved in the successful turnaround of businesses in the corporate, real estate and shipping sectors. \nThere are €1.9 trillion of non-core and under-performing assets, including €1.2 trillion of non-performing loans, sitting on the balance sheets of European banks. These assets are capital intensive and are ultimately restraining the growth of banks and companies, as well as the economies in which they both operate. Pillarstone's solution helps to unlock bank lending and rebuild companies, supporting local and national economies in turn. \nJohannes P. Huth, Head of KKR Europe, Africa and Middle East, said: \"We are excited to be teaming up with John Davison for Pillarstone. The UK was ahead of the curve in Europe in addressing the issue of non-performing loans, and John's expertise played a big part in that. The combination of his unique business acumen and our ability to provide fresh long-term capital allows Pillarstone to offer a timely solution to banks across Europe in managing specific exposures, including corporate loans, real estate and shipping.\" \nMubashir Mukadam, KKR's European Head of Special Situations, said: \"Pillarstone has commenced work in Italy, working with UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo, and we are evaluating opportunities in other European countries. With John joining as CEO and co-investor, Pillarstone will now deepen and widen its roll-out on a pan-European scale.\" \nJohn Davison said: \"Pillarstone offers me the opportunity to build a scaled international platform to support banks in successfully managing their non-performing loan exposures by turning around the businesses that underpin them with the substantial support of KKR's resources and network across Europe, as well its global expertise and knowledge. This is the perfect time for us to build out Pillarstone which will provide significant economic benefits to a wide range of stakeholders right across Europe.\" \nPillarstone is a portfolio company of certain funds and accounts managed or advised by KKR Credit. John Davison will become a co-investor in Pillarstone. \n- Ends - \nAbout KKR \nKKR is a leading global investment firm that manages investments across multiple asset classes including private equity, energy, infrastructure, real estate, credit and hedge funds.
