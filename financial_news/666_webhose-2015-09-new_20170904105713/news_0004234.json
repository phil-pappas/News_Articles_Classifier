Demand among portfolio sellers and traders -- who had previously provided some support to prices -- was also lackluster, as most short positions had now been covered. Arbitrage opportunities between the two basins had also narrowed on tighter spreads between the Platts JKM and U.K. onshore National Balancing Point (NBP) gas prices. \n\"High inventories continued to result in weak demand from South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan,\" said Stephanie Wilson, managing editor of Asia LNG at Platts. \"In Japan, Kyushu Electric was unable to take delivery of a cargo due to high inventories, while in Taiwan, CPC, the only North Asian buyer to have shown sustained demand for additional LNG in 2015, was recently heard to be looking to defer contractual volumes due to high stocks.\" \nFurthermore, Chinese downstream demand is also weak, with state-owned LNG buyer CNOOC issuing a supply tender, the first sell tender from a traditional northeast Asian LNG consumer, said Wilson. \"Demand is looking uncharacteristically soft leading up to winter,\" Wilson said. \nOn the supply side, there were numerous sell tenders from the majority of Asia Pacific projects, as sellers found it difficult to market extra volumes. Tenders from Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Russia were issued during the month. \nThis is the eighth consecutive month that Platts JKM prices have been range bound between $7-8/MMBtu since declining from the $9-10/MMBtu level seen over January and February delivery. \nMeanwhile, the price of possible competing fuel thermal coal also decreased 21.1% year over year, while fuel oil was also down 60.0% from the same month in 2014.
