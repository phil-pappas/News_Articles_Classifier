By Nicole Blackmore | Telegraph – 14 hours ago 1,217.00 -16.857 \nAsk an Expert: We look at how best to take an income from a £200,000 pension pot \nI have a £200,000 pension pot and I plan to retire next year. I had always assumed that I would be forced to buy an annuity at retirement. \nI am pleased that the pension freedoms mean I’m no longer restricted to annuities, but I’m not sure how best to secure an income elsewhere. What are my options? GB, via email \nYou should be aiming to secure a guaranteed income in retirement to meet your basic income needs. This income should ideally increase to offset the effects of inflation. Guaranteed income could be from the state pension, some company pension schemes and annuities. \nDanny Cox, of the advisory firm Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) , says your state pension age depends on when you were born. There is a calculator at gov.uk/calculate-state-pension , which will tell you when and how much you might receive. \n“Turning to your pension pot, annuities may not be mandatory but they are still the only way you can secure a guaranteed income from a private pension for the whole of your life and your spouse’s life if you die first,” Mr Cox says. \n“'Income drawdown’, currently the most popular way for newly retiring private investors to take their pension income, does not provide a guarantee of income. The pension remains invested and susceptible to the highs and lows of markets and interest rate risks. \n• Four funds that advisers recommend for a 'pre-retirement portfolio' • How we've used the new pension freedoms • The pension freedom mistake that will halve your pension pot \n“However, if correctly managed, drawdown can provide a healthy and rising income over time. Income drawdown generally suits those pension savers who have already secured their essential income. In many cases a mix-and-match of part annuity, part drawdown works well.” \nTo establish which route is best for you, first work out how much income you need to meet the essentials. Then see how far your other guaranteed income, such as the state pension, will go towards this and, importantly, when this will be payable. \nIf there is a surplus from these sources beyond your essential requirements, and you can tolerate the risks involved, income drawdown for the whole pot could be the answer. We have fund tips for drawdown here: Four funds advisers tip for a retirement income portfolio. The City of London investment trust , which has a decades-long record of increasing dividends, is often recommended. \nIf there is a shortfall of guaranteed income, after taking your tax-free cash (normally 25pc of the fund) look to an annuity to bridge that gap, using part of your pension pot. \nAnnuities can be good value when you shop around for the best rates and ensure you qualify for any enhancements because of lifestyle or health issues. The remaining part of your pension pot can go into an income drawdown plan, where the money remains invested and income is taken when needed. \n• State pension age: look up when you will retire \nGot a question for our experts?
