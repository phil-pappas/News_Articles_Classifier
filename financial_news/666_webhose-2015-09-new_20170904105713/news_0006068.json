Tuesday, September 22, 2015 2:15PM IST (8:45AM GMT) (BW)(NY-TARO-PHARMACEUTICAL) Taro’s Keveyis™ (dichlorphenamide) 50 mg Tablets Now Available for the Treatment of Primary Hyperkalemic and Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis Hawthorne, N.Y., United States Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE:TARO) announced that Keveyis™ (dichlorphenamide) 50 mg Tablets, the first medicine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of primary hyperkalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis and related variants, is now available for appropriate patients through its specialty pharmacy partner, Diplomat. Periodic paralysis is a group of rare hereditary disorders that cause episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis .[1] It is estimated to affect approximately 5,000 people in the United States, up to 70 percent of which are currently undiagnosed .[2] “Receiving an accurate diagnosis is a significant hurdle faced by many people living with this often debilitating disease,” said Kal Sundaram, Chief Executive Officer of Taro. “While it may take time to change the current environment, Taro is actively working towards building the disease awareness and understanding needed to make the path for people living with periodic paralysis an easier one.” Beyond the introduction of Keveyis, Taro is committed to learning more about primary hyperkalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis through ongoing research and data publication. The Company is currently working with physician experts in an effort to create a patient registry, which it believes will lead to better understanding of the disease, its subtypes and the impact of Keveyis on different patients over time. To ensure that people who may benefit from Keveyis can get access to the medicine as quickly as possible, and at an affordable price, Taro has also created the Keys2Care patient support program. Taro’s goal is for patients to have little to no out-of-pocket cost. Through the program, people who are prescribed Keveyis are connected with a Diplomat representative who can assist them with navigating any required insurance approvals. It may take several steps to gain access through an insurer. Here’s how Keys2Care can support patients: Keveyis will be provided to patients – at no cost – while insurance approvals are being investigated. For those that do not have insurance, Keveyis will be provided – at no cost – while their Diplomat representative works to secure assistance for them. For patients requiring additional financial assistance, Diplomat representatives will help to identify any co-pay assistance options and support provided through charitable foundations. Finally, for those who qualify, through Taro’s Patient Assistance program, Keveyis will be provided at no cost. Keys2Care services can be accessed from 9 AM – 9 PM ET at 1-855-611-3401.

Your doctor may run tests on a regular basis to check for signs of acid buildup and may reduce your dose or stop your treatment with Keveyis.
