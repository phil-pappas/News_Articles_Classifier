Christopher Pearce by Agnes King Big four professional services firms are ramping up their climate change and sustainability practices at a rate not seen since 2007 when the then Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd ratified the Kyoto Protocol and national greenhouse and energy reporting took effect.\nThe investment indicates that despite Australia's international reputation as a laggard on carbon emissions reduction, companies are moving to mitigate environmental risk to remain competitive in global supply chains.\n\"Back then sustainability was run out of the corporate affairs team, now it belongs to the strategy group,\" Ernst & Young's newly promoted climate change and sustainability boss Matt Bell said.\nEY's domestic sustainability practice has grown to roughly 160 staff, up from 90 when it acquired boutique consultancy Net Balance a year ago.\nMr Bell said the sustainability manager is emerging as a parallel role to the chief risk officer within corporations. While the risk officer concentrates on short to medium term risk, sustainability officers focus on medium to long term threats and opportunities.\n\"All our clients are looking at risk in a very holistic way,\" KPMG global head of sustainability Adrian King said.\nVisiting Australia last week, former European commissioner for climate action Connie Hedegaard told journalists that the world has noted Australia's lack of ambition on climate change ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP21 or CMP11 to be held in Paris later this year.\nThe Abbott government has set an emissions reduction target of at least 26 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030.\n Higher end While criticised by many as lame, the Prime Minister's hand-picked economic modeller Warwick McKibbin has argued that compared to other countries in terms of economic costs, Australia's target is at the higher end of commitments. Even though its emission pledge is lower, economic output will be hit harder because natural resources play such as big role.\nBusiness is emerging as the pace-setter in Australia amid ongoing policy uncertainty, according to chief executive of think-tank and advocacy group Sustainable Business Australia, Andrew Petersen.\n\"Business has always known that climate change would be a big disrupter,\" Mr Petersen said. \"They see opportunities.\"\nClimate change conjures up images of tree-huggers, however, the engagements these advisors work on have very little of the warm-and-fuzzy about them.\nMuch of the work is around \"stranded asset risk\" â€“ the quickly diminishing value of assets that are suddenly on the nose, like coal.\n\"This is not about corporate responsibility, it's about sustainability,\" Mr Bell said.\nSome commodity companies and property groups are struggling to convince major shareholders that diversifying away from a singular asset class is good for value creation into the future.\nStick to their knitting Mr Bell said it is not unusual for big investors to pressure businesses to stick to their knitting even though it means almost certain death in the medium to long term.\n\"[Some] investors prefer to adjust their portfolio to manage risk,\" Mr Bell said. \"They don't want the company to mitigate risk.\"\nThis presents a unique challenge for management.\nKPMG developed a tool last November to quantify \"true\" organisational value when social and environmental impact is accounted for as well as financial performance. It aims to put a dollar value on the consequence of a corporation's economic activities that affect unrelated third parties.\nKPMG has run companies from a range of sectors in Europe, the United States, Australia and Asia through the tool. In some cases, the negative peripheral impact has completely wiped out company earnings.\nMany of these negative factors, such as injuries in the workplace, eventually end up weighing on company balance sheets through taxes or regulatory change.\nKPMG's modelling shows public policy is heavily geared towards punishing bad behaviour, rather than incentivising good practices.\n\"Companies will be penalised for negative behaviour faster than they will be rewarded for positive behaviour, like cleaning up waterways,\" Mr King said.\nCompanies undertake this work predominantly as an internal risk management and decision-making tool, according to Mr King. However some, such as Swiss-based building materials manufacturer Holcim, Dutch passenger rail operator NS Railways, and vehicle manufacturer Volvo, use it to inform public reporting.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/environment/un-climate-conference/subsidising-adani-coal-rail-link-unwise-exeu-climate-chief-hedegaard-says-20150824-gj6ge5.html"], "published": "2015-08-31T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:29:22.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
