Tyrone Branigan Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Mercedes Ruehl Australian investors will put over $5 billion worth of office towers, shopping malls and logistics centres up for sale over the next three months as they react to record prices.\nNext week marks the beginning of the final quarter of 2015. The period has always been a strategic window for owners to recycle capital and sell before the end of the year but the record amount has led some to question whether Australian real estate is nearing the top of the cycle.\nIn portfolios alone Charter Hall Group, JP Morgan, Brookfield and Valad Property Group and a handful of other owners are expected to put more than $4 billion in real estate up for sale by year's end. It follows the strong sales results achieved in the sale of the Investa balance sheet portfolio and the GIC/Frasers portfolio.\n\"The strong level of major transaction activity is being fuelled by record low interest rates, appetite from investors to grow their portfolio and the depth in offshore demand, particularly given the dollar's depreciation,\" JLL's Simon Rooney said.\nMr Rooney said in the retail space owners are seizing on the opportunity to re-weight and redirect their portfolios and disposing of core and non-core assets.\n\"We estimate that with the significant pipeline of major transactions currently underway totalling $2.1bn volumes will reach in excess of $6.6bn for the 2015 calendar year. This represents a slightly lower figure than the record high in 2014 of $7.4bn, but an exceptionally strong year in a historical context.\"\nPrompted liquidations But most of the big transactions in Q4 are expected to be in the office sector. \"Off the the back of the Morgan Stanley /CIC transaction we can definitely sense the increased weight of investor expectations for prices in commercial assets to further condense in the fourth quarter,\" CBRE director Josh Cullen said. \"There is always a fourth quarter rush but coupled with continued low levels of debt and interest rate, we can expect increased investor demand.\"\n Michael Stokes, of CI Australia, said 2015 would be significantly bigger than last year but said there are signs the market could be getting closer to the top. \"The strong results of the last two quarters has prompted a lot of institutional owners to liquidate non-core sub-optimal stock. These can be seen as indicators that a market is peaking.\"\nColliers International, which advised on the GIC deal, is predicting $2.5 billion industrial will transact by the end of the year, with about $850 million of that in the final quarter.\n\"During the sale of the GIC portfolio you saw a number of industrial owners sitting on the sidelines who have now pulled the trigger, such as JP Morgan,\" Colliers director Gavin Bishop said. \"What's different now compared with 2007 is there is a positive spread between cost of debt and return on property, whereas pre-GFC it was negative. Back then the market was driven by debt and it was more localised. Australia is now more of a global market.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/114522070827507984683/posts", "https://twitter.com/mjruehl"], "published": "2015-09-23T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:11:19.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
