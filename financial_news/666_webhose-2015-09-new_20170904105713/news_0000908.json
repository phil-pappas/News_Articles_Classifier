LOUISVILLE, KY, September 25,   The Victorian Group have been encouraged by findings from research by The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. The findings show that nearly 14 per cent of Americans are now in the process of starting or are currently running their own business; the reports display the highest figures in the 16 years the study has been taking place. The Victorian Group believes the recovering economy and entrepreneurial support are factors for the increase of Americans looking to explore entrepreneurship as an option; for the first time the figure sits at 51 per cent. With existing SME's looking to expand, it is a promising statistic that 24 per cent of US firms will be looking to source 20 new employees externally over the next five years. With the confidence growing through growth of SME's it is reported that 80 per cent of those who plan to start businesses in the next three years are doing something about it, such as leasing space or registering their companies. How many start-ups will emerge from such preparation is, of course, unknown.
