For men, graduates earn £25,200 in median income but non-graduates £10,700. \n• Ten best student current accounts: £160 bribe versus £240 pitfall \nThe researchers used anonymous tax data and student loan records for the more than 260,000 graduates who studied between 1998 and 2011, looking at their earnings for the year 2011-2012. \nThe study puts the gender pay gap for graduates in the 10 years after leaving university at around 23pc, whereas the Labour Force Survey , the nation's largest household survey carried out by official statisticians, suggests it is closer to 33pc. \nThe ONS sample is made up of approximately 40,000 households, from around 100,000 individuals who submit responses every three months. \nIn the 10 years after graduation, the top-earning 10pc of male graduates take home £55,000 a year, while the highest-paid 10pc of women earn more than £43,000, according to the research published today. \nThe top-earning 1pc of male graduates earn £148,000 in the ten years after graduation; among women this is just £89,000. \n• \"I paid off my student loan but the deductions won't stop\" \nGraduates tend to also be more \"recession proof\" than non-graduates, the research found. \nIn the four years after 2007, male graduates saw their earnings drop 14pc while non-graduate men's income fell 30pc. For women, graduate income fell 20pc and non-graduate by 40pc. \n\"The 'graduate premium' we identified was maintained through the recent recession, although all groups saw significant falls in their earnings during this period,\" the authors said. \n\"The value of a degree is therefore particularly true for women,\" said Jack Britton, a research economist at the IFS. \"A degree provides protection from low income and shields graduates from some of the negative impact of the recent recession.\" \n• Martin Lewis: time to stop calling student loans a loan \nAnna Vignoles of Cambridge University said: \"This study illustrates the power of using 'big data' to better understand the graduate labour market. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) shows that previously we have underestimated the earnings of top graduates.\" \n• The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:50:20.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
