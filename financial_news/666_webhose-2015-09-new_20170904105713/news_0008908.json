More than 870,000 of these savers will face a penalty of £1,000 more for accessing their fund, while 62,000 savers face extreme charges of 40pc or more if they access their retirement pot. \nPrevious estimates had suggested just 500,000 people would be charged to use the new pension freedoms, but the figures released by the Financial Conduct Authority reveals the actual number to be far higher. \nAround 1.5 million of the customers being charged exit fees are aged under 55 and will be accessing their pensions in the coming years, while 670,000 are over 55 and are already able to dip into their fund as they like. \nMinisters came under further pressure to ban exit fees, a move which The Telegraph has campaigned for through our Make Pension Freedoms Work campaign. \nThe findings are part of an official inquiry into pension freedoms which was launched this summer after Chancellor George Osborne pledged to end retirement rip-offs that prevent people withdrawing money for years after they turn 55. \nThe new freedoms were introduced in April to give pensioners more choice over how they spend their retirement pots, giving them the option to take up to 100pc of it as cash, or use it like a bank account and leave the rest invested. \nFrank Field, chairman of the Department for Work and Pensions Select Committee, said: \"We pushed for this data to be released because it exposes the extent of this rip-off. Insurers stung savers on the way in and now they want to sting them on the way out. For the first time I feel the Treasury is taking this issue seriously and I am very confident that it will deal with it through policy, sooner rather than later.\" \nA Treasury spokesman said: “The Government is determined to tackle unfair exit charges and other barriers that may be preventing people from taking advantage of our reforms to increase flexibility over how they use their pension pots. \n\"That's why we launched an investigation into exit charges and other barriers, and commissioned these reports. We are considering these findings alongside evidence we are receiving from consumers and the industry in response to our consultation.” \nRichard Lloyd, director at Which? the campaign group, said: “The Government must take action to make sure everyone who wants to take advantage of the freedoms can. People should be able to switch without being stung by excessive exit fees if their provider doesn’t offer the full flexibilities.” \nTom McPhail, head of pensions policy at Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) , a pension firm, added: “ These figures will add fuel to the fire of the Treasury’s investigation into the freedoms. Exit fees of £1000 or more are excessive and are very hard to justify.” \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is thought that the Government is considering a 2.5pc cap on pension exit fees but the Telegraph understands that major pension companies have already held meetings with the financial regulator to avoid the \"draconian\" cap on charges. \nMeanwhile the data, which was collected by the FCA also revealed that more than 200,000 Britons have accessed their pension cash following the introduction of rules this year which gave them greater freedom over how they spend it. \nThis is more than twice the number of savers the Treasury estimated had accessed their pension pots following the freedoms. \nExperts say the freedoms have resulted in around twice as many people accessing their pensions than over the same period last year. \nSteve Lowe, director at Just Retirement (LSE: JRG.L - news ) , a pension firm said: \"These figures are breath-taking when you consider the bulk of that money was built up to help people pay the bills in retirement. \n\"But we are concerned that some of those taking the cash may be seeing the £151 a week flat rate State Pension as their safety net without realizing only a minority will get anywhere near that figure when it is introduce next April.\" \nThe watchdog said most savers were taking cash, as opposed to transferring it to another investment, sending sales of annuities, which pay a guaranteed income for life, tumbling to just 12,400 over the same period, far below the 90,000 in the same period last year. \nSeparate data from the Association of British Insurers, the trade body which represents the pensions industry, showed almost £2.5 billion in payments has been made to savers in the April-June period. \nIt also revealed that one in seven insurers force savers to pay for expensive advice if they want to take their pension as cash or transfer it to another company, even thought the law does not require them to. \nLast week this newspaper revealed that Aegon (Swiss: AGN.SW - news ) , one of Britain's biggest pension firms will not allow savers to have access to their pension cash unless they have a financial adviser until April next year at the earliest. \nOn Wednesday Members of the Department for Work and ork and pensions committee grilled the government and regulators about the reform , asking if consumers were being \"ripped off\" by criminals targeting a potential four million people who have access to pots containing thousands of pounds each. \n\"We are seeing activity in this area, but I don't think it's causing more people to come in as potential fraudsters,\" FCA director of strategy, Christopher Woolard, told lawmakers. \nSome 160 cases of possible pensions fraud are being considered for enforcement action, only four of which were directly linked to the pensions reform, Woolard said. \nThe government set up a Pension Wise website to tell the public about options and warn about scams. A fake version of the site has already been taken down. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T02:16:41.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
