Think again By Andrew Oxlade | Telegraph – 2 hours 32 minutes ago 2,840.00 +73.000 \nPlanning on clearing your mortgage with your pension at 55? For most 40-year-olds this won't be the case \nThe 9-to-5 slog has been made all the more bearable for millions of Britons, knowing they will have full access to their retirement savings from the age of 55. George Osborne’s much-applauded pension reforms, which allowed full access to funds from April, mean those who have saved can now turn retirement dreams into a reality, buying that tea shop in Dorset, a convertible car, or simply enjoying fewer hours in the office. \nHowever, this magical retirement age of 55 does not apply to all a fact that very few people seem to be aware of. While pension freedoms have caught the headlines, the Government has been steadily furthering plans to increase the “private pension age” from 55 to 58. \nThat is just for starters. The Government in fact wants the age to be far higher, as we explain below. \nThere are good reasons for doing this, but it has serious ramifications for anyone who is under 50 today. They face a dilemma about whether to focus their saving efforts on a pension, an Isa, or something else altogether, and many may be sleepwalking into a financial planning disaster. \nA study published last month by Partnership, a retirement firm, estimated that more than 600,000 Britons over 40 were planning to pay off their mortgage with a pension. Some will be banking on accessing that money at 55, when the reality is that it won’t happen until a few years later, and possibly even longer. \nI am in my early forties, and when I polled my friends I found that the vast majority having heard so much about “pension freedom at 55” assumed they would be able to tap their money at 55. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) among the engaged, astute investors using our online hub at telegraph.co.uk/investing, 51pc said they knew nothing about the rising private pension age. \nYet many have been piling extra money into either a company pension scheme or have opened a Sipp or self‑invested personal pension. \n• Over 55s at risk of shock 70pc tax bill on pension cash \n• Sarah Willingham: 'We get an unbelievable return from property' \nThe attractions are simple. If a higher-rate taxpayer (those with an annual income of approximately £42,000 or more) puts £1,000 into a pension, it instantly becomes £1,666, because that money escapes the usual income tax (the calculation feels counter-intuitive, but a 66pc boost is the end result of 40pc tax relief). \nUnder the new pension freedoms, you can withdraw a quarter of your money instantly, if you are over 55 (or your own private pension age), and free of tax. The rest can be left there, safely protected from inheritance tax, or taken out in future, tax efficiently, when you are earning less, or you can withdraw it today and pay your usual marginal rate of tax on that money. \nLarge chunks of the population still don’t bother with pensions, but when the incentives are this good, many higher earners are taking advantage, possibly with an eye to using the money for something other than providing a retirement income. \nRobin Stoakley, managing director at investment firm Schroders (LSE: SDR.L - news ) , said this investment may not even be for savers to spend on themselves. “It’s tempting to access the money to help out the kids,” he said. “It’s very laudable but they should make sure they’re not causing significant problems for themselves in later life by doing so. \n“Pension saving should be for exactly that your pension. These issues certainly underline the need to seek good financial advice.” \nNick Hungerford, founder of online wealth management firm Nutmeg, said it was “dangerous” to earmark pension saving for other purposes. “You have to ask yourself, who is going to pay me a salary when I retire? With low interest rates, you need a heck of a big pension to pay that salary.” \nHe said the Government should do more to communicate changes in private and state pension ages. \n= When can you retire? = \nThe Government wants to link your private pension age to 10 years under the state pension age, which is due to rise to 66 by 2020 and to 67 by 2028. \nThe state pension age is due to be reviewed in 2017 and then every five years. The Government has stated an aim that Britons should spend only a third of life in retirement, which will form the basis for calculations. \n• The best way to boost your state pension: should you top it up, or defer it? \nThe Government said in 2013 this “implied” the rise in the state age to 68 would be brought forward to the mid 2030s and the increase to 69 would come in the “late 2040s”. \nAlan Higham, an independent pensions analyst and founder of PensionsChamp.com, said: “It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is likely that those under age 40 may find their state pension age move on to age 70, and thus their minimum private pension age goes to age 60.” \n= What’s the worst-case scenario? = \nThe unknown factor for calculation is how fast life expectancy and longevity projections rise, which will be fed into the pension age formula. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the forecaster that audits government finances and its plans, estimated a worst-case scenario last year. It said the state pension age could, expecting the worst, reach 70 by 2037, 71 by 2040 or even 75 by 2064. Private pension age would therefore rise to 60, 61 and 65. \nIt’s important to underline that this is a gloomy scenario (or optimistic, if you view longer lifespans as a good thing) and far less likely than the central forecast. \nBut there is also political risk that the rules, in any case, could change so that the private pension age is closer to the state pension age (SPA). It’s worth knowing that the Government considered making it five years below the SPA, before deciding earlier this year to go with a decade gap. \n• One excellent reason to sell investments just AFTER they've crashed \nA report produced for MPs at the Work and Pensions Committee earlier this year also said five years was preferable because of the “significant tax relief provided to pensions, increased longevity and the importance of ensuring people do not underestimate the income needed in retirement”. \nThe foil to this is that allowing people to withdraw money from their pensions hands tax revenues to the Exchequer today, giving current policymakers or future governments a reason not to raise the private pension age closer to the state pension age. \nWhatever happens, the point is not to be put off from saving for retirement it’s just a matter of doing it in the right way. In the panel, right, we explain how you should do that and talk to one expert about how she’s doing it. \n= Pension choices: what's the best way to save? = \nAdvisers tend to recommend using a mix of Isas and pensions. Pension saving is attractive because of the tax breaks although these are currently under review, with an announcement likely in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement. \nIsas, where you can save £15,240 a year away from the taxman, are better for those who may want to access the money before reaching their private pension age. \nWe asked Holly Mackay, founder and MD of Boring Money, about her plans. Ms Mackay, who has 17 years’ experience in the investment industry, set up the Boring Money website earlier this year to help people make sensible financial decisions. \nAt 43, she expects the state pension to be “very small and come relatively late in life” for her. She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) is also concerned that governments will keep tinkering with the pensions system and says the new £1m limit on pension pots will be a problem for her and her “peers in middle management”. \nx \n“I balance the nice tax breaks of a pension today against the relative certainty and immediacy of Isas, and invest in both,” she said. “After selling my first business, I also bought a property, which I rent. \n“As a general rule of thumb, I think about Isa savings as long-term savings that can be dipped into and might finance things over the next 10-20 years, such as home improvements, school and university fees and special one-offs. The pensions savings are there for later life.” \nCalculations by Interactive Investor, a broker, show £10,000 invested in an Isa generating a return of 5pc over 30 years would leave you with a portfolio of £43,219. An equivalent £10,000 net contribution, invested in a pension by a high-rate taxpayer would grow to £72,032 under the same scenario, due to the tax breaks. \nRebecca O’Keefe, head of investment, said: “Having taken 25pc tax-free cash of £18,008, the comparative value of a pension is twice that of an Isa, making it a significantly better investment.” \nThe Treasury’s consultation on pension taxation, which ends later this month, also covers the possibility of pensions that work more like Isas.
