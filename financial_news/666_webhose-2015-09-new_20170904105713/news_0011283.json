Conversely, a delayed rate increase would relieve some selling pressure, if only temporarily.\n\"As long as the Chinese growth anxieties are there, the Fed will have to find some other remedy for their itching to raise the interest rate,\" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade. \"All in all, in the short term we could see another leg up for gold, but nothing mammoth.\"\nThe dollar fell 0.6 percent against a basket of leading currencies, largely because investors prefer low-yielding currencies such as the euro and the Japanese yen for better returns.\nDoubts over whether the Federal Reserve will raise rates at its Sept. 16-17 policy meeting have resurfaced in light of persisting market turbulence in recent weeks.\nBut comments from the U.S. central bank's Vice Chairman, Stanley Fischer, last week suggested that a September rate hike remains an option.\nLater on Tuesday investors will turn their attention to a survey of U.S. manufacturing activity, but the biggest focus of the week is the August non-farm payrolls report on Friday.\n\"I think if we did see a very strong number in the non-farm payrolls this week, it would certainly give them (the Fed) an opportunity ... to make their move in September,\" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.\nIn other metals, spot palladium fell 1.7 percent to $587.50 an ounce and platinum dropped 0.3 percent to $1,004. Silver was down 0.1 percent at $14.59.
