That is the smallest audience on record for the Emmys, which aired on Fox. Last year’s Emmy telecast on NBC averaged 15.6 million viewers.\nTaraji P. Henson arrives at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday Photo: Vince Bucci/Associated Press To be sure, the Emmy Awards were going against the NFL juggernaut on NBC, which aired a game between the Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks. That contest drew more than 20 million viewers. Last year’s show aired in August with no regular season NFL game competing against it.\nStill, even with the NFL competition, the numbers are a disappointment. Many awards shows have been seen their audience grow in recent years. For example, the audience for the Oscars has improved in each of the last three years. This year’s Oscars averaged 43.7 million viewers. The Golden Globes audience has also grown as has that of the Grammy Awards.\nThe awards themselves were also a blow to broadcast TV as the premium channel HBO took the majority of trophies Sunday night including Emmys for best comedy (“Veep”) and best drama (“Game of Thrones”).\nWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KJ940_0920em_H_20150920191802.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KJ940_0920em_M_20150920191802.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-21T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T23:11:35.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
