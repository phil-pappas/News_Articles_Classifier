Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey A federal Labor government will pay universities more money per student rather than deregulate fees, in a move that will cost the budget a net $2.5 billion over the first four years.\nIn a policy announcement to be made on Monday, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten will promise that, if elected, Labor will legislate a new student funding guarantee that will remove the need for higher fees and give the university sector certainty.\nArguing that increased education is vital to Australia's economic transformation, Mr Shorten will say that under the plan undergraduate funding will be increased, so by 2018 funding will be $2500 more a year per student than it would be if the Coalition stays in office.\nBy 2018, a university will receive $11,800 a year per student, rather than $9300 under the current trajectory. The funding will be indexed to inflation, meaning it will rise to $12,100 the next year.\nCostings released by Labor that have been undertaken by the Parliamentary Budget Office say the measure will cost the budget $4 billion over the next four years. It will be offset by a decision to limit the growth of demand-driven student places universities have to offer by adhering to the targets of the current government.\nThis will save $1.2 billion over the forward estimates and partially offset the cost of the student guarantee.\n\"Labor will put our nation's future prosperity first. That means investing in our universities, not saddling students with $100,000 degrees and decades of debt,\" Mr Shorten said.\nCase is emphatic He said every dollar spent on university education generated a return of $26 and thus \"the economic case is emphatic\".\nIn May, Mr Shorten promised free university degrees for 100,000 students who studied science, technology, engineering or maths over the next five years.\nAlso on Monday, Mr Shorten will announce an extra $31 million to be invested in Tertiary Education Quality Standards Australia to ensure more students finish their degrees. About one in four students never finish their degree.\n\"A Shorten Labor government will set an ambitious goal to increase the number of students completing their study by 20,000 graduates a year by 2020,\" he said.\nThere will also be a higher education and growth strategy to enable more students from low socio-economic backgrounds to study and complete their degrees.\nLabor will also establish a higher education productivity and performance commission, which would be independent and aim to take partisan politics out of higher education policy making,\nThe Coalition's 2014 budget policy to deregulate university fees while at the same time slash funding to universities by 20 per cent and increase the interest rate on student loans was one fo the most politically damaging measures in that now-infamous budget.\nBroken promise It constituted a broken promise, was unpopular and was rejected twice by the Senate.\nIn the end, then-Education Minister Christopher Pyne stripped the bill back just to deregulate fees but abandoned plans to present it to Parliament for a third time because the Senate crossbench was not interested.\nIn Parliament new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull suggested the policy was dead for now after Mr Shorten asked if he was still committed to \"$100,000 university degrees\".\nMr Turnbull rejected the premise that deregulating fees would cause $100,000 degrees but said all policies would be reviewed as part of the leadership change.\n\"Our cabinet will examine the challenges that we face, the policies that we have. We'll develop new policies,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-09-20T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T18:46:03.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
