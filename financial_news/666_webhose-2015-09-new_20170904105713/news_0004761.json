He added that that SEPL has a proven methodology that has seen it steer many start up firms into fledging businesses giving Stillwater the confidence that it can do things on a larger scale. \nHe mentioned some ongoing projects of investee companies of Stillwater as including Africa's largest audio-visual studio at Adentan, the first island resort in the Ghana at Akosombo, a 40 acre fish farm also at Akosombo and 200 affordable housing units at Oyibi. \nHe further said that the world needed to know that such potentials continue to remain abundant in frontier markets such as Ghana, and challenged other financial institutions to consider investing into start up firms as part of their broad strategy. \nThe new identity was developed by Droplets Africa Limited, a full service marketing and communication firm, wholly owned by Stillwater. \nAlso at the briefing was the Managing Partner in charge of Droplets Africa, Mr. Kelvin Asamoah, who also said that as this is the first time Stillwater was overhauling its logo, the creative challenge was for the team to create a visual identity that is iconic, and unambiguous and will also speak to the next chapter in the company’s growth. \nThe new logo he said adequately reflects that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T00:27:42.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
