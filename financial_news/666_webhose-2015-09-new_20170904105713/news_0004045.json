SAM MOOY by Jacob Greber John Kerin Clinical, dispassionate, ready and willing to tackle any big job asked of him.\nJust some of the first things people who know Scott Morrison will tell you when asked what kind of Treasurer he'll make.\nIf he lives up to even a fraction of that reputation, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will be well served.\nAnd it will be needed. Many serious economists are putting the chance of a recession at about 20 per cent. Ratings agencies have gradually hardened their message that Australia cannot afford much more slippage after what is expected by 2018-19 to be more than a decade of continuous deficits. Australia's AAA credit rating will be sorely tested over the next 12 to 18 months.\nScott Morrison and Malcolm Turnbull have a formidable task ahead. Andrew Meares Morrison has form. Faced by a shemozzle in pensions after taking over the welfare portfolio late last year, he spent little time working out what to do.\nBuilding on his success as the Immigration Minister who stopped the boats, he applied the same methodical and driven approach to turning around the ship of entitlement mentality that became ingrained, thanks largely to the efforts of the former Howard government.\nMorrison spent the summer getting his head around the complexities of retirement incomes and childcare, spoke to the interest groups to canvass their views as well as his opponents and the Senate independents to gauge what was achievable.\nPragmatic compromise The solution, involving targeted cuts to better off self-funded retirees and part-pensioners, grew from Morrison's embrace of a framework worked up by the Australian Council of Social Services director Cassandra Goldie and suggestions from independent senator Nick Xenophon.\nThe lesson? Pragmatic compromise based on hard evidence trumps ideology when it comes to winning over the community and – more specifically, the Senate.\n\"My sense is he's definitely prepared to look afresh at the detail, to take criticism and understand where that is coming from – and that's a very important attribute,\" Goldie told The Australian Financial Review on Sunday.\n\"You need to be a good leader in these roles but leadership isn't about dogged pursuit of a policy where you don't have broad support.\"\nShe suggests Morrison's performance will hinge on the brief Turnbull gives him and is keen to see a shift away from Abbott's refusal to countenance reforms to superannuation, negative gearing and tax reform more broadly.\nGoldie's views matter because she is part of an important trio alongside the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Council of Trade Unions that Morrison and Turnbull can co-opt as part of their mission to win the national claim to economic competence, particularly on tax.\nSpending performance As was highlighted at last month's national Reform Summit, co-sponsored by the Financial Review – improving the government's spending performance and addressing the nation's tax mix is at the heart of preventing – as former Treasury secretary Martin Parkinson puts it – Australia \"sleep-walking into a crisis\".\nMuch has been made of Morrison not being Joe Hockey. Where Hockey was seen as gaffe-prone and a poor communicator, Morrison has won recognition as one the best performers in a troubled government; confident, competent and able to stay on message.\nTurnbull highlighted economic leadership as a primary reason for challenging Tony Abbott last week, re-elevating budget repair as an existential priority for his prime ministership.\nHaving built up the need for action to fix the \"debt and deficits disaster\" left by Labor, Hockey and Abbott sharply reversed course just before the May budget by pushing the eventual return to surplus out into the next decade and unveiling a \"Keynsian-lite\" approach to stimulus across the small business sector.\nThe poll-driven about-face left many in business and the broader community suffering whiplash, undermined Abbott's already-disputed claim to economic competence and set the nation on a path that would leave it without a solid fiscal buffer in the almost inevitable event of another global shock.\nMorrison will need all the skills developed over this career to keep both the economy humming at a time when many worry about whether a global \"secular stagnation\" means growth will be far slower than used to be considered normal.\nPath to success The path to budget success will depend as much on whether he reassures households and businesses as whether he addresses underlying economic and budget realities.\nAt the most basic level, the new Treasurer confronts the same issues that bedevilled Wayne Swan, Chris Bowen and Joe Hockey – a steady decline in living standards, now already four years old, after more than a third of a century of rising economic welfare.\n\"It's not that Canberra has been run by idiots, it's actually attempting to do something really hard, which is turn around the most prolonged fall in our living standards in decades,\" says Chris Richardson, one of Canberra's most experienced budget watchers.\n\"And pulling that off is not going to be the stuff of luck; it's going to be hard yards. It requires community agreement, bipartisanship – all those things that have been hard to achieve for a while.\"\nRichardson suggests the best way for Morrison to crack the living standards issue is to focus on a few key things based around tax reform and competition policy.\nOn the latter, Richardson says the National Party has already done the new Treasurer a big favour by giving Turnbull less room to scrap the effects test.\n\"On tax reform, you might want to focus on the big things to move the dial: there are a couple of different options, including superannuation reform, company tax and the goods and services tax,\" he says.\nBig step Moving from welfare to Treasury will be a big step up for Morrison but he has shown an aptitude for taking on challenges in the past.\nEducated at Sydney Boys High School, with a degree in economics and geography from the University of NSW, Morrison worked for the Property Council of Australia and became chief executive of Tourism Australia where he masterminded the controversial 2005 \"Where the bloody hell are you\" campaign.\nAt home in Sydney's Sutherlands shire, Morrison spent five years as the NSW Liberal Party director. While his political instincts are conservative, he was never seen as part of Abbott's inner circle and is considered to be very much his own man.\nMorrison's entry to the mezzanine level of federal politics was mired in controversy, with another candidate, Michael Towke, initially winning preselection for the safe seat of Cook in 2007 following the retirement of leading moderate Bruce Baird, the father of NSW Liberal Premier Mike.\nMorrison – considered then Prime Minister John Howard's candidate – was eliminated on the first ballot with only eight votes but eventually prevailed after Towke was felled by an extraordinary campaign by the moderate wing of the party.\nMaiden speech In his 2008 maiden speech to Parliament, Morrison talked of the need for the country to \"embrace a new round of economic reforms and of particular significance is the need to reform our federation,\" which he described as being more akin to a \"three-legged dog\" than the three-legged stool of co-operation it should be.\nThe mission that put Morrison on the map as the government's genuine Mr Fix-it – halting the flow of boat arrivals that flourished under the former Labor government – supports the image of a man willing to take on challenges considered overwhelming by others.\n\"There were plenty of people who doubted it could be done but not Scott Morrison,\" says David Gazard, the former adviser to Prime Minister John Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello.\n\"He devised a plan in opposition and followed through in government … that's what he does,\" says Gazard, who believes the new minister will do well.\n\"He is an independent thinker who consults widely, he expects a lot from his staff and he is relentless. He has training in economics and he is used to working under pressure.\"\nFormidable task All of which he'll need in spades given the formidable task that now stands before him. Morrison will need to fashion a credible fiscal strategy in the face of a massive 30 per cent collapse in the terms of trade since its 2011 peak, soft global business investment, the weakest worldwide trade since the global financial crisis and an unemployment rate above 6 per cent.\nEconomist John Edwards, the Reserve Bank of Australia board member and former adviser to Paul Keating, knows better than most what Morrison is now confronting.\n\"Morrison will likely end his weekend with the gloomy realisation that his problems as Treasurer are less likely to arise from a global economic slowdown than from the intractability of the budget problems he faces,\" Edwards wrote in a blog post for the Lowy Institute on Friday.\n\"When looking at the numbers, he will be reminded that under Joe Hockey, fiscal warrior as he is, government spending has on average been growing somewhat faster than it did under his predecessor, and as a share of GDP the deficits have been just as big.\"\nDr Edward's top tip for Morrison? Don't follow his predecessor by relying on an \"ideologically sympathetic\" adviser from business (possibly a reference to Hockey's chief of staff Grant Lovett, a former banker).\n\"By the time they have begun to understand how it works in Canberra, their minister has moved on. If Morrison has the wit to bring in a well-trained, strong economist from the mid-level of Treasury who can help him interpret the world, he will long be thankful he did so.\"\nAs will the nation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T18:46:47.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
