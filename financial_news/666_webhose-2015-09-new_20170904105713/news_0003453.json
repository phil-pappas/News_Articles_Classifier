Getty Images Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires The Australian dollar fell below US70¢ overnight, touching a two-week low after another batch of bad economic from data from China forced selling in currencies in commodity-exporting countries.\nEarly on Thursday the Australian dollar fell as low as US69.89¢, losing more than US1¢ in less than 24 hours and extending the previous day's US1¢ plunge. The dollar has now lost almost 3 per cent since the beginning of the week.\nBy 7am AEST the Aussie had regained some ground, fetching US70.04¢.\nThe trigger for selling was a disappointing reading from a preliminary manufacturing gauge in China on Wednesday.\nThe private Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) recorded its lowest reading since the depths of the global financial crisis, at 47, lower than a consensus of analysts from Bloomberg of 47.5 and worse than its August reading. A number below 50 indicates a contraction in activity.\nThe Australian dollar was sold down along with the New Zealand dollar, the South African rand and Asian-region emerging market currencies.\n\"Investors wanted some good news out of China and when they got that weaker figure it once again hammered home that perhaps that the bottom is not there yet and that kicked off further safety seeking,\" Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at SwissQuote: Bank told Bloomberg.\nStephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA Australia and Asia, said the PMI reading, the seventh consecutive month of contraction was a bearish signal to the market.\n \"This number should be a wake-up call for the RBA [Reserve Bank of Australia] and we're seeing the market react with the Aussie dollar feeling the pressure post release,\" he said.\n\"We're now approaching some significant levels as all commodity currencies tank.\"\nBut Bank of America Merrill Lynch FX strategist Adarsh Sinha and rates strategist Yang Chen say it may not be all doom and gloom from China, with the outlook for steel production in China, which forms the basis for demand for Australia's main exports, iron ore and coal, clouded by easing measures from Chinese policy makers..\n\"There is evidence of stabilisation in property and infrastructure sectors that are the predominant users of steel,\" they said.\nThat stabilisation led the analysts to feel \"comfortable\" with projecting just a further decline in the Australian dollar to US69¢ by December.\n\"The broader macro backdrop for [the Australian dollar] remains negative, especially if the [renminbi] continues its depreciation path and capital inflows into the resource sector slow,\" they said.\n\"But with the Fed delaying lift-off, the RBA sticking to a firmly neutral stance and steel prices looking set to stabilise, we are comfortable with our 'conservative' end-2015 forecast of US69¢.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-09-24T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:10:16.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
