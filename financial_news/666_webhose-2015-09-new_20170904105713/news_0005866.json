The artwork is a memorial to the employees the company lost on 9/11.\nEach soft flame—vulnerable, but nonetheless constant—could also serve as a testament to the firm’s ability to endure.\nThe terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, killed 35 of the roughly 40 employees then assigned to the investment-advisory firm’s offices on the 93rd floor of the World Trade Center’s North Tower. They included David Alger, who was president of the firm and the younger brother of founder Fred Alger, and most of the investment-management team.\nFourteen years later, Alger is thriving in sunny, loft-like offices across town on New York City’s East Side. It is no accident, though, that the space—dedicated to the memory of its lost colleagues—is on the second floor.\n“For obvious reasons, I never want to be on a high floor again,” says Chief Executive Daniel Chung, who in 2001 was a 39-year-old technology-stock analyst attending a midtown meeting on the morning of the attack.\nExpansion challenge Alger has proved its mettle and investment skill in the intervening years. It manages more than $24 billion, up from about $13.6 billion at the end of 2001, and its fund lineup has expanded to 17 mutual funds and 14 institutional strategies, up from just 10 mutual funds at the time of the attack.\nThe firm, a unit of brokerage firm Fred Alger & Co., which was founded in 1964, has maintained a focus on growth stocks. The investment philosophy, set out by Fred Alger, uses fundamental research to identify companies that are experiencing positive changes such as high unit-volume growth, new management, an acquisition or product innovation. Fred Alger, who retired in 1995, returned to lead Alger immediately after the attack and remained until October 2006.\nUnder Mr. Chung, the firm also has embraced change. Mr. Chung, Fred Alger’s son-in-law, joined the firm in 1994, then became its president in 2003 and chief executive in 2006.\nAlong the way, in 2004, the company started its first international fund, and now offers three international strategies with a combined $302 million in assets as of June 30. In 2008, it launched a hedge-fund-like strategy that now has about $200 million in assets. In 2014, the firm opened a London office to handle overseas sales and client service. And earlier this year, the company joined with La Française Group, a French asset-management company, to distribute its products in Europe.\nAlger now employs 160 people, 45 of whom are investment professionals, compared with about 215 employees, including 19 investment professionals, at the end of 2001.\n‘We proved them wrong’ Mr. Chung says he’s proud of where the firm stands.\n“Part of that is what we had to go through,” he says. “Many said we wouldn’t be relevant. We proved them wrong.”\nThe 35 small oil paintings by artist Patrick Jewell are accompanied on the wall at Alger by the list of the 35 victims. Photo: Peter Ross for The Wall Street Journal; Painting by Patrick Jewell After 9/11 hit, seven alumni returned from other jobs or retirement to help rebuild the money manager. A handful of them remain. Among them are Jill Greenwald, a small-cap specialist who left J.W. Seligman and Chase Vista funds to return and who is now a portfolio manager; Steve Thumm, who left a job at a hedge fund and who is senior vice president, head of equity trading and a portfolio manager; and Theresa McRoberts, who left a hedge fund where she was a partner and heads Alger’s health-care team.\n“I knew they could help me teach the next generation how to invest the old way, and they have,” says Mr. Chung.\nThe road to recovery hasn't all been smooth. Fred Alger Management and Fred Alger & Co. agreed to pay $40 million in 2007 as part of the fund industry’s “market timing” scandal. The two companies settled charges that they permitted investors to make short-term trades and permitted late trading in certain funds advised by Fred Alger Management.\n“We decided to move past it rather than to continue to fight it,” says Mr. Chung.\nIf any question lingers over the firm today, it is whether Alger can successfully expand its investment-management talent.\nA key element in Alger’s growth has been Patrick Kelly. Just 26 at the time of the 9/11 attack, he was promoted to portfolio manager in 2004 with no portfolio-management experience. He now manages or co-manages more than 70% of the firm’s assets, including its flagship $5.1 billion Alger Spectra Fund and its $2.4 billion Alger Capital Appreciation Fund .\nMr. Kelly stepped into big shoes. The Spectra fund was run by David Alger at the time of his death, and was one of the most successful funds of the 1990s, says Alec Lucas, an analyst covering equity strategies at Morningstar Inc. MORN 1.67 %\nBut Mr. Kelly has steered the assets impressively, Mr. Lucas says.\nOver the 10 years through August, Spectra ranks first in its large-cap-growth category, while Capital Appreciation’s A shares rank 10th in the category, according to Morningstar.\nLooking for other stars The firm’s other funds don’t have quite as impressive a record, Mr. Lucas says. Through July, all of the Alger funds to which Morningstar awards its highest rankings of four or five stars were managed by Mr. Kelly with the exception of Alger Emerging Markets Fund .\nWhile Mr. Kelly’s level of success is difficult to reach, says Mr. Lucas, the question is: Can the firm find other managers who can prove they can outperform in a market cycle?\nTodd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual-fund research at S&P Capital IQ, says that Alger is trying to diversify and to reduce its dependency on one executive. Such a danger is known as “key-person” risk, Mr. Rosenbluth says. “No firm better understands the impact of that than this firm that lost people in that tragic terrorist event,” he says.\nMs. Maxey is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.
