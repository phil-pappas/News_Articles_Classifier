As part of the new expanded benefits program that began Monday, primary caregivers can choose to work locally for one year following the birth or adoption of a child. \n\"As a professional services company, our people are everything,\" said Ellyn Shook, chief human resources officer at Accenture. \"Ensuring that we have the opportunity to offer our people the joy of celebrating new parenthood while having a rewarding and career-enhancing experience was really a top priority for us.\" More Headlines Wells Fargo Strategist Sees More Stock-Market Volatility \nShook said the program also makes good business sense . \"Engaged employees and being able to retain people is critical,\" she said. \"Last year we invested $787 million training and developing our people, so ensuring that we can get a great return on talent is a top business priority.\" \nAccenture has made a commitment to grow its percentage of new women hires to at least 40% by 2017. The new program also includes doubling the time Accenture provides for back up dependent care, not just for children, but also for spouses and elderly family members. \nShook said another big issue at Accenture is gender pay equality . \"We have a very rigorous process where we look at pay through a gender neutral lens,\" said Shook. \"If there is a disparity, we fix it right away.\" \nShook believes there will be efforts made nationally to equalize pay between men and women. \"I think it has to become the norm, because it makes no sense. If you're going to exclude 50% of the population, women, from your workforce, you're not going to have top talent. And that just doesn't work,\" said Shook.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T14:21:07.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
