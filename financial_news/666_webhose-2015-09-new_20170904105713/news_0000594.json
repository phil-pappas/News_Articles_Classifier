Photo: Josh Robenstone\nAustralian online retail giant Kogan wants to branch out of electronics and become a one-stop digital bazaar for bargain hunters.\nIn a move that will send shivers down the spines of retailers and department stores, Ruslan Kogan says he doesn't want cheap televisions to define his business any more.\n\"We want to be a department store,\" Mr Kogan said.\n\"I had a guy at my place to fix the airconditioning a few weeks ago and he walks in and was like 'oh, so you're Kogan, the guy that sells the TVs'.\nAdvertisement \"I was like 'we'll there's 30,000 products on our site right now and TVs are just a portion of that'.\"\nMr Kogan started kogan.com in 2006 from his parents' garage and quickly grew a multimillion-dollar business selling his own brand of electronics, sourced directly from Chinese factories.\nLater he drew customers by undercutting retailers on third-party products such as Apple and Samsung smartphones.\nBut the company has moved into categories as diverse as fashion and outdoor goods, and the company's outspoken chief executive wants to grow those new arms of his business.\n\"From a financial perspective, they're industries that have much-higher margins than consumer electronics, so it gives us the ability to really smash the competition,\" Mr Kogan said.\nKogan has quietly rolled out private-label brands of sports equipment, power tools, manchester, travel goods and even pet supplies in the past year.\nThe 32-year-old CEO said his private brands were grown at a micro level, with each product assessed for demand and potential.\n\"We'll think 'Is there a demand for towels'? and we'll take a look at the number of Google searches for towels, then we'll look at how much we can get them manufactured for,\" he said.\n\"Then we'll look at how much we can get them delivered to the customer for, see what the other price in the market is, and then say 'go'.\"\nWhile focusing on vertical integration across 15 private-label brands, Kogan is also adding lines of popular third-party brands.\nCore to his success is a back-end bidding system that manufacturers and suppliers use to compete for contracts.\n\"What Amazon is letting the customer do at the front end, we're doing at the back end,\" Mr Kogan said.\n\"You could go onto Kogan and order an iPhone a week, and over the space of a few months one would arrive from France, one would arrive from Hong Kong, one would arrive from the US, one from Singapore.\n\"But from your perspective, when you receive it will come from Kogan.\"\nThe supplier bidding system is now being applied to everything from bottles of Chanel No 5 perfume to Levi's jeans selling at $49 a pair – half the retail price.\nDespite the heavy discounting, Mr Kogan insists they are not selling at a loss.\n\"We don't have the luxury of not making money,\" he said. \"If the jeans are $50, we're making money on that.\"\nMr Kogan still owns the whole company and won't reveal customer numbers or sales figures, other than that they are in the range of \"a few hundred million dollars a year\".\nHe said he wanted the breakdown of Kogan's sales among categories to eventually mirror the general retail market.\nNAB estimates Australians spent $17.4 billion on online retail in the 12 months to July – about 7 per cent of the total spent at bricks-and-mortar retailers.\nThe bank's online retail sales index showed sales declined 1.4 per cent in July, but still 5 per cent up on sales a year ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T02:18:10.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
