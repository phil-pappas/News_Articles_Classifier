Company performance continues to accelerate in 2015 and, as Q3 comes to a close, results have eclipsed 2014 levels. This growth is the direct result of a multi-point strategic national expansion plan. To help drive this plan, Patrick Bet-David , CEO, and Thomas “Tom” Ellsworth , President, reviewed multiple financial firms and sources before securing a long-term commitment from Silicon Valley–based Decathlon Capital Partners.\nJohn Borchers, Managing Director of Decathlon Capital Partners commented,“ We reviewed PHP’s ambitious expansion plan and sustained year-over-year growth. We were impressed with Patrick Bet-David’s passion and executional drive as well as Tom Ellsworth’s history of operational success. We are quite pleased to be a financial partner and look forward to the future.”\nBet-David said, “We have secured a financial partner in Decathlon Capital Partners that enthusiastically shares our vision of the future. I am excited to be working with John Borchers and his team. I am also quite proud to say this is our first financing of any kind as previous growth has been enabled and funded by consistently profitable operations.”\nEllsworth added, “Beyond our ongoing reinvestment of profits in growth initiatives, the commitment from Decathlon Capital Partners enables us to accelerate our strategic plan and invest in programs, technologies and processes that drive expansion, speed and efficiency.”\nAbout PHP Agency\nPHP Agency is a financial services marketing company with a two-part vision: change the culture and diversity of the insurance industry and build the world’s largest financial services marketing company in history.
