Photo: Bloomberg\nChina's exports declined in August, adding to growth pressures facing the world's second-largest economy.\nOverseas shipments fell 6.1 per cent from a year earlier in yuan terms, the customs administration said. The reading compared with a fall of 8.9 per cent in July. Imports dropped 14.3 per cent, widening from an 8.6 per cent decrease in July, leaving a trade surplus of 368 billion yuan ($83 billion).\nThe data highlights tepid demand around the world outside of the US and sliding prices for inputs to China's factories and their shipments abroad. The latest steps to boost growth have included the fifth rate cut since November and the People's Bank of China's unexpected move to devalue the yuan last month.\n\"External demand probably weakened,\" analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc led by Song Yu wrote in a report ahead of the data. \"The explosion in Tianjin port further added some negative impact (though we expect this impact to be short-lived) on both imports and exports,\" they wrote, referring to a blast in the northern port area that killed more than 160 people.\nAdvertisement The exports figure compared with an estimate for a 6.6 per cent drop in dollar terms, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Economists saw a 7.9 per cent decline in dollar terms for imports.\nChina's exports may rise about 2 per cent in 2015 from last year while imports may slide about 10 per cent, according to a State Information Center and China Development Bank report published by Shanghai Securities News last week.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:47:21.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
