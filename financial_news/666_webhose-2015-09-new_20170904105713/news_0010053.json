More Former Lula aide held in Petrobras probe \nBut eight months into the job, Mr Levy is struggling to make much headway amid a slumping economy and a political crisis that has undercut the government’s ability to get anything done in Congress. \nThe sheer scale of the fiscal hole facing Brazil was made evident on Monday when the government announced that — even when interest payments are excluded from the calculation — it was forecasting a budget deficit for next year. \nInstead of proposing new spending cuts or tax increases, it also called on Congress to do the hard work of finding ways to plug the fiscal hole. \nMany economists accused Mr Levy and his economic team of effectively giving up on their efforts to restore fiscal order. “The government is apparently throwing in the towel and is now enjoining Congress in the quest to identify additional revenue sources,” said Alberto Ramos, an economist with Goldman Sachs, in a note. Siobhan Morden at Jefferies in New York said the government was “admitting defeat”. \nStandard & Poor’s and Moody’s, the two main credit rating agencies, have both held off reducing Brazil to below an investment grade rating, while they waited to see the results of Mr Levy’s budget-cutting efforts. \nHowever, with Brazil’s debt-to-GDP ratio having risen from 53.4 per cent in 2011 to 64.5 per cent and with some forecasts suggesting it will soon reach 70 per cent, some economists expect a downgrade in the coming months. Since the 1990s, Brazilian governments have used the concept of a primary budget balance — which excludes interest payments — to measure their fiscal performance. Even though they have not always succeeded, Brazilian leaders have at least set themselves the target each year of achieving a primary surplus. \nHowever, the government acknowledged on Monday that even that was unrealistic, and forecast a primary deficit of 0.5 per cent of GDP for 2016. It was the second time they have issued a significant reduction in their budget forecasts in a matter of weeks. Including interest payments, the current deficit is about 8.8 per cent of GDP. \nThe harsh political reality is that Mr Levy has little room for manoeuvre. The state has already raised tax rates sharply over the last couple of decades and with the economy now in recession, vice-president Michel Temer said on Monday that “there is no space to increase taxes”. \nHowever, officials pointed out on Tuesday that more than 90 per cent of public spending is predetermined, principally pensions, salaries, health and education, which could only be restrained after bruising and complex political battles. \nMansueto de Almeida, a researcher at Ipea, a public think-tank, says that the measures introduced so far by the government represent only 10 per cent of what needs to done to bring the deficit under control. \n“Everyone is in favour of the fiscal adjustment as long as someone else pays the bill,” he says. “If we fail to do the fiscal adjustment, then everything else in the economy is at risk.” \nMr Levy’s inability to make much of an impact on the deficit is a reflection of the broader weakness of the government — Ms Rousseff’s approval rating has fallen as low as 7.7 per cent. Political clumsiness has only added to the problems. Brazilian papers carried a leaked plan last week to reintroduce a controversial financial transactions tax, before even some senior members of the government had been informed. After an angry backlash that included allies in Congress, Ms Rousseff withdrew the plan only days later. \nThe finance minister has avoided much of the blame for these missteps, but that has not stopped renewed speculation about whether Mr Levy will stay in the post much longer. Since he joined the government in January, he has been sharply criticised by Ms Rousseff’s Workers party for his appeals for austerity. He is now also being attacked from the right, with the head of the São Paulo industry federation Paulo Skaf calling him the “minister of unemployment ”. \nFrom 1995 to the end of last year, Brazil had only three finance ministers as hyperinflation gave way to a prolonged period of stability. Dilma Rousseff, the president, who faces calls for her own resignation, continues to support Mr Levy. It is a measure of the current crisis that the finance ministry could again become a political lightning rod. Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
