The FCC Enforcement Bureau found that Lyft customers were not able to easily opt out of receiving calls or texts, and couldn't use the company's services without opting in. For the First National Bank, customers had to receive marketing text message to use the company's online banking and use bank cards through the mobile Apple Pay system. \"Consumers have the right to choose whether they want marketing calls and texts to their cell phones,\" said Travis LeBlanc, Chief of the FCC Enforcement Bureau. \"Today, we again make clear that such calls and texts are unlawful without express written consumer consent.\" The citation is meant to warn the companies and if they continue the FCC says it may impose sanctions for the violations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T17:03:59.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
