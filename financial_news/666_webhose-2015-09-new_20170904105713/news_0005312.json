The official date for Crestone is now expected to be months away, with a date in March said to reflect a worse case scenario.\nSome progress has been made on the systems changeover, but UBS global wealth management vice-chairman Alain Robert is again in Australia as the firms attempt to navigate the separation. The decision to spin-off the division came after UBS considered shutting it and wealth boss Mike Chisholm opted instead to lead a buyout of the local division.\nAmid all the uncertainty many existing UBS advisers, who have committed to staying on with Crestone, have not been able to open new client accounts.\nMuch of the delay is thought to have been caused by Crestone seeking its own financial services license, which would also require the transfer of assets. While the situation is fluid, a live option is that Crestone acquires the UBS license to circumvent the transfer.\nUnder the buyout arrangement announced in May, Crestone will draw on UBS economics and equities research and be given access to capital markets deals for its clients.\nIt's understood Brisbane-based adviser Mark Harris has left UBS to join Macquarie Private Wealth.\nA t least 10 advisers have already jumped from the UBS Crestone ship for other firms . They have landed at companies including Bell Financial Group, Koda Capital, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, while some have opted to join their former UBS colleagues at Escala in Melbourne.\n Crestone has indicated it will operate in the wholesale investor part of the market.\nStreet Talk first revealed UBS Wealth advisers were working on an MBO in February, which came after the firm decided to stop servicing clients that had less than $1 million invested.\nNews of the adviser departures came after Crestone chief executive Mike Chisholm said that he had received indications from all of UBS Wealth Management's advisers that they were \"keen\" to join Crestone.\n\"There are roughly 100 advisers employed at UBS Wealth Management and we have now received indications from 100 per cent of them that they are also keen to come over to Crestone,\" Chisholm told The Australian Financial Review in May.\nElsewhere in buyouts, the spin-off of Wilson HTM from its listed parent completed in July, and Duncan Gamble and James Ferrier are understood to have joined the former's board last week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T01:02:48.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
