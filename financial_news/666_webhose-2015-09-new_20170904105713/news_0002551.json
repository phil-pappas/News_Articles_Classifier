A Reuters poll had predicted a dip to 54.1.\nThe headline index has been above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction since mid-2013.\n\"Exports are under pressure from Asia and that has lowered overall demand. Even in the U.S., there is a fair amount of import substitution,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit.\nFears of China's economy cooling rapidly, coupled with authorities there devaluing the currency, spooked financial markets last month. Stocks and commodities both fell.\nWilliamson said the PMI pointed to third-quarter euro zone GDP growth of 0.4 percent, similar to the consensus from a Reuters poll of economists earlier this month.\n\"This isn't runaway growth by any means and suggests the ECB is going to be a little disappointed with the results it's getting from its quantitative easing programme,\" Williamson said.\nThe employment sub-index came in at an eight-month low.\nThere are signs business growth could pick up speed, Williamson added. Backlogs of work rose to the highest since mid-2011.\nA manufacturing PMI fell to 52.0, matching expectations but down from 52.3, as export orders growth slowed. The sub-index measuring factory output, which feeds into the composite PMI, fell to a four-month low as a result.\nThe euro zone's dominant service industry PMI dipped to 54.0 from 54.4 last month. Economists had predicted 54.2.\nService companies were able charge higher prices for the first time in over four years, suggesting disinflationary pressures may be ebbing in the euro zone.\nThat will be welcome news to ECB policymakers struggling to get inflation close to its target of just below 2 percent. It was 0.1 percent in August.\n(Detailed PMI data are only available under licence from Markit and customers need to apply to Markit for a licence.\nTo subscribe to the full data, click on the link below: www.markit.com/Contact-Us\nFor further information, please phone Markit on +44 20 7260 2454 or email economics@markit.com) (Editing by Larry King)", "external_links": ["http://www.markit.com/Contact-Us"], "published": "2015-09-23T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T11:52:08.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
