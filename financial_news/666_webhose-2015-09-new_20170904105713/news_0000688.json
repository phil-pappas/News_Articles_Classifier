The portal -- www.advantage.jharkhand.gov.in -- will allow seamless integration with portals of various government departments by eliminating the need to sign in multiple times, as well as creating separate login credentials for different departments. The feature is currently available for using services of the industries department, commercial tax department, labour department, industrial area development and the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board. Other departments shall be included soon. Chief Minister Das said there was a need to provide time-bound facilities to attract investors to the state and generate employment for the prosperity of the people of Jharkhand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T18:13:47.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
