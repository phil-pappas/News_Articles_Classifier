Earlier this week, taxi drivers in Australia staged a protest in Melbourne against the startup, while São Paulo’s city council banned the use of Uber in Brazil’s largest city.\nFor his part, Kalanick defended his company by saying it paid better salaries and offered more flexible hours than the traditional taxi industry, media reports said.\nOne Twitter user who said she was in the audience applauded Colbert’s approach to the protest:\nBut I understand why they didn't show it all. I'm just glad I got to witness it and see in person just how phenomenal Stephen Colbert is.\n— Sarah (@falpal_sarah) September 11, 2015 Kalanick appeared on Thursday’s show along with Joe Biden .\nEarlier in the week, Tesla’s TSLA, +0.15% Elon Musk and Jeb Bush faced Colbert’s questions.\nMarketWatch has written about questions that Colbert should have asked in his first week helming “The Late Show,” as well as covered investing lessons from “The Colbert Report,” his erstwhile Comedy Central show.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/falpal_sarah/status/642199402656960513", "http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/18/uber-worst-company-silicon-valley", "http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/10/media/stephen-colbert-uber-protester/index.html", "http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/brazil-taxi-drivers-protest-uber-33631386", "http://uk.businessinsider.com/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-just-got-heckled-during-taping-of-the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert-2015-9?r=US&IR=T"], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T16:33:04.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
