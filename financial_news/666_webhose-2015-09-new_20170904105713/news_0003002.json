Gabriele Charotte by Joyce Moullakis Macquarie Group's shares rallied strongly in early trading on Monday, after the financial services behemoth said profit would jump 40 per cent in the six months ended September 30, stoking more bullishness on the full-year result.\nMacquarie attributed the strong performance in its first-half ended September 30 to improved conditions across businesses including Macquarie Securities, its equities arm, and Macquarie Asset Management, which benefited from \"strong performance fees\", a statement to the Australian stock exchange said. A depreciating Australian dollar also buoyed the result.\nThe statement outlined that Macquarie's second half would be \"broadly in line\" with the six months ended September 30, and that its asset management division would generate lower performance fees in the latter half. The company also cautioned that the outlook was subject to conditions including market conditions and fluctuations in currencies.\nMacquarie stuck to its previous guidance for the full year ended March 31, 2016, reiterating that profit would be up on this year's $1.6 billion result. The guidance provided on Monday did, however, provide for a more bullish take on full-year earnings.\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs said the upgraded guidance implied that 2016 full-year profit would print about 7.5 per cent ahead of their current forecasts and 2.2 per cent ahead of Bloomberg consensus.\nAnalysts polled by Bloomberg were penciling in an annual result of $1.86 billion, a record full-year profit for Macquarie.\n\"MQG (Macquarie) continues to exhibit strong earnings momentum, which is highlighted by today's upgrade to FY16 guidance,\" the Goldman analysts said in a note to clients.\nThe stock climbed 2.97 per cent to $78.05 at 11:50 am in Sydney trading, as investors cheered more upbeat detail around earnings guidance.\n Macquarie's chief financial officer Patrick Upfold will make the presentation, lodged with the ASX, at the CLSA Investors' Forum in Hong Kong this week. It showed that earnings guidance for Macquarie's six operating groups remained unchanged since its July annual general meeting.\nIn July, Macquarie moderately upgraded its 2016 guidance by saying profit in the year ended March 31, 2016, would be up on this year's result. The company ditched the word \"slightly\" from previous guidance as the first quarter benefited from hefty performance fees, asset disposals, a weaker Australian dollar and volatile market conditions.\nMacquarie reports its first-half earnings on October 30.\n.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:08:03.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
