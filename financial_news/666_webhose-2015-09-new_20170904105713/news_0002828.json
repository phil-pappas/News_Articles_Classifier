In Canada, the government reported inflation held steady in August, in line with expectations, leaving the Fed move as the main catalyst for Canadian markets. \"I think you need a pretty significant deviation (in inflation) to have it have a large impact on the currency, given that we're still working through the fallout from yesterday's (U.S. Federal Reserve) meeting,\" said Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. At 8:51 a.m. ET (1251 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading at C$1.3030 to the greenback, or 76.75 U.S. cents, stronger than the Bank of Canada's official close of C$1.3174, or 75.91 U.S. cents. * The currency's strongest level of the session was C$1.3013, its strongest since Aug. 13, while its weakest level was C$1.3183. * The Canadian dollar was outperforming most of its key currency counterparts, though not its commodity-related cousins the Australian and New Zealand dollars. * U.S. crude prices fell 2.6 percent to $45.69 a barrel, while Brent crude lost 1.2 percent to $48.51. * Canadian government bond prices were higher across the maturity curve, with the two-year price up half a Canadian cent to yield 0.479 percent and the benchmark 10-year rising 18 Canadian cents to yield 1.513 percent. * The Canada-U.S. two-year bond spread was -19.9 basis points, while the 10-year spread was -64.7 basis points.
