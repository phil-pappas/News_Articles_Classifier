So far, only the US, Japan, Russia and Europe have launched a space observatory.\n“Well done @isro. This is one more grand accomplishment for Indian science & our scientists,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who is now on a visit to the US, said in a tweet.\nDeclaring the launch successful amid cheers from the assembled scientists, a beaming ISRO Chairman A S Kiran Kumar said PSLV had put in an astronomy mission which is being looked at not only within the country but also globally to bring in new information to scientific community.\n“I congratulate the entire ISRO community for the wonderful job they have done,” he said addressing the gathering at the Mission Control Centre. ASTROSAT has reportedly cost USD 27 million to build.\nIt was for the first time that India launched US satellites–four in all–belonging to a San Francisco-based company, under an agreement signed with Antrix Corporation Ltd, the commercial arm of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).\nWith a lift-off mass of about 1,513 kg, ASTROSAT was first injected into a 650 km orbit by PSLV-C30, followed by the other six satellites in the space of about three minutes.\nInternational customer satellites that piggybacked the polr rocket were the LAPAN-A2 of Indonesia meant for maritime surveillance using Automatic Identification System (AIS), and maritime monitoring nanosatellite from Canada, NLS-14 (Ev9), which uses ‘next generation’ AIS.\nThe rocket, one of world’s most reliable launch vehicles which clocked its 30th successful mission in a row today, also carried four identical LEMUR nano satellites of a Spire Global Inc., San Fransisco, US, that were non-visual remote sensing satellites ‘focusing primarily on maritime intelligence through vessel tracking via’ the AIS, ISRO said.\nWith this, a total of 51 satellites belonging to global customers from 20 countries, including Germany, France, Japan, Canada, U.K, have been launched successfully by ISRO so far.\nPost the successful injection of ASTROSAT into the orbit, ASTROSAT Project Director K S Sarma said it was “healthy and doing well”. It has a mission life of five years.\n“This satellite is very unique as we have sophisticated and sensitive astronomical equipment”, he added.\nASTROSAT will observe the universe in optical,ultraviolet low and high energy X-ray regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, while most other scientific satellites are capable of observing a narrow range of wavelength band. It will send back data and study parts of the universe including black holes and the magnetic fields of stars.\n 29, 2015 7:30 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T01:49:56.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
