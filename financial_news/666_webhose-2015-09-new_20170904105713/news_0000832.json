Cassano, who is leaving for personal reasons, formally tendered his resignation to the board of directors on Friday. Chairman Luca Cordero di Montezemolo will fill the role until the board appoints a new CEO.\nCassano had been named CEO of the “New Alitalia” in September 2014 after the Italian flag carrier closed a major investment deal with Etihad Airways to return the carrier to profitability. Under Cassano’s leadership, Alitalia began the first stage of its business transformation program.\nThe long-mooted deal between Etihad Airways and Alitalia came to fruition Aug. 8, 2014 in a complex transaction worth €1.75 billion ($2.35 billion), which saw the Abu-Dhabi-based carrier take a 49% stake in Alitalia for €387.5 million.\nIn June 2015, Alitalia introduced a new brand , aircraft livery and visual identity on an Airbus A330-200 as the carrier revitalizes its business. It also announced product upgrades across all classes of service on its international widebody fleet.\n“We will now move into the next phase of our business transformation strategy under new leadership,” Montezemolo said in a statement.\n“The company will announce a new CEO in due course. In the interim, Mr. Cassano’s daily responsibilities will be split between Alitalia’s COO Giancarlo Schisano and CFO Duncan Naysmith, with both reporting directly to me, until the new CEO is appointed,” Montezemolo said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T18:26:17.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
