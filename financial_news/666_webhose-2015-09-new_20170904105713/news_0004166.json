PUBLISHED: 11:39, Thu, Sep 10, 2015 | UPDATED: 11:44, Thu, Sep 10, 2015 GETTY Morrisons is closing 11 supermarkets \nThe cull comes on top of 10 supermarkets already shut earlier this year, as the retailer continues to dwindle in the face of competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl. Customers now expect bargains and don't look likely to change shopping habits, which means it is difficult to raise prices and increase profits, Morrisons said today. The retailer would not reveal the locations of the stores ear-marked for closure, as staff have only just been told of the news. The move will cost £20 million, but will save the company over the longer term. It comes as pre-tax profits at Morrisons' plummeted by almost half to £126 million in the six months to August 2. At the same time, like-for-like sales dropped 2.7 per cent compared with the same period last year.Boss David Potts said: \"With great regret we are proposing to close 11 supermarkets. This is a difficult decision but one which we cannot see any way through to make those stores viable.\"\"This will be a long and challenging journey but an important one for one of Britain's great retailers.\"The retailer is also selling 140 of its local convenience stores for around £25 million in an effort to concentrate trade on its larger supermarkets.

The brand has only opened one new store this year has no plans for any more over the next year. Discounters Aldi and Lidl have raised the pressure on Morrisons and Britain's three other biggest supermarkets Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's. In a statement Morrisons said today: \"We have seen no change in shopping habits, with customers continuing to shop around for value and shopping more frequently.\"In addition, as we continue to lower prices, deflation has been a consistent recent feature of our LFL (like-for-like sales).\"Although some commentators predict the return of food price inflation, driven perhaps by higher global commodity prices, we expect deflation to continue as we keep investing in our proposition.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T13:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T16:19:48.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
