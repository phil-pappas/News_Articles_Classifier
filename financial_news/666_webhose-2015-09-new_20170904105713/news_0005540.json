Most other euro zone yields were down 5-9 bps.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve prolonged the era of nearly free money last week by declining to raise its interest rates, citing global economic risks.\n\"I'm not too convinced that they are signalling they are ready to do something in October, but it does support our view that, if nothing changes between now and December, the ECB may have to add more stimulus,\" said Elwin de Groot, senior market economist at Rabobank.\nTo some analysts, the U.S. economy looked robust enough to justify a hike, but the dent to the global inflation outlook caused by a slowdown in China and a steep fall in oil and commodity prices tilted the balance against what would have been the first hike in almost a decade.\nAtlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on Monday that the decision had largely been a \"risk management\" exercise to ensure that recent market volatility would not drag on the U.S. economy.\nHe still expected the Fed to raise rates later this year.\nThe spread between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and their lower-yielding German counterpart has widened by almost 15 bps this month to just over 150 bps, reflecting the divergence between monetary policy outlooks in the two regions.\nSpanish 10-year yields were down 4.1 bps at 1.96 percent, while Portuguese yields rose 1.6 bps to 2.60 percent.\nIn Spain, investors worry that a win for secessionists in a regional election in wealthy Catalonia on Sunday could trigger political instability.\nThe head of Catalonia's regional government said a unilateral split from Spain was unstoppable unless the central government agreed to call a binding independence referendum.\nIn Portugal, an election on Oct. 4 is likely to produce a hung parliament.\nOn the supply side, the Netherlands raised 2.8 billion euros at a three-year bond auction. The April 2018 bond was launched in January and has never traded with a positive yield.
