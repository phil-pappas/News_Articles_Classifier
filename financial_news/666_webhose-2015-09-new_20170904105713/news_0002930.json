Banks have Rs 1,350 crore exposure to Chennai-based Surana.\nThe company was referred to corporate debt restructuring (CDR) a year ago but it failed to revive.\nLenders said the promoter failed to bring in the funds proposed in the revival package. However, company executives said banks stopped providing working capital loans which led to a financial crunch.\nThe promoter had to infuse Rs 32 crore in the company as per the CDR package. The lenders to Surana, led by IDBI Bank , met here on Tuesday to discuss options to revive the company. The meeting, however, remained inconclusive as not all lenders gave their consent to the proposal, the bankers cited earlier, who were present at the meeting, told ET. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T03:18:08.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
