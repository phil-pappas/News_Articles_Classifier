David Rowe Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro Has Slater & Gordon 's managing director Andrew Grech finally convinced investors the embattled law firm has survived the intense scrutiny of regulators and short-sellers?\nSlater & Gordon's share price has gained about 11 per cent to $3.28 since the company released its results, a sign the profits have allayed concerns of at least some investors.\nBut Grech's unaudited accounts have so far only served to further entrench already strong views of the longs and shorts in this fierce battle.\nThe shareholders Grech thanked for sticking by him would no doubt be warmed by the solid profit number and increased transparency around the company's accounts that shows they have \"nothing to hide\". The outlook was bullish while the commentary about the accounting changes that Slaters agreed to with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission was welcomed.\nUsing Slater & Gordon's newly created cash profit proxy \"EBITDAW\" – that's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and movements in work and progress – for 2015-16, which will be the first full year of ownership of the Quindell PSD business, guidance was given for profit of $205 million.\nThat is an indication management is confident of the outlook and its ability to integrate its new asset.\nInstincts, analysis on track The bears naturally see things differently. To them the release of a complex and confusing \"4E\" validated that their instincts and analysis were on track. The role of \"gain on bargain purchase\" in lifting both 2015 and 2014 restated earnings has been picked up the sceptics. The $42 million gain is equivalent to half of the company's reported net profit after tax of $82 million.\n The Australian Financial Review was told by several analysts they were battling to reconcile the statutory accounts with some of the numbers shown in the investor presentation. With three accounting changes forced on the company by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission , there are plenty of questions to replace the answers. They'll wait to clarify these issues with the company before deciding whether Slater & Gordon is a bargain at its current price.\nSome analysts believe the 2015 earnings guidance of $205 million shows just how bullish Grech is on the PSD business. The divisional breakdowns show that, all things being equal, PSD will need to swing from a $5 million loss for the period Slaters has owned it, to a healthy profit.\nDeutsche Bank numbers suggest group EBITDA will need to more than double from $122 million to $305 million to hit the number before adjusting $100 million for the contribution of work in progress (that is the $205 million number, which excludes movements in WIP). If Mr Grech is able to deliver this, it will indeed mark an incredible turnaround for a Quindell PSD business (now renamed Slater & Gordon Solutions) that caused many to scratch their heads when Slaters paid $1.3 billion to buy it.\nAmong the sell-side analysts there's still division as to the direction of Slater & Gordon.\nDebt levels a worry Bank of America, which has been the most bearish, is worried about debt levels. Slater reported a surprise rise in debt levels to $623 million – above the board's defined gearing threshold. This is a concern because free cash flow from operations was just $18 million, Bank of America analysts say. In fact, it seems this number may have been a mere $2 million for the second half of the year.\nUBS, which has a neutral rating on the stock, pointed to several questions it would like answered. These include understanding the variation in statutory and normalised numbers, the decline in operating cash flow, the increase in debt, intangibles and the impact of new accounting treatments. These may be addressed in late September, early October when the company hosts an investor day to explain the accounting changes.\nDeutsche analysts, who lowered their price target from $8 to $5 to reflect the market and management focus on cash conversion, are more upbeat. They say better disclosure and transparency gives them comfort that management will hit their guidance. While analysts are still trying to reconcile these numbers, the company showed it had grown organic earnings by 11 per cent in 2015, which \"should go some way to addressing market concerns about acquisitions masking organic revenue declines\".\nBut many in the market are reserving judgement until the largest lingering uncertainty is removed.\nAfter eight weeks of intense investigation, ASIC still does not appear entirely satisfied with the financial reporting of Slater & Gordon. Management expects the issues to be resolved quickly and investors await the apparent formality of an external auditor validating the accounts.\nUntil then, both the bulls and the bears have plenty to feast on.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-09-01T10:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:25:00.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
