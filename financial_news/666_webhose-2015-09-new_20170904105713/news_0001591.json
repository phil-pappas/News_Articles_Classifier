Jane Dyson by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Two smaller block trades that have flown under the radar in the past two months are the UBS stake in Bell Financial Group and Deutsche Bank's holding in Wilson Group.\nFor both investment banks the strategic relationships have lapsed on the retail side, with Bell having partnered with Citigroup and Wilson having spun off its broker unit.\nWell-placed sources have suggested UBS is shopping its 16 per cent stake in Bell around, as the former also seeks to maintain ties to its wealth unit when it divorces next year.\nUBS Wealth Management is being acquired by staff and rebranded as Crestone . UBS may, however, look to hold fire on its Bell stake as similar to the broader market the stock has pulled back this year.\nFrom a peak of 55¢ in March, Bell's shares closed at 43¢ on Wednesday.\nDeutsche on the other hand, still holds about 18.6 per cent in Wilson, now a funds management company.\nDeutsche also took a 20 per cent stake in the standalone Wilson HTM, led by Brad Gale, to maintain its retail broking distribution relationship.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:10:41.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
