Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Royal commissioner Dyson Heydon has left open the possibility of Bill Shorten having to re-appear before the trade union inquiry, a day after announcing that disgraced union leader Kathy Jackson will not be recalled.\nThe commission announced on Thursday that it would conduct another 10 days of hearings into the Labor leader's former union, the Australian Workers' Union, in Sydney between October 12 and 23.\n\"At this stage, the commission does not propose to recall Mr Shorten as a witness,\" the commission said.\n\"However, during the course of the inquiry, affected parties may seek authorisation to cross-examine Mr Shorten.\n\"In the event that such an application is made, it will be considered in due course.\"\nOpposition workplace relations spokesman Brendan O'Connor slammed the commission's decision, announced on Wednesday, that Ms Jackson, the former Health Services Union national secretary, would not have to make a second appearance.\nLabor 'astounded' ACTU secretary Dave Oliver has accused the commission of giving Ms Jackson \"special treatment\" when she previously gave evidence. Ms Jackson is attempting to appeal a damning court judgment that found she had siphoned about $1.4 million from the HSU.\n Mr O'Connor said on Thursday that Labor was \"astounded\" that the commission had decided not to recall Ms Jackson to give evidence.\n\"The decision by Dyson Heydon not to call Kathy Jackson means any pretence the commission had of independence vanishes,\" he said\nThe AWU hearings will re-examine the union's relationship with a range of companies including Thiess John Holland, ACI Glass (O-I), Downer EDI, Unibuilt, Cleanevent, Winslow Constructors and Chiquita Mushrooms.\nUnder questioning on the ABC's Q&A program this week, Mr Shorten said he could not take seriously any adverse findings that might be made against him by the commission because of its political bias.\n\"The royal commission, in my opinion, was set up for a range of motives. On the one hand it is to look at particular arrangements in the construction industry and also I believe it was set up to smear its political rivals,\" he said.\n\"I do not believe automatically that because â€¦ if they are to make an adverse finding, no, I don't accept automatically I am going to allow that royal commission which is set up on a political basis to start dictating what the Labor Party does or how we run our politics in this country.\n\"If there is criminality found by this royal commission, well, then, that is a matter which needs to be looked at, but I don't accept that everything that this royal commission is doing is started with the best of motivations, nor do I believe that this process has been entirely fair.\"\nNSW Liberal senator Arthur Sinodinos told the ABC's Insiders program on Sunday that \"Bill Shorten's had one appearance [at the royal commission] and he's about to have another\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-09-24T12:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T11:02:38.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
