It is almost as if the Hiranandani Brand spots the potential of a location much before others do! The past record shows that whenever brand Hiranandani has created integrated townships, the location has ended up being a winner: whether it is the stupendous success of Hiranandani Gardens at Powai or Hiranandani Meadows and Hiranandani Estate in Thane, it has always been that Brand Hiranandani has been the first to spot the potential of what were then, ‘new’ locations. These mixed-use, integrated townships have proved to be trend-setters, and it has been the Hiranandani Business Park (HBP) which has been the flag-bearer of commercial real estate growth. The next Hiranandani Business Park is coming up in Panvel, an integral part of the upcoming Hiranandani Fortune City – should it surprise anyone that Panvel looks all set to be the next commercial real estate hot-spot in the MMR?
