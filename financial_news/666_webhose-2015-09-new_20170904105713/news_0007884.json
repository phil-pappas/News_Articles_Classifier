Investors have seen a near-default in Greece, conflict in Eastern Ukraine and a selloff of European government bonds.\nBut some analysts believe the eurozone economy is showing signs of strength. The bullish case for the eurozone is being fueled by the European Central Bank’s market-stimulus measures and “the beneficial impact of low energy prices on Western Europe, which is a major net importer of oil and gas,” says Jason Hollands, managing director of U.K. finance firm Tilney Bestinvest.\nAlthough a really hard landing in China could have negative repercussions for global growth, continued weakness in commodity prices could be a positive for Europe, he says.\nFor those who think it’s safe to wade back in, here are three U.K.-based funds that advisers say are well-positioned to take advantage of any investment opportunities arising in Europe.\nFund No. 1: The family way First up is the £1 billion ($1.5 billion) FP Crux European Special Situations fund, recommended by Rob Morgan, investment analyst at U.K. financial-services company Charles Stanley Direct. The fund is managed by Richard Pease, who doesn’t target any particular sectors or geographies, but instead favors family-owned businesses that can expand globally in niche areas without the need for external finance.\n“Mr. Pease likes to see healthy, repeatable cash flow from secure revenue streams and a robust balance sheet. Fortunately, Europe is home to many such companies, and he has frequently been able to identify Europe’s success stories to help propel performance of the fund,” says Mr. Morgan.\nThe fund, which has returned 5.47% this year and 13.5% annually over three years, holds a position in Nordea Bank, a Nordic and Baltic financial-services company. In July, Mr. Pease acknowledged that fears about a Chinese slowdown are likely to cause continued volatility in equity markets.\nFund No. 2: A cycle buster The second recommended fund focused on Europe is the £1.9 billion ($2.9 billion) BlackRock European Dynamic , which has returned 8.63% this year and 15.3% annually over three years.\nIt is a high-conviction fund that seeks quality businesses from sectors that can grow at different stages of an economic cycle. In August, it was mainly invested in Switzerland (18.2%) France (12.6%) and Denmark (3.8%).\n“Presently the fund is skewed towards financials, health care and industrials and away from more consumer-goods companies, many of which are quite expensive, and basic materials, which have suffered recently due to worries about a slowdown in China,” says Mr. Morgan.\nFund No. 3: Going small Mr. Hollands says if investors want a play on a more “domestic” recovery story for the eurozone, they need to be investing through a small- and midcap-focused fund.\nMr. Hollands recommends the £51 million ($77 million) F&C European Small Cap ex UK Fund , managed by Sam Cosh, who has an impressive track record managing the small-cap-focused European Assets Trust, which is based in the Netherlands and listed both there and in the U.K.\nThere are some themes running through the portfolio such as financial services and nutrition. The fund, which was launched in March, holds Irish bank Permanent TSB Group Holdings and Glanbia PLC, a performance nutrition and ingredients group.\nSome analysts believe that the eurozone economy is showing signs of strength.
