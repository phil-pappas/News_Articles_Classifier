After that, those who rely on Autodesk's software will need to buy subscriptions for the products, all delivered via the cloud. \nThe move means near-term pain: shares of Autodesk have lost almost a quarter of their value in 2015, with investors grappling with the fact that the shift to the cloud will hurt earnings temporarily as the company's revenue model shifts from one-time software purchases to smaller recurring payments. \nBut Barron's notes that five years from now Autodesk could be earning over $4 a share, double its fiscal 2013 peak. The stock could benefit much sooner than that. \nAutodesk spokesman Noah Cole declined to comment on the specific forecast in Barron's but said the company planned to give new targets at its investor day on Tuesday. \nCole said the move to a cloud-based subscription model lowers upfront costs, which could help attract new customers. \n(Editing by Andrew Hay)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T06:12:29.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
