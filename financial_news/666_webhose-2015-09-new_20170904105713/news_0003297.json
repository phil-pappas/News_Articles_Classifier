He further adds, that this could be limited as banks need to implement Basel-3 rules such as liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio.\n 03, 2015 7:11 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T23:16:21.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
