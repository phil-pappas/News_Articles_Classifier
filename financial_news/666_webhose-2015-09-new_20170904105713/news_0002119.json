We need to lift up our pride and show the world what we're doing... I want to send a message that represents unity... \n\"Trump doesn't represent anything to me. Everyone has their opinion, and he can have whatever opinion he wants, as long as he doesn't humiliate my people.\" \nWENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T04:36:27.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
