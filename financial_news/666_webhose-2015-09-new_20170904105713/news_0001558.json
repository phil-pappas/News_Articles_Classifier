To tune in, go to www.princetonresearch.com and click on RADIO. \nMr. Letcavage has a compelling story building Premier, a vertically integrated energy company with three interactive subsidiaries strategically positioned to capitalize on energy deregulation. \nLetcavage will be discussing the dynamics and benefits of Premier's business model of the acquisition of synergistic subsidiaries that accumulate and service residential and commercial energy consumers collectively offering and delivering cost savings and state of the art energy efficient products and services. \nThe deregulated energy business is estimated to be a $500 billion+ industry in the U.S. (roughly 5-7 times larger than the lucrative telecom deregulation market of the early 1980's). The U.S. Energy Information Administration indicates the deregulated retail electric supply market in the northeast alone exceeds $75 billion annually, further noting the current New York market to be approximately $7.7 billion. \nThis press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
