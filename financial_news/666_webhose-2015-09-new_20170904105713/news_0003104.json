But does it matter to bondholders?\nIn other words, will at least some investors accept a lower yield on bonds because they believe the issuing company is socially responsible—and expect a higher yield from companies they view as less responsible?\nJournal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/WealthReport More in Investing in Funds & ETFs Search for Low-Volatility Investments Beyond 9/11: Alger Comes Back Hulbert on Bear-Market Havens Can You Use a “529” for Airfare? U.S.-Stock Funds Fall 5.6% in Month The answer is yes, researchers say in a paper published in June in the Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, “Corporate Social Responsibility and the Cost of Corporate Bonds.”\n“Our results indicate that firms with better CSR [corporate social responsibility] performance are able to issue bonds at lower cost and that both CSR strengths and concerns are considered by bondholders,” wrote the authors, Mingzhi Liu and Wenxia Ge, professors at the University of Manitoba Asper School of Business in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The study also found a correlation between social responsibility and bonds’ credit ratings.\nBroad concerns Bondholders are concerned about a range of social-responsibility issues, the study found, though not necessarily out of the goodness of their hearts. Social responsibility might offer several clues to a company’s financial stability and prospects, suggests Dr. Liu, an assistant professor of accounting and finance at Asper.\nRelated Water: The New Investing Factor Q&A: Geeta Aiyer Defends Sustainable Investing The researchers found a link between bond yield spreads—a measure of companies’ borrowing costs—and companies’ scores on seven types of social-responsibility measures, including community involvement, corporate governance, employee relations, and product features such as quality, safety and social impact.\nThe effect is stronger for certain types of corporations. For instance, social-responsibility scores and bond yield spreads are more closely associated, statistically, for companies with stronger financial statements and for those in industries where the environment is an issue, as well as companies issuing investment-grade bonds, the researchers found.\nLooking for signs Dr. Liu points out one reason bondholders might favor companies with high CSR scores: Those companies may be less likely to be targets of costly and potentially crippling lawsuits that could lower the value of their bonds. “CSR-related information captures the dimension of a corporation’s environmental risk” and the related litigation risk, he says.\nHe adds that high scores on various social-responsibility categories could also mean that management is looking after the company’s reputation, a concern for any investor. And because environmental or other socially responsible projects can be expensive, embarking on such campaigns could be taken as a sign of a company’s financial strength, Dr. Liu says.\n“Normally, only financially healthy firms have enough cash flows to support CSR activities continuously,” he says, so investors “could judge corporate CSR investment as a positive signal” in that regard.\nMs. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.
