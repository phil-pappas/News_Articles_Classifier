But it has struggled to raise growth capital in Australia partly because the few venture capital firms hunt for \"flavour of the month\" apps, not unglamorous productivity tools.\nMr Scicluna put the dilemma to former small business minister Bruce Billson at a breakfast function in Mr Turnbull's electorate earlier this year but says he was left with an impression that he might be better off taking his business to Singapore.\nNow he wants Mr Turnbull's innovation team – Industry and Science Minister Christopher Pyne, Communications Minister Mitch Fifield, Assistant Minister for innovation Wyatt Roy and Education Minister Simon Birmingham – to deliver policies that boost science, technology engineering, maths and the idea of start-ups in education, create greater incentives for angel investment and interest in start-ups.\n\"We are not short of ideas at the end of the day. What we end up being short of is the culture where people are willing to have a punt on early stage start-ups and development.\"\nAustralia has traditionally been weak at commercialising ideas. Mr Scicluna said we could do worse than borrow some UK policies to encourage a broader swathe of investors and not just a few people to \"have a punt at taking an innovation and commercialising it and making a go of it\".\n John Pollaers, chairman of the Advanced Manufacturing Council, paid tribute to former industry minister Ian Macfarlane for putting advanced manufacturing back on the agenda and starting work on attracting and retaining intellectual property and skills in Australia.\n\"Now with a prime minister who understands and appreciates the significance of technology there is now truly an opportunity to move from re-establishing the importance to now leveraging the importance of technology and advanced manufacturing in Australia,\" Mr Pollaers said.\nHe welcomed the more intense focus on industry and science and the balance and diversity of technology, gender and \"focus on the future\".\n\"Literally 60 per cent of the jobs that are going to be entering in to the workforce in the next 10 years are going to be different. We are seeing the rise of new industries, we are seeing disruptive technology, now we are hearing [from the Prime Minister] that it's not a threat to Australia, it's an opportunity.\"\nBridget Loudon, co-founder of Expert360, a digital platform for matching freelance business consultants with clients with short-term assignments, said: \"It is obviously exciting for Australian start-ups to have a PM who is familiar with the industry and has experienced it first hand.\"\nMs Loudon said it remained to be seen how the new ministerial innovation team would work with the start-up sector.\n\"We're hoping for better co-ordination of start-up policy, driving real change with strong leadership. We need vision that starts at the top and not a piecemeal approach. We need courage to acknowledge that the mining boom is over, and make sure we fuel our next growth engine,\" she said.\n\"There has been a lot of focus on specific policy change and we've made excellent strides, however, I equally think that we need a grassroots shift in mentality on the role of technology and start-ups in Australia. That starts at the top.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T13:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T14:06:55.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
