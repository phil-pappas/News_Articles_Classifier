It also said it had overstated profits going back to fiscal 2008/09 by 155 billion yen.\nQuarterly revenue fell 5 percent from a year earlier to 1.35 trillion yen, led by a decline in PC and TV sales.\nChief Executive Masashi Muromachi said last week he was looking to restructure weak operations and reconsider strategies announced by his predecessor, who stepped down amid the scandal in July.\nWith Monday's announcement, Toshiba has finally caught up with its regular financial disclosures. It had twice postponed its full-year results due to the accounting investigation, raising fears the laptops-to-nuclear power conglomerate could be delisted from the Tokyo bourse.\nThe accounting probe found in July that Toshiba suffered from dysfunctions in governance and a culture of discouraging employees from questioning their superiors, prompting previous CEO Hisao Tanaka and several other board members to step down.
