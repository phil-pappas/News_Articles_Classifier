Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup A new online funding platform that promises to connect female tech entrepreneurs with investors from four major Australian venture capital funds has been launched by Job Capital founder Jo Burston under her well-known Rare Birds brand.\nMotivated by the insights she gained from doing over 300 interviews with female entrepreneurs for her Rare Birds books, Ms Burston said she decided to create a platform which not only connected women with investors, but taught them how to be ready for funding.\nScale Investors, Right Click Capital, Impact Investment Group and Springboard Enterprises Australia have all signed up to be involved, looking to making a number of series-A or early-stage investments of $1 million plus in fledgling companies.\n\"There were a lot of common threads coming through where the challenges aligned,\" she said.\nCo-founder of Beat the Q Posse Group Rebekah Campbell has said she struggled to be taken seriously by potential male investors fore eventually getting funding. Nic Walker \"There is a trend toward women looking for the right money. You can have funding with mentorship, funding with a good advisory board, and funding which gives you connections locally, or globally.\"\nEntrepreneurs on the Rare Birds platform must complete an eight step process which helps them through the due diligence process, developing pitch documents and investor Q&As. This usually takes entrepreneurs about a week to complete.\nRare Birds also has an online deal room with a suite of communication features such as messaging, task management, voting and document management.\nGiving women a leg up \"What I'm trying to do is give these women a leg up not just nationally, but globally and get them profiled in a really polished way to meet investors,\" Ms Burston said.\n\"This sets them up to be ready. You can meet someone in the lift or on a plane and you have to know how to articulate your story.\"\nMale-led startups are not excluded from using the funding platform, but its main target market will be women.\nMs Burston said she was inspired to create Rare Birds after speaking with countless female business founders about their struggles to get funding.\n\"I remember interviewing Rebekah Campbell (co-founder of Beat the Q Posse Group). She pitched 50 times before she got her first lot of money,\" she said.\n\"One of her challenges was walking into a boardroom full of men and not being taken seriously.\"\nThe venture capital funds were selected because they were in line with Rare Birds' values and Ms Burston said she is open to having more investors come on board.\n\"What we want to do is create a really solid deal flow from the Rare Birds community into investors who help create successful entrepreneurs,\" Ms Burston said.\n\"The ultimate goal is to have one entrepreneur with the choice of five funds, rather than one fund with the choice of 400 entrepreneurs.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-09-02T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T03:04:51.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
