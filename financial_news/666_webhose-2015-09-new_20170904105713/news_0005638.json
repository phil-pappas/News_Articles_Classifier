( WMT ). The group relaunched itself as a more independent organization Thursday in New York and said that it is preparing for “massive” Black Friday actions across the country.\nThe group, Organization United For Respect at Walmart, is a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit association popularly known as OUR Walmart. The group’s purpose is to help Wal-Mart employees as individuals or groups in their dealings with the company over labor rights and standards and their efforts to have Wal-Mart publicly commit to adhere to labor rights and standards. According to the group’s website, OUR Walmart has no intention of having Wal-Mart recognize or bargain with OUR Walmart as the representative of its employees.\nALSO READ: America's Richest (and Poorest) States \nEarlier this year Wal-Mart agreed to raise the pay of more than 500,000 workers to a minimum of $10 an hour by February 1 of next year. And while OUR Walmart hailed the company’s decision, it has maintained its demand for $15 an hour and consistent, full-time hours. The employee group also wants the company to end unfair job reviews and terminations and to address racial justice and women’s rights, as well as be a leader in addressing climate change.\nFormer U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich said:\nIt has been a big year for Walmart workers. 500,000 Walmart workers got a raise this year to $9 an hour and to $10 an hour next year. Now this is at least proof that when working people and those of us who are fed up with income inequality -- when we stand together -- we can change even the biggest and most powerful corporations in America. ... Walmart workers and their families still need public assistance to afford basic necessities -- like food and health care. Taxpayers foot the bill -- effectively subsidizing Walmart's low-wage business model. Walmart could break this cycle by paying $15 an hour and providing consistent full time hours. It’s time to make it happen -- this Black Friday I’ll be standing with OUR Walmart calling for $15 and full time.\nALSO READ: America's Fastest Growing Jobs \nOUR Walmart was organized and held its first job actions against the company in 2012. Last year the group claimed that “tens of thousands of Americans [protested] at 1,600 Walmart stores across the country.”\nRelated Articles \nUBS Says Huge Oil Merger Should Go Through: 3 Big Stocks to Buy Boeing Teases First Look at Air Force Training Jet Concept The Healthiest City in Every State Consumer Discretionary Wal-Mart Stores Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T08:17:01.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
