Alex Ellinghausen by Andrew Clark \"I ﻿ 'm not going to play Canberra games,\" Tony Abbott said last Monday morning. Just 12 hours later he was an unwilling player in one of Canberra's increasingly popular \"games\" – destroy a sitting prime minister.\nBut Abbott remained true to form. Instead of a haggard-looking, rejected PM playing his part in the game and resigning his commission at Government House, in front of a blaze of cameras, and then appearing in Parliament, even more haggard-looking; or breaking down, Kevin Rudd-style, in a parliamentary forecourt, a proud Abbott \"tied one on\" and went AWOL\nAmid the shock, rejection, disappointment, grief and bewilderment, Abbott did what any red-blooded Australian would do – he threw a party. They were all there: Peta Credlin, his chief-of-staff many blame for the downfall; Treasurer Joe Hockey, who often cops the same negative rap; other ministers and about 50 members of his personal staff.\nIt was some night. Nursing a giant hangover on Tuesday morning, Abbott faxed his resignation to the GG, and was a no-show for question time. Instead, he held a brief \"presser\", lashing out at what he described as a \"febrile media culture that rewards treachery\".\n\"My pledge today is to make this change as easy as I can,\" a grim but composed Abbott told assembled journalists. \"There will be no wrecking, no undermining and no sniping. I have never leaked or backgrounded against anyone and I certainly won't start now,\" he said, in a thinly veiled swipe at the months-long leadership intrigue of his successful rival, and now Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull.\n\"It's been a tumultuous week and I now intend to spend some time with my family to think about the future; but my intention is to remain in the Parliament,\" Abbott said later.\nThe same pattern of non–appearance in Parliament was repeated on Wednesday and Thursday. But according to a spokesman, \"it's a pretty safe assumption\" Abbott will take up his seat on the backbench when Parliament resumes after a three-week break. If that does occur, it will produce the delayed image of a politician drained of the great power and authority of the prime-ministerial post, returning to the scene of his political assassination.\nMeanwhile, according to the same spokesman, Tony Abbott is \"coping well\" with such a dramatic humiliation, although a few moments later he acknowledged Abbott is \"pretty gutted\" by the experience.\n The now politically chastened Abbott may be far more conservative and less flamboyant than his successor, Malcolm Turnbull. But both shared for the bulk of their lives a sense of destiny, one that would, they believed, culminate in a lengthy tenure as Prime Minister.\nThey have both, at separate times, apparently destroyed the achievement, or at least the continuation of that ambition, in the other. Abbott ended Turnbull's leadership of the Liberal Party on December 1, 2009, by beating him by just one vote in a party-room ballot. Nearly six years later, Turnbull wrecked the not-quite-two-year-old Abbott prime ministership by defeating Tony Abbott 54-44 in a late night party-room vote.\nSo it is a matter of a not-quite-one-week-old historical fact that Turnbull has completed this mutual act of destiny destruction. What makes this episode so different – not to mention so searing, and almost unimaginably humiliating – for Abbott is that Turnbull's action has not just halted, but destroyed, his destiny dream.\nOrdinary mortals wake up from a nightmare to find the world is OK. But when Abbott woke up to the true dimensions of what was rapidly taking shape around him, the nightmare began. Instead of realising the hangman's noose was only tightening in a nightmare, his welcome to a new day was the onset of political asphyxiation. Abbott knows now that when he defeated Turnbull in that vote almost six years ago, it was a fateful act, but not fatal.\nThe four Abbotts Abbott is a complex figure. According to author and Labor stalwart Bob Ellis, he is six people: \"rugger bugger; the absolutely strict, self-flagellating priest; the man who will discuss anything with you over a Guinness; and the jogging athlete and cyclist\". The Ellis listcomputes to four, but no matter: he has a point.\nSix years ago Abbott, the man who places the highest premium on loyalty, renounced his former adherence to the contentious policy issue of an emissions trading scheme, resigned from the shadow cabinet, turned on Turnbull, and defeated him in a brutal party putsch. The ruthless former heavyweight boxing champion later – and ultimately to his great cost – allowed Turnbull to remain in the ring, tolerating his finely honed, but politically loaded, verbal parries.\nThe same Tony Abbott was lethal as opposition leader. His idea of political nuance was to vary descriptions of the Julia Gillard-led Labor government from \"bad\" to \"very bad\" to \"seriously bad\" and \"the worst government in Australian history\". And the attacks became more graphic. \"The Prime Minister and the Leader of the House [then Anthony Albanese] have targets on their forehead,\" Abbott told Parliament in March, 2012, although he later apologised for employing a metaphor he regretted.\nBut it was not part of Abbott's character to follow the advice of Niccolo Machiavelli, a political operative in intrigue-ridden Renaissance Florence, and a genius in the practice of the dark side of politics. Machiavelli Quote: : \"Men ought either to be indulged or utterly destroyed, for if you merely offend them they take vengeance, but if you injure them greatly they are unable to retaliate, so that the injury done to a man ought to be such that vengeance cannot be feared.\"\nFor a time after he lost the Liberal Party leadership, Turnbull publicly expressed his intention to retire from political life. But he was prevailed on to stay. A key figure in this persuasion process was former Liberal prime minister John Howard. There were others who played an equal, if not more important, role.\nBut whatever the precise level of influence Howard had on Turnbull's change of mind, his role in the dramatic denouement of this Turnbull-Abbott saga is critical. Abbott has in the past acknowledged the importance of mentors, and three in his life are the late Father Emmet Costello, the Jesuit priest who for many years was attached to Riverview, the exclusive Jesuit school on Sydney's north shore and Abbott's alma mater; Bartholomew Santamaria, founder of the Catholic, anti-communist Democratic Labour Party; and Howard.\nMeeting Father Costello at Riverview was helpful for a young Abbott already developing a sense of destiny. The Jesuits are renowned for preparing potential leaders for public life, stressing self-abnegation and obedience.\nParadoxically, Father Costello also played a pivotal role in helping with the conversion of Turnbull, Abbott's political executioner, to Catholicism, and gave counsel to Turnbull's father-in-law, and onetime Liberal attorney-general, Tom Hughes, in matters of faith.\nBut in the shaping of his political career, which dates back 21 years, Howard was the key. Howard's recent, more than partial withdrawal from that mentor role, took on a real poignance for Abbott.\nEmmett Costello and Santamaria are dead. Howard is very much alive, but has also been more than alive to what he regards as the Liberal Party's future prospects, and how much those prospects depend on Turnbull.\nFor the latter, his actions in the past week echo these words of Napoleon: \"I can no longer obey. I have tasted command and I cannot give it up.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T19:07:23.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
