As soon as you get into the vehicle you know immediately that it's a good place to be.' \nDeveloped using Jaguar's Lightweight Aluminium Architecture, the new F-PACE is designed to handle with precision and control without sacrificing ride comfort - it's what makes a Jaguar stand apart from the competition. \nTaking full advantage of the body structure's inherently high stiffness, the sophisticated double wishbone front suspension and Integral Link rear suspension provide the best possible starting point. \nTuned to perfection, they make the new F-PACE incredibly responsive yet also ensure that the impacts, undulations and extreme cambers of even the most challenging roads are handled with ease. \nThe electric power-assisted steering system maintains Jaguar's leadership in steering. Everything between the steering wheel rim and the tyre contact patch is optimised to ensure that the new F-PACE responds immediately to the slightest input, giving a truly connected feel. \nIncorporating all of the learning from F-TYPE, the system gives even greater feedback. Combined with the torque vectoring technology first developed for F-TYPE and the torque on-demand all-wheel drive system, the new F-PACE delivers outstanding agility in all weathers and on all surfaces. \nTo make development and testing even more efficient, the vehicle integrity team's subjective assessments are fed back into the Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) tools used by the vehicle dynamics CAE team. \nThis improves the models and therefore delivers even better simulation results - and vice-versa. \nThis iterative loop of continuous improvement ensures that prototype vehicles are ever better, benefiting the tuning and assessment process. \nA business desk report Other Stories Follow Us The longer your good is in coming to you the more it will be when it finally does By: Nana Adjoa Boahemaa", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:25:12.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
