She said she had not reached any settlement with the firm and will pay some of its legal fees.\nA judge has ordered Pao to pay Kleiner $275,000 in legal fees. A jury in March found that Kleiner Perkins did not discriminate or retaliate against Pao when the firm fired her in 2012.\nPao's case became a flashpoint in an ongoing discussion about gender inequity at elite technology and venture capital firms, where women are grossly underrepresented.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
