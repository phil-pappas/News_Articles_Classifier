NDAQ, +0.70% and other companies, stealing more than 160 million credit and debit card numbers and other personal information in what the authorities have called the largest such scheme prosecuted in the U.S.\nThe breach, the authorities said, resulted in more than $300 million in losses.\nUnder a plea deal filed Tuesday in federal court in Camden, N.J., 34-year-old Vladimir Drinkman pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to hack a computer network and wire fraud. Additional conspiracy and fraud charges are to be dropped as part of the deal.\nReached by phone, Drinkmanâ€™s lawyer, Florian Miedel, declined to comment on the case. Sentencing has been scheduled for Jan. 15, Miedel said.\nDrinkman, arrested in the Netherlands in 2012, had been charged with five others in connection to an elaborate scheme to steal and sell the data, using so-called anonymous web-hosting services and communicating through private and encrypted channels to avoid detection.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:42:36.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
