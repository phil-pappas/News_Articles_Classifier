Jessica Hromas by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Rural veterinary roll-up Apiam is seeking a $100 million sharemarket debut before the end of the year, with stockbroker Shaw and Partners launching a three-day pre-float roadshow this week.\nâ€‹It's understood Apiam boss Chris Richards will meet fund managers in Melbourne on Tuesday, before heading to Sydney on Wednesday and Thursday for a series of one-on-one meetings and group lunches.\nApiam is expected to be pitched as a vertically integrated rural veterinary business, bringing together seven large scale practices in a deal likely to be worth about $100 million.\nThe company's business model sees vets paid by farmers to monitor livestock and prevent disease, while account managers are responsible for selling drugs and other products prescribed by the vets.\nApiam is expected to tell small cap fund managers it has already secured 60 per cent of the Australian pig market and uses its size and scale to get exclusive distribution licenses for products and lower buying prices.\nIt's also expected to focus on proprietary systems and software and argue it is not susceptible to the weather-related cycles generally associated with the agricultural sector.\nShaw's recently appointed head of equity capital markets, and former Royal Bank of Scotland and CIMB banker, Marlon Freeman, is running the deal.\nThe broker's mandate comes hot on the heels of another vet roll-up, National Veterinary Care, which listed at $1 and has traded as high as $1.58 . Shaw and Wilson HTM ran that deal.\n Apiam's founder, Bendigo-based Chris Richards, will be joined on the roadshow by general and legal counsel Ella McDougall and chief financial officer Matt White. It's understood the company is targeting a December debut on the ASX-boards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T22:05:57.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
