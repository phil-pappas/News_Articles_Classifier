Sam Bennett Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Joe Aston I'm on the Cyclades island of Mykonos for the first time in a decade. It's been a week, almost, and I can't be sure whether to love it or hate it.\nMy memories of this place are those of a 21-year-old with a severe Jay Gatsby (or Jean-Frédéric Taillefer) complex, without any means to fund it. But somehow I muddled along, nursing triple vodka tonics on the beach, pursuing Jewish Australian Princesses with scant success, wondering why I bothered leaving Double Bay.\nA fortnight before I got here, the great Taki Theodoracopulos teed off in The Spectator , christening Mykonos as \"hell\", and a \"modern Sodom\", whose wind is \"maddening and constant\", where \"ghastly music blasts away all day and night\" and \"literally thousands of sunburned young people wearing expensive rags down tequilas with a thousand-mile look on their unshaven faces\".\nI am upsold to a 170CC quad bike of destiny Taki's is a portrait of the island's vilest infelicities, and none of them is wrong. Even so, family duties require my presence in this part of the world, so I'll be damned if I won't make a good fist of it.\nThe most common refrain against this vulgar paradise is that it is vulgar, though I'm yet to see any local pretence to the contrary — besides a few kitsch galleries and the local fine arts academy, whose campus I passed in the town, and chortled at uncharitably.\nOne of the grandest conveniences is the British Airways flight from Heathrow direct to the island's poky landing strip, where private Gulfstreams and Bombardiers jostle for parking alongside EasyJet and Meridiana.\nOur first stop is the trumped-up shed hiring out cars and bikes. I am upsold from a Soviet-era 50cc scooter (sans muffler) to a 170CC quad bike of destiny. The blond reprobate running the joint tries appealing to my jingoism. \"You are Australian, so you know Sam Burgess? He was the last person I allowed to rent this,\" Niko boasted.\n \"No, no, I think you'll find he's decided to be English after all.\"\nNiko regarded me blankly.\nTheir prices are galling At our villa on the hill above the main town of Chora, Dimitri, our host, scribbles furiously on an A3 tourist map of the island, pointing us to obscure beaches and tavernas, and then Little Venice for sundowners. There, Jackie O is not a gay bar, he assures my brother Lachlan and me. \"It is a 50/50 crowd. I was there on Sunday.\"\nLachy and I motor first to the deceptively named Paradise Beach, astride the Rabbitoh/Lion's boneshaker. This sordid bay could be the mess yard of a Serco-operated detention facility, or the food court at Miranda Fair right before its 1997 renovation.\nWe flee a couple of bays west to Psarou, and the zhuzhy restaurant club of the moment, Nammos. Their prices are galling. €25 ($40) for a deck chair. €15 for a caprioska. €110 for a fresh snapper (which even the local fishermen's collective wouldn't flog at market for better than €5 per Nemo, surely). €120 for a bottle of Domaine Otte (RRP at Dan Murphy's = $64).\nIt is hard to wrestle with Dimitri's logic Despite Nammos's obscene mark-ups, its vulgarian clientele and its stereo pumping elevator covers (but the original, at least, of Lady D'Arbanville — nobody should try covering Cat Stevens, besides maybe Yusuf Islam), I can't help but love it here. Maybe (like Gerard Depardieu) I'd qualify for a Russian passport.\nLater, we head into town for a look-see. There are more selfie sticks than there are Asians. The restaurants are passable at best. And they all have their Macbook DJ's, ingenuity inversely proportionate to volume, playing that Daft Punk hit from two years ago.\nSo, having been thoroughly fleeced on the beach, we opt for a dinner of succulent pork gyros and two tinnies of local beer. The bill is €9.80.\nAt Jackie O's, it is hard to wrestle with Dimitri's logic. The place is about as 50/50 as a sure thing. Not a female in sight, and all the boys wear heels. Gayer than a Mexican tablecloth. We settle in for a second round.\nArriving back at our quad, the seat is covered in tomato sauce. Perhaps a mad Wallaby groupie has recognised the rego and taken his angst out on comrade Burgess. We are nowhere near anywhere, so I remove my Canali linen shirt to soak up the ketchup, and ride home with my slack guts glowing, bared to the moonlight, Lachy's palms gripping my bitch tits.\nThe next morning, despite my temptation to SOS a helicopter, we set off again, stopping first at the dry cleaner. From a plastic bag, I pour garments straight from Patrick Bateman's wash basket. The laundry lady looks on the verge of calling the police. Muttering to myself, I vow to hunt down and destroy the Ketchup Bandit.\nBut what saves me from surrendering to Taki's despair is lunch at Spilia, a restaurant cut into the rocks of Agia Anna beach near Kalafatis, devoid of scenesters, music barely audible, where we murder linguine of the freshest seafood. Our waiter is a dead ringer for Joaquin Phoenix — his service in equal measure glacial, insolent, hapless and superb. I am Leonard Cohen, composing Suzanne on this cliff face, with Wi-Fi instead of a camphor lamp. There are worse places I could be ...", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mrjoeaston", "https://www.spectator.co.uk/life/high-life/9606502/mykonos-has-turned-into-hell-i-still-blame-jackie-kennedy/", "https://plus.google.com/+JoeAston"], "published": "2015-09-04T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:03:45.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
