The portfolios comprise non-performing and performing mortgages and Expansion's sources say the portfolio could sell for around 400 million pounds ($618.24 million). \nThe acquisition, to be finalised in the next few months, would be financed by capital from Sabadell's British lender TSB, according to Expansion's sources. \nThe Catalonia-based lender closed its deal to take full control of Britain's TSB bank for 1.7 billion pounds ($2.6 bln) in mid-August. \n($1 = 0.8818 euros) ($1 = 0.6473 pounds) ($1 = 0.6470 pounds) (Reporting by Tomas Cobos; Writing by Paul Day; Editing by Susan Fenton)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T10:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T16:28:07.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
