While the winners and losers have yet to be determined, ad buyers have had months to assess the landscape. With advertisers spending roughly $70 billion a year on TV, a lot is at stake.\nCMO Today spoke with three top ad buyers and asked what new or returning shows they are anticipating the most. Responses have been edited for clarity.\nDave Campanelli, director of national TV at Horizon Media\n“Fargo” (FX)\nOne of the best shows of 2014, and it was a bit of a surprise. Regurgitating old movies and shows doesn’t usually have a good track record (i.e. “ Coach ”), but this one surpassed expectations. Now setting season 2 in the past, with a whole new cast, it will be exciting to see.\n“Empire” (FOX)\nThe biggest breakout hit of last season. Will it get bigger than season 1? Will it fall off in season 2? Excited to find out.\n“Supergirl” ( CBS CBS.A 2.07 % )\nThis received more buzz during upfront week than just about any show. But I wonder how well it will fit in the CBS schedule.\n“The Daily Show” (Comedy Central)\nHow do you replace Jon Stewart? Is it even possible? Trevor Noah was a bold choice for Comedy Central as they take a stab at reinventing the show, rather than bringing in a more familiar name that would probably do better short term, but not have the same unique voice.\n“Quantico” (ABC)\nSeemingly covering similar territory as “Homeland” on Showtime. Can it be as successful?\nSharon Cullen, managing director at OMD\n“Limitless” (CBS)\nA unique combination: fast-paced and high-concept, yet at the same time easy to follow. A very likeable lead actor, Jake McDorman. Bradley Cooper’s involvement as executive producer and guest star should help leverage the movie’s built-in equity.\n“Quantico” (ABC)\nOne of the shows that represents the more diverse makeup of the new season’s fall slate with Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra bringing a ready-made fan base for the international after-market, which is attractive to global advertisers.\n“Heroes Reborn” (NBC)\nThe 3.9 million likes that the show has garnered on Facebook indicate that its fan community remains robust and engaged, and that kind of passion is always attractive to advertisers.\n“Scream Queens” (FOX)\nThis is not the most scientific measure but we’re going with the “show that buyers with teen daughters were most frequently asked if they could get an advance copy” litmus test.\n“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” (CW)\nMaybe it’s because the title is something that a lot of our young buyers can relate to, or maybe it’s because the CW is our client, but this is a show that we’re excited about. In the same vein as “Jane the Virgin,” it’s a concept that stands out from the pack, and like JTV there’s probably not going to be any middle ground in terms of how viewers react. If it works, it can deliver an audience that’s very attractive to advertisers.\nJason Kanefsky, executive vice president, director of strategic investments at Havas Media\n“The Simpsons” (FOX), “The Big Bang Theory” (CBS), “Modern Family” (ABC)\nReturning iconic sitcoms. These shows represent the most visible and expensive real estate in TV, and the ratings are closely monitored. Any slippage versus year prior will be closely documented and will set off alarm bells should the ratings fall.\n“Empire” (FOX), “Scorpion” (CBS)\nThese sophomore dramas need to continue their upward trajectory and become linchpins on the schedule for seasons to come. These shows have great potential and grew audience as the first season progressed.\n“The Voice” (NBC), “Survivor” (NBC), “Dancing with the Stars” (ABC)\nThe reality genre needs to remain steady. These programs have become the workhorse of the schedule as they can be shifted to different nights, “supersized” or truncated as the need arises.\nFreshman hits, to be determined\nEvery network needs two or three. It creates positive press, momentum and halo impact for the entire network. It’s a long way to May, and without some help from the rookies, it will be a long season.\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://deadline.com/2015/08/coach-cancelled-nbc-reboot-dead-1201511247/"], "published": "2015-09-21T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T20:40:25.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
