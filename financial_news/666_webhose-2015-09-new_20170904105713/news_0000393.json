But first: a pop quiz.What’s the typical down payment made by a first-time home buyer?\n20% t 13% t 6% You already know from the headline that it’s not 20%. Would you believe it’s not 13% either? According to the 2014 National Association of Realtors Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers , the median down payment made by first-time home buyers, who planned to use the place as their primary residence, was just 6%.The need for a 20% down payment is basically a myth. A nice-if-you-can-swing-it goal. Achieving it would allow you to get better mortgage terms and skip the payments for private mortgage insurance, which would save you a grand or more each year. But if you can’t, don’t feel bad about it, because hardly anyone else can either.20% is just not realistic these days for the majority of U.S. home buyers, especially first-timers. After all, the median home costs $234,000. A 20% down payment plus closing costs could easily top $50,000. And who’s got that lying around?Not the average 2015 college graduate with student loan debt who owes more than $35,000 . Or the median full-time worker who makes less than $42,000 a year . Even the average U.S. household, which has more than one worker, can typically only save about a tenth of that amount annually.People who have diligently saved for retirement could take some money out of those accounts to purchase a home. The IRS imposes rules and limitations—for example, the lifetime maximum withdrawal for a home purchase is $10,000 for most retirement accounts—and it’s generally not a good idea to raid retirement savings.But it’s not just the first-timers who can’t meet the 20% ideal. The median repeat home buyer ponies up just 13% of the purchase price as a down payment. Ways to Buy with Less Than 20% Down If you’ve been avoiding the housing market because you thought you needed to have buckets of money, feel free to hit some open houses even if you have far less than 20% of the purchase price saved up .While conventional mortgages require 5% down, and have significant closing costs, a bunch of government-backed programs allow for home purchases if you have even less money on hand. These are offered through entities like the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), [entity display=\"Fannie Mae\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"fannie-mae\" natural_id=\"fred/company/1542\"]Fannie Mae[/entity] and [entity display=\"Freddie Mac\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"freddie-mac\" natural_id=\"fred/company/1677\"]Freddie Mac[/entity], the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the USDA.Some have more restrictions than others, but one that many people qualify for is the FHA program, which has backed as many as 37% of the mortgages issued in the U.S. in recent years. Homebuyers with credit scores as low as 580, debt-to-income ratios as high as 56%, and less money for a down payment—generally 3.5% of the purchase price—can qualify for an FHA loan. You can even get the down payment money as a gift from family members or exceptionally generous friends. If you don’t have any of those, look into local programs that help with down payments.The downside to these more forgiving loans tends to be higher fees for you, but still …. Are Low Down Payments a Bad Thing? While low down payments are great for helping people without a lot of savings to get mortgages, one has to wonder what they mean for the housing market, and the economy as a whole.Could they be propping up home prices, by encouraging people on shaky financial footing to put in bids? Could they be setting us up for pain by expanding the number of homeowners who would quickly end up underwater if housing prices were to drop? And if mortgage interest rates start to rise with the federal funds rate, won’t home prices have to go down, since new homebuyers won’t be able to afford as much principal, because they’re paying more in interest? It seems a mathematical certainty. Unless, of course, incomes rise to make up the difference.At least low down payments are helping people escape the tough rental market, where ever-higher rents have been making it really hard for renters to save.If you are one of those struggling renters (or a current homeowner looking to make a move), rest assured that as long as the other aspects of your financial life are in order, more-or-less, you should be able to qualify for a mortgage. Even if you don’t have 20% saved for a down payment.Happy house-hunting.", "external_links": ["https://www.edvisors.com/newsletter/financial-aid-news-06-18-2015/#monthly-stats", "http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/wkyeng.pdf", "http://www.valuepenguin.com/saving-for-down-payment-for-house", "http://www.valuepenguin.com/how-save", "http://www.realtor.org/reports/highlights-from-the-2014-profile-of-home-buyers-and-sellers"], "published": "2015-09-30T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:00:47.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
