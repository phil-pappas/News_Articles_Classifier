In 2014, Riverside completed the acquisition of French orthopedic company Soft Medical Europe. Today, Orliman sells in more than 40 countries and 70% of sales are generated outside of Spain.\n“We’re very proud of the work we did at Orliman,” said Riverside Principal Rafael Álvarez-Novoa. “It went from a family-owned business to a growing international enterprise during our hold. Orliman has proven to be a very solid and stable business, with strong leadership position in its core markets and very promising exports business that grows above 15% every year.”\nWorking with Álvarez-Novoa on the transaction for Riverside were Vice President Damien Gaudin and Operating Executive Juan Rufilanchas.\nMontalban and KPMG advised Riverside on the transaction, and Garrigues acted as legal counsel for the firm.\nThe Riverside Company ( http://www.riversidecompany.com or http://www.riversideeurope.com )\nThe Riverside Company is a global private equity firm focused on investing in and acquiring growing businesses valued at up to $300 million.
