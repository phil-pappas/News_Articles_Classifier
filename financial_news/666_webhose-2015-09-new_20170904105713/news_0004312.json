The phenomenon causes the sea temperature to rise significantly in the Pacific Ocean off South America, and the air becomes dry, affecting the rain-formation process. \nHe noted that only the extreme northern part of SADC and parts of island countries of Madagascar, Mauritius and Seychelles are expected to receive normal to above-normal rains in the first and second part of the summer season. \n\"The bulk of the southern tier states of continental SADC is likely to receive normal to below-normal rainfall for the period October to December 2015 and January to March 2016,\" Garanganga said in his climate outlook presentation. \nHe however, said since climate conditions constantly change, users should contact their national meteorological offices for latest interpretation of the outlook, finer details, updates and additional guidance. \nWith the impending extreme weather conditions, the SADC region should prepare for such natural phenomena. \nFor example, farmers could plant crops that do not take long to mature, and the region should invest more infrastructure development including roads, irrigation and silos. \nImproving the transport network and storage facilities will allow agricultural produce to be moved smoothly from one place with surplus to another needing additional food. \n\"We should invest more in irrigation, conserve dam water, and plant short season varieties,\" SARCOF Principal Meteorologist Linear Gopo said. \nMost economies in SADC are largely dependent on climate conditions, and any reduction or increase in rainfall often has a negative effect on socio-economic development. \nFor example, Zimbabwe's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) dropped by three percent and eight percent after the 1983 and 1992 droughts respectively. \nIn South Africa, the 1992 drought induced a reduction of the agricultural GDP by about ZAR 1.2 billion and caused a 0.4 to 1.0 percent loss in economic growth. \nThe same drought cost the Zambian government US$ 300 million and translated into a 39 percent drop in agricultural output and a 2.8 percent decline in the country's GDP. \nThe SARCOF-19 Outlook comes at a time when the Kariba Dam between Zambia and Zimbabwe is experiencing declining water levels, as water coming out through the turbines is more than inflows into the dam. \nThe Zimbabwe Power Company, said water levels in Lake Kariba have dropped to 41 percent compared with 80 percent this time last year. \nWith expected low rainfall, it is likely to take longer for water levels to be at optimal. As a result, the Zambezi River Authority, which manages the dam on behalf of Zambia and Zimbabwe, has reduced water allocation for power generation at the dam by Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) and Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA). \nIn a public notice on 1 September, ZESA Holdings advised its customers in Zimbabwe of the reduction in power generation as a result of depleted dam water levels. \nThe power utility noted that there is to be a reduction in power generation at Kariba Power Station from 750MW to 475MW until dam levels have risen to requisite levels. \nSARCOF-19, which brought together Climate scientists from the SADC National Meteorological and/or Hydrological Services and the SADC Climate Services Centre was held on 26-18 August. \nThe forum meets each year to review the rainfall season in SADC, and discuss the potential impacts of the consensus seasonal climate outlook on other socio-economic sectors including disaster risk management, food security, health, water resources and hydropower management.
