It should be accessible by everyone,” the declaration said.\nZuckerberg, writing on Facebook, said that for every 10 people connected to the Internet, one is lifted out of poverty.\n“If we connect the more than four billion people not yet online, we have a historic opportunity to lift the entire world in the coming decades,” he wrote.\nOther signatories included Jimmy Wales, co-founder of free online encyclopedia Wikipedia, and U2 frontman Bono on behalf of his One anti-poverty campaign.\nJamie Drummond, global executive director of One, called on every country to come up with an “urgent plan” to meet the Internet access goals.\nThe campaigners did not announce funding on their own, but the United Nations has said that meeting the new global goals will cost between USD 3.5 and USD 5 trillion per year.\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on Saturday launched its own roadmap, which put a top priority on improving the health and education for girls.\nReleasing the report, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that more than USD 25 billion has been committed so far to meeting the goals, led by USD 3.3 billion from the United States and large pledges from Canada, Germany and Sweden.\nMelinda Gates, speaking to reporters in advance of the launch, said that the health and education of girls was critical to anti-poverty efforts and that the issue had not been sufficiently emphasized in the UN’s previous Millennium Development Goals.\n“When we look at investing our own money or asking governments to invest their money… we have to make sure that those investments make a difference,” she said.\nFirst Published on September 26, 2015 10:17 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T06:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T04:09:54.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
