We have incredible wind and solar energy resources in South Africa,\" he said. \"The very ambitious renewable energy programme that we have is already saving us an enormous amount of money that we would otherwise have spent on gas.\" \nHe said baseload power is not a function of a particular type of energy. \"It is a function of how you manage your overall electricity grid and particular resources within that grid,\" he said. \n\"If you combine sufficient wind and solar and solar thermal resources that we have in South Africa, then we don't need nuclear and we certainly don't need it at the price that it is coming in at.\" \nLe Page said nuclear power plants around the world are coming in over budget and over time. \"This nuclear programme that's been proposed for South Africa in secrecy without transparency ... is likely to cost R1trn to begin with, but who knows what it will cost us if it is not built on time.\" \n\"Meanwhile, our renewable programme is being built on time and on budget very successfully.\" \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T12:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T12:40:18.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
