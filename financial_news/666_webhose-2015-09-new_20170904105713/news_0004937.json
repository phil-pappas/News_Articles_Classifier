Photo: Michel O'Sullivan\nThe competition regulator has given the green light to Macquarie Group's proposed acquisition of ANZ Banking Group's Esanda dealer finance unit on Thursday, as the contested auction nears a conclusion.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said in a statement it would not oppose the slated acquisition saying it was not likely to \"substantially lessen\" competition in the market for the supply of bailment finance and point-of-sale (POS) finance facilities to motor vehicle dealerships.\n\"The ACCC had some concerns that the proposed acquisition may lead to increased bailment interest rates [or lower commissions to dealers on POS finance], particularly for dealerships that do not have access to an aligned or in-house finance provider,\" ACCC chairman Rod Sims said.\n\"However, the ACCC concluded that on balance the combination of existing and potential competitive constraints would be sufficient to prevent a substantial lessening of competition as a result of the possible acquisition.\"\nAdvertisement Bailment finance is acquired by dealerships to finance the cars held in their showrooms before they are sold. Dealerships also acquire POS finance facilities to allow them to offer finance to customers purchasing vehicles, and earn commissions on arranged customer finance contracts.\nThe Esanda dealer finance unit may fetch as much as $1.5 billion.\nAs reported in Street Talk, ANZ has pushed back the final bid date for the Esanda unit until next week to accommodate bidder requirements.As revealed by the column, non-bank lender Pepper Group has entered the race and is seeking equity partners for a bidding consortium, which will compete against Macquarie and China's HNA Group.\nDeutsche Bank is running the auction. The sale, which is roughly half of total assets sitting under the broader Esanda arm, represents $8.3 billion in assets.\nCompetition pressure Mr Sims added that a merged Esanda and Macquarie entity would \"face competition\" from Westpac Banking Group and affiliate St George and manufacturer-aligned financiers as well as the possibility of new entrants and pressure from vehicle manufacturers.\n\"The ACCC also noted that if the merged entity were to increase bailment rates and or decrease POS commissions, this would provide an incentive for other providers, including manufacturer aligned financiers such as Toyota Finance and Nissan Finance, to begin to compete for the business of unaffiliated dealerships,\" Mr Sims added in the statement.\nWith Macquarie viewed as the favourite to buy the Esanda division, the ACCC's statement will likely have investors and analysts redoing their sums on an equity raising to help fund the purchase.\nShaw and Partners' senior analyst David Spotswood has estimated Macquarie may raise $200 million if it wins the auction. CLSA senior analyst Brian Johnson said Macquarie could either rundown its stated surplus capital, recycle by selling assets or opt to raise equity.\nMacquarie's motor vehicle leasing portfolio, which sits within its corporate and asset finance unit, expanded by 11 per cent to $9 billion in the 12 months ended March 31.\nThe Esanda sale includes POS finance, bailment facilities and other branded finance for vehicle dealers. The auction covers the unit that makes loans to car dealers for floor stock financing, also known as floor plan financing, and there is a retail component where financing is provided directly to customers.\nMacquarie on Monday upgraded its first-half earnings guidance for the period ended September 30, putting the company on track to a report a record annual profit of $1.9 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T00:00:35.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
