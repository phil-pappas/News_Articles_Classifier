At the secondary school level, they organise and make the preparations for practicals. \nIf the teachers boycott this process, then the exams will be a sham. \nENGENDERING CHAOS \nThe alternative would be to postpone the exams altogether, which would be traumatising to the candidates. \nStaying without being taught for a month is torturous enough, but having the exams without teachers is tragic. It would create chaos, discredit our exam system, and make our graduates pariahs at the international level. \nAlthough the Kenya National Examinations Council argues that it has put in place measures to ensure the smooth administration and marking of the exams, it is not convincing that all is well. \nSOLVING THE ISSUE \nThe looming tragedy must be avoided. For this reason, we support the initiative by the Catholic bishops to mediate between the unions, the Teachers Service Commission (TSC), and the National Treasury to end the crisis. \nOther religious leaders and respected retired political and industry leaders should join in the initiative to bring the warring parties to the negotiation table. \nThe future of thousands of children who have been preparing for years for Standard Eight and Form Four exams is at risk and we urge the protagonists to sober up and resolve the dispute quickly. Kenya \nDykes will be built and families moved when the El Niño rains hit Western Kenya next month. see more » Copyright © 2015 The Nation. All rights reserved.
