SAM BENNETT Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Joe Aston Arriving in Milan always fills me with a profound sense of wellbeing. Italy, after all, is indisputably the greatest country in the world, and Milano is Italy's finest city. It's a loaded prize category, I'll concede, given the intergalactic magnificence of Rome, and with no less than Florence and Venice on its reserve bench! Italy is surely the Manchester United of the United Nations.\nAnd Milan is her striker, excelling, as it does, at all of her métiers (food, fashion, architecture and design, art and miscellaneous urbanity) while possessing few or none of her southern shortcomings (gangs, crime and corruption, crippling strikes, militant stockpiles of rotting garbage, and sundry other decrepitudes).\nIt is no small relief to have escaped Greece. The outhouse masquerading as Mykonos Airport is an Homeric nightmare. Inside, Dante himself has set the temperature. The departure concourse emanates the odour of a thousand camels and the queues have been exported from an Atari cartridge of Lemmings.\nAt some point during check-in, I mislay my Lock & Co panama. Just past security (if you could call it that – setting off the detector merely earns me a weary wave through), my sister Madeline points at a repellently fat young man, wearing a \"Keep Calm and…\" T-shirt (though I cannot for the life of me recall the iteration of that emporium banality emblazoned across his man boobs) and, atop his unsightly head, my hat.\nMilan is Italy's crowning glory, thinks Joe Aston. The city excels 'at all of her métiers - food, fashion, architecture and design, art and miscellaneous urbanity'. AP I march over to this fleshy poacher and claim back my kit with a composure borne of sterling shock. Steadying myself at the cafeteria, my faith in European man is shaken to the core. So I order a round of lime-flavoured Bacardi Breezers, and return to Maddie and my friend Adam bearing aristocratic headwear and welfare mum beverages. We all fall about laughing.\nFever strikes ... In Milan, I take a large apartment not five blocks from the Duomo, sold to me (entirely accurately) by its agent as \"original 1970s lavishness\". Think Boogie Nights : shag pile carpets (and toilet seat covers), a 25-seater sofa upholstered with a garish flower print, and a terrarium large enough to house a gorilla colony.\nWe dump our things and stroll across the quadrilatero and to the Bulgari Hotel, where in the garden we quaff Aperol Spritzs, then lunch on the sublime house spaghetti and Livio Felluga bianco.\n Rather suddenly, I seem to be developing a sinus infection of a severity only ever recorded by bacteriologists in corrupt central American republics. In the farmacia, gripped by a delirium fuelled equally by fever and pinot grigio, I watch the chemist lay out paracetamol, amoxicillin, a congestant nasal spray and a decongestant syrup. Bewildered, I depart with the entire cocktail.\nPleasantly buzzed Feeling poorly yet still pleasantly buzzed, I lead the way to Bar Straf for more spritzing (one pill per gulp), where we await the rest of our party – my brother Lachlan and his girlfriend Tonia off the Frecciarossa from Rome, and my friend and colleague James Chessell coming off the BA shuttle from Heathrow. Here, we drink in the Milanese milieu, at the foot of the Duomo, and across the lane from La Rinascente, where my old friend Giorgio Armani got his start as a window dresser.\nDinner, at Rovello 18, is a triumph. The ristorante's proprietor Waltero bear hugs me and then cracks his finest barbera, which we all guzzle with ill-advised haste. The stuffed rabbit is lovely. The veal chop is perfectly executed, as is the traditional riso al salto. The ravioli is the ravioli to end all ravioli.\nChessell, by this stage vaguely cross-eyed, insists on a second round of digestivo. It's not for nothing some people know me as \"Limoncello Joe\", so, between sneezing fits, I loosen my gullet.\nBack at the porn palace, my head is Vesuvius. Maddie administers more drugs and, on a sofa last inhabited by Dirk Diggler and Rollergirl, makes me a bed.\nLike Lazarus In the morning, I rise like Lazarus, amazed by my sister's maternal healing powers. In the kitchen, Adam is mumbling more than usual, about a pot of drip coffee he's managed to rustle up. He pours me a cup, and, tasting it, I can only conclude it has been filtered through the communal long drop of a South African shanty town.\nSo Lachy and I walk down to a pasticceria on via Montenapoleone, where we stand at the bar for espresso, orange juice and fresh ham sandwiches. We nod at one another in silent approval.\nAcross the street at Tom Ford, I am fitted for a new suit. Measuring me up, the master tailor mutters something in Italian that doesn't sound garment-related. I look over at the sales assistant. \"He says you are not so drunk as last time.\" Reclined on the store's velvet sofa, Lachy LOLs.\nEmail: joe.aston@fairfaxmedia.com.au Twitter: @mrjoeaston", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mrjoeaston", "https://plus.google.com/+JoeAston"], "published": "2015-09-18T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:08:04.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
