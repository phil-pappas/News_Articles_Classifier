But in the social-media era, the decision over whose legacy merits the tradition is kicking up painful public controversy.\nFans and friends of the late comedian Joan Rivers rallied last year in response to the initial announcement—later reversed—that the lights wouldn’t be dimmed for her.\nThe issue surfaced again after the death Saturday of 21-year-old Kyle Jean-Baptiste, who in July became the youngest actor and first black man to play the lead role of Jean Valjean on Broadway in “Les Misérables.” This month, he was slated to join the cast of his second show, the coming revival of “The Color Purple.”\nTo commemorate the young performer, only the Imperial Theatre, home to “Les Miz,” was scheduled to have its marquee dimmed Tuesday night, a move that led friends and supporters to raise opposition on Facebook FB -2.46 % and Twitter TWTR -2.73 % directed at the arbiter of lights: the Broadway League, the industry’s national trade association.\n“The Broadway League got it wrong here,” said April Reign, who posted about the issue and serves as managing editor of Broadway Black, a digital platform that notes the achievements of African-Americans onstage and off. “People around the world are discussing this. It’s not just the Broadway enthusiasts.”\nAccording to the League’s president, Charlotte St. Martin, a 10-person committee of the 800-member group makes the choice.\n“They are industry people who are following 50 years of tradition,” said Ms. St. Martin, adding that the committee’s individual members aren’t disclosed to prevent lobbying. “It is a very thoughtful group of people.”\nThe criteria, she said, can be gleaned from past recipients of the tribute.\n“You just have to look at the people who have been honored, and you see that it by no means includes everybody,” she said. “It’s people who have spent a lifetime in the theater.”\nIn 2015, four people so far have been honored: Producer and agent Samuel “Biff” Liff, who died at age 96; actor Theodore Bikel, age 91; actor-director Roger Rees, age 71, who had just starred in the 2015 musical “The Visit”; and actor-director Gene Saks, age 93.\nFor these and others, the lights have typically been turned down for one minute shortly before an evening show, which in most cases precludes the cast from participating while they prepare.\nENLARGE Kyle Jean-Baptiste.

Fans can look at it.”\nWhile these small changes have evolved the tradition, it is the digital world that has turned what was once an industry rite into a viral flash-point for controversy.\n“The advent of social media has changed the conversation,” said Ms. St. Martin.\nDuring the controversy over Joan Rivers, supporters circulated the label #Dim4Joan on Twitter, a move that was adapted to #Dim4Kyle this week.\nIn Ms. Reign’s view, the criteria for receiving the honor should be broader: “It is your impact on the community, not your age or longevity.”\nMs. St. Martin said a similar tension develops in the months leading up to Broadway’s season honors in the Tony Awards broadcast, when people want their loved ones included in the memorial segment.\n“It is emotional,” said Ms. St. Martin. “People love their people, and I understand.”\nWrite to Pia Catton at pia.catton@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KC650_NYDIM0_JV_20150901181612.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-02T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T04:34:41.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
