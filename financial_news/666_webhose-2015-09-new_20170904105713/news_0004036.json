The country is currently importing grain to ease the food shortages but large sections of the population, especially in Matabeleland South and parts of Masvingo, are facing severe food shortages. \nFarmers told the Zimbabwe Independent that the failure by GMB to pay them had hampered preparations for the summer cropping season as they failed to acquire inputs on time. \nMost farmers did not receive any payment from GMB for the 2013/14 as well as the 2014/15 seasons while others only received 23% of what they were owed for the 2013/14 season. \nZimbabwe Commercial Famers' Union president Wonder Chabikwa said farmers were faced with serious challenges in the preparation of the 2015/16 summer cropping season. \nChabikwa said: \"We are not happy at all. Farmers received a small percentage of the 2013/2014 summer marketing season. It's abnormal being paid only for that season, what about the 2014/2015 season? Where are we expected to get money to buy inputs for the 2015/2016 season? \n\"Production costs for local farmers in this country is the highest in the region. A farmer spends between US$900 and US$1 000 per hectare and the US$390 per tonne that GMB pays us taken away with the cost of production.\" \nHe said because GMB was failing to pay farmers, some farmers had resorted to selling their grains to middlemen who buy for paltry amounts ranging from US$150 to US$220 per tonne. \n\"I can say there is no preparation (for 2015/16 season) taking place at the moment. Farmers are in a difficult situation. There is no money; the price of fertiliser is still very high despite government promising a 20% slash. \nWe need government support through the provision of affordable loans for farmers,\" he said. \nA disgruntled farmer from Chiweshe, who asked not to be named, said the government was sabotaging farmers by failing to ensure they are paid for the grain they delivered to GMB. \nThe farmer said he delivered 37 tonnes of grain to GMB at a cost of US$390 per tonne for the 2013/2014 summer crop and expected to be paid about US$14 430. \nThis year he delivered 30 tonnes from the 2014/2015 summer cropping season and was expecting to be paid US$11 700, making it a total of US$26 130 for the two seasons. \nHe, however, received 23% of the 37 tonnes he delivered to GMB, which amounts to US$3 319. \n\"I was called last week to collect the money from GMB Concession, only to receive US$3 319. Already I have used a significant amount of it to pay school fees for my children and I am left with nothing to pay my workers, buy fertiliser, maize seed and land preparations,\" he said. \n\"The government has let us down.\" \nPresenting oral evidence before a parliamentary committee on peace and security early this year, GMB acting general manager, Lawrence Jasi said the parastatal owed farmers US$49 million for grain delivered during 2013/14 marketing season. \nThe government last month released US$15 million to GMB to enable it to pay farmers, but the funds were not enough hence the decision to pay less than a quarter of what the parastatal owes farmers. \nThe farmers predicament has been exacerbated by the fact that they are failing to acquire loans from banks to fund farming activities as financial institutions do not accept their A1 permits and 99-year leases as collateral.
