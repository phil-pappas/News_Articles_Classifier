The mission of the program is to develop a standardized education and credentialing process for health care personnel providing pre- and post-testing information, and to provide tools and educational resources to allow each woman to make better informed personal genetic testing decisions.\n\"The Perinatal Quality Foundation welcomes Sequenom's support of this important nationwide program,\" said Mary Norton, M.D., President of the Perinatal Quality Foundation and Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at University of California, San Francisco. \"This critical partnership will greatly assist us in achieving our vision of providing each pregnant woman in the U.S. with access to knowledgeable personnel and educational resources to enable her to choose the most appropriate prenatal testing decisions for management of her pregnancy.\"\nThe prenatal genetic testing industry has seen significant advancements, including the availability of cell free DNA (cfDNA) analysis for noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), expanded carrier screening and the introduction of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). The Genetic Education Module will seek to develop and disseminate information to advance the understanding and appropriate clinical use of these new technologies through the development of objective, evidence-based educational tools and resources that aim to help a woman make genetic testing decisions that are consistent with her own preferences and values.\n\"The PQF Genetic Education Module addresses a significant unmet need for unbiased and high-quality genetic education among health care providers and patients,\" said Mary D'Alton, M.D., Chair of The Pregnancy Foundation and Chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. \"We are delighted that Sequenom has joined us in support of this important project.\"\n\"This PQF program promises to bridge a major knowledge gap in the rapidly evolving prenatal testing field. Sequenom is proud to be a sponsor of this landmark educational initiative, which will support informed and responsible use of innovative pregnancy management approaches, such as NIPT,\" said Daniel Grosu, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Sequenom.\nPQF's far-reaching educational initiative will include complementary websites for patients and health care personnel. The websites and accompanying tools will be designed to provide adequate knowledge and understanding to providers by offering basic and accurate explanations of genetic tests to most patients, and identify patients who will benefit from a referral to a genetic counselor or geneticist. The Genetic Educational Module is expected to launch in early 2016.\nAbout Sequenom \nSequenom, Inc.
