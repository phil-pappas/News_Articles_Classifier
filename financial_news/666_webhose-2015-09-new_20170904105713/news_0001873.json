Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Fleur Anderson The unkind might suggest Joe Hockey with his days numbered as Treasurer is a dead man walking, a political wraith practising zombie economics until the final death blow.\nThe reality, on Day Two of the Age of Malcolm, is somehow the very opposite.\nWith a kind of gallows humour, Australia's treasurer of two years is not slinking away quietly before Turnbull's reshuffle next Monday.\nSure, Hockey'd had to postpone the government's long-awaited response to the Murray review into the financial system on Tuesday, given the chaos of the previous night's leadership change.\nBut by Wednesday he was back on track, fronting the cameras in Parliament's blue room to present with Tax Commission Chris Jordan the government's legislation on multinational profit shifting.\nThere were rumours Hockey was to be offered the Cabinet portfolio of communications, which include regulation of the media industry. Given there was that defamation action against Fairfax Media oh so recently, could this be the reason behind Hockey's return of bon homie?\nA psychologist might instead point to that lightness of being, that odd euphoria, that happens when the worst has happened (e.g. you are about to lose your job) and yet, here you are – still alive and breathing.\nThere were tough and even disrespectful questions thrown at him, yet Hockey did not lose his cool.\n \"Are you gutless for not resigning as Treasurer?\" one person asked.\nHockey would have been forgiven throwing a shoe at the ill-mannered question but instead turned his head and ignored it.\nWhat did he say to Turnbull, what did Turnbull say to him? Who's been leaking from Cabinet? The questions came thick and fast.\n\"No,\" he said, keeping schtum​.\nThere would be no truth bombs or bitter recriminations. Not now at least.\n\"I am an instinctively loyal person,\" Hockey said.\nDoes he still want the job, and finish what he started two years ago?\n\"What I laid down 20 years ago in my maiden speech, it hasn't changed. I want to do my very best for my country. Simple as that.\"\nBy question time, Hockey threw himself into the fray with joie de vivre. And he answered with barely concealed hilarity, an attempted attack by shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh whether Hockey asked rich man Turnbull for permission before launching a crackdown on some of the world's favourite tax havens, Bermuda, the Isle of Man and the Cayman Island.\n\"I love this guy,\" Hockey guffawed. Did he consult Turnbull? He consulted his whole party room that very Tuesday!\n\"Put up your hand if you support what we're doing on multinational tax,\" Hockey said to his colleagues.\nEven man and women from the government side, from frontbenchers to backbenchers raised their hands and cheered.\nDisunity? What disunity. JoHo's got his groove back.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@fleur_anderson"], "published": "2015-09-16T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T13:02:57.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
