If the Chinese market falls, investors would trade on Japanese shares to hedge against the fall in China, they added.\nChinese stocks surged in late Tuesday trade, sparking a rebound in global equities. Hopes for more stimulus measures from the Chinese government increased after its trade data on Tuesday showed that China's imports shrank far more than expected in August, falling for the 10th straight month.\nAlso improving sentiment was data showing that Germany's imports and exports hit record highs in value terms in July, which underpinned gains in European stocks.\n\"It looks like the global market is recovering from the China shock,\" said Hiroyuki Nakai, chief strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.\nBut he added that once investors bought back recently-battered shares, they will likely stay on the sidelines.\n\"Next week's FOMC (Fed meeting) is the main focus for now. Investors do not want to take positions aggressively until they confirm what the Fed will do with rates,\" Nakai said.\nA mixed report on the U.S. jobs market for August last Friday added to investor uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates at its Sept. 16-17 meeting.\nAll of the Topix's 33 subsectors were in positive territory.\nBrokerage stocks jumped, with Nomura Holdings up 5.9 percent and Daiwa Securities Group rising 5.0 percent.\nExporters also gained ground. Toyota Motor Corp jumped 3.9 percent and Honda Motor Co gained 3.4 percent.\nToshiba Corp, on the other hand, fell as much as 4.4 percent to 322.3 yen, the lowest since Dec. 2012 after CLSA cut its rating to 'sell' from 'buy' and reduced its earnings per share estimate and profit outlook. The broker cited challenges in its energy business and the PC and TV businesses.\nThe broader Topix gained 3.9 percent to 1,472.64 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 advanced 4.1 percent to 13,223.36.
