Bloomberg by Rachel Evans and Lananh Nguyen Traders are betting the euro's slide to a one-month low is just the beginning.\nOptions prices show investors are paying the most in two months to protect against further losses by the shared currency after European Central Bank Executive Board member Peter Praet said officials would \"certainly do what's necessary\" if its inflation targets were in jeopardy.\n\"The euro in particular we feel has a lot more room to fall,\" Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of macro research at Barclays, said in a media presentation at the bank's office in New York. \"We are expecting the ECB to extend quantitative easing by at least another six months, maybe another nine months.\"\nPraet's comments reignited speculation that the ECB will extend its stimulus package, just as four Federal Reserve policy makers signalled they're still looking at raising interest rates this year after standing pat on policy last week. The euro has already slipped about 5 percent from a seven-month high reached August 24 on the prospect of the two monetary policies becoming increasingly divergent.\nThe euro fell 0.6 per cent to $US1.1120 as of 5pm New York time, having touched $US1.1114, its weakest since August 19. It reached $US1.1714 on August 24, its strongest in seven months.\nEurope's single currency weakened 1 per cent to 133.60 yen, as a drop in shares and commodities buoyed the traditional haven.\nInvestors should sell the euro versus a basket of the dollar, sterling and Swedish krona because the ECB is unlikely to tolerate more strength and portfolio outflows indicate weakness, Deutsche Bank strategists including George Saravelos and Alan Ruskin wrote in a note.\nThe ECB's â‚¬1.1 trillion bond-buying program, which started in March, has had little success in boosting inflation. Gains in euro-zone consumer prices slowed to a near-standstill last month, against the central bank's goal of just below 2 per cent.\n Traders have responded by pushing up the cost of options that protect against euro weakness.\nThe premium they pay for three-month options to sell the euro against the dollar over contracts allowing for purchases widened to 1.2 percentage points, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That's up from a 2015 low of 0.6 on July 27.\nECB policy makers are \"willing to do more if they need to to fight deflation, and I think a weaker euro is definitely part of their quantitative-easing strategy,\" said Rebecca Patterson, chief investment officer at New York-based Bessemer Trust Co, which oversees more than $US105 billion. \"You want to sell into euro strength.\"\nThe ECB's tone contrasts with that of Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart, who said he remains confident the US will tighten policy this year, even as market volatility threatens the outlook for growth and inflation. Fed futures show 39 per cent odds of a Fed rate increase in December and a 48 per cent chance of a move in January.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T07:07:00.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
