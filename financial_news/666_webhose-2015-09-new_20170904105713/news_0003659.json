Citi rated Glencore shares as a \"buy\" and said Glencore could even consider going private, but other traders were wary of buying into commodity stocks.\n\"It is hard to make a case for buying commodity stocks in general with the current climate in China and emerging market volatility,\" said Thames Capital Markets' senior trader Gerren O'Neill.\nCURRENCY HITS\nShares in Asian commodity merchant Noble fell 10 percent, near to levels last seen at the height of the global financial crisis of 2008, giving it a market capitalization of just under S$3 billion ($2.10 billion).\nAustralian energy shares also tumbled, with Santos, Origin Energy and Karoon Gas all losing around a tenth of their stock market value.\n\"There is a crisis of confidence and people are continuing to de-leverage commodity stocks exposure,\" said Benjamin Chang, CEO of hedge fund LBN Advisers, which manages about $600 million in funds.\nBoth Glencore and Noble Group have also seen their Credit Default Swap (CDS) prices - the cost of insuring against the companies defaulting on their debt - soar this year.\nThe bankruptcy filing of Daiichi Chuo Kisen Kaisha hit the shares of rival maritime companies, which in turn affected Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock market.\nDaiichi Chuo, which has suffered four straight annual losses as Chinese demand for iron ore and coal has dropped, had liabilities of around 108 billion yen ($900 million) as of end-March. It has a market value of just $96 million.\nWeakening commodities markets also hit currencies from countries that rely heavily on energy or raw material exports.\nIn Malaysia, a large producer of oil and natural gas, the ringgit fell against the dollar on Tuesday to around its lowest level since the depths of the Asian financial crisis in 1998. In Indonesia, the world's biggest exporter of thermal coal, the rupiah is languishing near 17-year lows.\nAustralia's dollar, closely linked to its commodity exports such as iron ore, coal, oil and natural gas, has also taken a beating, losing more than a quarter of its value against the greenback since June 2014, when the current oil price rout began.
