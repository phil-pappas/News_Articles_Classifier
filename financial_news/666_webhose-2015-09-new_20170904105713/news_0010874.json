Alex Ellinghausen The exemption idea, first proposed by the Greens MP Adam Bandt, would not lose a lot of the forecast revenue while it was reasoned the big four would not pass it on to customers because it would put them at a disadvantage to their smaller competitors.\nHockey asked the Opposition if he could count on its support for the idea when it came to putting the legislation before Parliament. It was given on an in-principle basis.\nThat was just over three weeks ago. On Tuesday, Hockey, standing alongside Tony Abbott, was demanding Labor renounce its support for this \"tax on savings\" .\nWrong time for the tax \"It was a tax that was going to affect everyone with a bank account. Now is exactly the wrong time to apply such a tax to bank accounts, when people are receiving lower returns than they may have expected in the past,\" he thundered.\nSo what changed?\nFirst, there was lobby group pressure. Hockey, as he said on Tuesday, consulted the chief executive officers of the big four and, surprise, \"they put good arguments as to why it should not proceed\".\nIt was the second decision cabinet took on Tuesday that big business helped influence. The decision to strap Bruce Billson's proposed effects test to a rocket and fire it into space was in part driven by a threat from the Business Council of Australia to run a public campaign.\nBut back to the bank tax.\nThe backbench, while largely appeased by the exemption proposal, was still uneasy about applying the tax at all.\nThirdly, the policy did not fit the election theme, to be tested at the Canning byelection, of Labor being the high-tax party and the Coalition being the low-tax party.\nSources said Abbott effectively cut the idea off at the knees, just as he did to Hockey in April after Labor announced proposals to change superannuation taxes and the Treasurer had kept open the idea of doing something similar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:20:50.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
