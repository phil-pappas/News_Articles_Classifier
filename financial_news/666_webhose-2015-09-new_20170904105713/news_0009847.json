ADVERTISEMENT The poll stems from daily interviews with employed people in the United States who are asked whether their employers are expanding, maintaining or reducing the size of their workforces.\nIn August, 44 percent reported that their employers were hiring, 12 percent said their employers were laying workers off, 39 percent said their employers were maintaining the size of their workforces. \nGallup began tracking employeesâ€™ perceptions of job creation in 2008, just after the recession hit. The index hit a record low of minus 5 in early 2009 and then went up to a record high of 30 last September. \nThe index has remained at 32 since May. Gallup said the recent volatility in global stock markets has not had a noticeable effect on the U.S. job market. \nThe poll surveyed more than 17,500 full- and part-time workers between Aug. 1 to 31 with a 1-point margin of error.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T08:04:43.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
