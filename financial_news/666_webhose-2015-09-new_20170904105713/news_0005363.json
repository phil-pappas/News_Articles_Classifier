Glenn Hunt by Mark Ludlow Edmund Tadros The postcodes at the front-line of the solar revolution are not where you'd think.\nWhile roof-top solar systems are often associated with inner-city elites, new figures reveal that households in regional cities and outer-surburban battlers have embraced solar as a way to alleviate double-digit power bill increases over the past five years.\nAn analysis of data from the Clean Energy Regulator found Queensland had 225,268 of the 398,400 solar photovoltaic systems in the top 100 postcodes, as well as almost one-third (446,811) of the total 1.4 million rooftop solar systems up to the end of July.\nWith the Palaszczuk Labor government setting the ambitious target of 1 million roof-top solar systems by the end of the decade, there is expected to be even more pressure on the nation's electricity network given non-solar households subsidise those who use solar power.\nQld energy minister Mark Bailey with premier Anastasia Palaszczuk. Renee Melides The explosion of roof-top solar systems has been fuelled by generous solar feed-in tariffs from state governments, especially Queensland where about 200,000 households will pay next to nothing for their power until 2028.\nAlthough the generous tariffs have been shut down or restricted to new entrants, solar households continue to get a significant advantage over non-solar households. A study by AGL Energy late last year found subsidies to solar users topped $200 million a year .\nRegions the biggest solar users An analysis by The Australian Financial Review found seven out of the top 10 postcodes for solar installations had median weekly household incomes below the national average of $1234.\nRelated Of the top 100 postcodes, almost half had lower than the median weekly wage.\nThe Central Queensland city of Bundaberg (4670) - the home of the sugar industry and Bundaberg Rum - had the largest number of small unit installations in the country, with 9686 PV systems, even though it only has a population of 71,000 people.\nBundaberg's median weekly household income is only $854 - one of the lowest in the top 100 postcodes.\nThe West Australian coastal city of Mandurah (postcode 6210) came in second, with 8748 solar installations, followed by Hervey Bay (postcode 4655) with 8314 and Caloundra (postcode 4551) with 7824 units - both on Queensland's Sunshine Coast.\nThe inland city of Toowoomba (4350) rounded out the nation's top five postcodes with 7143 installations.\nIpswich (postcode 4305), Gold Coast hinterland (4211), Logan (4207), Mackay (4740) and Perth's northern suburbs (6065) were in the nation's top 10.\nIn fact, Queensland and WA - two sun-drenched states - dominated the postcodes with the highest number of solar installations, NSW didn't get a look in until Lismore (2480) and Dubbo (postcode 2830) who were 26 and 27 on the list respectively.\nSouth Australia - Surat (5162) and Aberfoyle (5159) just scrapped into the top 30, while Victoria - renowned for its inclement weather - didn't make the cut until 58th on the list.\nOf the 1.4 million household solar installations across the country, Queensland had 31 per cent, followed by NSW on 21 per cent or 309,396, Victoria on 18.3 per cent or 263,645, South Australia on 12.9 per cent or 186,974, then Western Australia on 12.9 per cent or 186,974.\nNot 'latte sippers and champagne drinkers' Queensland had a total output of 1385 megawatts of solar power each year - the most of all states - with 4366 megawatts produced nationally.\nClean Energy Council chief executive Kane Thornton said the resolution of the revised Renewable Energy Target earlier this year - which locked Australia into delivering 33,000 kilowatt hours from clean energy by 2020 - would ensure the solar roll-out would continue to ramp up.\n\"There is really a race on around the states to attract investment and jobs,\" Mr Thornton told the Financial Review .\n\"Each state has its nuances in terms of renewable opportunities, but Queensland has embraced solar. They are all trying to send signals to investors to say, \"pick me\" and they are actively looking at what they can do to back that up.\"\nQueensland Energy Minister Mark Bailey said the state was planning a dramatic shift away from coal towards renewable energy.\nHe ridiculed former Liberal National Party treasurer Tim Nicholls who said solar users were part of the \"latte sippers and champagne drinkers\", saying this was not the case.\nMr Bailey said the 1 million households target was achievable, with 28 per cent of the state's homes using solar PV systems.\n\"We have to be active in terms of our policy and making sure we are moving away from carbon-emitting industries into clean energy industries,\" he told a budget estimates hearing last month.\n\"We have to grow jobs in emerging industries in Queensland like the renewable energy sector. In Queensland, we've gone backwards in the last three years with the loss of 1300 jobs in renewables.\"\nNon-solar households subsidise the uptake of solar households because network electricity companies continue to charge for the use of the poles and wires. If a solar household becomes less reliant or goes \"off the grid\", non-solar households are slugged with more charges to cover the costs.\nThe Queensland government is holding a review into a \"fair price\" for solar to ensure non-solar households are not hit with higher network costs.\nThe impending arrival of battery storage technology - which will allow people to store electricity they generate and go \"off-grid\" - will also have implications on the issue of cross-subsidisation. It is not expected to reach a critical mass until 2025.\nUntil then, Federal Energy Minister Ian Macfarlane said network tariffs have to be reformed to be more cost reflective, which would be helped by the roll-out of smart meters which would allow consumers to change their electricity consumption.", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/09sep/solar_installs_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-09-08T09:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T07:33:48.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
