Tanya Lake by Sam Henderson \"A rising tide lifts all boats. Only when the tide goes out do we realise who was swimming naked.\" This is one of Warren Buffett's classic Quote: s. It's as true today as it was back in 1930 when the Oracle of Omaha was born.\nEach and every boom has been characterised by certain economic and commercial traits, from quantitative easing to the blooming of a flowering new economy such as those found in Asia or the industrial revolution back in the 1930s. And so, too, each and every bust has been blamed on the countercyclical dynamism of the same making. History does repeat itself, but it's as though humanity fails to learn from its mistakes. Managing an SMSF is fraught with all the same dangers.\nLet's go to 1637 during the Dutch golden age when tulips came on to the scene and bloomed in price to more than 10 times the average wage for a single bulb. Can you imagine paying $750,000 for a single tulip bulb! It was labelled tulip-mania.\nSo too Black Friday in 1869, Black Tuesday during the 1929 crash, the Tech Wreck, the Asian Crisis, the GFC, etc, as we silly humans continued our herd mentality towards financial butterflies and other miscellaneous distractions.\nHindsight truly makes some people think they are really very intelligent. They are usually the ones who never had any money to invest in the first place or a cynical academic pessimist like a teacher or engineer who was too scared to invest anywhere under any condition or circumstance. They're all going to be right one day!\nDiversified portfolio, weighted with cash Notwithstanding, for the rest of us a diversified portfolio of quality assets, weighted accordingly with cash and cash-like assets to take advantage of opportunities and to allow us to sleep at night and provide a reliable income will most likely suffice. If you're a chicken little, then perhaps turn the situation on its head and consider that companies with great management, good recurring and growing income in industries that are also growing and have high barriers to entry, pricing power and possess economic resilience and lowly indebted balance sheets, will always make good investments.\nNow back to my good mentor Mr Buffett. Remember, in the height of the GFC he forked out $5 billion to buy Goldman Sachs preferred stock and we all thought the old bloke had finally lost his marbles. Well, he made $2 billion on the deal. I don't expect you have a spare five bill lying around or have the insight of Warren Buffett, but if you stick to the basics, pin your ears and avoid the shiny stuff, you will out-ride this bump as you have other bumps in the past.\n So what does all this rhetoric mean for our market, and more important, your SMSF portfolios that have been hammered by a nearly 20 per cent fall in the Australian equities market from its high around Easter this year? And what of our property market as we watch Sydney clearance rates plummet from 89 per cent to 72 per cent in just a few months? Is there more to come? Probably. The night is always darkest before the dawn.\nRecent downgrades from brokers across the banking sector continued to spook investors this week and the threat of a slowing China remains a key theme to keep the blowtorch clearly on the heels of the Australian resources sector. Remember that during the GFC, when borrowing money was almost a crime, the only two banks to cut dividends were ANZ and NAB and they soon increased those dividends as economic conditions improved. Telstra also remains attractive at current prices and many of the healthcare stocks, while growing slower, remain in growth phase despite what happens in China or a potential rate rise in US interest rates.\nOur Australian market is trading below long-term market average price-earnings ratios and dividend yields once again look attractive across the various sectors. But is it that simple? Do we start buying now?\nNope. While US economic data such as jobs and GDP growth look attractive, corporate earnings growth in the US remains muted, so a rise in interest rates could quickly scare the US consumer and corporate America. Remember, we are buying companies, not governments, and the US has been fuelled by free money and needs to be reset. That being said, its unlikely China will slow down overnight nor is it likely that its sharemarket will be allowed to free-fall.\nSo I'm going to take a more moderate view. While I remain overweight in cash in my client portfolios I remain underweight bonds, which is handy because most of you SMSFs won't have bonds anyway and hopefully you haven't become too enamoured by hybrids, as they're out of favour right now and will be volatile, illiquid and unruly if markets are capricious.\nI also remain overweight international equities (underweight US) owing to the likelihood of our dollar falling further. Most of this is in exchange-traded funds for liquidity, ease of trading and speed to move quickly and cost-effectively if the climate changes and the tide subsides further.\nOpportunities will appear. It's important that you have a strategy, and I implore you to have a plan for each holding in your SMSF. If in doubt, get advice and channel some Warren Buffett wisdom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T21:06:52.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
