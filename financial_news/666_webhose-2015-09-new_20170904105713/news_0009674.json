Louise Kennerley Share on twitter by Ruth Liew Financials, healthcare and telecommunication stocks are the most in-demand sectors for bargain hunting investors who are gaining in confidence despite recent losses in equity markets, new data shows.\nResearch from Investment Trends at the end of August showed 29 per cent of investors intended to pump money into the equities market – a jump from 18 per cent in May – as an increasing number of investors view the dismal sharemarket performance as an opportunity to buy at a cheap price.\n\"Investors see recent falls in the share market as a great buying opportunity,\" Recep Peker, senior analyst at Investment Trends, said.\nThe survey, which is based on 7293 responses over the past 12 months, found financial stocks to be the top pick among investors looking to park their funds in equities in the coming year. This is followed by healthcare and telecommunication companies.\nIntentions to invest in Australian shares returned to October 2014 levels, after languishing in bear territory for nearly a whole year, he noted.\n\"While we saw a large increase in fear levels in the last week of August, many others saw this as the signal to buy in to the market, with the net intention to invest in Australian shares hitting 36 per cent – unseen since October 2013.\n\"Volatility and falling markets saw Australian active investors' concern levels in August jump to levels last seen in July 2013,\" Mr Peker added.\nChina woes The research comes after the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 lost 8 per cent in August alone, amid worsening fears about economic woes in China. Latest data from the Asian economic giant showed factory activity had contracted at its fastest pace in three years during August – fuelling further fears that the country's growth is continuing to slow.\nThe country's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 49.7 from 50 in July, with a figure below 50 signalling a contraction. This comes after fears of Greece's potential exit from the European Union earlier this year, which sent tremors throughout global sharemarkets.\nAccording to the Investment Trends data, a slowdown in China represented the biggest worry among Australian investors over the coming year.\nNearly seven out of 10 respondents point to China as the biggest roadblock to their confidence, followed by a sluggish Australian economy.\nAround 54 per cent fear another global financial crisis or market crash may be just around the corner, while 32 per cent are worried about global debt levels and sharemarket volatility.\n\"Only 30 per cent of investors agree Australia's economy will record healthy growth in the next 12 months,\" Mr Peker said.\nIt comes as no surprise that investors are eyeing opportunities to snap up financial stocks. Financial companies lost 10 per cent on average last month, underperforming the wider S&P/ASX200 Index.\nData from broker Morgan Stanley showed that health insurer Medibank Private was the best performing financial stock in August after gaining 12 per cent, although it had underperformed the ASX200 to date. Insurance Australia Group, which struck a deal with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway in June, was the worst performer after falling 14 per cent despite its capacity to hold underlying margins in tough markets.\n\"Consistent with our sector view, wealth or asset managers continue to outperform general insurers,\" diversified financials analyst Daniel Toohey said in a report to clients.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Ruth_LiewAFR"], "published": "2015-09-01T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:30:56.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
