Another member of that unit, former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Carl Force, has admitted to charges of extortion, money laundering and obstruction of justice.\nAn attorney for Ulbricht has said those charges “removes any question about the corruption that pervaded the investigation of Silk Road.”\nIn court on Monday, Bridges admitted his theft made Ulbricht believe that another individual was stealing from Silk Road and helped lead Ulbricht to try to hire someone to kill that person.\nSentencing for Bridges was scheduled for December.\n 01, 2015 4:08 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T23:14:39.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
