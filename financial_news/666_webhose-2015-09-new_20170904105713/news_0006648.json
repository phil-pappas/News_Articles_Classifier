The donation--$2,500 from Sam’s Club, matched by $2,500 from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation (USCCF)—opens doors for students across the country ages 11 to 18 to go through the process of starting and launching a real business or social movement over the course of an academic year. \nYEA! is an innovative after-school educational program that works to transform middle and high school students into confident entrepreneurs. By the end of the 30-week class, students own and operate fully-formed and functioning businesses, which may be carried on after their graduation from the program. \nSam’s Club, USCCF and YEA! joined forces earlier this year to fuel growth and support for youth entrepreneurship and the future of small business in more than 100 U.S. communities. As a result of the collaboration, 13 new YEA! chapters will launch this year with the support of local Chambers of Commerce and the business community. \nFunding provides the opportunity to launch an estimated 300 new student-run businesses and provide hands on, experiential learning for students in the YEA! program, spearheaded by the following funding recipients: \nAthens Chamber of Commerce, Athens, Texas Alexander City Chamber of Commerce, Alexander City, Alabama Central Palm Beach County Chamber of Commerce, Loxahachee, Florida Hannibal Chamber of Commerce, Hannibal, Missouri Lakeland Chamber of Commerce, Lakeland, Florida Montrose Chamber of Commerce, Montrose, Colorado National Association of Women Business Owners Detroit & Detroit Chamber of Commerce, Detroit, Michigan Paso Robles Chamber of Commerce, Paso Robles, California Richland Area Chamber of Commerce, Mansfield, Ohio Templeton Chamber of Commerce, Templeton, California Union County Economic Development Partnership, Marysville, Ohio Harford County Chamber of Commerce, Bel Air, Maryland Santa Rosa Chamber of Commerce, Santa Rosa, Florida “Sam’s Club has helped small businesses startup and succeed since we opened 32 years ago. We are thrilled to help the Young Entrepreneurs Academy deliver entrepreneurial education to young people in the communities we serve,” said Rosalind Brewer, CEO and President of Sam’s Club. \n“The U.S. Chamber Foundation is delighted to team up with YEA! and Sam’s Club, and we look forward to together inspiring young people through the spirit of the free enterprise system,” said Carolyn Cawley, managing director, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation. “By offering support for these educational programs, we hope to emphasize what a powerful tool entrepreneurship can be.” \nYEA! was developed in 2004 at the University of Rochester in Rochester, NY, with support from the Kauffman Foundation. YEA! now receives national support from the United States Chamber of Commerce Foundation and Sam’s Club, to help promote the spirit of enterprise and build the next generation of business leaders in communities all across the country. \n“YEA! will help Chambers of Commerce to fulfill their goals of supporting small business development in their communities by training their future leaders and helping them to establish strong, lasting relationships with their hometown business communities,” says Gayle Jagel, Founder & CEO, YEA!. “This program will enhance business education for students and provide a unique, challenging and fulfilling experience for all participants.” \nDuring the 30-week commitment, students will brainstorm and form their business ideas, make pitches to investors for startup funding, file their DBAs, and launch their own businesses or social movements. Mentors and local entrepreneurs across a variety of industries, such as graphic design, web development, law, accounting, retail, manufacturing, technology and more are invited to support the students throughout the hands-on curriculum as mentors, field trip hosts or guest lecturers. \nStudent applications are now being accepted.
